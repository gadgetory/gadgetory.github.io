right now we're taking a first look at
the new jaw bone era Bluetooth headset
this fresh model for 2014 officially
hits store shelves January 16th and
costs $99.99 by itself or one hundred
and twenty nine ninety nine bundled with
its handy charging case jawbone says it
has tweaked revamped and improved this
gadget to outperform its predecessor the
first era which made its debut back in
2011 the first thing you'll notice about
the new era is its very very small size
it's downright tiny in fact jawbone
claims this device is 42 percent smaller
than the one before it frankly it's the
most minut wireless headset I've ever
seen hey I've seen horse pills bigger
than this thing essentially a little
black bar also available in silver brown
and red the era consists of an earbud
and soft silicone ear gel cover and
power switch the headsets two
microphones work in conjunction with the
voice activity sensor the small nub next
to the power switch to knock out
background noise on calls the company
has dubbed the solution noise the sashen
4.0 paired with a new companion app you
can also use the phone to find the error
if you've misplaced it customize what
the main action button does or get tips
on how to use the product properly
another trick the app can do is to
configure the error to speak to you in a
wide range of custom voices for example
there are colorful characters to choose
from including mobster ace arcade and
bombshell just to name a few an agenda
keeps tab on all your upcoming meetings
what's really slick is that the air will
provide alerts for appointments that are
about to start
you can even automatically dial into
conference calls with the software smart
enough to punch in all those bridge
numbers and annoying strings of dialing
codes sounds great but I'd like to see
it's an action personally to charge the
era either use the micro USB port on
back or plug it into its optional
battery case so there you have it I'm
Brian Bennett for CNET and you've just
taken a first look at the new jawbone
era</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
