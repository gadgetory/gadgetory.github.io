Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update you may start to notice vanishing
posts on Facebook the social network
says it's testing out a new feature that
lets you schedule what time you want
your status update to delete in case you
only wanted something posted temporarily
now some users with this feature shared
screenshots showing options to select
different lengths of time to keep a post
alive ranging from one hour to one week
although i'm not sure why many people
would want to care that much about
having a post disappear perhaps it would
be helpful for drunk posts that you
won't have to regret in the morning
maybe Facebook should work on showing
more posts when they happen depending on
how your algorithm is calculated
sometimes you don't see things from your
friends until a day after it was
published the idea of sending a
disappearing photo became popular with
the messaging app snapchat Facebook
tried to copy snapchat with an app
called poke which was a failure and they
also launched slingshot which also has
not taken off there's been much talk
this week about the Apple watch but it
also looks like HTC is also jumping into
the crowded SmartWatch market sources
say HTC plans to release its own
SmartWatch in early 2015 and it'll try
to stand out with design HTC is also
having an event next month on october
eight to unveil a new product but our
sources say it won't be a SmartWatch
it'll likely have something to do with
photography because the theme of the
invite is double exposure and HTC is
asking those invited to send in their
selfies with their RSVP HTC has unique
camera technology in its smartphones the
HTC One m8 model has the second sensor
on the back to create photos with depth
of field to adjust the focus after a
photos taken moving on to Microsoft news
if your xbox one is making terrible
noises microsoft says it will replace
your model hundreds of xbox one owners
have been posting complaints about
buzzing and clicking noises on
Microsoft's forums one person said it
sounds like a no
printer now if you need a new machine
you should contact xbox support and
would you like a sneak peek of what the
next windows will look like two German
websites that posted about 20 photos of
what looks to be a leak of windows 9
these shots show off features that were
expecting in the new version such as a
mini start menu and the ability to run
those modern windows apps on the desktop
screen it's worth noting that this leak
isn't likely the final version of what
we'll see at the end of the month from
Microsoft that's your tech news update
