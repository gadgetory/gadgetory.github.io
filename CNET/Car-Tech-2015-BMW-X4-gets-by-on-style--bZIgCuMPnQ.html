New York Auto Show where BMW has just
launched the new x4 this is actually an
entirely new model in the BMW lineup and
it kind of follows the x6 in the whole X
lineup the x3 and x5 have very
traditional SUV like characteristics
whereas the x6 has that cool coupe like
design and the x4 has that as well but
it reads a lot differently where the x6
is kind of a bad-boy car and has bad-boy
swagger this one has a little more
utility feeling to it
when I look at the the high roof line in
over the driver's seat it looks kind of
comfortable
yeah it slants back towards the rear but
it feels more utility more something you
can strap your bicycles to the back on
and take out camping or something like
that then a canyon Carver race car we do
have a fairly high ride here this is
sort of a characteristically X cars
where there's a lot of space between the
defender and the wheel so that that hits
it some off-road capability and of
course this car will come standard with
all-wheel-drive there's also going to be
two engine options for the u.s. one is a
turbocharged four-cylinder engine the
other is a turbocharged 6-cylinder
engine 3 litre that six cylinder will
get you 300 horsepower the 4-cylinder
240 horsepower these are fairly standard
engines in BMWs lineup both of these
will be mated to an 8-speed automatic
transmission and we get a lot of the
same cabin tech that BMW uses in their
cars as well there's the new I drive
system the latest version of it which
has an embedded touchpad in the main
dial and we have maps on a hard drive
and plus a data connection they'll get
you Google search results for your
navigation there's also an app
integration with the BMW connected app
on your smartphone and there's a fairly
new feature I've seen it at another car
it's called the driving assistant and
the Select alerts you if there's really
curvy roads ahead or a sudden slow down
in the speed limit
BMW x4 will be available later this year
and will be built exclusively at the
South Carolina Spartanburg plant so this
will be an american-made car I'm Wayne
Cunningham here with the BMW explore at
the New York Auto Show</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
