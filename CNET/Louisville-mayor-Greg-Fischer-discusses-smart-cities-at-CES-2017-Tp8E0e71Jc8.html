smart home and appliances cnet bought a
house in Louisville Kentucky and turned
it into a living lab to test the latest
greatest smart home gadgets CNN also
Lisa's an apartment in downtown
Louisville one floor above a
city-sponsored hackerspace called Lewy
lab with me to talk more about
Louisville's effort and smart technology
is the mayor of Louisville mr. Greg
Fischer mayor Fischer thank you for
joining us here today it'll be way too
rich so I wonder if you can talk a
little bit about the evolution of city
of Louisville sort of interest in Smart
City which is really kind of what this
is right and and how the Louis lab came
to be you know a lot of buzz obviously
about smart cities and smart homes we're
interested in what's the intersection of
those so we can make our citizens life
easier so when people talk about smart
homes frequently they think about the
consumer aspect of that we don't really
look at our people as consumers we look
at them as citizens so how can we meld
that world of smart city which is open
data that's out there for everybody all
information from weather policing
traffic how do you integrate that into a
smart apartment or smart home to make
our citizens life easier and also we
have what we call citizen science how do
we involve our citizens so we can
crowdsource data from them to make a
smarter City as well so the city has
some ability has some some air quality
sensors for example to distribute it
around that we know pulling data and
we've had that in the apartment actually
tied into a light bulb there so if the
the air quality goes bad the color will
change light probably the light will
change color so that you kind of get an
indicator maybe you can do something
about it if you have an air quality
issue are there other other other other
other elements of Smart City and sort of
data gathering that you are particularly
interested in Louisville or just in
general well take it an example let's
say you're a commuter you want to know
how things are going to be on your drive
in to work and we have a partnership
with ways so we know what our traffic
data is like it all all times as well
obviously our weather conditions we know
what that as we have cities feed for
that so we've worked with Alexa and
others to create an agnostic app so that
you can say
what if this is going on and so let's
say I'm going to work and I'll say
traffic's fine weather is fine so we
want to make sure there's no weather
issues so it just helps me plan how I
can get to work easier mm-hmm so I
wonder if you can talk to some of the
challenges particular to Smart City data
gathering getting that information out
to residents how you work across social
net socio-economic lines well there's
there's been such an interest in smart
cities but you know in Louisville
especially open data so we've in it
we've done a lot of experience with what
we call against his sin scientist so the
air quality is an example that we're in
the Ohio River Valley air quality is not
so as good as in other areas so if you
have asthma too probably got a thousand
citizens that have volunteers where
their asthma inhalers have a GPS on it
so we know where episodes are taking
place so we can have identified the hot
spots in our city so we can mitigate
those hot spots with either changing
traffic patterns or vegetative medicine
and then we can do one-to-one health
interventions as well so the more
platforms we create like that where
people can get involved we find very
good not just for quality of life
enhancement but also then in building
trust between citizens and their
governments so the more we can do to
reach out to people to ask them to be
part of a smart city environment we find
people are very willing to participate
in that are our hacker community our
maker community love for us to throw
challenges to them as well and they've
really come through with a lot of
solutions so that that's that's
interesting that the only of crossing
over from government to Indian
independent Citizens may be private
businesses helping to see the Smart City
idea come to fruition have how has the
interaction bin would say the business
community and getting things off the
ground here well it's been great with
I'd call it the entrepreneurial
community so let me give you an example
of that we want to increase fire safety
like every city as well that does and
then we had a vacant abandoned property
situation those were two different silos
but when those groups got together and
looked at their data together they said
we've got an issue where if there's a
fire at a vacant property that can be a
danger obviously two adjoining
properties but it takes longer for a
higher alert to be called into the fire
department if the property is vacant our
maker community looked at that and said
well what if we had a low cost fire
alarm that could notify the fire
department and they said that can't be
done it cost a thousand dollars for the
fire detector you have to have power to
the house these homes are abandoned our
maker community said well what if we
make something that solar powered that
is actually listening to a
fifteen-dollar smoke detector device
build a modem into that and then off it
goes to the fire department and also
shoots a signal up to the web as well
for less so for less than fifty dollars
these makers entrepreneurs created a
company now it has a first of its kind
for a low dollar smoke detector for
vacant properties that makes our city
safer is there a political element or a
partisan ship element that has come to
play in any of the smart city in any and
any of this really I hadn't heard that
before but we are in unchartered
political waters so it's just a matter
of time I'm sure I would imagine so so I
wonder if you can speak to anything
specific to the Louis lab which is sort
of a brand new office right so what what
are your what are you hoping will come
out of that in particular well I think
what's interesting about that is when
you show the power of public-private
partnerships so we created a innovation
center with general electric appliances
University of Louisville called first
build in community so it's a co-located
innovation space microfactory when we
learned that you guys had a smart home
in Louisville and then we started
working together around that we said
well what about the folks that are
renting so we were developing something
called Lewy lab where we were
co-locating our performance improvement
and innovation professionals were known
in the country's the most innovative
cities it comes to civic innovation and
you guys said what about a smart
apartment why don't we collate co-locate
that so you're one story above our Louis
lab space that we work together in that
regard so that's where we really see the
partnership of an opportunity seen that
in this case GE appliances and the
others we're working with our healthcare
community
for different opportunities as well and
all the time we're trying to bring
citizens into this loop because if we
can enhance the quality of life of a
citizen what that does is grow the trust
between citizen and government that's
something these days is being sorely
tested are you looking into other cities
and what they are doing either a are
there any cities you feel are doing
smart city particularly well right now
well a lot of people are talking about
Smart City applications so you know it
could be policing it could be traffic it
could be a lot of stuff that we're
talking about our sweet spot is the city
is that we're big enough to be
internationally relevant but we're small
enough to get things done our metro area
is about 1.4 million people so what
we're interested in is enhancing that
citizen experience and bridging that
world between the home in the city and
have people look at really their home in
an expanded sense the city is your home
so how do you bring all this data
together and let it talk to you either
in the home in your car on your device
so that you're totally informed about
what your options are to enhance your
quality of life that could be
entertainment it could be safety it
could be traffic it could be a variety
of things all right mayor Fischer thank
you for being with us today</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
