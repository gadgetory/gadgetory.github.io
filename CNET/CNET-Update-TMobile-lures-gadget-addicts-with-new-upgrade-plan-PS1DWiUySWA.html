Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update if you're someone who can't wait
to buy that new phone t-mobile is hoping
to lure you in with a new upgrade
program called jump for ten dollars a
month customers can upgrade a phone
twice a year by paying the same amount
for a new phone that a new customer
would pay no need to wait for two years
to get that big discounted upgrade price
which is the case for other carriers the
program also acts as insurance to
protect against damage or theft a
federal judge has found Apple guilty of
conspiring with book publishers to raise
the retail prices of electronic books
the US Department of Justice accused
Apple of colluding with five publishers
to artificially raise the price of
e-books back when the iPad was about to
launch the case claimed that all
publishers were pricing their best
sellers in Apple's bookstore at 13 or 15
dollars but Amazon was selling ebooks
for ten dollars so publishers were
withholding their books from Amazon
until the prices were raised an apple
denies that it was colluding to fix the
prices and it will appeal the verdict
only Apple went to trial over this
because all the other publishers settled
out of court the next step is to have
another trial to determine the damages
that Apple will have to pay this ruling
could not only change the way books are
sold online but it also could change the
future deals that are made for other
digital media like music and television
programming Google just launched a new
Google Maps app for Android users if you
look up the location of a restaurant
you'll see reviews look up a store
you'll see coupons a new explore menu
lets you discover a new place to visit
based on different categories it's a
copy of what Foursquare does if there's
a traffic problem ahead you'll be
alerted to take a new route mid travel
but there are some features being
removed latitude and check-ins are going
away instead if you want to see your
friends and family pop up on a map
they'll have to use their Google+
accounts to share location to save a map
offline you'll have to now type in the
phrase ok maps into the search box and
if you want to create your own custom
map well sorry you'll have to wait for
that to be added in a future update all
these changes are also coming soon for
iOS X
Fox gamers could be paying more for
games when Microsoft decides to ditch
the point system for real world money in
Xbox Live some people in the UK are beta
testing the switchover and they are
noticing games are costume slightly more
for example games that were listed for
1200 points came out to cost about 10
pounds in the UK and now those games are
listed for 12 pounds it's just a beta
test so things can change but maybe
you'll want to spend up those points now
before everything is converted to get
the most bang for your buck that's your
tech news update you can find more
