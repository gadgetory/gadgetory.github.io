given half a chance they'll destroy
everything and everyone you hold dear so
what can we do to protect ourselves well
the answer is the only thing we know how
to do when we face a massive threat
shove it Marly out of the way I'm Claire
reilly welcome to watch this space from
the CNET studios in sydney this is your
guide to everything on earth you need to
know about space and tonight the
asteroids are coming and we only have
one defense NASA's double asteroid
redirection test mission set to launch
as early as 2020 the dart mission will
answer one big question if Earth was on
a collision course with an asteroid
could send up a spacecraft to nudge it
out of the way the mission is simple
NASA's high-tech dart spacecraft also
known as a kinetic impactor is designed
to intercept asteroids and knock them
off course before they can hit our
planet kind of like a game of pool the
dart will be blasted off into space and
using its autonomous navigation software
and onboard cameras the spacecraft will
target the asteroid 11 million
kilometres from Earth and deliberately
crash into it at a speed of 6 kilometers
per second it might sound simple but it
sure beats the other options we had all
right guys it's done the numbers on the
asteroid I think our best bet is
operation Armageddon so we're gonna get
a group of criminal miners and we're
gonna send them up to the asteroid
they're gonna bury a nuke inside I'm
gonna rework this I'll come back
I heard your feedback about the criminal
miners and I get it so we're going to do
Plan B which is operation deep impact
okay same idea we send the people up
they nuke it but it goes around earth
this time and we'll put everyone on to
escape rockets and Elijah Wood was gonna
be there but maybe he's gonna get
married over there I hear it I can hear
it now right let's just um
let's just do the diet plan the dot
isn't the only spacecraft that's
asteroid bound it's being launched
alongside the European Space Agency's
Hera spacecraft as part of the asteroid
impact and deflection assessment or Aida
mission Hera is designed to orbit the
asteroid and quietly gather data while
America's Dart spacecraft is gonna stick
a proverbial saucepan on its head and
crash into the rock yeah that checks out
but even though bashing into an asteroid
sounds like a simple concept the dot is
actually a very high-tech piece of
equipment the cube-shaped spacecraft
features onboard cameras and an
autonomous navigation system as well as
roll out solar arrays or Rosas
to juice up the batteries while it flies
through space best of all the dart is
packed with nasa's evolutionary xenon
thrust a commercial or next sea solar
electric propulsion system and i really
need to get a teleprompter for this doe
the next C ion thrusters will not only
allow the dart to maneuver its way
towards the asteroid in space but it
also means NASA doesn't have to have
such a tight launch window think of it
like a nerf blaster if you're trying to
shoot a moving target then you need to
shoot it at exactly the right angle and
at the right time to make sure you hit
it but imagine if your nerve dad had its
own tiny thrusters on it you'd be able
to shoot the dart switch on the
thrusters and it would still make its
way over to the asteroid to knock it off
course so where are we gonna shoot this
dad
well nASA has picked up the binary
near-earth asteroid 65 803 didymus for
its target not to be confused with sir
didymus from the 1980s David Bowie
classic labyrinth yes that's a niche
movie reference DDMS is about eight
hundred meters in width and currently
orbiting the Sun out past earth the last
time it came close to us it's skimmed by
about seven million kilometers away the
asteroid was discovered in 1990
six but in 2003 scientists realized it
had a small moon in tow nicknamed diddy
moon so I guess we all know what Sean
Combs is calling his next album the dart
will target the smaller 150 meter wide
Diddy moon which nASA says is more
typical of the size of asteroids that
could pose a hazard to earth that's
basically code for we don't want to bash
into the big Arnie twin so we're gonna
hit bond with Danny DeVito instead NASA
plans to launch the darts sometime
between December 2020 and May 2021 it
will use its thrusters to spiral out
past the orbit of the moon and shoot
towards didymus if all goes to plan nASA
says it will intercept the DD moon in
early October 2022 from there scientists
here on earth will be able to use
telescopes and planetary radar to
measure the DD moon's change in momentum
at that point we'll know just how well
NASA's shoving method really works and
if it doesn't well at least we'll have
plenty of time to set up the apocalypse'
lottery find Elijah Wood and strap him
to an escape rocket bound for
interstellar space alright that's it for
this week's episode of watch this space
we'll be back again in two weeks but if
you've enjoyed our broadcast remember to

to get more space news as it happens I'm
Claire Aelita CNET goodnight and
Godspeed a lot of people have asked me
to stop making so many references to
labyrinths on this show and quite
frankly I refuse that's right children
the asteroids are coming so it's time to
Duck and Cover and get to your asteroid
bunker to await the inevitable water
wars that come after the asteroid hits
too grim better cut that Ben so what was
with the hole Elijah Wood getting
married underage and having to take care
of the little baby these people in
Armageddon had like criminal record
Steve Buscemi why would you let him onto
his face Kraft I'm not talking about the
character he plays I'm talking about
Steve Buscemi the actor cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
