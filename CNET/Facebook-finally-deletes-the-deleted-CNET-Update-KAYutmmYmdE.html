show I'm Bridget Carey and this is your
cnet update thanks to smartphone cameras
we can live broadcast a video stream
online through services like you stream
but now you stream is about to offer a
way to broadcast video right to your
Facebook page so friends can see it live
from their newsfeed it'll be a separate
ustream app called BFF broadcast for
friends and it will be available in the
coming days on Android and Apple devices
so you remember that embarrassing photo
you deleted on facebook from years ago
well you know it's been around all this
time right oh you might not see it on
your profile but if someone had the
original URL link yeah it was still
there but Facebook has finally gotten
around to updating its system so that
when you delete a photo it's gone from
the archives within a month how nice of
them to take time out of their busy
schedule to finally address the problem
that the blog ARS technica discovered
three years ago tired of app updates
taking up hours of time eating away at
your data plan and sucking the life of
your battery it's enough to make you
want to cry but now android has solved
all your problems and improved your life
with delta updates it means you only
have to download the features that
changed instead of redownloading the
entire app Google mentioned this feature
was coming but it seems the folks at the
android police blog founded already
working on their phones magic can no
longer find a gathering on ebay the
online seller has banned spells and
potions from being sold ebay won't let
you sell hexes curses psychic readings
blessings are any magic service but you
can get your magic fix now the rule
takes effect in September so this is
your last chance to spend 131 dollars on
a genie manifestation potion for it
being Merlin's own recipe it's a steal
at that price the streaming video
network crackle owned by sony has added
its mobile app to windows phones and
nook tablets soon it will also be on
amazon's kindle fire you can watch many
films TV and original web series
including jerry seinfeld's new show
comedians in cars getting coffee there's
an update to the photo sharing network
in
to Graham the app now will display
photos by location with a new mapping
feature but if you don't want your
photos on a map you can avoid it from
the start once the app is updated you go
through the photos you already took that
had geolocation tags select the ones you
want to allow to be mapped and as always
you got to be mindful of photos you pin
to location because if you take photos
in your home you're not going to want to
publicly tag them with the location of
where you live and be respectful of
other people and where you're tagging
them that's your tech news update for
more details about today's stories just

update from our studios in New York I'm
