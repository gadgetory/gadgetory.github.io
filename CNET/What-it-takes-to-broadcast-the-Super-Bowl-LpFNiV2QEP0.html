gonna see the game here at Levi's
Stadium but over 115 million people will
see it here on television you see this
isn't just the broadcast of the Super
Bowl this is the Super Bowl broadcast so
11 tractor trailers full of broadcast
tech made their way from the Rockies to
Silicon Valley
immediately after the AFC Championship
game to set up this the CBS Super Bowl
50 broadcast compound an amazing array
of broadcast tech tied together with 32
miles of cable so complicated I've been
lost at least once they've got a map
that shows avenues this way and streets
this way 10 a guard is CBS executive VP
of engineering his team built all this
and runs it you would like to be sitting
in my chair when everything's working
when it's not working it's not
necessarily so much fun but the truth of
the matter is the person sitting at home
they have the best seat
football's a game of inches but
broadcasting it's a game of shots there
are 70 camera angles here for Super Bowl
50 a hundred camera angles total
available in and around the game to a
crew working in a place like this Super
Bowl tech 101 pylon cam that's right you
see a camera lens there there's another
one over here two HD cameras in each of
eight pylons these sit at goal lines and
sidelines and yep they got microphones
too because what's a hit if you can't
hear it I love seeing a guy go into the
pylon because I know we're gonna have
that shot you know I know that we're
gonna have that moment it's actually
even better if the guy goes right up to
it and doesn't knock it over because
then it even continues it's definitely
gonna get mowed down and we've got our
technicians ready to pounce when the
pylons get knocked over that they've got
to quickly reset the pylon and the
camera inside so we're ready for the
next play now a lot of the big cameras
we have around the field are actually 5k
resolution even beyond that amazing 4k
TV you may have just gotten during the
holidays these high res cameras let us
get more out of close-ups and slo-moes
that's also helped by high frame rate
cameras like this that are dead
- just doing high frame rate and replay
in the most smooth action and we have
technology in the booth to stitch a
bunch of these cameras together to give
you this fly around angle like something
out of the matrix and this year the CBS
Super Bowl coverage is going to lean
hard until the NFL's next-gen stats
technology this kind of turns every
player on the field into a live data
node throwing off data about the speed
of a run the duration their dynamics on
the field and then putting that into the
broadcast in almost real-time things
that human statisticians just can't do
you now have sensors and all the players
shoulder pads so we know where everybody
is
so now it's a matter of taking all that
data and trying to be able to make sense
of it and because of that you know
there's stats that come out every week
that we hadn't even thought it so we're
trying to document the story we've got
some great technology that I vision 360
cameras that are around the light grid
the pylon cameras I think that's the
little the cherry on top that makes it
interesting eye candy for the viewers
