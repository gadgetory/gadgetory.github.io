of box I'm Bridget Carey this is your C
net update having a separate smartphone
app for every task is so yesterday the
next time you need to book a trip or
order a pizza you could just ask Cortana
inside of Skype Microsoft is working on
a future where we can have a
conversation with the Windows 10
assistant Cortana to take care of
complex tasks and make suggestions and
the artificial intelligence would be
smart enough to understand our context
clues but for this to work
Microsoft needs companies to start
building BOTS so Cortana can be the
middleman or is that middle woman to
handle the requests Microsoft showed off
some of the possibilities at its annual
build Developers Conference
Cortana could talk to a bot for a hotel
chain to book a hotel after seeing that
a trip is on your calendar and a
Domino's bot can be used to order a
pizza but when I say but I don't mean
one of these a bot is a program that can
converse with us like a chat bot and a
few are available to try now on skype
Microsoft has been working on artificial
intelligence with the chat BOTS a-and
well tell you still work in progress as
you may already know Microsoft took Kay
offline temporarily and you could say
she's still in sensitivity training from
repeating the terrible things people
were teaching her to say on Twitter but
BOTS can do more than just tweet or
order pizza BOTS can also interpret
images we saw an example of how a blind
person could be told what's happening in
front of him by wearing glasses that
took photos and played audio
descriptions of what's happening or of
people's facial expressions the same
tech can be used by a smartphone camera
so it could read off a restaurant menu
but there's more new stuff from
Microsoft to talk about besides BOTS
instead of coming out with a Windows 11
or a 10-point something Microsoft is
pushing out new features to the
operating system called anniversary
updates and the next one is coming as a
free download this summer among the new
features will be new ways to use
biometrics like your face or your
fingerprint as
a password you could log into a website
with biometrics through the edge browser
drawing on the touchscreen with the
stylus is also improved with new tools
like a digital ruler and if you draw on
a big map it knows it is a 3d image and
it'll stick to the curves of the
landscape the Xbox is also getting some
love with Windows 10 Cortana it's coming
to Xbox one to become a personal gaming
assistant offering tips and tricks and
there wasn't much new to say about the
hololens but the first units are now
being shipped to developers to create
experiences with the mixed reality
headset those are the big takeaways from
Microsoft's event but if you want more
details on BOTS and everything new in
Windows 10 Heide cnet.com from our
studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
