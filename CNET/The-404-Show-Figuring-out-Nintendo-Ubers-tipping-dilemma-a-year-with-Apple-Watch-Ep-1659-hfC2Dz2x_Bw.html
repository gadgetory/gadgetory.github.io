tuning into the show this is the 404
show it's a podcast is its podcast much
ado about nothing joining us today on
the program mr. Scott sty I like being
existential Scott Stein you have been on
uh the show in a while I now told me you
candidly that you despise us and native
Russ should Russ is like you can't get
him busy so ugly why'd you say that I've
wanted to for years I've dreamed of
being on the show again how screwed up
is that I've wanted to do this I've said
I've said just a few just a tenth of a
mile down the hallway yeah well unit one
look you having some excited to be a Fed
Parenthood uh home stuff like VR he's
real and virtual reality we're on the
show I feel like it was three months ago
no am I making that up I think you're
making that up I don't think it was I
think a long time yeah it's been a while
I'm is faster for me now anyhow I'd yeah
three months would actually be two years
I read something oh by the way Scott
signs here I read something that um I
know you're about to dislike mean I know
I wasn't allowed because usually we
introduce the show or like with the date
but whatever we just went as on a smirk
just went to start to roll here um no I
read something that said like 'hey-- as
you age you start to perceive time as
way faster yes that mad I've been
obsessed with this so what's going on
you sound like you're going through some
sort of like existential crisis it's
like the end of interstellar arsenal of
interest lost on me and see how the part
ways like catching up and he realizes
the like his kids have all grown up and
he's like on this metal ship crying oh
that's funny I a moto metal ships wait
were you tip your not the crying guy
yeah I look at that and inside me is ok
later so so well though it's a strange
metem so what happened what like you're
not an old guy what happened so why you
haven't been over time over over time I
feel like it happens more and more I've
been obsessed with that I think that I I
just notice that all of a sudden I will
talk to friends and say you
yeah we just saw each other and they
like it was six months ago Wow no no a
bit I think that's also that when you
there are books written about this
actually a book about time and memory
that I want to read up to pulp the name
of it but um I believe that your brain
locks in all of its neural patterns and
when you start locking in everything in
your brains kind of all folded and you
do that same trip back and forth and
back and forth yeah your brain kind of
goes in autopilot it just goes nothing
news being written yes correct if that's
a truth a scientific truth like you
that's and that's been written metal so
that's part of the that's part of the
aging process as part of the idea of
like learning versus wisdom and so when
you start writing those neural channels
over and over again you lose track of
time is writing written in the same ways
you're just not making many new
signature your brain goes asleep and
says if I'm not interested in this well
but don't you think a lot of that has to
do with the fact that like a kid's
schedule is like a very or kids
schedules in general are very like set
and so you if you're taking care of kids
you're basically following a very set
pattern you know with the school year
and the summer and cetera et cetera
where there's not a lot of variance to
it so it is in the same way that like
when I if I woke up and like had to
drive to work more like coming in on the
subway this morning I don't really
remember anything that happened on the
subway cuz nothing notable happen on the
subway you just enter these like phases
of autopilot yeah where your breath like
it happens sometimes i'm driving like
i'm driving like 150 miles sometimes
like 70 of those miles with ya like hey
Laurent enough Oh easily so and it used
to be so hard as a kid yeah to spend I
look at my kids in the backseat where
they're you know ten minutes drives them
crazy yeah well cuz like they need
constant stimuli yeah and it's so much
more of their of their life as you know
um percentage wise for sure as we need
it so so what like weirdly can slow time
down though well okay no it's not like
I've lost my mind what do you mean mr.
Hawkin I noticed that some people have
theories that the more things you do in
a day the way to break things up you can
slow down your perception slow and the
perception sure of course you can but
requires I've if you stare clock all day
it'll feel like it's taking
forever that's why people travel trap
traveling and tourism is about slowing
down time and having new nodes I mean
it's about have any like of things a
vastly different experience from your
day to day life so I can sympathize a
little bit with that where it's like oh
my god I can't believe a year went by my
kids want already that totally yeah
after me for seven bright definitely I
mean I'm sure that just compounds in and
gets crazier and crazier as the years go
on like I now we'll think of things were
like do I want to go do that today
because if I go do that the day will go
by so quick like it'll be slower if I
just stay home and do nothing then go to
that party where seven hours will fly by
yeah she's used to slow down time and
make life boring isn't it but that's
also funny cuz like I think if you went
to that party the day would feel longer
because you're doing something different
yeah I think that's why gravy i think
it's just like a different way to think
about it I don't know I don't know
technically staying at home not
technically just according to one theory
a technically seconds go sexually yeah
uh yeah and if you yes thank you stay at
home time would go by quicker yeah it's
really remember it as time going by
quick yes exactly yeah it's it's so true
about the driving thing I'll just be
like oh my god wait have I been going
through every red light right no idea
what if I would no clue yeah I was
driving home at night with the kids and
I just go I hope everything was safe yes
three hours just went by and I don't
know where I was you like pull park the
car and you like get out and like in bed
yes I remember is being bed as weird as
like a hand hanging off your car yeah I
was a bunch of like deer fur know Shivan
did that happen alright we're not gonna
stay in that realm is anything that you
want to cover in that could I tell you
my the weird Warren Ellis tweet that I
saw this morning so 20 warnell gems an
author yeah he's an author fantastic
author graphic novels and novels and uh
he tweeted this article on Ribbon Farm I
don't want to lose the spot of mine so I
well I'll pull up the Apple up the name
of it immortality begins at forty mm-hmm
ok.thank at a shroud so how do you
interpret that because it's a very
literal statement but it is full of
equations and strange poetry
and it's also so depressing a wonderful
I just like this sentence or this
paragraph 40 is also the age at which
point it stops being worth anyones while
to manufacture an investment in you
right because it is this drying up of
supply well you're supposed to you're
supposed to invest meeting in yourself
and like your whatever kids or something
like that and they've got the same
problems like that's what is it saying
that at that point you're supposed to
move into different roles right give a
man a fish and he'll eat for a day stock
a lake with fish and he'll fish till
he's 40 at which point it's generally
not critical to anyone else that he
continued to eat right cuz I mean it's a
tragic and it's a tragic sentence yeah
but but that's under up to you after I
understand where where that's coming
from and I hate to put this like number
on on you know a yearly number yeah that
you should sort of like say to yourself
well I'm definitely over the over the
apex right yeah it's a terrible thing
well it just becomes I mean at that
point it just becomes like again you're
taking care kids fine or your actions
are generally done to benefit yourself
in the sense of like I want to do this
creatively because it'll make me feel
more into what I'm doing it's it's not
yeah it feels like more like the
decisions you're making are strictly for
your own personal or your family's own
personal benefit and I also interpret
that to mean like you have nothing cool
left to give society likey that's what
that's me saying yeah I don't
necessarily believe it but I think it's
also it's also discussing its net to be
a positive pieces by saying depressing
because it's the same it it's up its up
to you because that's the immortality
part that it's up to you to turn into a
different role to give back to be a
leader to do that because you know what
the game and the fun stuff that society
was making for you yes not for you right
it's not good for offer over for yes
it's like leave the theme park now you
gotta build the theme bar right or
something fun yeah you gotta carve out
your own sort of slot there I think so
yeah which is why me being sad at a
theme park makes sense because I should
you know I gotta start making what you
just got back from a theme park
of so you're you're someone who's over
40 and you just got back from a theme
park so how do you interpret that thing
well I spend most time taking my kids
around a thing so I learned to give up
all the rides I wanted to go on didn't
go on hyper space mountain at Disney oh
cool they're calling Space Mountain
Hyper's and a new riotous yet wait
redesign what when the fall what well
it's part of their hold the fort till
that 14 acres yeah star wars are words
they have this I didn't realize how much
they changed it but apparently now
they're slow Star Wars music their ships
little battles and is there like Marvel
 there too there is a like meet the
Marvel characters zone that's sort of
far off in Tomorrowland like it's like
in the corner yeah okay but the rest of
it is all star wars and you jump to
Lightspeed with the Star Wars music
somebody had shot at a GoPro video with
them in it going through the ride is
pretty cool that is cool i wish i had
done it but all most of the time was
going through waiting on lines of
Fantasyland storybook canal right after
I star tours if you don't you don't want
to do that taught a lot of zombies like
I was taken on a lot of rides that were
inappropriate for my age and I just sort
of made the best of it all I know is you
just went yeah I mean I cried my eyes
out but I went I remember going when I
was three and my parents took me on
Space Mountain yeah and I cried yeah
because it was like staring all four or
five airplane crash simulator to me and
I'm just like I couldn't even see
anything that was going on it was just
dark and I was like being shaken yeah
but then when I went back when I was
eight apparently i love the damn thing
yeah yeah my son Alex went on roller
coaster for the first time he thought it
was scary yeah and at the end he said it
was great so I saw the whole process in
his head yeah the other one that
happened all at once and yeah thank God
went yeah and the other one on a finding
nemo submarine ride and was bawling it's
me I yeah yeah and did not find joy it's
a women maybe you will it takes a
certain age for you to just realize like
this isn't torture this is fun yeah you
know and I feel like a take everyone has
their moment right on the borderline ya
mean both um alright well look I I
respect the fact that you're going
through it's not a crisis is not
anything like that you're just the
episode where Scott it was that goes to
the mid life grand no not at all i think
this is just a healthy audit yes yeah
I got the whole time while bring a lot
of a deeper Philip flops yeah our
philosophy books lately they're make you
pee get all yeah tongue-tied yes making
you like do drugs and whatnot right it's
good i dream i was reading too much
dystopian sci-fi so now i'm switching it
up and reading well speaking of
dystopian sci-fi we had a pretty long
conversation about VR last week with
Justin you Justin you only sees the
darkest corners of VR yeah right he only
sees like no this is that we're going to
torture people in the future oh yeah I'm
just like so okay that's one way to
think about it uh and fulfill like all
these deviant acts that you could never
do and it's fine sure uh my question to
you Scott as the person who has been uh
reviewing all this stuff for cnet.com I
need you to tell me like is we're in a
weird spot right now because the the
honeymoon is kind of over yeah there
seems to be a general lack of interest
on the internet about VR mm-hmm where do
you see this like how do you feel about
virtual reality on April 29th 2016 I
think some of the bloom of the oh wow
this is what VR is hmm is fading so I
get after so many times using in so many
different ways there was a time where
just realizing that VR does what it does
was cool yeah now I'm pretty used to
that and then it's gotta be a well what
else are you doing with it right and
that's going to be a hard transition I
think because a lot of the apps and
movies and games really ride right now
on the on the can you believe yeah that
this is all around you right now and
video is inevitably like I'm just more
more aware that a lot of 360 videos
really grainy compared to the video
watch on TV doesn't always look right
right all right my iPad even so um I'm
really excited about new ideas I think
they're coming all over the place as a
ton of stuff but also you just it just
becomes more painfully where how few
people have tried this we're aware of an
escape and now its sales what people
can't buy them they can't buy them
literally and or in other people are
just not adopting that much and your
times
res Betham reissuing cardboard i think
is another initiative but also i
remember my mom had it sitting on her
counter yeah for months and didn't even
know what it was is it do you know Gino
after showing her VR you have this right
here and she's like oh I just thought
that was like it I think she thought it
was just some sort of a business I don't
know what you business card holder what
did you think yeah is a fancy bike
helmets a coaster set it's a rectangular
coaster set so that's a memento tell me
about the first time your mother
experienced VR that I think way she
experienced which which which we are I
don't humor me old samsung gear vr ok
she haven't hooked her into VOSH odor
cirque de soleil no I didn't I didn't I
knew I don't want her to lose the
problem is inept ever come over the
house and upstairs to the to the ER
we've yeah so it was it was I was
burping just then that's okay unless
you're a little burp on there you're
human the you I think I think I tended
to show people the virtual cinema yeah
is that the mo you're looking at movie
on a screen showed some of the political
films like the bill clinton documentary
2 and she looked around and said oh
there are a lot of nice things in his
office oh look at that what is that look
at that stuff on his shelf it's
interesting is that what type of antique
is that you know oh he looks very thin
now he looks very old so you get and
that's i find that too watching like
boxing or the debates you start getting
interesting like who's that guy running
across this yeah what's that it's like
you're hyper tended to small details and
you not paying attention but um she
thought it was really amazing my my mutt
my brother-in-law's mother whatever that
is to me about that my brother
mother-in-law I don't think it's
anything it's not it's just that woman
said the Roman over there she I thought
she was never into tech I showed her on
netflix and she was watching something
goes interesting i said now look her and
then she finally realized you look
around yeah oh oh ma she could giggle
flora and saw the remote on the sofa
yeah and in Cirque de Soleil show that
was amazing my my actual mother-in-law
and father-in-law and I'm folding it
focusing on older because i feel like it
not to be stereotypical those might be
people you'd say oh they are gonna care
about this yet but i think i raised but
the reaction rate i want to get wine and
their reactions
or entertaining and yet you can't bail
that's without a fantastic that totally
unaware and little kids to yeah I trying
on my son we thought it was like some
sort of amazing magic goggle uh trip
which it is um my wife still doesn't
want to use it she hasn't tried it on
now Wow scared she she's really not into
the stepatech she tried a little bit
centimeter dizzy I think she's hyper
aware of the prosthetics of technology
so she just finds its not comfortable
that forget it um but friends who try it
every time I think I downplay it
actually and then they try a vibe for
other things and every single person
just says like that was amazing yeah how
incredible 1 like 1 curmudgeon in 100
huh so that's that's still amazing to me
but then again it's gonna burn through
that and yeah there's a so what it is it
just a theme park rider right and you
and I think that works I mean it's great
for parties and inviting people over and
stuff like that but like I haven't
bought one for my house and I don't
necessarily know that I want to because
it's like I don't necessarily want to
play these games for hours and hours and
hours I on I mean it's never F and cool
and I think there's going to be some
amazing experiences but it's just not
necessarily the most relaxing thing I
mean we talked about this last week but
it's just not super relaxing to me and
I'd rather just do it occasionally and
have an amazing time then like just have
it become a mundane thing all right
let's do this three years it's April 29
2019 okay where we at vr well Trump is
president ah hopefully uh where we threw
out of much smaller we're all living
over the ocean yeah I was gonna say it's
rapture up in here what what do you so
do you think it's small already know i
think it's yes in rehab earlier prayers
a long time but you think they're gonna
you think there's gonna be a vibe to
that's oh yes in three years yeah that's
quick okay at least and actually that's
just the beginning I'd be pissed what's
what I think it's going to happen in
three years is you're going to be in in
the entry level area of like consumer
mixed reality that stuff like hololens
things that are going to be blending
virtual reality and real where you're
going to be able to turn the shutter and
go into VR open it up and now it's not
lending into your world all right but I
think it's going to be prototype be sort
of like
the gear VR when it first came out a
year which is now uh what a year and a
half ago or a year over a year ago yeah
give you our first came out boom that I
think we're mean there was the rest of
it will be very very streamlined and
lower priced my question is though has
it has it caught on I guess is what I
also want to address like it's three
years from now now has a good give a
 is it still here I registered over
here yeah for certain percentage I don't
think it's a broad success yeah um I
think it's still here and I don't I
think the PlayStation was gonna do all
right though yeah I don't think it'll
like destroy but I think it'll be okay I
think you're gonna get I think you did
enough having a much more common
platform stuff right more lightweight
and will be priced like a hundred fifty
dollars yeah and then you're gonna be
able to sort of almost mix-and-match and
by ones in and plug them into wherever
you need hopefully yeah and then it'll
be just something you use or you don't
use it's like did you want it and the
more games will start Foley to get like
you know adding a VR motor not if your
mood I think it'll maybe not be so
isolated and it's sure like platform
gotcha all right I don't spend too much
time on VR because it sounds kind of
boring but I mean that's like almost
where it needs to be yeah um to get
people to use it let's talk about some
stuff that happened this week with
Nintendo yeah the company that for
whatever reason people continually try
and understand and I have been flying
this flag for many many years sharing
they are in the business of not give
enough you know wow that's not it no
that's not no listen I'm not done okay
sorry not caring what we think like in
the sense it like they've kind of been
marching to the beat of their own drum
for a very long time that's true and
like they should like Oh a they'd 0 then
want nothing to do with e3 they don't
want to be at e3 they just don't I mean
they want to be there more than a
Activision does okay so it's a matter of
degrees like a bunch of companies
dropped out Nintendo Co dropped out if
they wanted to they could have like I
feel like they continually tell the
world like trying to get out
this but you just won't let us leave
they drop their press conference many
years ago yes that's a huge deal their
booth presence has kind of stayed the
same for I mean what are we talking
about III are you talking about
Nintendo's a company because III is a
very different beast and I don't think
it's exclusive exclusive to Nintendo
that Nintendo wants to pull out like you
have a lot of Commerce ease and it's
just the nature of III as a show so
right i but i think it's a it's a huge
it's a combination of a lot of things
with them and we're talking and the
reason we're getting it is because we're
talking about the fact that they came
out preemptively ahead of e3 which is
now what not even two months away yeah
and they basically said a that new
console we have we're not even gonna
talk about it show it do anything with
it at e3 right that's coming out march
of 2017 yeah remember zelda thinking we
promise you for 2016 9 s not happening
either that's coming out next year as
well on this NX system and wii u right
and little cherry on the top of the
sunday there's only one thing we're
doing at e3 and we're just going to show
you sell that we you brats it so pack
light I mean it made perfect sense to me
know that surprised me not at all
anomalies heart was a bit disappointing
well was it they really games if that's
a crazy if you're not showing the NX um
all I mean look at last year from
Nintendo last year during e3 had like a
handful of games yeah but it was such a
it was like blown and it was low really
paltry and and because they had moved
all their developers over to this new
console already so they have no Tibet
dev support sure and and this year is
even more so so like if you're not
showing the NX there might have been a
time when they planned on showing it but
if you're not showing it you have no
options you can't show anything so so
and i also think like this is kind of
become a party that they're not
necessarily wanting to be a part of
right uh III yeah um I mean it's hard to
say I think I would be surprised if next
year they came back hard in a big way I
think they like having the gamers who
like Nintendo a loyal wander and or
people who are covering Nintendo I think
with increasingly don't care about is us
well that's yeah
well I mean particularly like I think
that they spawn tween the director
exactly that's what is I think it's
about the direct channels i think the
reaching other stuff i think they're
taking this end around and they're more
about the competitions and the people
who like nintendo culture and I just
feel like it's it's more disconnected
from you know they're just gonna do when
they do it right of course and again
like all this information out during an
investor meeting this is not like a
consumer-focused thing right this is an
investor meeting which they like for
whatever reason can't wrap their heads
around the fact that like you know you
have one of these things and the presses
are going to pick it up yeah and they're
going to cover this and I feel like you
know you talked about maybe sending
mixed messages and why not no these are
the messages that everyone extrapolates
from what you tell people who are
invested financially in the company and
they draw these conclusions yeah and
they're most there no one's like making
these crazy accusations I mean this is
these are facts you guys got nothing for
the rest of the year yeah that's I just
will say that's and then whether a
developer's tied him the NX or whatever
that that is the biggest problem to me
because I feel like you know from from
the perspective people using this like
at home my kid loves the we you know
simply says he likes to play games on
the wii u it's it's a system that's out
there may not be as popular definitely
is not as popular but you got to do
stuff with that you got to have new
games or have some team doing small
little fun games i feel like it all kind
of went to sleep where the games lately
have no they for a while they were
writing a couple years worth like again
we're all surprises knowing that no
they've been getting weaker well I guess
the sales weren't there so they couldn't
invest in this console that never soul
right it makes sense what about smaller
scale games what about these like you
know kind of more retro indie if they're
not really guilt Nintendo's a company is
not really built for that sort of game
and and where they are they're moving
over to mobile so much I had been into
for a while but not if it's stuff like
me tell me toma was yeah really I'm
really concerned bad it's bad terrible i
played it for 10 minutes and then or I
just couldn't even continue it was is it
is it like a smash hit in japan i don't
actually don't know it's not even like a
game of weird except but it's not as
good as other apps that are social or
the people who seem into it
seem to have invested a tremendous
amount of time to get a little bit out
of it I don't know yeah I don't know
what the I mean I'm not saying I need to
win the game but I need to have a point
like Animal Crossing is a point right
and this is just like I get to learn
more about my friends in a bi hat
occasionally like I makes me very
worried about animal crossing mobile no
yeah don't be worried it's just gonna
it's gonna be no worry no it's I just
gonna be a different version it's it's
not gonna be new it's just well but
there's a dump concern I'm concerned
about two pokémon as well I I there's a
dumbed down version my fear is that
they're gonna make instead of making
like the games that they've been making
more mobile they're gonna make what they
think are mobile games which is like
right a lot of free to play like very
abusive for you to play stuff and and
they haven't shown that they can
prioritize like a gameplay which is what
they're known for exact over the
money-making endeavors of like mobile
yeah yeah it's a prioritization that
makes that makes me I guess concerns not
worry bits concerned it's it's it's the
idea that it's balanced with this
company it's it's the idea of you should
be able to do both but but clearly uh
you know now you have like they
announced two more efforts on mobile and
where are the other games and you should
be able to do both but maybe you can't
maybe you can't oh that's the issue is
they were built as a company that could
make these super high quality games and
they were very expensive to produce and
then they'd make a bunch of money and
selling them because they'd sell for 40
hours via dollars or whatever but on
mobile like you can't charge forty or
fifty dollars so you need to make it up
somewhere you just need to figure out a
way where like free to play mechanics
don't totally prevent people from
enjoying an experience I would pay like
five bucks a chapter or whatever it is
or five bucks for like three hours of
gameplay of fire emblem on mobile but
they just need to figure out some sort
of balance so like if like they need to
get to the next I'm sure they will to
the next stage of Super Mario maker
style mentality and what would keep
evolving what does that mean well I feel
like that's a game that really balanced
not just the retro but the flexibility
the user created content and it's
seemed like to head do a pretty good job
of balancing stuff that Nintendo usually
is not that good not a huge financial
boon for them though no it's fine now I
know it's like what are they doing but
it was a huge I people cared about it in
a game for the first time in a very long
time so right like that's something to
be noted and I think much it's I mean
what I did but I think it did okay but
it definitely didn't like turn the ship
around for Wii U I don't think there was
a game that could have done that for Wii
U I think that that game feels like a
mobile game and that's our handheld yes
or OC change to me is why that you want
to be doing those lows on a train yeah
of course like any of your livers
there's like an iPad app yep that
allowed me to design levels like I it's
that's gotta be honest Williams it
seemed it's easy to say right yep but
you know putting it into practicing in
the execution of that is probably um you
know a total disaster yeah so I don't
know but Nintendo you know I being
covering them for all these years you
just learned that like they are doing
their thing yeah and you know that it
that investor meeting they they're
saying like oh we're getting out of dude
they're selling their majority stake in
the Mariners yeah the baseball team uh
we're we're leveraging our our IPS for
theme parks yeah so looking for other
income basis I mean they've had success
with me Bo yeah and they were just gonna
make more figures with I mean yeah right
now they they they gentlemen they're
well-known right hidden kink wanted yeah
and and is a yeah and the brands are
very valuable like I deal with Disney
and Mario and a Nintendo would be very
valuable yeah and all that stuff can
essentially float them until they
release the NX and if it's a big success
than they're fine and if it's a total
wii u disaster then maybe they can just
reorg the company where it's just about
using the brand and and licensing out
stuff and then that's the end of it hmm
so all right we're going to shift gears
let's talk about uber last week I want
to say there was a story uh uh where
California was was was sort of like
opening the door and going to but it was
this sort of like
not lawsuit yep but it was something
where like drivers were fighting for the
right to be able to ask for tips okay in
Californian driven uber cars sure ah
then I get an email the other day from
the uber NYC and uber nyc's like nah
don't don't don't worry about it
nothing's changed you don't need to tip
we don't expected to tip and that's the
thing that we're staying with ok I just
wanna like I don't know the second I saw
that story about the California uber
driver yeah like then being able to ask
for tips i'm just like uber is totally
just turn up not that this would be uber
is fall shark but the fact that like all
good things must come to an end right
we're like the most attractive thing for
me about uber yeah even when it even in
its infancy was like oh if you throw
away the on-demand car thing you throw
the whole thing it was like I have to
talk to this person right I have to deal
with them I don't allow you wouldn't
have let's face it so lift has tipping I
use lived expert now that's is it up and
that's what I'm saying so if if ever
were to add tipping it would be a nap so
you still wouldn't have to talk to the
person the I mean well what do you mean
so like all good things must come to an
end they're gonna add tapping not today
we're tipping but it's like the door for
this really awkward and precarious
relationship with the driver that you
don't want to have would have opened up
and like you know stained the otherwise
kind of like you know you don't talk to
me I'll talk to you well where I'm going
relationship that it was C hat but it's
interesting because you can't as a
driver you can't and and if Eber makes
it public like no typing no tipping if
the driver asked for a tip then you're
uber ratings going to go down as a dried
of course so they're like drivers don't
really have an incentive to go against
uber in this scenario so they have no
leverage yeah I don't know there was a
loss there was a hundred million dollar
lawsuit that they're settling in
Massachusetts in California where uber
drivers will remain independent
contractors instead of employees right
so so it minimizes the amount of hours
are allowed to work because the second
you go over that limit you
to get the benefits all sorts of stuff
right yeah I mean it was very weird I
thought it was amazing that like they
thought it was such a big deal that they
had a email blast anyone who has an uber
account sure New York well it Matt I
mean I as you said it matters like it
matters to you that I don't have to tip
these people it's a huge appeal element
to tuber it's yep for me it's like
arguably the most confusing if you start
hearing about the tipping straight I
swear and the messaging gets all out of
whack yeah yeah wood and i know we're
definitely in a bubble here New York I
think uber is amazing in other cities
like la it is i I've kind of started
falling out of love with uber in New
York um and I just I'm curious like get
your guys's take on it okay I'm kind of
starting to think like there's too many
cars by faith to make overs drivers like
19,000 ubers in New York it's crazy just
use cabs in New York which in the ever
you ever used a news not in New York
okay but I was in the middle I use
aliases like in the middle crown heights
it was like nine o'clock on a Tuesday
it's different I'm talking them the
island oh you're saying Manhattan Hatton
but like really brought a downtown
Brooklyn you're not counting that I
guess so i get it i mean but again like
they're eight even parts of Manhattan
like if you're all the way on the west
side you might not be able to get a
catching a cab stuff it's great where I
live I mean like in montclair it's
fantastic sure okay you know yeah you go
to San Francisco it's great LA it's it's
great it's true man i kinda just go for
like whatever cars nearby and I don't
like the hassle I don't even like the
hassle i have seen people the office do
with a call an uber and then they don't
know where the ubers yeah waiting for
that sure I get it I'd rather wait for
an available cab I just feel like
sometimes it the thought arises in my
head that like maybe Manhattan's not
built for uber like maybe this city
shouldn't have this I mean they you mean
from a business standpoint or not Mike
from a total consumer standpoint but
they do well in like I'll disclose my
dad's in the tax like right but they do
well here like why what makes you say
they should be here it's I just think
like I have a scaling demand right so
like if I get it I get it but I've take
them a lot in New York and I've just
started to see the needle move in like
the opposite direction
where I was like I used to love it and I
still go wrong if it's midnight a man
right taking an uber right without a
doubt I would keep uber and taxis and
get rid of all the weird lurking cars
you turn around your lurker well the
drivers go do you ride really why we get
get rid of those are banned you know I
don't need the workers but you let you
go back to the garage way for a dispatch
don't here's what you like the weird
hunting lurking them blossom lane I say
given to them but I say don't get rid of
like regular car service companies no
but regular Carthoris cumbies don't go
hanging around block then offering
they're all sorry they're also having a
tough time ask yeah what I would say is
here's a big addition for me two for
cabs and like to encourage me to take
cabs in New York City a rating system
for camps and I realize you can call for
11 or whatever and I don't give that I
great my great did you know you can
digitally hell yes I am aware but only
because he told me I did they have an
app called arrow yeah and it's like the
same thing yeah but you can't rate the
cab why is it called arrow it's a RR oh
so a third party at I mean it's in
conjunction right the sinir the
department of taxi things is what it is
I just it's like musing the New Jersey
tan transit at to buy ticket show
oh so that I happens but yet I will
never use anything else because i'm not
going to go up to a ticket booth and
purchase it's the world second or even a
kiosk and worse I'm just saying it's
really frustrating to me to be able to
have to take a cab and like there you
know you know we're out Alex and I my
fiance were out late and we're in the
middle of the city and we're both tired
and a cab drives by with the light on
and we hail it and if it's like a
miserable ride there I have no leverage
beyond like not tipping them or tipping
them a small amount it gives a lot some
power to the consumer and the cab
drivers would care like that carries
that's a ongoing punishment in a bad
driver something that has to happen
where is right now like just one tip
being low it's just this faceless person
right hey look look if it's awful you
can
do it on the screen how amazing would
that be like right in front of you just
like how many stars would you rate this
dry and you can and that's not
impossible only thing is they can't rate
you back that's the one reciprocal thing
in ubers there's this why not you can
cause you have no account no but like
you could make it so that it becomes
that you can make it that's an
interesting about that super said you
know you if you trash them because
that's a thing as too much get upset in
trash the drivers all time but there's
the negative in uber that if you start
doing that obviously they're good you
know don't do that be a good person well
you figure out a mean though yeah I will
I always want to know when you rate an
uber driver do you do they see their
your rating you gave them now I they
don't see which rating you gave them but
obviously they see their rating right
cuz I'm always just like this guy
just see I gave him two stars no no no
all right I don't think immediately I
think uh they might only see the average
um big you know if they only do one
drive a day and their rating goes down
after that apparently there's a way for
you now to see your rating really and i
don't know that i doona me I used to
have them tell me we have to go into the
settings under profile and it's under
one of ya I'll get interesting she ever
we were in LA and was that with you when
the guy like week uber did it was like
this really fancy Mercedes okay you
remember sort of yeah and the guy
volunteered he's like I don't do this a
lot but uh I gotta let you know you got
a five you got a 50 no 49 you saying
i'll pick up anyone lower than a 47 yeah
do you remember it a little bit just
like I was having that happen for a
while they were just coming out and then
I found it in the app and i think i'm at
480 i know someone someone that already
think someone didn't like mine on tip
yeah maybe but i felt bad i was like
 and I got a tip these people there
ya know I do that now I would your holy
right it's got there's got to be a
system in place where like the cab
drivers can have that uber cuz there's
no there's no incentive for them exactly
right exactly and maybe if you're like
the dispatcher you go hey to my my fleet
of 12 cabs yeah whereas the highest
rating at the end of the week you get an
extra twenty bucks all right Burton
first highest rating you get a Cadillac
second highest rating steak knives
third-highest right your fire
and the no we fire the guy with the
lowest rate you'll be that guy talking
to you Russ I know you drive you know I
try to find couldn't find where this is
in the set it's the very irate it is
Barry is pretty it's pretty bare
interesting um so there's one story that
will talk about with you again we'll
finish things off with that but I want
to uh pivot back into Scott while we're
here cuz you know you are here a lot
when you do specialize on a lot of
specific things on Cena including the
Apple watch I think a distant relative
you are usually go like but you're busy
cuz you travel on your way along yeah
very bit you can see the family how much
and when you're here it's like man we
got pick his brain cuz he's not gonna be
your back for a while exactly I'm cousin
Scott your cousin Scott with the weird
job yeah hope to see you again sleazy do
mom oh you i bleep computer all those
come and visit anytime crash on her sofa
you should come out cap lay with all
your gadgets uncle Scott banging my ring
against the metal like it's like a
punctuation yeah I think your trunk
taking off my wedding rings okay Oh
happen it's off for the podcast good now
that the Rings off you can talk about
the Apple watch there we go so uh it's a
year in over a year in right it's over a
year a year in a month I like that were
doing these sort of like yearly audits
on these products what what do you think
yet well I'm in the process of re
reviewing the Apple watch while you doin
anyway why you doing that because it's
year old and Pete and that's what people
do now is they look back on products and
because they haven't come out with a new
one so if you're shopping for this it's
changed a little bit and the landscape
has changed a little bit and so uh the
opinions a little different I see a lot
of people wearing Apple watches I just
don't see them using them yep that's the
thing is what do you do when you use a
watch you're not gonna be like sitting
there right you know it's hard to tell
and I always find it's hard to tell you
you're not gonna sit there fiddling with
it it's kind of designed to not fiddle
with it too much I also think uh yeah i
agree i see i I just got my teeth
cleaned this morning that is an old and
that I got my teeth clean I got my teeth
clean and and she was wearing an Apple
watch and I feel like I feel like
inevitably like I see it more and more
although I also hear about a lot of
people have stopped wearing them yeah I
have two friends with them I was at the
lunch with one of them the other day and
he had not he told me the war
first thing about the watch is that he
had yet to find the delicate balance of
like using it in public and not looking
like a total reject yeah yeah and to me
I was like that's a weird problem but
then I thought about we talked about I'm
like oh wait I kind of get it because
you it is this awkward interaction thing
yeah and a little bit self-important
yeah because if you think that somebody
is annoying on a phone what you're
saying on the watch is I am choosing to
not be connected to my phone by staring
at a watch right in front of you I could
just as easily pull my phone out and do
the same thing but I'm gonna do it on my
watch instead even though it's more
clumsy and so I yeah it's like a halfway
statement it's like I'm not just I'm not
connected but I am connected as you can
do nothing yeah that's to me that just
yeah no I'm not down with that yeah how
long is it going to be like are they
gonna refresh the hardware on this thing
are they basically saying oh we screwed
up no no they didn't I mean they're
gonna keep on with this and at least for
a while and the refresh I would guess
would be opposite the iphone 7 sure and
may help if the iphone 7 doesn't have as
many features as rumors say that would
be as amazing for people then having
that alongside it would pet would spice
up the event a little bit what does that
mean but let's go deeper well because
the iphone is it is it it's always one
of the top search commodities on the
site and people want to know but i don't
want to read about it but sales dipped
right on the iphone this year and it's
their biggest part of their industry and
none of you know at some point people
are just going to stop upgrading all the
time and we talked about all time with
smartphone boredom they are amazing
devices and they continue to evolve but
i'll need one every year that's a thing
and they approach and I've seen resume
your articles debating this from
everybody now in the industry and it's
both their amazing but there are also
commodities now yeah so it's commodity
status not everybody needs every great
future all the time the most people have
got one and so yet you said a lot of
people settle with not needing one right
now right and there are very few tricks
to pull out of the hat that are amazing
at this point right I think there are
not that many there are still a few but
kind of few and far between a few people
i've talked to that have switched from
Apple to Android enjoy the notion enjoy
the idea or at least then the idea that
i can just get another new phone
whenever i want like i don't have to do
this year long waiting game yes where i
have to wait a year to see if i want
this phone right and then kind of go
from there and you have a lot of
different ideas for what you'd want you
want a removable battery do you want
this you want that right if ur incise is
like i'm a guy where expandable storage
the only thing I give a right well
guess what just me like 11 phones this
year that can do that and if you change
your mind maybe you know you side now
that doesn't matter this admires there's
a phone out there Apple you've got to
wait for their design decisions you know
to match with yours or not and whether
you're gonna bend or not and so that's
always the battle but going to so I
that's that that's the iphone but Apple
watch I would say there should be one in
September people are not expecting a lot
of great changes but definitely battery
life could be one of them so if you had
a guess I mean if there's anyone who's
can make an educated guess it's you what
do you think of her battery life on that
watch too I don't think it can get all
that much better yeah because more than
you know more than a day or day and a
half yeah but the battery life limits on
these things continue to be a challenge
I mean that's like it's kind of hit a
wall things like the pebble that last a
week yeah that's because you're using
different display technology and they're
not doing the same thing but i would
think that they're going to be able to
try to get to a couple of days also to
work in the feature of mitra my fitness
devices they've never done sleep
tracking now I'm not like a huge
believer in the sleep tracking
technology on the friends because they
don't really work share that well but
they do log sleep and I feel like that's
kind of useful and they're part of the
ecosystem for Fitbit for where they
would all these things my phone log
sleep though does it yeah how does how
do I have an app that uses sound all
your dummy and it works I'm telling you
it work how did you sound so I mean when
you an app it's called no no I'll tell
you so it uses the sound from your
sleeping from me like moving around or
not sleep cycle it's called sleep sighs
oh yes it what about
doesn't pick up Alex I so they're
actually linked which is pretty cool so
because we're connect to the same Wi-Fi
router it'll recognize which sounds
she's making versus my sounds you both
have this running at the dog there's no
dog but if there was maybe I look at it
is gonna sound a weird sentence I sleep
with a dog yeah okay well then you can't
do this you're a you this yeah it might
not work with you're screwed um but it
works it worked for me and it also wakes
me up when I'm lightest and sleep so
when I just start moving around that's
when the alarm starts going off I like
that it's really cool and it's very I
really like me that's a smart it would
interpret you Jeff as a very restless
furry annum yeah be like well you
getting so little so you're getting so
little sleep and your heart is beating
way quicker than should yeah I mean it's
not tracking my hair are you a dog it
was a fusion to preacher yeah it would
see all of this is sean john candy from
spaceballs as my profile it's just the
epitome of like all the issues with the
Apple watches that your phone just does
all that stuff but better yeah just does
lend and oh that's just I don't know man
I wanted to want own Apple watch I said
it that's the thing at the number one
thing when people ask me now and it's
kind of how I'm going to this now just
the other day people still ask try get
an Apple watch yeah it's like a very
commonly asked question if they know
that I write about tech or I deal with
this stuff because people have not
gotten on the path you don't know if
they want and generally the answer is no
you don't need a question right Napa
watch but I do wear one I find that in a
messy landscapes awful and it's kind of
like a tether to keep you connected but
that's the thing as do I want to be
connected I'm trying to not be as
connected right and also it does a very
mixed to not to not good job of staying
connected to things in your life
obviously when you're not near a phone
right which so then if you're always on
the phone why of that but we're not in a
world where if there's some fantasy I
guess of this being a super connected
device to everything around those things
are was working without being next to a
foot by can you even work out like is
the stand yeah you were out without the
phone and it works fine well in so it
has actually a fair amount of
stand-alone things music playing if you
want store stuff on it you
do the fitness tracking even Apple pay
sure um and if you go near Wi-Fi
hotspots that it recognizes it gets
messages it gets these ok but not but
not all of them so you're kind of like
but they're gonna switch to that in June
they're gonna make all the apps run
natively and I think it's gonna start
running warm Wi-Fi so it's cool but it's
not in it doesn't really feel like it's
really keeping an eye on everything or
sure yeah yeah it feels still like it's
being a bit either or a bit of a
reminder device right uh and I just I
wanted to be able to stay on all the
time if I wanted to right after worry
about charging but you wear yours yeah
now do you do it just for the job or do
you do it because you genuinely like it
no I do it because I like it but I don't
do it I don't love it and that's a thing
as I like it because I think it's the
best for messaging yeah ok I think it's
the best among smart watches for getting
quick messages and information and not
always being responded to it easily none
of them do it that well but this one
does it pretty well it's interesting
that I find a lot of people giving off
the sentiment that they they almost kind
of like make this compromise they're
like yeah I just have to like force
myself to like yeah a little bit or
force myself to wear it and I just kind
of tell myself I like it well I've heard
that and i use it i always use some sort
of activity tracker fitness tracker I
think it's finished trackers pretty good
what it's lacking is the rest of the
fitness tracking ecosystem other stuff
has like social mm-hmm competitive stuff
um being able to do the tracking
nutrition built-in things that you just
you you would assume you have the option
you have to a third party apps but right
the basic daily goal keeping on it is
good sure and stands in for that so i
use it for that you civ4 dumb things
like the weather dumb but it's useful
for that whether it's important i only
get weather for my phone yeah and if I
Drive I use it of course you could
obviously use and some people with cars
are you do this stuff you can get
turn-by-turn directions through
bluetooth but I actually use it in
addition to ping me with all turn remind
right yeah that's like that which is
good and especially my family's asleep
or not around I want to just kind of at
night get a little heads up on it is it
vibrate yeah
yeah it vibrates makes it that's the
touch whatever it's called yeah the
taptic sick a faint vibration on songs
pebble it makes little sounds um and it
and and it and it turns on pretty easily
awareness by don't like you have to turn
to turn on yeah yeah but it doesn't ever
have doesn't often have any fail moments
for that uh that's why I use it but I
feel like those extra hooked in futures
just a little bit more than the pebble
yeah uh are why I do it but I do do it
because I work it's like it's hard to
draw the line I do a series of wearables
I've always been kind of it I've always
been a bocce techie geek totally not
everybody is gonna be like that I get it
and I'm I'm kind of I'm that person as
well I've recently fallen into like a
renaissance of like analog watches um
I'm like back I see the money of Colin's
every day I just like on your rest yeah
i just really like unique kind of
watches i like uh you know I but here's
the thing right like I used to be the
casio guy I used to be the like I cell
phones i would like tell the temperature
up the watches that would give me the
temperature have like readings and yeah
you know I never the calculator watch
but I had the watch that change the TV
channel yeah at the memo bank watches I
had I had one watch listen to this I
gotta find this I had a watch from casio
that vibrated when my phone rang wow how
long ago it was all what dude it's a
definitely ten years ago that's amazing
we gotta find it it would also go off it
use bluetooth know it used this is gonna
freak you out like an acoustical know it
used some sort of like wave sensor and
it would go off when I walk in front of
Michael oh that's disconcerting that's
amazing yeah I never really such a dick
I school I need to tell that story more
yeah yeah and I gotta find what that
watch was a man who walked in front of
micro and like I would just know it was
crazy to as at the meteor honor whatever
the hell it was was so sensitive that it
would go off if I had pulled I was
driving so it had to be at least 15
years ago um I would drive in a car
stopped at a light the person next to me
was on their phone it would vibrate
weird that's weird it was faster % casio
did so many case
you wonder why casio is not involved in
making smart waters now I spoke with
castle before talked about this I think
that they're kinda like a company like
Nintendo that just like they do there
that we know that we know or do yeah
proud legacy been anyway I not that
bring reminds me the number thing that
bugs me at the Apple watch it needs more
watch faces yeah if you're like a watch
nut or design fetishist you should be
able to download or get whatever watch
faces you want right and I'm anything an
apple still has no watch face God there
is insane yeah and they have a built-in
bunch of 10 or 11 yeah customized but
it's not enough i mean they get really
old they're very repetitive and yeah you
know what that if I had a really cool i
just want awesome watch faces that show
more yeah I don't want to load the apps
the apps are awful right tell you why
they don't do it yeah they don't do it I
know I try to monetize like they won't
have a store to forget it but it'll be a
cert thing right it'll hot you submit a
watch face yeah that's gonna take seven
to 10 business days for us to vet it oh
definitely there's gonna be curate
because the second someone flicks their
wrists and shows the most hideous Apple
watch face I will not be right there
really are that's the guy it was really
good definitely a problem with pebble
right it is but in but you can't that's
wonderful and terror yeah you can't
reject they couldn't reject things as
like this is ugly no but they could
reject like an overcrowded thing I mean
I think it'll be much more heavily
curated we're gonna develop partnerships
yeah I kept saying was gonna happen and
it didn't now I think it's gonna happen
in September they'll announce the Apple
watch to with with you know you have
your Disney line you have your philippe
starck did watch faces are sure they
could partner with all sorts of
designers I just think it needs to
happen yeah because at this point if
it's supposed to be a cool watch it's
not cool enough even as a watch if they
missing those extra faces if they came
out with a hybrid analog sort of hybrid
thing which like I know I think if
there's one coming I could pull it off
could be them we're like they teamed up
with like tag or a you know whoever you
know scoggin whatever it is like make a
make a watch that has both we're like
maybe I could see through that screen on
top and see a second hand below it it's
definitely possible and like I that I
almost like that my
happen it's uh it's totally not possible
and maybe like down the road yeah like
once Apple watch become such a Morgan
eyes commodity in the right brain
branching out other design before we uh
go into the last thing here give me two
major maybe like out of the box
predictions about Apple watch too can I
get can I ask you that oh yeah like
aside from battery life uh I know I'm
putting on the spot here now I've been
thinking about this yeah one would be
maybe FaceTime I mean if they go down I
think people can go to adjust yeah have
a quick little call with someone right
it's it it's again it's samsung tapped
into that it's a fantasy soon like I do
you think I like this like they'll have
a you know you put your your wrist up to
your face and you can't you just gonna
like show people stuff yeah it's cool I
mean again can do with your phone but
anyway this is the exact that's a thing
yeah the thing is why do you need it I
have a second one which might be merged
into you but so far this stuff has been
a big mess is a cellular I mean we need
a on standalone question is how do you
do then have the battery like not be bad
the gear s2 3g aight i wore for a while
which has cellular doesn't not bad job
like massive its massive its massive the
battery life is maybe add a lot oh
here's which is like nine manners you
install look that macbook and you worry
about having a cellular in to talk about
worrying about something wrist not so
much that person but I mean give this
giant chunk alike cell phone yeah send
in your wrist all day did get hotter
hope that's okay and you have one next
year lowers yeah I have one at things
everywhere so it's like basically well
like look at what I've gotten fireman
when they show the cross section of that
stupid macbook they have with like the
whole thing's a battery of the screen
it's like a little ziggurat of like
tiered Barry so why don't you do that in
like the band of the watch like oh just
do that at thank thank you for reminding
me but not to say you yes you're you're
totally right and also I agree and I
will say that yes smart bands would be a
fantastical yeah I like that pebble has
promised that they would do that for a
while yeah those those pebble watches
have the connector I think they'd a real
problem getting any traction yes their
company is not you're not doing well
well I mean what was last time you heard
about pebble as a top smartwatch and he
had a market I guess but like if someone
said to you do I get a pebble or an
Apple watch I feel like you would
recommend a pebble know mmm III think is
really torn right now I like pebble for
if you get it cheap if you get it for
150 bucks yeah get a pebble what about
okay so i mean but i don't i feel like
pebble needs a bigger watch also i think
it's slowing down I haven't seen as many
interesting software app things I think
it does is basic notification things
just fine yeah I like pebble time steal
a look of it but then you're paying up
to 250 what are they gonna do what does
that company have to do I got am I want
to see some of this I want to see that
smart band stuff work but the question
is how do you make that appealing but
face is too small the screens to small
on those watches a couple I think the
problem is that it's really hard to
interact with yeah because with those
buttons only you're caught I don't
always like touching on a screen sure
but with the buttons in the app
sometimes they don't all work the way
one yeah and something you want to do
something and you say i'm not really
sure how I can do it yeah I think they
just think they also have to make their
their fitness stuff which is actually
getting better baked all these watches
need to bake all their features right at
the top gotcha you don't have to dig
down yeah the things make it more about
what you can see as a dashboard right
away in as few steps as possible they
all say that but I feel like it actually
doesn't become that good watches all
right well there you have it that's the
hot take one year later all done from
Scott Stan about SmartWatch landscapes
including pebble and Apple watch we've
pivoted into the social commentary
section of our phone well let's not
preface it because it's important that I
i make it clear oh wow you were starting
to preference and I don't even know what
I want to talk about I don't but that's
part of the fun it is setting you up for
certain disaster sure okay so what do
you want to talk about Russ so here's
the deal i started a new job this week I
can't talk about it yet i'll talk about
it next week it's fine this guy what's
fine i I just haven't always public yet
and this is not the show to make it
public so its ranks no offense it's your
own show um when I start a new job and I
was there all week and we were having
meetings on one
on a certain floor of the building that
I hadn't been on before and uh you know
we there was a break in the meeting and
I walk outside and there's a bunch of
people working at that's whatever and I
was looking for the bathroom and I ask
someone where the bathroom is and
they're like oh it's right over there
and I turn around and I start walking to
the store and then as I got closer I see
the sign it says in all it's an all
gender bathroom okay I'm like okay
whatever i'm going to i watched a linear
feel whatever it's fine uh that's the
connection i made to it that it's like
using like hello fellow young people so
as I'm walking in it occurs to me cuz
like I don't want to get graphic but I
needed to make it to and it occurs to me
wait I wish everyone saw the little
snarl that Russ just did but anyway you
had it you had to make a poopie I had to
make a poopie yeah and it occurred to me
that I had never in my life use the
bathroom maybe when I was to make a
poopie with a member of the opposite sex
never in my life in wait so this was
like multiple stalls multiple stalls
okay three different stalls all right
and as I'm walking in and it's empty
when I walk in but it's three-stall
other people join you as you go wait a
minute so like or there's no urinals
there are no urinals because so now is
that a thing like oh that's interesting
yeah because like I would feel
uncomfortable with a woman walking into
me peeing in a urinal okay that's why
there's no journals I'm sure she would
feel uncomfortable too is this the death
of the urinal is this the death at a
funeral I guess a yourselves are very
efficient I love yours with them off in
the side where no one can see how no no
the best journals are the ones that go
all the way up car door honey here's and
then it becomes sexist because it's only
for one sex let me let me say the reason
i mention this it is obviously in the
news right now right people freaking out
there's assholes in the world who don't
understand how to live life and let me
reiterate the fact that like I think the
idea of like trans people going into
bathrooms and harassing pick up members
of whatever is an imaginary issue that
people are like maniacs and Alabama are
making up so I'm sorry Alabama go on
zing um so I think like I think it's a
joke so this is not about that or
whether I think it's a good I course not
it's just about this realization that i
had as i was walking in um where was
like and I like sat down and I was like
this has to be the quickest poop of my
entire life that's all it is that's all
this is it's a design to get everyone to
poo quicker right it's like a proto
anything yeah you found that it was
effect you can its bed you up it sped me
up why would also I found that I will
never ever poop on that floor again I
didn't even take your phone out oh no it
was like a lightning poop I feel like it
would freeze all processes and that um
my body would go into some sort of
digestive arrest like so yeah I wouldn't
be constipated for days it's an amazing
thing like have you um no but like I
haven't I've never ideas never look and
my wife does not like me pooping next to
her what do you mean how does their her
yeah mine doesn't either she goes go to
the bathroom you're gonna do that you
know like I mean if you ever had a
situation where and we don't cuz when
I'm side we don't have isn't her side by
side toy yeah should be a thing right I
think that's awesome and make that is
the thing for like the uber-rich
probably happen yeah who's like bizarre
we're like it's like two heads in the
shower the support where you were saying
that um yeah I just never had them on my
life where I've done and number two next
to someone of the opposite sex is
usually they don't like that right my
idea why also use I don't like Casey I
have a different and there's no
opportunities like someone's brush your
teeth enemy but he writes things like we
kind of just don't care and we kind of
like leave doors open and talk okay okay
fine Joanna doesn't like that yeah no
yeah we don't I i I'd i went online i
think i would not mock but the doors
closed look usually i want a little miss
here's the one rule we have just don't
touch each other like when that's
happening right but you talk all you
want relieve you for like you brushing
teeth and you're pooping or yeah in the
same place in china's course people and
talking but like the second like you
accidentally rub elbows your mmm do you
look at each other's you're talking or
pretend it's a phone call the know we
look I guess you've got yeah we
literally mean this is someone that
you've been married to for many years
yeah you were dating that many years
were
for so imagine that scenario not maybe
exactly they're not brushing teeth yeah
but still like in the same room with a
complete and order strange now how much
space is at the bottom of the stall it's
not a full door normal stall I want I'm
okay with it really when it wouldn't
phase you in other ways I don't think so
because you know what we all do it I
that's true and I it's a natural thing
but it's this weird like unfamiliarity
this is the kind of thing I always think
about this when I grow up what's gonna
make me sound like an old grandpa racist
to my kid is the pooping with pooping
only poop yeah it's like segregated into
this is happening so I don't even know
exactly I think it 20 years there won't
be doors or wow that's that's you be
like why you guys not okay with just
open poop that I don't think that's
gonna I think that makes that doesn't I
would I would is that a privacy thing
yeah I think maybe people all be wearing
VR all right I have they get to the
total 0 is out your VR glasses what are
you doing with your open mixed reality
glasses while pooping what's wrong with
you shut your lenses uh yeah it'll be
just a your other reason I think they
like I would ordinarily say oh they're
all going to be you know mixed gender
toilets in the future but it's an
expense issue which is to say male a
toilet oh man 1 or way cheaper than
female tour looks like oh and plus I
only need to build one now just make it
a little bigger I only need one bathroom
now I just have to add like a few more
stalls what are you saying I'm saying so
I'll have to build a woman's and men's
bathroom now okay first of all space is
not infinite you can't just like turn
one bathroom into a second bathroom with
no problem no but I'm just saying like
you save space you save space ultimately
a slightly larger yeah okay i get i get
to larger you don't have to do care at
the sinks in the same way right it's
more efficient but but soap dispensers
those gotta stay separate ok that's
what's guys there's no I miscegenation
of us up to spend the automatic and I'm
fine with that with shared bathrooms but
what I'd be worried about is the sort of
like uh in a Larry David II sort of
thing like I'd be worried about getting
out of the the restroom and that someone
else like being upset with me for some
reason cuz you and I don't read it well
that yeah
the night is going first a light but how
many i just had yeah just had to use the
bathroom core everybody hates me now
like you know I feel like that I'd be
worried about that so all right now only
fifty percent of the people hate you
you're worried about a hundred oh yes
just by using the bathroom look and I
want to not bother anyone but i will i'm
not saying night that arable moves I'm
saying evide bleah upset people yeah yes
that's it that's I worry about just like
you know would it I mean I feel like I
it's already awkward in the men's only
bathroom sometimes totally optional as
like why not it why not let everyone
experience the horror anytime I
recognize somebody's ankles in the
bathroom next to me and i realize i'm
pooping next to somebody that I know
yeah and I not gonna try to delude
myself cuz I know I just that's Bob
that's definitely Bobby he's the only
one who has those brown and pink f
adidas yep there's a dance those are
dance shoes that's it I know it's him I
say when you know it's someone say hi
why but I've talked I've definitely not
during poop but during yeah we could do
that one sentence back and forth is fine
everything any conversations screw you
and I don't dare make eye contact
understanding you don't so white
standing in the bathroom and talking Oh
nuts I mean at the urinal I mean you
know oh definitely not at the arrow I
don't mind that I got someone I know I
hey what's them but I that reminds me of
a like terrible memories of going to
jets games as a kid yeah at the trough
yeah everybody's talking about to cry
talking about ken O'Brien it's just like
a big elephant drink no um alright I
think we could close it off there yeah
