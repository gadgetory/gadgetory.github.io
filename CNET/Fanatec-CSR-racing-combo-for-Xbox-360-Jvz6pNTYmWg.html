Sims you probably get into the point
where you're sick of driving with your
thumbs and want to step up to a bona
fide racing wheel I'm Antoine Goodwin
with cnet.com let's take a first look at
the fanatic CSR wheel shifter and pedal
combo the CSR combo is actually branded
with the Forza Motorsport logo and
there's also an Xbox 360 connect button
indicating that it works best with the
Forza Motorsport for racing game and the
Xbox 360 combo
however this Universal wheel and pedal
combo can be used with any Xbox 360 game
wirelessly and connected by a USB to a
ps3 or PC for racing on those systems as
well the CSR wheel has a very thick rim
with a flat bottom design if they're
actually really racy
they're also Alcantara inserts at the
neutral positions that wick sweat away
from your palms during timpz races and
aiding grip there's also a pair of
aluminum shift pedals here on the back
that feel like they can take quite a
beating the wheels brushed aluminum face
is dotted with controls that are easily
reachable with the thumbs including this
directional pad the ABXY buttons Bank
shoulder buttons and an LCD display that
can be used for adjusting anything from
force feedback stream to sensitivity
from ninety degrees all the way up to
900 degrees and linearity of the
controls you can also set up to five
different presets of all of those
settings for different games or
different players even at its default
setting the wheel offers really good
really strong force feedback and it's
actually quite accurate for racing the
table attachment clamp at the bottom
holds really well but if you want a
little bit more security you can
actually even remove it and drill holes
in a table or a racing wheel stand or
even more firmness the next bit of the
package is the CSR shifter kit now this
kit actually includes two shifters one
is a sequential shifter and the other is
an H pattern shifter the edge pattern
shifters gates they're a little too
loosely defined for my taste and I've
watched more than one three-two to
downshift during a race but I think if
you can get a little bit of practice
with it maybe even a little firmer mount
you could probably get used to it
finally we have the CSR elite pedal
which is actually a step up from the CSR
components that we've been talking about
part of the elite series now this
actually uses almost a completely
aluminium construction for the pedals
and the base there's also a really heavy
steel bottom here to hold it in place
and this thing is heavy and that's good
because you're basically going to be
kicking the crap out of it while you
race each of the pedals can be adjusted
horizontally or vertically with simple
hand tools and you can also adjust the
spacing it for example when you want to
get the brake pedal closer to the gas
pedal for that perfect heel and toe
downshift now casual gamers are probably
gonna get a little sticker shot from the
price the TSR wheel itself is 250 bucks
the shifter kit is $60 and the pedals
are about a hundred and fifty bucks then
we're talking about four hundred and
sixty dollars worth of racing simulator
here now if you want to save a couple of
bucks you can step down to the non elite
standard CSR pedals for about eighty
dollars they use a little bit more
plastic in their construction but they
use that same really heavy bait that I
like and you could probably even skip
the shifters because they're not really
that great to begin with shaving about
60 bucks off of the price check out the
full review of the CSR wheel pedal and
shifter combo for even more details
about the things that I liked and
disliked about each component and how
they compare to the previous generations
of fanatics Racing combos until then
I've been antoine goon which cnet.com
and if you'll excuse me I've got a
little more work to do
