one of the best thin gaming laptops you
can buy only it's not the model that
nearly tempted me to buy one last year
this is the improved 2016 model it's got
double the video memory inside on its
NVIDIA GTX 970 graphics chip a faster
Intel processor and a lighter frame
about a quarter of a pound lighter
despite having the same battery capacity
inside it has this new chroma keyboard
you'll see lights dance across the
keyboard as you press down leaving
lasting trails or ripples across the
surface razor is even working with some
game developers so when you get shot and
counter-strike it will flash red or when
your super is ready in particular games
that'll let you know that you're charged
up and ready to go how much more would
you expect to pay for these extra
features maybe a couple hundred bucks
compared to last year's model with the
super high def screen this 2016 razor
blade is four hundred dollars cheaper
it's one thousand nine hundred ninety
nine dollars
there's one more thing I haven't shown
you yet this razor blade has an Intel
Thunderbolt 3 port that allows it to
connect to this razor core external
docking station there's a full desktop
graphics card inside this case when you
can swap with any other graphics card
that comes out in the future to turn
this laptop into a more powerful one
even if games require more performance
than this laptop can handle in the
future a desktop graphics card can help
solve that you'll be able to find our
full review of the 2016 razor blade at
