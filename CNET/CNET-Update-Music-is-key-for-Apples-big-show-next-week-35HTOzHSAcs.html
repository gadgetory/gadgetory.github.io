announcement I'm Bridget Carey this is
your cnet update on Monday June eighth
apples set to make several software
announcements at its annual Developers
Conference known as WWDC we should hear
about upgrades to the operating systems
but also many are expecting Apple to
reveal a new layer to iTunes it's been
reported that Apple's creating a paid
music streaming service similar to
Spotify you could think of it as Netflix
for music giving you the power to listen
to anything you want on demand as long
as you pay a monthly fee The Wall Street
Journal spoke with unnamed sources that
said it's going to cost ten dollars a
month Apple is likely building on the
existing beats music service remember it
purchase beats last year for three
billion dollars itunes is the king of
downloads but streaming is an area of
growth right now and Apple wants a piece
of it if you subscribe to something like
this you may end up paying a hundred and
twenty dollars over the course of a year
and that's probably more than your
spending now on music downloads at the
last WWDC show Apple introduced home kit
which is Apple's standard for getting
smart home products to communicate with
one another and have your iphones serve
as the control hub for everything now a
year later companies are launching
products that work with Apple's home kit
the first is Lou tron's home lighting
control hub Apple stores are selling a
starter pack for two hundred and thirty
dollars so instead of going to the
lutron app to control it you can say hey
Siri turn on the lights there's some
speculation that on Monday Apple's going
to debut a streaming paid television
service but don't count on it Apple said
to be working on a service for watching
live TV over the Internet similar to
sling TV now recode reports that this
Web TV product maybe a year or more away
but you can follow the announcement live
on Monday it starts at ten a.m. Pacific
1 p.m. eastern but to switch gears to
other streaming news amazon is giving
you a new way to stream video games to
your television amazon partnered with
gamefly to stream some well-known games
on fire TV players you can run from six
different themed
game bundles for seven to ten dollars a
month and games include titles from
Batman's Arkham series and the lego
themed games speaking of Lego the game
Lego dimensions coming out in September
just added a new wrinkle the game is
Legos answer to Skylanders and it just
announced new expandable character packs
which include the simpsons Doctor Who
Jurassic world ghostbusters and
scooby-doo some of the vehicle toys can
be rebuilt to take on different
properties when scanned into the game so
for example the Batmobile pieces can be
turned into a bat blaster or a sonic bat
ray put it on the platform scanner and
you can switch between which you play in
the game that's all for this tech news
update but there's more at cnet com from
our studios in New York I'm Bridget
