drone company zipline is partnering with
UPS to test aerial deliveries but it's
not just any parcel taking off starting
this summer in Africa drones like these
will be delivering desperately needed
medical supplies ups zipline and Garvey
are going to be delivering life-saving
commodities medicines blood in Rwanda
this isn't your typical multicopter or
unmanned aerial vehicle it is a
fixed-wing drone that's capable of
carrying 1.5 kilograms of medical Goods
and traveling a range of 120 kilometers
the fuselage is made of carbon fiber and
Kevlar this makes the entire aircraft
lightweight tipping the scales at just
10 kilos or 22 pounds they also fly
below 400 feet and can operate in 99% of
weather conditions
a delivery hub can fulfill 100 drops
every day with requests arriving by text
message or phone call an operator packs
the order and scans a QR code that gives
the drone a route to the destination it
flies automatically dropping the payload
in a landing zone the size of three
parking spaces back on solid ground
we're not allowed to show you the
proprietary landing system that's a
secret or we can tell you is that the
drone is designed to take off and land
in very short distances zipline says
that the cost of drone delivery is no
more expensive than using motorbikes or
trucks jecht is actually using the work
that the Rwandan government is doing as
a model to actually scale this up
globally so that we can do things like
global vaccination campaigns in other
countries as well
testing deliveries in Rwanda will
generate safety information to feed back
to the Federal Aviation Administration
and likely lay the groundwork for drone
deliveries in the United States US
companies like Amazon and Walmart are
already experimenting with drone
delivery but federal regulations are
still being debated
there's always an application during a
disaster relief crisis situation to do
recognizance to find out where the
disaster is where people are to rescue
them so you're always going to have a
application like that domestically and
overseas as well so we'll obviously
learn a lot about this this process but
this is strictly a humanitarian mission
and we're excited to be a part of it
starting in July for Rwanda is in need
of medical supplies things are looking
