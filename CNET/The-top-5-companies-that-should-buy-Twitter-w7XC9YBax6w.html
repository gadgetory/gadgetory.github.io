should buy Twitter recently reports
world that Twitter was up for sale let's
see who should buy it and number five is
Apple Apple is just sitting on tons of
cash it could probably buy Twitter using
proceeds of iPod Nano sales yeah that's
still a thing
besides Apple has tried his hand at
social networking a few times and they
don't go anywhere with it so maybe a
Twitter owned by Apple could be
successful at number four is Amazon
Amazon owns a lot of different
properties did you know that Amazon owns
Goodreads IMDB comiXology and even
twitch could you see how Twitter could
easily fit within Amazon's world
plus with Twitter's push into video it
could add some interesting live content
to Amazon Prime video at number 3
snapchat hmm social network buying
another social network sure why not
snapchat keeps finding new ways to
engage its users maybe it could figure
out what Twitter should be or maybe just
become a part of snapchat and number two
Facebook so take everything I said about
snapchat and apply it to Facebook in
this situation imagine Twitter existing
the same way Instagram does the
companies can remain separate but I
think Facebook could bring some real
focus to Twitter and number one is
Google why on earth should Google be the
company to purchase Twitter it makes the
most sense
the company has struggled to make a real
dent in the social space however
combining some features or Twitter into
something like YouTube might be really
really helpful add it to that unlimited
usage of Twitter's real time data plus
Google search could lead to even better
results what do you think let me know on
Twitter assuming it's still a thing I'm
Matt is and I'll see you online</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
