cnet com I'm on the floor at CES 2013 in
the garmin booth with Kip donna leader
of garmin and we're about to take an
extremely early first look at garmins
idea for the dashboard of the future
this is the k2 infotainment platform and
it's basically garments take on how they
would handle the dashboard if they
handle the whole thing now before you
get a little worried about garmin doing
dashboards no they've been doing airplay
dashboards for years so they've got a
pretty good idea of how the sort of
interface design thing works so Kip why
don't we walk through exactly what we're
working with here sure in the center
console here we have a ten point four
inch capacitive touch display and
underneath that we have a bank of
buttons that allow you to jump to
between the different modes of the
system as well as some audio preset
buttons down below it yeah those are
always really good just to me when
you're driving yeah so we've got
navigation here I'm assuming this is the
really good garmin navigation is there
anything new that we're seeing from your
turn by turn directions these yeah let
me let me go and start a route we've
situated the vehicle in in chicago and
in addition to having garmin's normal
navigation capabilities we also have for
the first time some very immersive 3d
graphics and so we're driving past grant
park right now in downtown chicago and
you'll see as we drive the route that we
have realistic representations of
buildings as well as landmarks now we
already know you guys do navigation well
you've been doing that for a long time
let's talk about some of the the other
communications things that you kind of
have working in this new k2 system so
communications is a big part of the
story and so we have a android phone
that's tethered using a garmin app and
it's tethered over bluetooth and it
allows you to access any of the data or
apps on the system and do so in a safe
way so the types of things i'm going to
show you here are things that you do
while the vehicle is stopped so for
example you can pull up any contact
information off of your phone we had a
little bit of fun with this and we
pretended that this was Abraham
Lincoln's phone and type of contacts
that he would app on it so it's pulling
this it's pulling the pictures as well
as all the contact information
from the phone in addition you can you
can do text messaging from it again this
is all being enabled by the smartphone
talking I just sent the Abraham
Lincoln's phone an email and you'll see
this is the type of pop-up that you
would get when you were driving and you
could hit play and using text-to-speech
it would it would read you the email
just came in so we have a what we refer
to as a message center which is can be
customized for a particular driver so
you can select each one of these columns
is what we refer to as a tool and you're
able to select different types of things
that you want to have access to easily
from your car so for example here you're
seeing calendar information from your
smartphone same thing with that email in
here as well we've got you can select
things like whether now this this giant
10-inch screen right here in the
dashboard is just one of two screens
that you guys are showing off that's
part of this k2 infotainment platform
I'm noticing here behind the steering
wheel we've got a really large 12 inch
screen that's integrated pretty well if
I might add into the sort of bezel of
the instrument cluster yeah like you
said this is a 12 inch display both of
these displays are driven by the same
processor we can drive multiple displays
in 1080p video and what this does is it
gives you access to relevant information
in kind of a summary fashion and you're
able to see information related to each
one of the modes of the system and
control that with buttons on the
steering wheel and so right now
obviously it's it's showing what's
playing on the media player you can also
toggle to get to get navigation
information if we were actually routing
to a destination it would be showing you
what Lane you should be in and what your
next turn coming up is as well as seeing
summary information related to
connectivity so it's again pulling from
the smartphone and then I'm also
understanding that there's some really
good voice technology guys want to
demonstrate as well yeah so we think
that the best solution is a hybrid voice
recognition solution where you have some
commands that are interpreted on board
but other things that are done off board
and so so for example while you're
driving you might ask a question such as
can I help you where can I get a beer
important questions in life and it comes
back after it goes off board and
interprets that question here there's a
place called tilted kilt pub and eatery
just ahead on north wabash avenue and
this is ready to go now this is all set
up and it could be installed maybe in
the vehicle as soon as you guys find a
partner ticket it's it's still a bit of
a work in progress but you can see that
we've we've accomplished a lot in just
just a handful of months this past year
but yeah we are ready to have
discussions and are already having
discussions with OEMs and hope to have
this in a vehicle sometime in your
future awesome well this has been the
garmin k2 infotainment platform we've
been here with Kip from Garmin and I'm
antuan goodwin with cnet com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
