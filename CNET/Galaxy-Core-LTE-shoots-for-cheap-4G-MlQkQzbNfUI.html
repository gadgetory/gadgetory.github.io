Congress in Barcelona checking out this
it's the samsung galaxy core LTE now as
you probably know samsung is best known
for making really really enormous
Mobile's but this is actually one of its
smaller options it has a 4.5 inch
display and as it's becoming harder and
harder to find phones that are roughly
this size this could instantly be a
contender if you do prefer those more
manageable Mobile's
it has a 1.2 gigahertz dual-core
processor now on paper that is not as
powerful as some of the quad core
Mobile's that we see around these days
but anecdotally using it here it does
feel quite slick and smooth I didn't
notice any stuttering moving through
home screens or menus around the back
there's a 5 megapixel camera and this
thing is running Android version 4.2.2
now that's not the very latest edition
of Android but it's still extremely
sophisticated software and Samsung's put
loads of its own apps on here so you'll
have plenty to keep you busy as the name
implies this thing has LTE or 4G so you
will get faster mobile data because the
specs aren't too impressive I'm hopeful
that this phone will be quite cheap and
could be a good way of getting
affordable 4G it's out in the UK in the
next few months here's hoping we can
find it at a decent price let me know
what you think on the quest privacy net
