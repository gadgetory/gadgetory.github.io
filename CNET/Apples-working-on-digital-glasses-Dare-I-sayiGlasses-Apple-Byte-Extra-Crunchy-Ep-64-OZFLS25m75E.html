the apple byte extra crunchy you know
how we do it it's extra munchy this is
episode 64 according to my sources is
that correct that is correct that is
correct alright episode 64 a lot of
great stuff to talk about in the show
this week we do have to talk about
obviously the macbook pro reviews are in
we we kind of really covered that with a
special edition of our show that we
dropped for you just a few days ago so
if you want to talk about that we can
but again this show is all about you
it's not about us we want you to call us
at one eight hundred 61 62 63 eight
leave your name where you're from your
comments suggestions your bad apples
your good apples anything we're here our
phone line was actually our phone lines
we didn't really clean it out basically
yeah we got a couple might be full we
got out it is a check on that it is full
yes it's full it's completely full but
we do have a couple calls so let's just
jump into the week that is everything
Apple again this is kind of a compliment
complimentary peace to our video podcast
but we can get a lot more in depth we
can go back and forth and we have the
lovely musings of Steven Beecham who
makes this show possible yeah I'm here
making it possible if you weren't here
this this first story I'm excited about
actually you are excited about so hey
let's just jump right into it according
to Business Insider Apple has a secret
team working to make the iphone's camera
what they call a portal to augmented
reality now I want to give you guys and
gals a little history about this Tim
Cook has outright basically chosen
augmented reality as the platform that
Apple is looking to go with moving
forward he's said it in multiple
interviews with good morning america he
recently i can't remember what college
he was at i don't want to say it was
boston college but i believe it was in
that area he was there on campus doing a
speech he also talked about augmented
reality he's done it on the earnings
call augmented reality is the direction
Apple is going to go in he's many times
stated that it's more of a social
experience which is true where instead
of VR where you're wearing
these goggles / head this headset
display heads-up display in your in your
own world which is awesome right Beecham
totally change your life love being in
my own world what what what HTC vive
Star Wars preview yes change our GD two
handed me a lightsaber and then I
battled stormtroopers all right don't
don't get me all don't get me all worked
up art I mean I just got a little wet
just now but Apple is so far augmented
reality is what Apple's doing and what
they're trying to do right now kind of
their initial phases into this
transition of a feature that they
believe is going to be big coin in the
business insider Apple is integrating
augmented reality technology into the
iphone's camera app according to a
person familiar with this now this
involves a lot of different teams from
the startups that they have acquired
over time but Apple wants to put this
technology into users hands they've
hired experts in head-mounted displays
companies are also obviously competing
against them we have Microsoft doing the
hollow lens facebook has been reportedly
working on something like this snapchats
spectacles suspect this is like yeah
this is like a mash-up of spectacles
kind of and Google glass like yeah it's
like both it it's going to be cool so
this is first actually the beach this is
this is just applicable to Apple's own
camera where they believe and other ants
believe Apple will actually incorporate
this AR technology into the cameras into
the iphone software and then they would
allow developers to take advantage of
kind of this API to then use it within
their apps but they want this AR feature
to be able to recognize real world
objects and that would also require them
to kind of create this database of you
know the the actual lens within the app
being able to recognize this is a peach
this is a stop sign this is something
else that would then give it reference
points we have seen I can't remember the
name of the app a long time ago where
you held it up you showed the street and
a bunch of businesses popped up now for
those of you that are watching this um
they're watching a demo from austere hot
design group now this is a 50-person
company based in San Francisco Apple has
taken on their this man
named John border who was the senior
optics manager manufacturing exploration
engineer he joined Apple in September
and used to work for this company so a
demo for people that are listening is
basically there's an iphone and then
there's a len a glasses like type
product rights a pair of glasses and
they put it in front of the iphone and
you can see basically a row of different
apps different things pop up when
they're looking outside on the street in
san francisco but again augmented
reality it's it's it's here now we also
have another report that supports not
only Apple looking to add an augmented
reality aspect into their camera Apple
is specifically working on a pair of
digital glasses now this is according to
Bloomberg from earlier this week Apple
is in the early product testing phase
and you could say it's a pair of glasses
that's similar to Google glass what
they're doing really is think about this
because you have to think how Tim Cook
things he thinks logically and in a
business mind as well it's maybe not the
most innovative thing we get don't get
me wrong we we're probably sure Apple
has some sort of eyeglasses product that
they've been at least plane within their
mind for more than the past few years
most likely even at the same time or
when Google was doing it but Apple wants
to branch off what is their most what is
Apple's most successful product today
beach Oh iphone iphone right yes so they
had the Apple watch which was an
extension of the iphone all right fine
not the biggest seller but if the iphone
is the number one selling product
wouldn't it would be smart to make a
product that branches off of that guess
what a pair of glasses that would talk
to your phone that would be that dude I
would do that I mean rather than having
to pull my phone out of my pocket I'm
just wearing my glasses that is a game
changer you wear glasses eyewear
sunglasses okay sleep there you go yeah
I mean I will I the only time I don't
wear sunglasses when I'm in the studio
true although I I could do that I mean I
could be that guy well they're gonna
have some sort of shade technologies you
can be clear or dark it could be it
could be that yeah like or do you have
those glasses that when you go in the
Sun they turn yeah right they'd late any
blockers or someone
the blue blockers has that dude that
doesn't wrap the continent infomercial
all the time yeah he was like
freestyling about blue blockers you're
like yeah I'm gonna get this so um Apple
is in the exploration phase with these
digital glasses the ideas that they
would connect wirelessly to your iPhone
show you images and other information in
the wearer's field of vision they and
use augmented reality to assist in that
according to hear Apple has already
ordered small quantities of near I
displays from one supplier for testing
but if you expect these to come out
anytime soon if we even see these
digital glasses or eye glasses Oh or eye
lenses oh good you know you could the
property's gonna calm Apple Apple
glasses or Apple lenses whatever they
call them um but I gotta call it
something cool cuz snapchat is
spectacles I mean that's kind of sweet
actually that was pretty sweet but Apple
would release them at the earliest in
2018 if they do we also know Apple has
been known to just scrap projects when
it just hasn't come together correctly
for them you might even if you didn't
all know this i mean the apple ipad was
a project or a tablet device that they
had been basically had in their back
rooms for at least 10 years before they
actually put it out really so they wait
for the technology to be ready it's not
like they're doing this two years they
they see like a trend maybe and then
they're like oh now is the time yeah get
it well you know they've done that with
oled screens with wireless charging with
a curved displays bigger screens if you
know the glasses there they wait wait
they wait for trying to come but quite
honestly anyone who's a Apple fan knows
that Apple tends to jump on board a
little later when they feel the timing
is right so again Apple camera augmented
reality Apple pair of glasses augmented
reality base and this story I didn't
really put it out earlier a few weeks
ago just because it's kind of one those
quick mentions but according to ming-chi
Kuo who is the Apple rumor
extraordinaire from KGI securities he
had released a report outlining that he
believes
part of the reason why Apple kind of
scrapped their car plan right we talked
about the Apple car which all
indications say it's a no-go it's being
re-evaluated as more of a system that
could be bought out or integrated with
other cars but it's not an actual car
anymore I just want to make that clear
for people that are that are still
asking me like where's the Apple car
well as of now it's it's nowhere but
ming-chi kuo believes that Apple is
working on an augmented reality system
for your car that's that would be useful
yes definitely like I don't know how
many people there's a was it an Audi
product that we've seen at CES that had
a crazy like minute really had to play
right yeah cool concept stuff even
something as simple as BMW has this
thing where it projects the speed of
your car on the dash oh yeah I've seen
that at first it was weird to me but
then it becomes totally useful yeah I
was just watching I figured what movie I
was watching the other day I was either
James Bond or mission impossible and
they're doing all that stuff on the
screen you know I think it was James
Bond I not as a recent was this a recent
bond I haven't seen the recent was like
an older bond okay but he like it's in
the car with like some hot girl and all
that yeah like does he like waves his
hand and all the specs show up on the on
the windshield inside the car and she's
like oh my god what are you doing you
don't look cool I know what that or you
could or you could just imagine Minority
Report like on your car on your car
screen yeah totally minority report when
I saw that movie I was like dude yeah
super cool that what but you know the
coolest thing about this camera this
video that we've been watching is this
icon teleporter and it looks like it
looks at very interesting but he does
click on it or whoever's using that does
click on it at one point and it just
kind of brings up this guy see I think
right here they click on it and then
there's a guy chatting Oh is a little
wave like it's as if you're talking to
someone yeah so I guess you're
teleporting to another you know another
place yeah at first when I saw that
teleporter icon I thought it was like a
virtual reality thing good teleport to
someone else's glasses maybe in or you
could just teleport yeah just teleport
to some other place camera oh that's
that looks cool I really did want to
tell you at the moment the apple byte is
up for
when it comes to sponsorship if you'd
like to sponsor us um we actually are
going unsullied so therefore we are not
influenced by any sponsorship right now
we can say whatever that we want true
yes thanks Salesforce r.i.p alright p
alright let's talk about apple iphone
news there's a lot of rumors floating
around yeah you might i am of the camp
that's like why are we time on apple
iphone rumors like a year ahead but
their allies the bummer last one we like
uh when's the next one coming that's
actually really true right you're like
give me something to get excited about i
mean i like literally like it was like
the day after the iphone 7 lodge people
are like oh but the iphone 8 you know we
were we were actually telling people
even before the iphone 7 even came out
you probably should be here the next
iphone that's still true that's just the
reality and i think a lot of people feel
that way as well according to our friend
ming-chi kuo again he put out basically
two reports recently first of all the
report that is the most kind of curious
is in 2017 expect to see three new
iphones and they'll be described as such
one will be still the 4.7 inch iphone
with an LCD display and a single lens
camera the second will be again an
iphone 5-point sorry 5.5 inch screen
sorry five and 5.5 inch let me there's
all these sizes being thrown let me
realize a lot of spot sizes yes there's
the 5-inch and then there's the 5.5 inch
model okay we'll have a dual dual lens
camera as well LCD base and then the
third would be an OLED based camera so
remember we were all hoping that iphones
would just completely transition 20
leads completely at least the flagship
models but according to the reports and
rumors only one of those three phones
will actually be an oled display model
and the reason why a report supporting
this according to bloomberg is that
playmakers are struggling to meet the
iphone output in 2017 so OLED displays
first of all right there's major
advantages there more energy-efficient
they provide deeper colors everyone has
seen one you know when you're looking at
an OLED you just do what Apple has a few
suppliers the four largest are Samsung
LG sharp and Japan display apple also
has really stringent requirements for to
pass their quality testing and so even
with those fortis for display suppliers
and ol Ed's low yield rates that's why
we might only see again I say might
because this is a rumor report we might
only see one phone of the three to have
the OLED display and that one will be
the premium priced phone course it will
be like three hundred dollars for source
it'll be of course it'll be right yeah
so I am and that'll be the hardest one
to get yeah I don't be sold out and
guess what to me what's a little even
more frustrating is that you know that
that one is going to be the Laurel be
the large screen iphone oh yeah yeah
right with the best camera with the best
with the best camera so to me this is
this is awkward to me because now
remember the days where there was one
single model or at least if you had two
different sized iPhones you are still
getting the same phone yes now you're
essentially creating a product line with
three different phones so you have 4.7
inch LCD screen with a single lens 5.5
inch display with LCD and the dual lens
camera and then a 5.5 inch OLED display
with a dual lens camera like come on
yeah it's a lot it's a lot for consumers
to chew on you know it's exactly the
opposite of what they used to do yeah
and if these things all do hold true
which a lot of these reports and this is
not just one person saying this is
Bloomberg combined with ming-chi kuo
from KJ securities that to me is
troubling that if I want blue again
before and yes times are rich
gene but before you knew you were
getting the best the iphone was the best
i phone you could get now there are
three iphones you could get and one of
them is the best i phone you can get
yeah there was a time when you say oh I
have the iphone the iphone now it's like
I have one of the iphone which one oh
you know I I decided not to get the ola
oh you don't have the iphone oh yeah you
know you don't want to be that guy you
want to be that guy yeah so I I don't
like the direction that this is heading
it just again the word fragment just
make it just doesn't make it feel like
oh I have the actual the flagship iPhone
we used to feel that way yeah this is
this is it you gotta make the iphone
great again I don't even want a large
screen iphone that's what sucks I would
want an oled phone I don't want I don't
want a large screen one either and I
probably the ola it's gonna be on the
biggest one of course it is yeah I
didn't want a big one either so I don't
think it's gonna really don't respect me
alright let's listen well we'll stay in
the mature space right now earpods
launching more rumors including updates
of late November and December this is
according to French retail site website
ethnic fanuc they posted earpods for
pre-order with a suggested shipping in
November 30th no one knows if that is
true Apple has not even commented on
that all we know still from Apple is
that it's sometime later they know I've
been seeing this from Apple a lot like
shipping times are not clunky no they're
not solid anymore it's like we might
ship it on this time yeah it's
interesting it's it's time for a change
in I keep saying that time sir change
they are here's some other news just in
regards to your current iphone sevens we
told you the story about how there were
two different modems inside the phones
depending on which carrier you're with
or whether or not you're and on if you
had an unlocked version the phone so
just a quick recap this was based on a
report from cellular insights that
reported and clearly showed that the
iphone 7s on AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile we're
using a diff
modem this it was an Intel modem LTE
modem where's the Verizon and Sprint
ones were using a Qualcomm LTE modem and
the tests found that specifically when
you have a hard time getting a signal
let's say you're at one I guess it's one
dot now right they don't use bars
anymore they use dots for LTE that the
Qualcomm modem consistently it was like
75 percent faster with data speeds then
the intel based one that's heute that's
a huge different that's a huge
difference so now a new report here
combining research from twin prime and
shared by bloomberg says reports again
Apple may be throttling verizon's iphone
7 LTE performance and this is we do know
that there are different modems in each
one but what it's reporting is that
specifically the verizon iphone 7 which
again we know has the faster Qualcomm
based modem does not reach the data
transfer speeds that it is capable of
hitting hmm so the the hardware from
Qualcomm is capable of a maximum
theoretical download speeds of 600
megabits per second while the Intel
modem tops out at 450 megabits per
second ok but this research found that
the verizon iPhones are only marginally
outperforming the AT&amp;amp;T iphone 7s which
people are saying look they're
significantly faster why aren't they
hitting the threshold why aren't they
hitting these the highest speeds they
can't why is it only minimal why isn't
even something significant so field
tests are just saying hey it's a little
faster no there is no there is no direct
answer in the statement from Apple they
say that there is no discernible
difference in the wireless performance
of any of the iphone 7 models that's a
statement from Apple I could read it
here but that's basically the summary of
what they're saying although we have
found from cellular insights that for
sure there is a clear difference
specifically when it gets too low signal
performance so for Apple to stay here
I'll just read this statement from
their spokeswoman every iphone 7 iphone
7 plus meets or exceeds all of apple's
wireless performance standards quality
metrics and reliability testing in all
of our rigorous lab tests based on
wireless industry standards in thousands
of hours of real-world field testing and
an extensive carrier partner testing the
data shows there is no discernible
difference in the wireless performance
of any of the models but based on
reports that is not true good that's a
bummer so look if we don't know if
anyone is limiting this if even there's
a software you know tweak or a firmware
tweet that Apple has enabled on the
Qualcomm modem to prevent it from
reaching higher speeds no one's gonna
say that no one's gonna outright come
out and you know say yeah this is what
we're doing but at the moment it's still
curious of the Qualcomm modem that is
capable of doing more is not doing more
and it's that it doesn't have to do with
the infrastructure from verizon side so
it it seems like you would point it
towards Apple side but we'll have to see
if we hear anything more from this
that's very interesting I mean we know
that app or not Apple 18t throttles you
yeah a tornado unlimited data and if you
get over a few past 16 gigs at 16 gigs
yeah an eighteen t if you pass or no no
it gives you warning when you're at 16
gigs if you go over 22 gigs then it says
we're going to start throttling you on
your yeah I gotta which is basically not
having unlimited data it's on it's
unlimited data it's the unlimited plan
so I mean you could you could weigh your
verizon VS 18t but they're both
someone's throttling Lee somewhere it's
yeah pick your poison right that's what
you're saying pick your poison exactly
here's a story that I need to I must
follow up on we've butchered Apple
forever about this whole touch disease
situation where a multi touch
functionality or just touch
functionality on iphone 6s would stop
working and so this is according to
Apple a design defect specific now that
they've kind of acknowledged that
and with a new repair program for the
iphone 6 plus so this is to address
complaints about the manufacturing issue
there was basically a chip that would
get loose and would sometimes cause the
touch display to be unresponsive
specifically in the iphone 6 plus so
Apple describes it as multi-touch issues
what you can do under this repair
program which fine i'm glad that apple
has created this repair program but i
also i also think it's a little unfair
for for another reason but here you go
the repair program is Apple will fix the
affected 6 plus devices for a service
price of 149 okay they're gonna make
money off of their defective phones to a
certain degree i mean let's say okay how
about this yeah no matter what they're
gonna be making gobs money but they are
making money i'm not sure what the
margins are but okay so yes you're right
here's here's the thing that bothers me
though is a lot of these phones are out
of warranty and where people were being
turned down from getting them fixed so
there's plenty of people that had to
basically what is the best repair
program for iphones buy a new iphone
yeah exactly by the next iphone yeah we
even had callers who said that they were
told that they just had to buy a new
phone I remember we had a voice a voice
mail about that and I'm also curious
because they say this is specific to the
iphone 6 plus i had many people saying
it also affected their iphone 6 yeah i
can't speak to that but so i've heard it
from i'm pretty burial yep that's bad
I've heard it from both sides I just
think that there's a lot of people that
out of warranty already had to deal with
this I don't think it's fair if this is
see Apple team will repair this but they
aren't necessarily outright
acknowledging that it's a defect they're
just saying Oh some devices that may
exhibit this multi-touch issue here will
help you out but again when it's out of
warranty like if it's if they
acknowledged it was a defect they would
have to cover it but they're not they're
just saying oh it might affect you so
we'll offer you this plan to fix it if
it is affecting you not we outright
screwed up so we're going to make this a
free fries repair be interesting to see
if they change if you know if they
change their policy on this
say okay there was a problem and we'll
fix it for free but I don't think that's
gonna happen come on Apple step up baby
we spend lots of money on you yeah baby
won't step up baby shoe I gotta say
though when I when the old headphones is
so small but lazy and all crappy
headphones they used to sell always get
me torn out yeah wondering like one of
them would go out i would go there and
I'd say my headphones broken they would
always give me a free pair oh so that's
that's a positive everybody that's a
good Apple good Apple good out listen i
don't i don't understand when we read
news stories that aren't positive people
are like to you guys are just right
writing on apple's parade so far the
apple glasses that we saw earlier
awesome there's lots of good stuff dude
do you know how many apple products i
own it's like come on you hate up oh go
home go home all right love Apple thank
you sponsor our show that would be funny
they don't need us they don't need us
they don't need us at all a new report
here Apple we know about their whole
Apple TV platform I just wanted to throw
this in I forgot to add it into the show
PlayStation view arguably not arguably
in my mind the best TV streaming service
available right now unfortunately they
recently struck a deal where they are
losing some via comm channels like
comedy central mmm TV I don't care about
comedy central's probably the biggest
hit how many yeah and there was one
other Viacom station that is getting
removed from the package which is a
bummer but PlayStation view the service
will now be available for people who own
an apple TV to watch on Apple TV so
funny enough right sling TV streaming
service and Sony's PlayStation view
service now both on the appletv Apple
where was yours where was yours we asked
you to do it we asked you to make it
happen and you didn't make it happen
shame you watch Game of Thrones my bell
shame shame yeah yeah we got nobody find
the shame Bell will bring it back um
while you look for that I'm going to
talk about Apple and also their content
acquisitions or original programming
that they're looking for the
through the apple TV now Apple has shown
that they're willing to bid on some
projects at least if it benefits that
our ecosystem they have they did acquire
James Corden's carpool karaoke segment
again James Corden will not be in it but
they're going to basically take that
formula take that idea Apple music also
to complement that a series like a bio
series called vital signs featuring like
it's kind of like a biopic of dr. Dre
that is supposed to have some
interesting stuff and then we've also
heard of planet of the apps this is kind
of like a contest show that is still in
development in the I know they're
talking to developers so I know a few
developers that have said oh I applied
for it I'm in the running so that is
still happening but those are really the
only big three content pieces but the
question that I have to say is we know
that content is king Apple knows that
content is king but they don't have
enough exclusive things to make people
just want to buy an Apple TV and I think
that that's there one of the things that
they've missed on there's no streaming
TV service they have they are sitting on
billions and billions of dollars but
guess who's investing in all of this
original content of programming that we
are going to see Netflix and Amazon you
still don't have a Netflix your G but do
you want to do you want me to shame an
apple TV right now please ok shame shame
shame I can't show this TV screen by the
way ok she just shame shame shame on you
Apple shame the Sapa was in a bidding
actually talked to Chris Rock
specifically for a potentially getting
some comedy specials with them but Apple
ended up not at least bidding or coming
to agreements with them guess who did
Who am without netflix netflix a to show
comedy the greatest comedian in the
world to right now that's a that's a big
big get a to network to episode or two
comedy special deal reportedly at 40
million dollars Chris Rock exclusive to
Netflix yeah I'm gonna watch that it's
gonna be awesome like
this is this is the type of stuff we're
talking about now Apple at least was
able to secure early rights on itunes to
show off Michael Moore's Trump land
documentary so you'll you'll see that
early but again netflix is killing it
with exclusive content like yeah you
based on what's on netflix versus what's
on TV i hear people talking more about
Netflix shows and I hear them timeout TV
shows these days oh yeah yeah right far
by far yeah and unless it's like walking
debtors yeah and there are a few don't
get me wrong there are a few key shows
that are still worth watching on TV but
I just feel like things have shifted now
where you're not out of the conversation
if you're not watching TV anymore
exactly you're you're in eighty percent
of the conversations yeah if you're just
on streaming services unless you're like
me and just watch golf all the time then
you know don't really have anything to
talk to anyone about well how about uh
what's the latest golf golf uh turning
Tiger Woods coming back he's coming
valued weeks baby you've said that they
have said that for like three years I
know I went to the tournament Napa the
other day he was supposed to be there
and you didn't show it's wholly
upsetting oh like one of your I'm sure
because you know you go way back so you
love tiger during his prime oh yeah you
know you like the prime Tiger vs. post
tiger I followed Phil Mickelson or oh
that was pretty incredible yeah that's
that's that's awesome that's like yeah
falling legends around it's kind of like
the Golem legend a living legend legend
Terry it's like working with you Beecham
a living legend legend alright so
anyways Apple still kind of really
behind from the Content standpoint which
is frustrating to me because I always
felt they could have gotten ahead of
that a lot earlier but they just didn't
yeah so I'm not gonna play you know no
more we already did our shame on Apple
TV for shame let's go on to some happy
news Nintendo's Super Mario run yeah
one-handed one thumb version of mario
that you will be able to play on your
iOS device for iphone and ipad that has
given been given an official date of
december the 15th oh you can my alarm
you can get a free version of the game
but if you really want to unlock all the
features it's going to cost you
999 that's not bad that's not bad see I
flinch but I'm still gonna buy app cuz
it's an apple ii no smells like app like
I think the most well the most expensive
app I think I bought is like 499 maybe
okay the most expensive app I bought and
then I was really pissed about because
they made a cheaper version up later for
no apparent reason was I have a slingbox
at home and I think the original app was
like 30 or 40 bucks and then they
released like suspense they really take
a ten dollar one like three months I'm
like wait what why it's the same it's
the same app they just decided cut the
price down this makes no that is
frustrating man yeah dude dude hope i
hope he shot an email off or something
no i'm not like that just kind of like
it allows me to be like yeah that was
wrong that was wrong but ten dollar come
on this game have you seen this game is
there like Nina baby I did I pop a link
in there like me for you to see it there
love you can't tell me okay fine the
license oh here is awesome it is Mario

is a five-dollar game bro I don't know
I'm just I'm such a fan of Mario i am
hey five pay for it fine what if they
made it 15 bucks would you still pay you
it probably they just cuz my kids 20 you
would you would still buy that for 20 so
you're like no I don't know about time

accidents happen all right should we get
our voicemails let's do some voicemails
gets our voicemails y'all again if you
guys want to be a part of the show call
us at one eight hundred 61 62 63 eight
let us know what you're thinking about
let's talk let's go first call here we
go what's up beating phone this is aaron
hope from durham north carolina I just
calling i had a just a mention about the
dongle gate especially when it comes to
the lightning connection or the lack
thereof a lightning connection um just
wanted to say i have an iphone 6 amen
about a you know 2011 macbook pro and i
haven't clutched my own into my computer
in probably two years just because you
like I clouds right iCloud photos and
you know just all of those things are
already taking place uh you know in the
background so I just haven't had a need
to plug it into my computer at all so
but that's my comment thank you talk to
you guys later let the show peace thank
you for the call that's we we had to
show love to that because i know there's
plenty people that don't plug in their
um their phones yes you know i do
because i don't really trust I god I'm
like old sky will admit I'm old school
like I do wirelessly sync my phone
sometimes but I tend to be like oh yeah
once in a while I definitely plug it in
I plugged mine in last night exactly
because because i had like I took a ton
of music offer to make space and then I
wanted to put all that music back on and
it would have taken it taken or it's a
lot do it wirelessly so with the cable
it's like pretty fast exactly so see
there you go yeah that's why there you
go okay number two numero dos hi my name
is Josh I love listening to your show I
have a quick question I'm wondering if
Apple will ever have an AI that's
actually useful I've tried Siri every
time they come out with a new iOS and I
continue to think she's worthless do you
think they'll come out with an AI kind
of like Google's that actually works if
not are there other AIS that I can add
to my iphone 7 plus and use instead of
Siri thank you have a great one fight
haha come on don't tell me she's
worthless she's not worth she look she
is has been getting better every time
but still may not be up to your
standards I will say in the past there
were some other options for kind of like
assistance but really look series going
to be the most integrated with your
phone I would quite honestly say and
we've told people this before you just
use google the google app yeah yeah
because you can there is a google app
and you can do voice commands in its
again it won't be on the level of what
the pixel phone has which is by far the
sweetest virtual assistant AI i have
seen an experience on any phone it just
does stuff really well and it's only
going to get better it's even just year
one and i think it's some people like oh
it doesn't do that much different stuff
I think there's a lot of subtleties were
like wow this is the direction it is
heading so my advice would just be use
the google app and you know for voice
command stuff but really when i set
alarms or reminders which is really the
only thing I use my serie for ya music
see I don't even do it for that really
yeah I do it for like play this song or
or play little arms set timers play my
workout I asked your question scores
Raiders also you do you see then you use
her a lot I
I use it a lot actually yeah and it's
probably annoys people around me it's
all good but Google is like so
contextual like Julian oh man it's crazy
it'll answer with like context and
different things you didn't know and you
can follow up without reference by
saying an additional like an add-on
question a normal conversation yeah yeah
yeah that's what makes it that's what
what about this Cortana available a
knife I don't think it is I don't
believe so if I'm wrong someone can slap
me but I don't pretty sure it's not yeah
pretty sure it's not that's another good
one to court I'm cool yeah but if you
want to stay you know I'm thinking he's
talking about staying specifically with
the iphone just i would use Google's
Jojo again it's its own app it's not
integrated but it will probably do the
job pretty well for you yes and it does
all the things that Siri does too it'll
it'll set alarms and all that stuff
reminders true dad so cool okay and
that's all that's all we got today okay
again just one more last time call us 1
800 61 62 63 8 that is going to be our
