the best android tablets out there but
is it the best I'm xiomara Blanca for
cnet let's take a closer look in
partnership with Google HTC manufactures
the Nexus 9 and it looks rather average
I was underwhelmed by its design though
it's still a solid piece of hardware
with a premium feel it has a pair of
front facing speakers headphone jack on
the top edge and microUSB port on the
bottom the power button and volume rock
around the top right corner are almost
flushed to the tablets edge and are
tricky to find without looking though
it's slightly lighter than the ipad air
2 it's noticeably girthier its rounded
edges make it comfortable to hold and
the smooth matte finish on the back
feels good against your fingertips while
providing a soft grip it houses a speedy
NVIDIA Tegra k1 system-on-chip with 2
gigabytes of RAM and 16 gigabytes or 32
gigabytes of internal storage with no
expandable storage option the 8.9 inch
screen rocks at 2048 x 1536 pixel
resolution and HD video looks vividly
sharp with lifelike color however the
displays 4 by 3 aspect ratio adds to
letterboxing when watching widescreen
video it's the first tablet to run
Android lollipop 5.0 the revamped user
interface is draped in cool grays and
blues with trendy flat icons and a
stationary google search bar on the home
screens considering its speedy specs the
Nexus 9 delivers with fast performance
large games load within seconds and even
when many apps are open in the
background it chugs along unfazed I
encountered some apps and games that
consistently lag and crashed but it's
more likely because they're not
optimized for Android 5.8 the 8
megapixel rear camera is impressively
sharp though the native camera app is
rather bare bones and the 1.6 megapixel
front-facing shooter is a little fuzzy
in focus yet produces well exposed
photos with realistic colors the tablet
starts at 399 for a 16 gigabyte model
and is available in 4G LTE capable
versions ultimately determining the best
tablet
depends on your unique needs and there
isn't a one-size-fits-all slate with
that said those looking for premium pure
Android tablet should definitely put the
Nexus 9 at the top of their list so
check out my full review for more
information I'm xiomara Blanco and this
has been a first look at the google
nexus 9 tablet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
