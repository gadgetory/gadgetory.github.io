Alfred Inge and I'm Scott Stein the
much-hyped magically beone augmented
reality headset is finally slated to
arrive this summer
according to tape demos so that's not
really much this headset appears to
provide more realistic AR images than a
lot of the current consumer tech but we
still don't know a lot about price power
consumption and haven't tested it
ourselves so Scott you know a lot about
AR and VR is this something that we
should be excited about or still pretty
skeptical because we haven't really seen
much about it
well definitely skeptical because we
haven't seen much about it but there
aren't a lot of head-mounted what they
call mixed reality headsets microsoft
hololens is really one of the only ones
out there along with meta and a couple
of other random players so what this is
trying for something new and in that
sense they're about to be some growing
pains right so I don't think any of this
territories is fleshed out as VR which
already is not selling particularly well
and this is you know you've got a are on
your phones but this stuff wants to
project it in three dimensions this
thing they've revealed a few extra specs
like the fact that as an nvidia tegra x2
processor if you follow chips and this
was the first on-camera demo that anyone
had seen but it looked not unlike what
you've seen with microsoft hololens
which has been out there for a while
something kind of ghostly and floating
and appearing in your space a lot of
people thought that seemed pretty
disappointing because you've seen a lot
of videos and captures of things on your
phone that already looked like that so
alfred would you spend like something
like 500 spend and who would you know
but but like when you see videos of this
is this something that you think that
you could get into really like his
comparison to the hololens like made a
lot of sense for me and i tried on the
hololens and i really didn't like it
that much like for me I feel like it
makes the most sense to just do
something with your phone at least when
it comes with something like mixed
reality like I I feel like I'd rather
just you have either have a full-on VR
headset or just use my phone yeah
next up Apple and Microsoft both
announced new hardware this week Apple
with a lightly updated MacBook Pro and
Microsoft with the all-new
inch surface go tablet for anybody
paying attention these two reveals seem
to reinforce the narrative that Apple
has become a little bit too bland
with its hardware updates and Microsoft
a little bit more innovative and daring
would you guys agree okay I don't see
how its innovative and daring on
Microsoft's and but I would say it's
more like the thing that I would want in
the sense that I've wanted an iPad to
finally be a full computer for a while
and I don't want to have to also carry
around a MacBook and these changes that
the MacBook Pro introduced none of them
are the things I was dreaming of but
maybe if you're a pro user you want a
true tone or a quieter keyboard it's not
necessarily a more reliable keyboard
which is the thing people were
complaining about and there is actually
a repair program now to address that
those keys have been failing so no new
keyboard design really and nothing to
address the lower end area am i hearing
you guys correctly you don't want to
give Microsoft any credit for trying
something a little bit different I was
right I was excited about the surface go
in the sense that they finally made a
cheaper model and a cheaper version for
people that didn't want to shell out
like you know for the the surface pro
tablet or anything like that but I
didn't like the fact that you still have
to buy the keyboard and the stylus
separately which is like an additional
like what like 150 brings you in all
this like $700 I here's this cheaper
version cycle you got to pay more than
what you actually want haha last
speaking of getting credit for things
Elon Musk jumped into action to try
helping the soccer team stuck in a cave
in Thailand
offering a mini submarine the head of
the rescue mission deemed the sub
technologically sophisticated but quote
not practical good for him for trying
though yeah it's like when someone gives
you a gift for your birthday that's like
this weird like little robot thingy but
weird mini-sub right that I've also
tried and nobody's calling me a hero so
I don't really understand why you know
nobody's saying good on me for trying I
I sent my thoughts and prayers to them
so I don't
why I'm not getting all the credit for
helping save them I always have that
interesting mini-sub yes oh that's out
there thanks for the trash
if you want to read more about these
stories check us out on CNN I'm Ben Fox
Ruben I'm Alfred Inge I'm Scott Stein
thanks for listening all right welcome
back everybody thanks for joining us for
the grand return of the 359 podcast as
always so excited I'm trying to ramp up
the energy here actually energy for
Bryan it's the most amount of sleep I
got last night I got four whole hours of
sleep I'm feel good Mazel Tov I'm gonna
get in the chat I'm gonna dig out your
questions and comments so we can keep
the conversation going in the meantime
Scott why does everybody care about
magically one so much cuz I sure as hell
don't that is a super good question
I mean not always the last story but
magically didn't really get all that
much interest but you know for four
years now this thing has been building
up nothing but hype billions of dollars
in investment Google's been involved a
lot of big companies have invested and
partners like the NBA plus they've just
been you know talking this up for a long
time they're based in Florida so there's
a lot of mystery Florida a lot of
mystery around it but you know you're
right in that now I think years ago when
this type of stuff did not exist at all
it seemed magical and new now there's a
lot of stuff out there that's touching
on that territory hololens is years old
and also you have both ios and android
doing a lot of a are things which are
gimmicky but they're there for you to
look at all right but I agree with
Alfred's impression that if you already
have your phone and you get more value
from doing AR on your phone why would
you spend a ton more money to get this
like one headset you know like the
separate headset it really does have to
be cosmically better and even then
where's the content gonna come from yeah
when am I gonna use it I don't know I
don't see how this would fit into my
life but you know look at five to ten
years from now maybe I eat those words
and we're all living in a our world I
don't know I think all these companies
are trying to
solve all the meaning I think all of
them like I think Apple Microsoft Google
a lot of the big Facebook are all trying
to solve for this like potential future
from different directions but all
heading there like maybe some of them
are looking at the phone and saying o AR
and your phone and then we're gonna
slowly build towards something else or
maybe it's we work out the kinks on a
headset for like five years but yeah
what is you're using it for and when is
a huge question and it's a it's a big
problem and it's why VR has had a really
hard time getting anyone to really care
or buy it is that it's an extra piece of
tech no matter how interesting the demo
even is it's something extra you gotta
get and do which doesn't work with all
the other stuff necessarily already have
mmm I ran out of air their answer you
did good sometimes I like breathing
everything is good at the very end my
ran just all those times I don't and I
was like done with this this just in
Elon Musk just tweeted that he's going
to distribute oxygen masks actually
oxygen tanks to everybody in the United
States is that something he'd say that
way to help with help with people
breathing for people who like to breathe
he must he must be a fan over my work
here is done good job what it what good
on ask look we were talking about this
before the show do you one tech CEOs to
be loud and obnoxious and tweet all the
time and yell at people or do you want
them to be like a little bit more staid
and boring so and great that I guess we
have both so I think you have your
genres years and then you have your I
don't know other CEOs I don't like how
Musk
tries to directly target reporters which
he has done before but they're okay
right and they're filled with fake news
but you know some things where he does
try to engage with his like you know my
school lovers and you know talk on my
social medias yeah he's musketeer it's
like so it's some of it is
interesting and it certainly like
live-ins up things and makes him you
know presents him as the Tony Stark that
he wants to be um I think I want
something right in the middle it's just
like real human interaction where I
don't want friends that are like
withdrawn and just stayed and boring all
the time but I also don't want like
really over-the-top in-your-face friends
and we're always trying to say something
thirsty yeah got to calm down and
breathe I want to just write tech
billionaire can we get one of them yeah
what a Goldilocks tech billionaire I
want the porridge to be right in the
middle the little soft warm taste sure
right in the right in that spot okay
yeah do it do we have questions of
course we do let's go ahead and talk
about VRA our since we had already kind
of kicked this off with the magic leap
Mack Steph says would it be worth it to
get a rift for $200 or as any VR really
worth the money I think this is a
perfect opportunity to put Scott on the
spot yeah and just kind of give us the
the rundown energy are Scott called
which it's great it's Scott on what I've
seen it what's the current there the
current layout of the market what VR
where are people gonna put their money
best if they're interested in VR which
in itself is still very niche great
question I think of VR like a toy right
so game system or a toy or thing that
you say you're you get if you get like
enough use out of it it justifies the
purchase like I mean I had a Nintendo
GameCube a long time ago like if I hit I
still do
yeah like so I offered you want to go
play mailing yes
I'm with you so that's the thing is like
I had this like rule of in my mind this
rule like if there were ten great games
then I could justify the hardware
purchase depending on like it's the math
of like the cost of the individual
titles per the hardware it's the razor
and blade thing so I think um I think VR
is like that where you know $200 you
know you could see a handful of great
games you would get yeah it's worth it I
mean you want to try it out just know
that it's not the final step it's gonna
get overshadowed by other stuff in the
PC side of things I don't think it's
gonna
overshadowed that soon a lot of the
stuff that oculus is doing is mobile
like the next step beyond go is a full
six degree of freedom Santacruz headset
that I got to try that's not gonna be PC
base so I love the touch controller so
if you're talking about if it's being
packaged with those touch controllers in
the rift
I love the oculus apps store I don't
love all the oculus apps but it's kind
of the best software out there and the
best packaging of the software so you
like just kind of presentations it in
check so you like the rift content more
like their library of stuff newer than
the PlayStation I do because I feel that
Sony has done a pretty good job I think
for their unique first party apps the
PlayStation assortment is not as good as
their regular ps4 games are like the ps4
games are awesome I don't think the same
attention has been paid to psvr for
reasons that it's not as probably not as
worthwhile
they're good ports but also I don't like
the fact that on the you have to get a
pro to really get the most out of you
and PS VR as a graphic experience it was
all about value in price now it's great
if you don't have a PC but if you have a
PC and for the price that the rift is
dropping to I think you're probably
better off getting that not wild that
Facebook has oculus truthfully I just
feel like in the end I wanted that to be
its own platform aside from that because
I think there's a lot of social
ambitions that I don't really know where
all that's going it's okay I mean plus
the last generation of oculus social
updates aren't even hitting rift they're
skipping it so is that gonna be left in
the dust that's my long answer so it is
like in a weird territory because
Facebook is not really like a PC company
there are a mobile company so use it for
now get it on sale just don't you know
next year basically saying it's don't
yell at me in a year if like this all
just disappears but it could I feel like
VR is in a kind of a strange place right
now Scott its YouTube they're gonna yell
at you of course yell at me but I really
love the rift I
the rift touch controllers are the best
VR controllers absolutely that are out
there until knuckles if your knuckles
from Sonic not clea exactly sonic and
knuckles because vibes vibes and that
vive in valves upcoming hand motion
controllers I've never used those are
promising I'm just not wild about the
steam VR landscape quite as much I think
it definitely offers a tremendous
breadth of stuff but you have to hunt
around for things a little more I like
the video game console package of apps
you get on good let's look sorry it was
a long answer no no you know a lot about
this stuff but let's let's get to the
next question
okay so let's jump in hang on I can't
tell what the hell I'm doing anymore
okay let's talk about these surnames so
we've got the surface go then there was
the oculus go before we have Pokemon go
Android go Amazon go surface Go Go Daddy
oh thank you sir enjoy for pointing out
that Go Daddy was always the og what the
hell is with this naming convention
going on these days why does everybody
want you to lean on places to go it's
just easy
remember the doug liman movie go know
about deep cut Scott yeah I mean that
goes all the way back that came ahead of
its time I'm sorry everybody everybody
steals naming conventions we all know
that all the pay's knows are those are
those are like the least creative names
ever the same go CS go
yeah but the ghost it for like global
Offensive so it's not it's a what is the
hot turn if they area they're these
terms that just come flying through and
the impression goes yeah thing now so
the impression that I get is is that all
the tech companies hire the exact same
marketing agency it's this really cool
guy would slicked back hair he has an
amazing pitch and he's like guys yo use
gum just use go you little sell it comes
with a stop sign right people don't like
this no people of like stock but they
like Don Draper he's like we're always
trying to stop we're in motion right go
and they're like that's exactly it
we're going we're going the Paracel
memories yeah I think it I do think it's
a play for mobile to that like everyone
wants to be mobile so things that are
not necessarily mobile like a surface
you know Microsoft doesn't really have a
phone there that you know not anymore
right so this can seem mobile so I think
same thing with oculus a fee are always
mobile though it was it was this is the
surface that you'll be able to travel
with as opposed to these other ones the
one the home one is like what what do
you mean like this one is the go version
let's go yeah they really want you to
like be encouraged to travel freely and
then there's this new like search engine
website like goggle or something like
that so yeah go go what you did there I
saw it I loved it let's take a question
from from livestream for the first time
cuz I'm trying to branch out here
well-read twitch we don't know I'm
getting there I'm getting there come on
goggle plugs from Rita love it how about
other computer eyewear what else can we
see coming in the form of wearable PC
snapchat spectacles you know I never fit
my glasses um apparently snaps are
working on some AR thing so what can we
expect I would say these things always
come in waves so when you see something
emerge it's like the early days of
smartwatches
I think everybody's working on something
like this and it's only a matter of time
before the multi-year project everyone's
working on emerges that's just and um
it's just a gut feeling I have based on
it nothing really but the rumors of
Apple having an AR headset Google has
dabbled in this before with Google glass
but now with their continuing movement
in AR could they eventually get back in
this or partner with a company totally
likely Samsung who you know they have
ambitions in every electronic space and
like to create show pieces especially
and also developing screens and OLED and
interest
ways that seems tailor-made for them at
some point did you mention Apple yet
because I feel like Apple is an apple at
the front yeah and sharra had written
that story about the the you know the
reports of a 20/20 headset Apple is
really building a lot of it's a Ark it's
tough to really build from the inside
out I wrote about that Percy net a lot
of the tools that you would need in a
headset like multiplayer object
recognition and things like that so I
think that you and Microsoft supposed to
have a new version of hololens and
Microsoft is still pursuing headset like
things with their VR for PCs in a lot of
ways those those um camera equipped six
degree of freedom headsets that are out
there from partners are using hololens
like tech and they're supposed to
eventually blend there are also a lot of
random players like meta is a maker of
another headset that's been out there
and they could develop something we also
might start seeing a lot of like saris a
long answer you've got does you want to
hear more but also you stick your breads
like Rick this technique a death listen
let's go get your phone into there's
gonna be like the equivalent of those
you know things you see those VR
headsets at Target all right I'm gonna
force you into a lightning round
let's do lightning round questions and
then call it a day okay
let's talk about the old muskie key
seaman real quick
Matthew dad sure wants to know was the
mini-sub just a publicity stunt and
following up for that will must be able
to actually fix Flint and I want to
branch off of that and ask what the hell
is musk gonna do next I don't think that
it was a publicity it's not I mean a lot
of people like to call him out on that
is like oh they like he just want a
publicity Edelen like was riding on the
coattails of you know this this whole
thing with the soccer team in Thailand
it almost doesn't need publicity dude
like this guy like he can tweet out that
he wants a cyborg dragon and like
everyone's writing about that like the
guy doesn't need publicity I think he
was generally like trying to help was it
actually helpful it was a completely
useless yes um you know what I
I thought it was pretty thirsty but you
make a very good point
yeah he's nine make simplicity yo he
comes up he comes up with a boring
company flamethrower and people have
been writing about it for my point is
like I think that like in this scenario
though it makes no sense for him to like
just like throw himself in there's like
and then like he shows these videos like
we're testing out this submarine in this
like swimming pool like check out these
divers that we have and it's just like
why are you doing this like this doesn't
help at all dude like you're not this is
it's really just like check out these
cool thing I'm doing on the side by the
way oh it didn't help I mean whatever
equal if it did because a lot of those
soccer team kids were very bad swimmers
and thank God they all got out but I
will say in laning ran like the the
ability were in an era okay where let's
just say in general to pronounce things
all of a sudden if you have power can
generate a lot of interest a lot of
activity all across different channels
that's a messy situation
everywhere in lots of different ways so
if you're in a position of great power
like he is enthusiasm might be there but
I'd rather some thought go into you know
just have it be as well-planned and
executed as possible you know to to
broadcast attention it's just like where
do things end up going obviously
Flintshire that's great would love to
have and I'll have that happen just want
to see that happen wait wait this is
your lightning round answer alright
we're going to the next Oslo III I don't
know vex lightning rod I just want to
point out we do have questions on Twitch
oh we do yeah nice one asking if there's
ever gonna be a new counter-strike there
probably will be it will probably take a
while there was like a long gap between
the original counter-strike and like
csgo and even between that there was
like and it was like counter-strike
source that like not that many people
played way to be on brand twitch asker
sure they'll make one yeah there's
probably gonna do counter-strike there's
a new everything the twitch twitch your
you're allowed to ask questions that
don't directly relate i don't nothing
about the next counter-strike yeah but
when is counter-strike brawl coming out
everything against everything gets
remade yeah sooner or later by fans or
whatever else like a.m. came back as
like a developer project I'm still
waiting for vine to come back you can
just mark we all take second videos on
your Brian are we good or more questions
let's take one more for the road this
one's a little off-topic but I actually
thought this is really good and we could
provide some really fantastic advice Mac
Steph on YouTube wants to know is there
any foolproof way to easily tell if
something is refurbished or if it's
actually legit or just some kind of
bizarre marketing tool how tell if
something is officially refurbished or
if it's just you know secondhand trash
it's usually the packaging isn't it I
mean like it's pretty hard to
remanufacture the packaging especially
if you're getting it off of like an
off-brand site if you're buying a mini
sub from Thailand oh I'm pretty sure
it's unused it's not technically it's
not new but like it's never been used so
it might be refurbished on around also
just one other thing is you just buy
directly from the manufacturer that's
absent considering and they will always
tell you if it is or isn't refurbished
yeah you usually end up paying more but
then you know that it's new yeah I think
the answer is to go to as clear a source
as possible for the refurbished stuff I
mean I'm sure there are ways that I'm
not aware of to be able to check some of
that stuff out I think it's really tough
just know that the person who's
promising it is as close to the actual
source mmm cool so that's it we are out
of time but we are resuming our
regularly scheduled programming starting
