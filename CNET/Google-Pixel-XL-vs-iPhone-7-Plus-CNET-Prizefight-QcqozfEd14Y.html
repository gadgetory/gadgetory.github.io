have risen and fallen recipes note seven
and this is a battle between two big
boys it's a prize five punch-out between
the Google pixel XL and the iPhone 7
plus this prize fight will be decided by
your committee of One Ring Leon ding
dong let's get it on round one is
designed Google brings our first ever
phone made by Google with the help of
HTC but this is their design that has a
strong resemblance to the iPhone now the
pixel XL goes for a slightly
wedge-shaped design that's thicker at
the top and thinner at the bottom but
that means no camera bump its glassy
back places the fingerprint sensor there
and I'm a fan it weighs 20 grams lighter
and it's actually easier to hold in one
hand compared to the iPhone 7 oh yeah it
also brings a 5.5 inch quad HD AMOLED
display with a stellar 534 pixels per
inch Apple's iPhone 7 plus reminds you
of the past two iPhones before it
antenna lines are gone the home button
is still the fingerprint sensor the
overall look and feel is the same it's
not bad it's just what it is you'll
still get the camera bump this time it's
a dual lens one its LCD display trail
significantly with 401 pixels per inch
but it was rated the most color actor
display that's ever been tested on a
mobile device and that's a feat now
there's no clear winner here this just
isn't as easy as it used to be and I'm
calling this round a tie even if you
don't want to hear that next round is
features the pixel XL may not be
waterproof and it doesn't have a
removable battery or memory card
expansion like its other Android
brethren but it does have the Google
assistant it's conversational it's
faster it's smarter and surprise is
still not perfect but it's hands down
the best AI on any phone to date and
it's better than anything sear you can
do right now its rear fingerprint sensor
might feel for into iPhone users but
it's in a natural place
oh yeah the pixel has a headphone jack
the iPhone doesn't this isn't the most
feature-rich phone right now but it's
the best pure Android phone we've seen
and nougat is the best representation of
Android for someone who's curious about
seeing what's on the other
side of the fence now the iPhone 7 plus
is the first truly waterproof iPhone
with an ip67 rating it survives in a
meter of water for 30 minutes and guess
what the pixel doesn't the haptic home
button felt weird at first but now I
like it 3d touch just hasn't come
together like we hoped it would and you
can do similar things with a long press
on Android now it also has stereo
speakers when you use it horizontally
the pixel doesn't it's subtle but the
iPhone 7 also has the best haptic engine
with different vibrations and intensity
depending on how you're using your phone
and you can never underestimate the
power of the ecosystem the App Store and
iTunes have real staying power and even
apples messages app has surpassed the
three or four different Google messaging
platforms that exist on a pixel now
Apple normally gets destroyed by Android
phones when it comes to features the
pixel has the best AI but it needs just
a little more so we're giving the edge
to Apple round 3 is camera the iPhone
has long held the reputation of being
one of the best if not the best
smartphone camera but that's about to
change
enter the Google pixel now rated the
best camera on a mobile device ever for
both the pixel and pixel X L by DX o
mark CNET put these two cameras to the
test and the proof was in the pudding
richer colors more image details and
warmer natural tones were consistent for
the pixel camera if we're talking low
light images the pics will perform
better there as well again with more
detail and depth now the iPhone 7s dual
camera lens gets major props for its 2x
zoom and its portrait mode performs
significantly better than the pixels
blur mode but 90% of your pictures
aren't going to be bouquets style and
less you're really into that now Apple
uses optimal image stabilization and
Google uses electronic image
stabilization oh is excels for still
imagery in low light while E is excels
for video and the Google pixel already
outperforms the iPhone 7 that is using
oh is so don't be surprised anymore
the Google pixel XL is the best camera
on a mobile device the final round is
for
both of these phones are snappy
performers I haven't experienced the lag
or degradation that I've seen on other
Android phones but let's get the specs
out of the way the pixel XL brings a
quad-core Snapdragon 820 one with four
gigs of RAM the iPhone 7 brings a
quad-core a10 processor with three gigs
ram reports have shown 32 gig capacity
iPhone 7s write significantly slower to
memory compared to the higher capacities
now in Geekbench benchmarks the iPhone 7
plus blue the Google pixel out of the
water but in real world use there's only
not a major difference both of these
guys again are snappy now the 3d ice
storm unlimited graphics test the iPhone
7 plus once again I'll perform the pixel
as well now the pixel XL has a larger
battery at 3450 milliampere hours versus
the iPhone 7 plus is 2900 there's a lot
of different tests out there but our
video playback tests show that the pixel
XL ads out the iPhone 7 plus 13 hours
and 49 minutes to 12 hours and 4 minutes
what helps the pixel has a quick charge
feature that gets you seven hours of
juice in just 15 minutes
the iPhone does not now it's still
closed here but I lean on battery life
over benchmarks and I'm giving this
round to the pixel XL so let's tally the
score here in round one we had a tie the
iPhone was the winner with features the
pixel XL dominated with its camera and
the pixel XL took the final round for
performance so you do the math based on
these specific categories the pixel XL
takes this price by by around but barely
don't take this as an L Apple fans
unless you wanted this to end in a tie
it really could go either way and
depending on what you're looking for I
call this a pretty even battle and as
always it comes down to the ecosystem
but is either phone really good enough
to make you switch sides yet see that's
for you to decide i'm brian tom thanks
for watching we'll catch you all next
time for another prizefight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
