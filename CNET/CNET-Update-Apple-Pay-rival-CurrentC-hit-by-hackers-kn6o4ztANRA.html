issues with the currency app and HP
creates a whole new type of computer I'm
Bridget Carey and this is your scene at
updates the controversial currency
mobile payment app has achieved a
remarkable feat it's been hacked even
before it fully launched early testers
and anyone who signed up to get alerts
about the service have been notified
that their email addresses have been
stolen by hackers
the currency app is supposed to launch
next year as a rival to Apple pay and
Google Wallet and it's stirring up
resentment toward the retailers that are
supporting it instead of the end of seat
technology that's used by Apple pay and
Google Wallet you see unlike Apple pay
this app requires customers to scan a QR
code at checkout it collects data on
your shopping habits and there are
doubts about how safe it really is the
app is a product of mcx and that's
supported by a group of more than 50
retailers led by wal-mart mcx will not
say what personal information it
collects from users and it also has not
been open in addressing some security
criticisms such as why early testers of
the app need to provide a Social
Security number and driver's license
number which is something referenced on
the user support page now while this
drama plays out there are other payment
technology innovations popping up take
for instance point it's a new type of
payment terminal that small business
owners can use to scan your credit card
or use NFC tap to pay this dual screen
system was cooked up by the creator of
Google Wallet it accepts the more secure
chip and pin cards but the point looks
completely boring compared to a new
computer designed by Hewlett Packard
check out the sprout it's a Windows 8
desktop computer that has a projector
and cameras hooked onto the top of the
monitor the projector beams down images
to a touch sensitive pad below and it
also has a 3d camera so it can scan 3d
models of objects the sprout hit stores
November 9 to 4 and $1,900 this is for
creative
because HP wants you to take that object
you scan and send it to a 3d printer in
fact they're making their own massive 3d
printer it's called the multi jet fusion
but it won't become available until 2016
now if you have iOS 8 there's a new app
that's more fun than a 3d printer you
can finally send your friends emojis
that look like you the makers of bit
strips
you know those popular cartoons that are
all over Facebook they've put the
cartoon into an iOS keyboard app it's
called bitmoji you create a character
that looks like you and it creates emoji
cartoons in your likeness
you can insert them in text and in chat
apps that your tech news update and you
can always find more at C net comm from
our studios in New York I'm Bridget
