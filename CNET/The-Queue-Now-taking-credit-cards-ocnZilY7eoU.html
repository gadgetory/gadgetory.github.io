to you and Barbie gets like totally
connected get ready it's the cue hey
there what's going on in rich camaro
with citv and you have found your way
into the queue congratulations now on to
our must click moment some food to
thought for the next time you stay in a
hotel room report a friend of mine sent
along a clip of her undercover
investigation she told housekeeping she
was locked out of rooms that weren't
hers and they just let her in six
different times no questions asked now
if you're like me you travel with lots
of expensive gadgets so the lesson here
use that in room safe and this brings us
to our question of the day do you secure
gadgets in your hotel room check out
blog sina TV com for my answer and where
you can add yours a new way to give it
search credit card you got it a company
called secure give installing credit
card donation kiosks in churches across
the country the system consisting of a
touchscreen monitor a credit card reader
pin pad and printer donors can
contribute anonymously or get a
tax-deductible receipt for this on-ramp

supply a broadband net connection
American greeting is launching what I
believe to be the next big thing ecards
their email have gone a bit boring and
it's tough to cut through that inbox
clutter but mobile ecards now that'll
get your attention imagine your
recipients delight when while sipping a
grande nonfat mocha half-caf latte at
Starbucks their phone lights up with the
text click on it and up pops an animated
greeting for their birthday or just
because the service is carrier
independent the secret a one-time
compatibility text tells American
Greetings just how to send through that
II car an animated image or a link to a
mobile web page the service is free to
American Greetings com subscribers while
it's in beta moving through the cube are
be going virtual barbie girl is a
combination doll and mp3 player hoping
to capitalize on the popular
the webkinz trend this is where regular
stuffed animals are linked to a virtual
world barbie girl comes with a key to
unlock Barbie Girls calm where kids can
hang out and buy various accessories for
their doll the tech toy retails for
about 60 bucks finally the beta why buy
anything these days when you can rent
games books and even dogs have gotten
the netflix treatment now text books
flicks does the same for colleges best
friends the site's goal to one up buying
used textbook flicks says renting can
save up to sixty percent just search
from their selection of over 2 million
textbooks and pay a one-time rental fee
books are shipped in one to two days and
you have to return them at the end of
the semester they even supply a prepaid
shipping label I guess this does differ
a little bit from Netflix because what
they're sending you you're actually
using and no word on the website whether
you can highlight in your rented text
consider yourself all cued up I'm rich
