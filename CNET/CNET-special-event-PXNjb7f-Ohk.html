totally great my name is Paul Sloane
we're trying to start doing these events
sorta regularly so it's really great to
see a good turnout and thanks so much to
George Zachary dave McClure newval raava
cons um George's had a particularly good
day his company he's involved in
invested in millennial media what public
today so we'll get to that um the Thea
two billion dollar two billion dollars
up George George is buying for all of us
tonight nineteen ninety-nine ninety-nine
percent what was the game anyway um so
it's just a great time want to talk
about startup funding in general it's
just companies you know we hear this
over and over really cheap to start a
company these days lots of angel
investors especially given all the newly
rich from google soon-to-be Facebook and
everywhere else and lots of accelerator
funds like mr. McClory too many there's
a bubble in accelerators you it's all
over valuable oh I'm sorry this thing on
so so it's a great time over all the
same time companies going public
Facebook about to go public which I
assume you guys can all talk about but
what that'll mean to startup world so
let's just start off by asking a like
you each to answer whether this is a
good time to start a company oh yeah
hell yeah it's a great time to be an
entrepreneur it might be a good time to
be an investor
George I totally agree with Dave right
now there's a plenty of capital
available everything I see says that the
odds are tilted in favor of the
entrepreneur as a category but remember
there's a ton of companies getting
started very few of them produce the
humongous hits but there will be a big
chunk of them that produce pretty good
hits so I think I think it's a fantastic
time to be an entrepreneur if you have a
really great idea and if you're
relentless and won't give up that's the
key part yeah I'm not I'm not as sure
about it I mean I think it's an enormous
amount of opportunity out there it says
I think Marc Andreessen famous they said
software is eating the world so all
kinds of industries that before we're
not addressable by software now under
attack from web companies that was in
valley a fantastic asset yeah so I think
that part of it is absolutely true are
you playing games over here Dave I'm
actually trying to Like Tweet and
promote your stuff oh good good kid give
me live tweeting go father when I was
talking to him out there play the hash
do I do cnet startup we're broadcasting
live plea to please tweet vociferously
there you go sorry no problem and I
think it's a lot cheaper to start a
company these days which is also great
but I and I think that's a permanent
feature of landscape that's not going
away it's going to continue to get
cheaper the issues are that there are
way too many companies attacking every
space so it's highly competitive and
that may not change either and it's
impossible to recruit so basically if
you are starting a company I would
encourage people to be a lot more
thoughtful about it make sure you're
ready make sure you have an incredibly
good team don't raise money unless
you're going for the gold and you're in
for ten years and you're building you're
trying to build a gigantic company and
realize the failure rate has gone from
two and three to like nine and ten so
you just have to be much more
comfortable if this is we become more
like a hollywood-type industry where a
few bands and a few movies or winner
take all so that's why I'm not I'm not
unequivocally saying this is the best
time ever to start a company so you just
said one it's the best time ever to
start don't most good companies come in
bad times though in look at the talents
crunch now and
neers hard to get I do i do think that
the best companies really grow
consolidate share and take over their
markets generally in bad time I think
the best returns come from shitty times
necessarily invest fair enough that may
be a good as companies happen on a
regular basis regardless of rest of
market like the financing market is not
correlated with entrepreneurial
innovation you know it might be
correlated with a lot more coming
to the market so you know the people who
really have passion and really have
great ideas are probably somewhat
constant and you might have a lot more
crap in there with it during like big
market times and less of that when
there's low market times but you know
there's entrepreneurs everywhere the one
the one part about a bad economy and a
tougher financing market is it's harder
for your competitors to get funded a lot
of times people think oh the goal is to
try to get the money and no it's the
goal is to try to beat your competitors
not just to the money but to the people
so you know that that makes a little bit
easier in tough markets because the
relentless founder who says I will not
give up and I will win I've got a really
good innovative idea they tend to stick
out and shine through a little bit more
easily in the bad times so what do you
guys look for and if a welcome to answer
that one first what do you guys what are
you looking for since there's so many so
many companies out there these days and
you all are looking for slightly
different things yeah personally I like
to see technology businesses so the
value is built in technology and a lot
of the innovation layer that's going on
today is at the design layer in the
application stack which is perfectly
valid it's fine but I got in this
business I love technology so I love to
see companies that are doing hard things
and who have entrepreneurs and founders
who are well suited matched doing those
hard things and hopefully it is or can
be a big market so it's kind of to
permeate the intersection of those i
would say we're probably pretty
different than most other traditional VC
focus so we're not necessarily looking
at big market opportunities we don't
necessarily choir IP we're mainly
looking for smart people as evidenced by
great products so usually our filter is
what have you built
and so by evaluating products I like to
say product is a great mirror to the
soul of the team and so looking at
product will tell you kind of what can
they build what do they envision even if
it's shitty right now and give them some
insight that's where there were in the
future we like stuff that's got simple
revenue models so we're not typically
going for a growth we're going more for
customer problem framework we still do
some things that are growth and some
things that are you know more fantastic
and wild but you know right now kind of
looking a lot at education related stuff
apps for kids 0 to 10 and moms and
families which we think is a big market
and wildly underserved most everything
we're doing is cap efficient on the
building side and hopefully capital
efficient on customer acquisition side
strong emphasis on online platform so
Google for search facebook and twitter
for social Android and Apple for mobile
early YouTube and video sorry I'm
tweeting here so yeah I mean like
there's been the sea change and kind of
the ability to do customer acquisition
online in the last five years that's
really just monstrous and frankly I
don't think most investors have really
understood that or taking advantage of
that uh you know my answer has changed
over the last year and I think the most
important reason why it's changes this
might sound cliche are weird but I I
remember the day that Steve Jobs died
and I said what the am I doing with my
life after I have to TM and a loyalty I
said like when I was young I really
wanted to change the world I want to do
cool stuff and on that day I basically
said I'm not doing anything unless I
think the founders want to change the
world and they're compelled
psychologically to change the world and
I also think it's a good investment
strategy because it tends to produce
either big or bust and that's the
business than on it so it's pretty easy
these days to raise small amounts of
money right come on even easier next
week
we hope Jobs Act you're referring to and
then we'll get to that in a switch by
the way mr. Robert can I had a lot to do
with getting that on the right track
what about what about the series a
crunch people talk about that's your ear
field right you do a lot more series a
investing you said last week I talked to
Georgian that you said like in a 48 hour
span you got 70 emails from pitch refer
you and you have you had some off-site
and there was a whole bunch of emails
that had been sent from people you were
doing generally then like people started
panicking that they weren't you weren't
referring you know replying to them in a
nanosec yeah I was out last Monday and
Tuesday I wouldn't off site and at 70
emails 40 of them were pretty serious
summaries a lot of the more seed seeking
venture and I just can't I'm not smart
enough to consider 70 companies in one
day or two days I can't think of that
many so you know it took me throughout
the rest of the week in the weekend to
kind of sort it out but the interesting
thing was like the tension in the air is
definitely higher so I've gotten some
emails on Monday on Wednesday morning I
got emails hey i sent you an email
Monday wondering if you got the email
and there was a lot did you read my
email that I sent you no I forgot yeah
so that you know that in the reactions
that people are giving to me passing
have changed you to people say okay
thanks for replying i had a couple
people who just wrote back and said
great you are wrong and I'm going to
prove you wrong and like I'm not even
saying I'm right I'm just saying I'm not
ready to be an investor so there's like
I can feel the tension like people are
seeing that there's big money available
and people are feeling the gravitational
pull to the money so it's bringing out
kind of the core behavioral
characteristics of people and people
want money there's nothing wrong with
that and so yeah I think calling it a
series a crunch tries to create this
impression there's less series a capital
or there's something nefarious underfoot
really what's going on it's just there's
seed glut it's not seriously crunch
series a is relatively stable to where
it has
maybe slightly smaller slightly larger
depending where you are but there's just
a lot more seed and a lot of these seed
companies frankly should either be
merging joining other seed companies or
not raising capital there should be
small businesses that are sustainable
and grown to their own capital but I
think everyone is used the old model of
well first you do a seed then you go
raise a Series A and I'm not sure that
really applies to every company but you
know like an Angeles we get a hundred to
150 companies coming in every single day
hmm so you know we've got multiples of
his problem that we have to deal with
and we have even less data to go on
because these are much earlier companies
and out of that you know we can really
only pick and promote one or two like
that's it so I think you know seriously
crunch is a complete misnomer like you
know yes there are a lot more companies
getting funded its seed that are going
to get funded at series a that's always
been the case facto matter is there's
probably a lot more series a going on
now than there was three five ten years
ago well maybe not ten years ago 35
years ago and that's okay I mean like
there's a lot of that's going to be crap
and shouldn't be funded there's some
stuff which is okay and we'll find
alternative sources of capital either
bootstrap they'll have to charge and
make some money or they might find you
know seed or crowdfunding and then their
stuff that'll be great and like you know
goes to larger levels I think what a lot
of larger bc's are experiencing is holy
there's five times as much deal flow as
I ever saw before and I can't keep up
with it right and it is true that some
of that is going to hit the wall but the
entire industry is way way more
efficient than it was ten years ago like
we are not doing five million dollars
into stupid companies that are all like
you know shoved into the retail market
anymore maybe there's a little of that
but there's a lot more scientific
process okay we'll give you 50 K to try
out your idea prototype if you succeed
we'll give you 500 k to go to see if you
succeed without in getting distribution
or monetization then we'll give you the
five million dollar round so the entire
industry is way more efficient there's
lots more good deals to look at so for
large bc's who are whining about series
a crunch that's bull and they just need
to like follow up and sort of like
basically become more efficient and
become
more scalable because like it's great
for them it's great for them to look at
more opportunities and well I think the
new seed is actually 50k that's the
incubator yeah budget and then the new
series a is what we call seed today and
that should be around 300 to 500 k not
even a million like people think it is
and the new series they should be a
million bucks not three or five million
people like people used to so why why do
you think those particular numbers I
just feel like the costs have come down
enough that you can hit the the
milestones that used to be associated
with seed in series eight in those time
frames so you know I did a company in
1999 webspace opinions and it cost us
three to five million dollars to really
build our first products by Sun serve as
an Oracle run our own data center and
right around provision scripts and
versioning control it was just insane
right so today you can do that while
you're sitting at fire and startups or
YC or TechStars in 10 weeks 25 okay yeah
and so it's the same milestone so that's
what eight to me that you seen drowned
really is and just you know people being
what they are it's like sticky wages
right we haven't quite adjusted to the
idea yet that those are the new
checkpoints and if you defined it that
way if you said a series a is half a
million or a million dollars then there
is no series a scrunch there are lots of
series days being done right so why is
there mania in the air then I think you
know the public market has been on fire
since the fall people have forgotten
about kind of a major kind of macro
headwind issues which are getting worked
out but slowly those are two of the
reasons you know in the millennial IPO I
asked the bankers on Tuesday what a
level of oversubscription is the book
and I thought they would tell me the
book is the order book for shares and I
thought they would tell me like 5x and
they said it's 26 x and I never said
they're lying to me there's no way it's
26 x but it was dead they sold 10
million shares there's 260 million on
the book and I asked them why are why
and they said it's a hot market now what
they didn't tell me why shouldn't they
price it up if it's over 20 years ago
this is what I what I discovered through
the whole process is the investment
banks customers are not me the investor
or the start up there the mutual funds
right so they have the mutual funds will
buy will have relationships with the
banks
and they'll buy the good and the bad not
that bad but some of the bad so they're
basically given their customers some
advanced profit if you call it that and
today there was a bunch of griping at
the company at millenia like man we
could raise 260 million said 130 million
and get screwed or a stogie guys place
it's still absolutely no if you want to
look at it from macro down you would
just say that the global markets are
washed with liquidity because every
central bank in the world is now
printing huge amounts of money and that
money has nowhere to go and Silicon
Valley it seems like an efficient
allocator but can only handle a very
small amount market seeking growth right
when I chocolate ibly store relatively
speaking it looks a lot better than real
estate or financial services I mean if
you pump 5 billion dollars into seed
investing just think about how many
companies that fund oh wait that's
probably what we have today right it
just blows the whole market in two you
know five exercise it was before it was
interesting the questions the bankers
ask because I was in some of the road
shoes meetings they're like okay so
what's Eggman you're in like I'm
mobile mobile check it's like what do
you do you breathe air yes I get it
we're the second biggest global ad
network to Google ok done we're buying
ten percent person how old is that
company five years six years well
involve what do you say takes ten years
I think it takes ten years to build a
great company an average there's always
exceptions and outliers I mean you can
always find exception to anything but I
think it takes roughly from what I've
seen for your average good company not
bubble environment not writing something
ridiculous way if it takes five years to
even get to the point where you're
acquirable or you have a solid business
and then you usually have to stick it
out for another five years until you can
go public but i think it's you than that
but if you hit a good IPO window I don't
I'm you know I've got another rule thats
related which is from the moment like
you as an entrepreneur decide you wanna
start a company it always takes about a
year even though you think like I want
to start a company next month right
usually doesn't happen to buy the right
person there's false starts there's bad
ideas there's just a certain natural
latency to these things so give an
example if the number drops if it takes
five years to build a company so many
people enter the market and get so
competitive it takes ten years ago the
company again so I just think there's
a there's a natural pain threshold below
which you know too many people will show
up and it just gets arbitrage that's
capitalism you know I mean I have a
different opinion which i think you know
building a decent product takes one to
three years building a decent company
takes three to five years and I think
you know I'm not defining building a
great company as something that has to
be IP oval so yeah it's a different
definition I mean I'm talking like the
kinds that George did he wants to invest
you're just looking at change companies
that's the kind that our LP say either
invest in this or I won't find you
George would you like to be an investor
in twilio and wildfire for sure and both
of those companies are less than five
years old yeah and I certainly think
that both of them could be IPO
candidates obviously I'm pitching but I
think it'll be I think you got Dave how
many do you invest in a hundred 250 a
year okay and so how many will be I'm
hoping about 125 a year will look like
those that's why I invested 100 could be
clear when I thought I'm not gambling
i'm doing a quantitative model that
looks pretty predictable from my
perspective if i'm aiming for 50 to 250
million size exits and occasionally i'll
see you know north of 250 million dollar
stories and so do you look at companies
and think and try to sync already where
the eggs it might be no i mean i don't
actually i would say i didn't think it's
really thoughtful and smart about that
he's like great about sort of like you
know when he's thinking about the
investment he's already kind of like try
division like who needs this how does it
go and i will probably try and learn
more from him I think about who's the
customer right will someone use this
will someone pay for this and I almost
like smaller markets because there's
less competition like we can make money
on 25 to 50 million dollar exits that's
not where I really wanted to end up but
you know I think it's actually much
easier if let's say I've got two choices
right I'm building a product for women
right or I'm building a product for moms
25 to 35 in urban segments with one or
two kids who own a car right do you
think you can build a more targeted
product for this market or this market
how many women are 25 to 35 with two
kids in urban markets with a car well
still a
right so like if I can have less
competition and build a more targeted
product in this market and make money at
it well he'll like go build that product
it's easier right I don't need to build
a product for like 50 million women to
like you know go IPO I can build it very
reasonable you know I'm thinking as the
entrepreneur right now but also as the
investor and so actually I think what's
happened is the Internet has made us be
able to be more focused on varies niche
markets specific customers and we can
build better things because of that and
you know yes there will be large
companies and there are still like great
opportunities to find the next let's not
say Facebook but let's say I don't know
next mint com or mix you know other you
know niche product that is still a big
win but you know I think as an
entrepreneur like you I think we we
suffer from this disease in silicon
valley which is unless you're a
billion-dollar exit you're not a good
company right and there's plenty of
great companies that are doing
meaningful world changing things on a
smaller scale that will be 25 to 250
million dollars yeah the reason that
happens is this because the nature of
the venture market which is the only
liquidity really that makes a difference
to a venture fund as an IPO or a large
act that yeah the problem with as an
angel is even if you want to invest in a
smaller company you know that the most
common problem with companies is no
matter what they're going after the run
out of cash and they need more cash and
then they go to the VC the VC said no
it's not going to be big enough right so
you end up working backwards and even
the Angels end up only funding companies
at RVC scale and that is a fundamental
issue with the market and the way the
funding market is set up in the exit the
markets are set up and I think some of
those are starting be solved by
kickstarter and crowdfunding might help
with those and things of that nature but
i think the exit side of the market is
also an issue right so the problem what
i would have with like the smaller exit
is I need to find buyers right I can't
take these companies public and so in
order to get liquidity we have to find
buyers and I think that market will
change in the next two or five years as
well as yeah as you can party under
attack they're gonna be buying a lot
more of these smaller companies one
would hope yeah well I think like things
like second market will also provide
liquidity earlier
for those countries what do you think of
those platforms big fan so I'm an
investor in cap leg I'm a big fan of
angela's we're invested in a company
called trusted insight which is
basically doing angel list at one level
up for institutional investors there's
another reason why I think Barry is
awesome but i think you know markets got
to be more efficient and the only reason
we can't be bringing IPO size things
down is because right now there's too
many regulatory environments around
retail investors so i think the reason
you're seeing second market and other
things come about is if you exclude the
retail market investor and drop a lot of
the regulatory hassle that is in place
as a result of protecting the retail
investor there's a lot of other
alternative you know sources of capital
and buyers and so you know yeah second
markets going to exist for things that
are 50 200 million dollar market cap and
up and that's a lot of companies a lot
of companies are that size and not IPO
sighs and that provides greater capital
efficiency for the market so what about
crowdfunding what's it going to mean the
tough ones with to who yeah for people
trying to raise money who should use it
what kind of platforms might exist how
useful was a lot more crap well a lot of
a dependent how it's going to be
structured the if you read the bill that
actually passed was a Senate amended
version of the crowd funding bill it
leaves a lot to the rulemaking the SEC
and the SC's got at least nine months
possibly more to figure it out and so
it's going to be a lot of periods of
holding and comments and reviews and
conferencing and so on back and forth
and back and forth and it could work out
to the point where every soakin value
company may want to raise a couple 100 k
additional crowdfunding or it may be
poison pill and you can't touch it
because the liability and fraud
potential is too high and it degenerates
into nothing so it's anybody who tells
you exactly how it's going to work out
know something about what the SC is
going to do that I don't know tell me
more about angel I'm sorry going David
say isn't the current way that they were
drafting law that you have they're going
to say yes but it has requires
regulatory approval for every
Kickstarter or angel list or somebody
else that wants to write so it's
actually quite complex and probably over
the it's a little too over here but its
image NECC regulated platform
you're going to be a fun the fundraising
platforms are like lighter
broker-dealers we can think about them
they have to be registered the companies
that go on there have to have audited
financials there are specific liability
provisions around omissions and fraud
how do they try to enjoy before yes
there are exactly there are quite severe
liability provisions around the
disclosure of information there are
restrictions and the platform's a bit of
curate and market there are huge caps
and who can participate for how much and
the investors who come on require
training schedule oh wait for you to say
the first a lot in there let's Clea I
don't want to go into a regulatory I
mean like I think only five people in
the world I've actually read that bill
everybody has an opinion on it I have
there so few that's right well you know
that's that's just the case is all lot
of stuff is very complicated um tell us
about angel list how with as Dave said
more crap coming how with so many
investors out there how do you keep it
so that it's it's not overrun yeah you
know we curate quite heavily everything
gets a listing on angels but not
everything gets noticed right because it
just collapse into the into the noise so
we do highlight you know sort of the
best stuff and the community how that's
the best stuff through what it likes and
what its associated with we have
definitely raised the curation bar the
market itself moves very quickly so you
know two years ago a group on clone was
fundable then you know 22 months ago
became unfun double and then 20 months
ago a mobile app with no users was
fundable and then 18 months ago it
became unfun dab'll and so just the bar
in the entire market keeps moving up and
we raised the bar quite a bit to this
point where I think right now will
probably send out you know three to five
companies a week whereas there's a time
and we're sending out three a day and we
just think that you know we realized the
other day what investors look to us for
is actually keeping a high bar kind of
looking for more deals to George's point
they're looking for signal not noise
right they want another good deals yeah
exactly right i mean i would say easily
like I've said before Angeles is like
the most significant thing that's
happened in Silicon Valley in the last
five to ten years
for sure you know Paul Graham starting
YC or building the modern incubator
model I think was the first leg thing
well Josh I think did a lot of stuff
just got them did a lot of stuff refresh
or capital George has done a lot of
stuff with quick start right but
likewise he really changed the model
dramatically and I think Angeles is
changing the model dramatic because
incubators in the 90s we're like oh we
give you space and we take it's our idea
and we take forty percent I or 60 yeah
yeah yeah unfortunately from a in
entrepreneurs perspective what mistakes
do you see most do they ask for too much
money do they ask for not enough money
do they raise money to early on do they
go to the wrong incubator / accelerator
do they yes yes yes yes yes okay if the
list of mistakes is the list of mistakes
as well whose turn that off thank you
sorry go on the list makes is quite long
um where to start is the yeah it's a
long list so I actually know what they
do right it's funny because when these
guys were going through the criteria or
especially Dave wasn't like what he
wants to invest in I realized like you
know I don't have a formula or model
like that I probably looked at more
deals now than anybody on the planet
right we've got we've got 30,000 deals
on easels I've put in screen by eight
thousand of them the rest of skimmed and
you know there's no pattern matching
because there's just too much variance
each one is unique and so what ends up
happening is you you start looking for
two things one is surprised me give me
something exceptional excite me somehow
cuz you get very jaded very fast all
right exactly some truly something I
haven't seen before that was different
right and then the yeah that was a
basically a bunch of hackers who used to
be farmers in Croatia who had you know
we're hacking software for farmers was
incredible we saw it on Angeles Dave
found if the range of lifestyle this as
a seat here and now it's a hot deal that
just got done by a bunch of big
investors but anyway so so the first all
of that path everybody house farmers in
Croatia found on Angeles funded in
America what a country
but actually very but now there are
multiple forming yes it's crowded I see
that a farming community farmers at YC
who knew farming's hot so first I would
say the first thing is like surprised me
and the second thing is bringing it back
to what George was just saying is don't
screw up and most companies screw
something up and you can catch it in
even an angel this profile oh okay all
right that's what you screwed up okay
you've brought us some examples or get
used to screwing up fast and yeah I'll
just might not I'll give you like I can
go all day right okay I've got a better
questions tech company too many business
founders visionaries you know no product
you know just a product that you could
have built in the time it took you to
build the PowerPoint instead right you
know long a business yet too long a
business plan a tiny tiny market niche
market to be extra way bad location like
you're in tulsa oklahoma and we're
staying here right founders are clearly
not ready to go right they have no real
experience in space nor do they have
anything that shows that they have the
experience in the space a long cycle
time on product long cycle town bad
looking product bragging about minor
accomplishments right burying major
accomplishment can't invince anybody
else to join them okay yeah rambling
five-minute video it's this goes on and
on and on you know or that yet and then
they think they can fool us right so
they'll do like cumulative traction
graphs like come on you know we look at
say do these a day downloads and users
going up over time yeah linear rise that
mean yeah actually your attraction is
constant and not increasing alright but
companies that have good ideas good team
seemed promising how do they figure out
how much money to ask for or to look for
and when did it what kind of mistakes do
they make on that front because I hear
this all the time so I mean what you're
actually talking about is the pitch and
I think people yeah overemphasize the
importance of the pitch they obsess over
the picture that vision chart right yeah
it's like what's the most important
their attractions yeah so in my world
like its traction team you know market
products social proof that a down
somewhere at the bottom is the pitch
right and the if you have a great team
and you're building a great product and
you're going after something big you
will get notice you will get found even
some of the best profiles we pull out an
angel list they like you have like one
team members bio you have a slight
description you have one graph and you
have one link to the product and we're
like oh that's good all right and we
will email them to fill it out like come
back and complete it you know we'll get
you investors and all that stuff but you
don't the pitch is highly highly
overrated oh that I think we also see
the opposite thing is now there actually
is a lot of good resources and producing
a great pitch one of which I've done and
now we're seeing like wow a lot of
pitches are starting to look pretty good
but I'm not sure though they don't all
sound the same you go to one of these
demo days and they all get up and they
all have their practice formula hello we
are the that's not how you really talk
it's voice hello we're about to conquer
a huge market it's like I'm in dirt
attraction is overwhelming Spacely
sprockets yeah i think if YCS done one
thing wrong is they've shellacked all
the founders into being identical clones
who all present the same way and I
actually kind of want to hear the
rawness of the person because the
rawness of the person is the way that I
actually connect to them and flex an
insight versus you know someone who's
clearly never presented before basically
just like acting yeah and I can't
connect to the founder I kind of want to
hear it the good the bad there's the
direction here yeah acting so yeah
action um facebook when's it go in
public and what does it mean for
starters soon marks in China and Japan
doing the IPO book so what do you guess
my time I think well I don't think he's
in Shanghai visiting his with his
girlfriend's family about two weeks
before they're gonna go IPO so that's
probably not why he's in China kidding
it's just a few weeks away I i'm
guessing weeks to single month yeah i
think it's a late April or May and when
we were doing the millennial IPO the
bankers are the same as Facebook and
they said we got to get this done by the
end of March I said why the end of March
they said we got a lot of other stuff we
gather you hear me like wonder what
they're talking about very good well son
second market it's it's not trading
about a hundred million I think they
stopped it right no no no still trades
yeah then click cleared sixty thousand
shares last week yeah okay no it's still
trading and it's trading at about a
hundred billion and I think at this
point I heard it's loading the whole
market up no no it is I got the reports
today that's probably true it's still
training we can ask Barry probably can't
see anything but yeah I mean I think the
rest of the Republic you wanted to do
for everyone else does it increase the
mania does it increase the panic of the
email list evaluation probably cross the
pond my card how so that's such a bigger
fire but I just meant for other
companies the rest of the market feels
like Oh everything does it increase
valuation for companies that you didn't
uh no probably helps us with our
company's getting valuation probably
hurts us in terms of valuation for new
investments that we're doing it's good
for probably good for entrepreneurs I
know I mean they're gonna have a huge
currency to buy things with Randy's
gonna motivate other buyers but they're
not regular buyers there is a very anti
acquisition and when they do do
acquisitions or small acquisitions and
attention and they tend to screw the
investors in the acquisitions right they
will move most of what do you mean the
ball well they'll move most the smart
acquires all do this now for the Aqua
hires were you basically but i don't
think that smart acquire screwing
investors is actually smart okay like
the clever right the clever acquire
thing are moving most the acquisition
price into the package for the team and
the investors get their money back maybe
with interest if they're lucky yeah so
I've seen a lot of investors look at
Google and other folks are watching that
might work for individual angel
investors for those of us who are
basically producing hundreds of
companies on nao basis note for the
record that will not work thank you um I
think the smart investors not starting
to do multiples on the exits on the
notes to cover for that do we have a
microphone i want to get questions if
people have questions and also i want to
know if any other predictions I want to
know what you guys think the world looks
like a year from now or
is very very interesting well I think
International is way underrated that's
where the opportunities are on his
investor there are so many good
companies internationally that are
starving for good investors that that is
little that is Pinterest and Facebook I
don't know probably yeah yeah I heard
anyway from 11 to 16 million weeks last
month questions growing fast and just
announce yourself cream a que tu mp3 in
the next great crew in Silicon Valley
the web be through what do you guys see
is the next evolution of companies is
it's more efficient seeing less cost in
black swans do you see people being able
to build cash cows that also scale like
that inefficiently or is there something
else that that the people are building
or you think is the next model that I'll
avoid actually I think a lot of the IPO
constraints and twisting of this market
because there's constraints on growth
and scale and profitability that the
needs of the big animal at the top which
if we can get around it were
crowdfunding we don't just need them
anymore they need to go away so what's
hot and what's the question
okay okay we got it yeah yep so there's
a lot of things which are trendy these
days and I would stay say still that
social games and photos and to some
extent deal buying sites and by the time
you get spotted trend is too late yeah
right I think education and like
families are highly underrated and very
underserved I think that market is huge
and very monetizable everyone's
overeducated overeducated to recommended
i mean the don't go to college camp oh
yeah but that's why I think it's great
to do education startups yeah I used to
be in software and now i've i've been
working on gene technology to treat
aging and i'm hoping to try and get no
no jeans you know your jeans that made
you and i'm hoping to do something
disruptive there but that funding system
is very clubby very old world and it's
it's really really difficult so one of
the reasons I came here was to see if
there could be some possibility of
getting people interested in that kind
of a thing so we'd only without talking
about you at your companies but the
question is other other kind of funding
models for your kind of business yeah
for for for things that are you could
say leading-edge drugs or leading-edge
therapies there's a large capex then
it's probably still the same sources if
the capital requirements for those
businesses have changed or are changing
then maybe there's there's tremendous
technology and adoption and and called a
regulatory risk in those businesses and
so they still tend to work very much
like they used to work before and so you
have to get through the technology risk
for an investor by surrounding yourself
with incredible advisers University
researchers validation and so it there's
no shortcut in that industry for
building up the credibility around you
that will then get an investor to take
the risk and unfortunately there's no
shortcuts on that one I mean it's it's
gotten a little better but now I can do
that i mean i can write
no I think that's great and but I don't
like we've put a few biotech companies
up on Angeles and some of them have done
well but usually they come in with like
you know 5 Stanford researchers attach
the father of this is you know vouches
for it whitepapers so they just need to
have that technical validation because
we can't do that and even most the
investors won't even spend the time
unless they feel like there's a lot of
technical validation around it up here
good Nick so this questions for a new
vol not to like put you on the spot here
but as one of the five people who's read
this bill or at least attempted to I
tried finding the latest version I
couldn't find it but because there's so
many versions of this but are you guys
definitively positioning yourselves to
try and actually get through this
process because I know all the investors
I speak with perceive so and so are you
going to step through all of these you
know bureaucratic steps in order to I
mean I think it's an open question so
we're definitely looking at it we're
definitely engaged on it I don't know if
we'll go there I think will only end up
doing it if we feel we can do it for
high quality companies and high quality
companies will want to use it and if we
can do it with a lot of fraud prevention
and checks in place and sorry about
Angeles actually becoming a crowdfunding
site yeah and so and are you concerned
in any way that there's like this you
know race to capture the market but
because I see there's literally like a
hundred of these startups now that are
trying to that have positioned
themselves for this marketplace so do
you think that the what are your
thoughts on them every market is
competitive all right back there the
Vols extremely well-positioned I don't
think there's a race there may be a race
but it's a fool's race if that's what's
happening I mean it so this goes back to
I think at the end of day when you're
building a company you're always going
to have massive competition in anything
worth doing in fact the people who say
we have no competition those the people
you don't have fun because they're in
some niche market and so what's much
more important is execution capability
and understanding and so I think we have
as good an hour standing of anyone and I
think we have incredible execution
capability anyone who hangs out an angel
this knows how fast we execute so I'm
not concerned about our ability to do it
all these people who are clamoring about
it you know sure back there you talked
earlier about the pitch can you talk
about the quality average quality of the
pitch and if you can compare it if there
is a comparison to the days just before
the bubble burst back in two thousand
when you know as we recall prices of
everything we're going to the moon and
people were crazy ideas definitely much
better than then it was back then I was
around that bubble and I was pitching
during that fellow think it's definitely
a lot better than it was back then you
know there's a someone tweeted and I
kind of maybe I misquoting him but I was
great he said every bubble ends with
someone trying to ship pet food across
the country and we're starting to get
small variations calm bought it wait
wrote it all the way to you know it's
funny commit there now all these X in a
box companies that was your article in
start-up stats right you guys wrote it
and I thought it was a brilliant article
and you didn't make the obvious
reference to dick in a box to the
YouTube the BSR night live skit but
blank number right right is a sudden
that life's get around it this gentleman
over here right back to your comment on
international what is your perspective
on sort of VC and private equity in the
ad Asian markets a lot of good ideas
India Thailand these markets are clearly
starved underdeveloped so what is your
outlook and how do you do the due
diligence process so we're actually
modestly active in Asia right now I've
done about 15 or 20 deals across China
Japan Singapore India Australia I think
India is a huge market I think Southeast
Asia and particularly Indonesia is a
pretty big market Indonesia is not
terribly monetizable right now but that
will change over time China's big market
with a lot of complexity Japan's an
underrated market extremely developed
and great if you know what you're doing
and not a lot of local encouragement of
entrepreneurship strangely so we're
actually extremely bullish on Japan okay
my wife's Japanese what so I actually
think the funding markets develop
backwards you get your mezzanine
investors first and you're seriously
see then your B then you're a then your
angel than your incubator and so that's
the bad news internationally it means
like someone angel invest in your
company you're gonna get stranded around
a cash because there's no series a
investor to fund you so I think the
logical model is for companies to get a
little bit of traction internationally
establish an officer office here and
then make sure you have a foot hole here
for your full funding cycle but continue
to attack your remote market and I think
that model work George are you involved
overseas no I I won't find anything
outside the US the reason there's only
one reason it's not that I'm a u.s.
centrist mr. in one company overseas
yeah we are but I personally which might
won't do it because of two main factors
one is millennium haltom or Lenny was a
Baltimore back that's almost I thought
Alan who's the founders in Canada okay
so like the main reason is if I take a
day off of two days to travel somewhere
I miss all those emails all these emails
and all those people trying to get all
the main meetings I don't want to do
that the second reason which is actually
the most important to me is I have young
kids and I'm I try to be there every
night to put them to sleep and tonight
I'm not there watching them a live
streaming and that's really important to
me so that's why I don't do things you
didn't do you guys he do to this is one
of the challenges are instead not a
challenge it's not easy to the problem
is most do dogs as people diligence and
especially in place like China where
they're running one set of books for
government one for the investors in one
real set of books you have to be a local
player otherwise you're not going to
figure it out so it's probably gonna
happen with people establishing
cross-boundary trust right like I trust
this angel in China because he used to
work here and was a friend of mine he
invest in a company then he vouches for
them and I can do the age these trust
gossip networks have to be extended out
far enough we've hired a woman in Brazil
who's actually spending half time here
half time she's Brazilian where several
slippers yeah we're having someone in
India I mean I think you have to feed on
the streets you have to have local
cultural fluency language fluency you
have to develop mentor networks you have
to develop angel networks I mean I think
the first fund that figures out how to
do full cycle cross-border investing is
going to make a killing but it's a
really hard problem yeah but I be done
one country at a time let's move
opportunities definitely there is that
you don't care about international very
much this is a really interesting salary
we should spend more time and I just
want our quick
thanks thanks guys appreciate it it went
over here yeah I'm wondering if you guys
have some perspective on the upcoming
Facebook IPO and on the facebooks gonna
go public they're gonna make a load of
money we all use it okay like that's it
we don't need to like talk multiple
times though I'm asking hear me out my
question is is if the pricing and
aftermarket performance of the facebook
IPO might set the tone for future
funding valuations for companies down
the road yeah maybe it's a factor next
Facebook's a big-ass company they're
doing really well they're going to make
a lot of money I think Dave should have
invested that didn't go okay um I used
to work for the guys who was one of the
biggest investors but what Alaric over a
long time line the venture business on
average barely makes money or loses
money depending on whose statue listen
to this because that means for every 10
or 20 or 30 billion made in the facebook
IPO it gets reinvested in a frenzy and
to start off lost different I keep that
in mind right well yeah that's the
effect I mean I think Facebook is
distorting what's going on like Facebook
is this once in a decade really big
business that makes a small number of
people a large amount of money and the
actual trend is venture is getting a
little bit more scientific we're getting
smart about this business and it's
easier to create 25 to 50 million dollar
businesses with regularity like that's
what's really interesting and what's
going on and why it's changing the
dynamics because it's actually harder
for large funds to make money now
because it's easier for entrepreneurs to
exit early they own more of their
companies they're more efficient about
it like that's what's cool and like
crowdfunding is challenging seed
investors seed investors are challenging
around investors around investors are
challenging fear on investors like
there's efficiency throughout the whole
system that's going on facebook this big
anomaly that is more the old world not
the new world yeah so that's the most
interesting yeah people keep talking
about the facebook but like okay how
many people here are really still
obsessive users of facebook or have
moved on to something else see how it
yeah from from over facebook you heard
of here
it's not it's not over but it's gone so
morning face blah it's got facebook has
gone so mainstream that I think most
people here have moved on to a Twitter
or Pinterest or whatever but we're
thorough edge yeah I get it but that's
what saying I don't think Facebook is
that interesting to talk about here you
know like it's not on the edge anymore
okay next okay um my name is Elias I'm
owner of a newly started app company
called absinthe media based out of
Oakland and we created a generative
music system and we were able to
leverage interest from a lot of people
that kind of we got us in a position now
where we have a little bit of capital
that we can either a invest into trying
to lawyer up and do the patent thing or
just actually develop it in pushing the
product if forward develop know so I
just kind of want to know what what the
take is on that and I a to promote okay
sue points I want to spend a little bit
of money on provisional patents fine
develop develop you cannot cost these
guys afterwards about no develop gonna
cost me I'm gonna say that one way if
you fail to build an interesting company
the patents might be worth something
when you're trying to sell okay come on
Tuesday another this that's just build
 run at a time startup checking out
monetize patents do you have on over
here mr. google actually have a question
first yeah I'm sorry I norisse good
evening gentlemen my name is William
Clements I actually have a two-part
question just looking at how most
startups are focusing on sort of
consumers are to be deceived model do
you feel that there's still more
opportunity for growth and for success
in that particular party industry or
should be turning more so to be to be
tied businesses or enterprise sort of
enterprise clients what problems do you
have what customers do you know yeah I
see I hate these questions because it
implies that you're so flexible that you
could do one or the other and like it
just doesn't work that way either you
really love something know your market
or passionate about it have a product in
mind or you're not ready you know you
shouldn't be that flexible give a
oh this is not about me being flexible
this is more about evaluate
opportunities for example when we look
at most of the startups right now
they're usually it's a consumer
applications for a consumer consumption
you can make putting in
areas yeah you make so I called the
public that you have in georges georges
three claims to France recently our
Twitter Yammer and millennial and one of
those have in common nothing right ones
an enterprise software one's a consumer
and one's a mobile ad you know there's a
completely different so I think you can
make money anywhere have to do people
using the Internet yeah good starting
place right over here second question
with our second but yes that with
regards to looking at starts that you're
looking to evaluate how sophisticated of
a monetization strategy or product
rudiment are you looking for them to
have in order to take them seriously you
want to business model I don't need on
at the beginning but I would like to
know like what's the product what does
it do and who is it valuable to that's
kind of what I need at the beginning we
like to fund things that are simple in
revenue model either transactional
subscription or affiliate driven but
more important is is their customers
there a problem or is there a strong
desire and like problem desire proxy for
future monetization so if that's clear I
don't need to know how you're making
money for the find me and nany for my
you know yeah mom like that's going to
make money someone one thing I've
learned is that if you have some nagging
hunch that you haven't figured something
out about your business model when you
start a company you'll never figure it
out like usually the good entrepreneurs
already know where they can make money
way down the road now it might require
they have to hit media scale and hit 100
million users but they know that it will
make money at that point at the end game
so you guys touched a pound how
education is a bubble kind of this theme
that Peter Thiel I don't throw us out he
said that yeah I so I understand how
that kind of works but I think it's a
bit myopic because I don't think
everyone can be an entrepreneur how do
you think this will work for the ninety
percent or whatever percent who don't
want to be entrepreneurs do you think
higher education particularly or higher
education um yeah what do you think
he'll go do you think there's room in
the government or do you think this will
okay and i just think higher education
has set up as a scam right it's a it's a
brand based on network effect so
everyone has to call it go to college
because you won't hire anyone who didn't
go to college so who has to go to
college the college is figure that out
to raise prices five seven percent every
year with no end in sight and smell like
a talk to your VC though no but looks
like
no I think I think it'll get replaced by
be lower valuations five to seven
percent of you know it'll get so so
what's going to happen is obvious which
is what is a college education they'll
start getting be based because
university of phoenix or whatever you go
online you get accreditation you take
self courses and eventually we will
route around this brand based monopoly
of the college system is set up that's a
long thing i believe mark injuries and
he thinks all these schools will be
totally global and that you can you know
people in cambodia will be getting there
might I've even I'm MIT degrees on their
smartphones I think it's going to happen
I I funded a company called Udacity
which is one of the faster-growing
online universities and one of the
co-founders was a professor at Stanford
and he took threw me through a model
which basically show that seventy-five
percent of the cost of a Stanford degree
has nothing to do with getting an
education yeah it's real estate its
facilities it's admin and it's about the
admin hiring admin in fact I've seen the
emails which is inside a Stanford
they're hiring admin to sport more admin
so they qualifies a non-profit it's it's
huge profit for the people running it
it's not a non-profit so you know I
think one of the awesome things with
Udacity the other competitors are we can
educate the world's population if that's
something I can do with my life and back
those people that's that is great that
is so inspiring to me to change people's
eyes and we have emails from people all
over the world saying thank you so much
like I've never had a company where the
the user reaction was that positive and
like if I get to do this as a job fun
people to do that that's my dream I hope
in my lifetime will see people able to
take a test and just get a college
degree like you just take the test like
yeah you're good enough you got it here
you know higher education itself I mean
I tend to agree with with Peter that
it's mostly both like I really think you
know well we funded the company called
university now that I think can do some
interesting things at a broad-based
level and like trying to make that
efficient and less costly and make that
available online globally is important
but I think the way more interesting
part of the education market is kids 027
maybe up to 10 or 12 like that's where
you actually do real learning meaningful
e-learning and then like 12 or older it
should probably be vocationally oriented
we're like at least at least in most
parts of the world it actually raises
your living
like I things that are important to do
or try and figure out like prenatal
health care and education at zero to
three three to six and you've solved
eighty percent of the problems if you do
it before the age of six I I just really
say thank you for Udacity I love the
products Franklin listen I have a quick
question that a couple people emailed me
about which is that they're concerned
about being over 45 or 50 I wanted to
start something I better not start
something keep your eye on and it
started the fun when I was 44 no
seriously will you fund guys who are or
women who were older oh yeah we have
yeah assuming that they can they're
active and they have a lot of energy to
put into a start-up that's part of it
I'm 38 I'm gonna start up I hope I'm
fundable I can use either big question
of your right here can you talk about
besides the obvious situated in terms of
your actual capital investment for on
entrepreneurs what else are you bringing
or do you bring to the table for that
entrepreneur it's a good question when I
mean does for an entrepreneur what
should they look at other than just the
cash I bring nothing oh come on you
bring a lot over time so I mean I think
that's where again there's real
opportunity for innovation so we're
trying to bring design and usability
services on staff we're trying to add
distribution services on our stuff
trying to have distribution
internationally as part of that I think
there's it's interesting how many large
VCS are not reinvesting in
infrastructure and resources i think
andreessen horowitz is like to that
reducing orbits does a really like
interesting model where there times over
surrounded that's it and first rounds
done that I think you know there's some
other smaller folks doing some
interesting stuff but not too many so
that's the interesting innovation the
venture business which is that the
incubators are building infrastructure
to help their companies as opposed to
this trying to help them with advice and
I separated out smart money and dumb
money not based on the value they add
because if a board member can walk in
one day a month and you know teach you
stuff about your business then you're
not good enough to back and you need to
go back and learn more so with that was
board seats are highly overrated no no
that's not it at all so to me what board
seats are about is about investor
supporting the entrepreneur so really
smart money which is dumb money is when
you get in trouble will this investor
back you you know bail you out believe
in you take you the next round or they
going to hassle you harass you make your
life miserable and and if I'm selecting
investor to sit on my board I care far
more about supportiveness that about
value then but you know intellectual
value add I'm not looking for my board
member to come and solve math problems
for me which is I think sometimes how a
lot of entrepreneurs tend to approach
their investors to think is too silly ya
can't chemistry with the investor is
what the person on your board is
critical if you don't have good
chemistry do not take their capital
completely just like anything else in
life you know I'm good chemistry the
person do not get involved in whatever
way you do not have a smart jerk on your
board you will regret it because they
will screw you and they'll be really
good at it cuz they're smart I think
there's there's a ton of specialization
and innovation to happen in venture and
I think we're seeing that right now so I
think you're seeing incubators sort of
morph into like health care focus
education-focused tech-focused platform
focus I think you know that's a good
thing that actually is the natural
evolution and I think there are some
large and innovative VCS which are
experimenting with the model in
interesting ways time for one more sure
so in the whole online internet space
the playing field is really level right
now and SOPA and PIPA have kind of died
down a little bit but the telecoms and
media companies are going to keep trying
to make it you know either pay to play
or fighting against net neutrality do
you guys feel any responsibility as kind
of figure heads or should there be more
cooperative lobbying effort to kind of
stave off these kind of attacks on
something that could really hurt this
entire industry so you know I've spent
some time in DC recently and evangelist
we we definitely were vocal against SOPA
and PIPA and we ran some campaigns and
we were very active on the job Zack and
I can tell you that DC now knows Silicon
Valley exists and because we've got
money and they want it well we've got
money we've got a voice and I think
they're definitely paying attention I
don't think so advised that organized
because by nature we're all sort of
individuals and you know we all
like to do our own thing and compete and
all that so we're not going to we're not
oligopoly like the NPA or the RA we're
going to band together and have a carbon
lobbying effort and I think it's silly
to even try I see all these grassroots
efforts they like combine Silicon Valley
let's get together and this just doesn't
work it's not in our nature but what I
think we could do is we can build a few
internet scale tools and scorecards and
tracking systems that allow us to
project the voice of millions very
quickly and very easily and I think
that's all we need and I think and
actually think startups will do that I
think there are smart startups that will
figure out how to project the silicon
value voice and they will figure out how
to get paid for it beyond beyond Twitter
beyond Twitter yeah cuz Twitter doesn't
aggregate Twitter doesn't unify so
here's an example I think it would be
amazing if someone built an iphone app
that if you are a representative and by
the way all the reps are on Twitter or
all the Senators on twitter and you can
get up and you can say okay what am I
constitu think of this bill in this
issue and it tweets out and it goes to
all your constituents and then they
answer and then automatically adjust for
their demographics like okay based on
people here district they live here geo
location map map here's the votes
fifty-seven percent of people here
district want you to vote on this bill I
think the simple app alone would change
the world I've talked to the House
Majority Whip and he said eat it up
tomorrow and you force all the
Republicans to adopt it right so
someone's it's just waiting to be built
I think if your investment company
called loaders and it's doing something
like that but there's several companies
doing basically campaign electoral sort
of aggregation I think yet so I think
soaked in valley yes we should be
vigilant but we're better off now than
we were before I think we're at a time
thank you all so much you heard it here
first Facebook is a fad and don't work
with smart jerks do not quote me on that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
