seeing what cool concept pieces razors
cooking up they very often have
prototype designs that are very cool and
flashy but may or may not ever come out
in stores this year however we've got
two new products here that aren't
definitely coming out one of them very
soon one of them a little bit later
first up is the new version of the razor
blade advanced 15 it's the same 15 inch
gaming laptop that I loved so much in
2018 but this new version while it's the
same from the outside inside it has
Nvidia snoo r-tx graphics cards the 2060
the 2017 max Q and the 2080 max q all in
a very slim body and also new in this
rebound version new webcam here an IR
camera that supports Windows hello
facial recognition login I always like
seeing that in a laptop of course
getting new r-tx parts does not always
come cheap this guy's going to start at
20 to 99 for the 2060 model and go all
the way up to $29.99 if you want the
full 20 80 max Q version with all the
trimmings now here's something that kind
of looks like one of rays extremis
content pieces but is actually coming
out in the first half of this year it is
the razor wrapped up monitor it's a 27
inch display gives you a lot of mobility
2560 by 1440 very flexible hinge it's
built on top of a single aluminum
gigantic stand piece that not only makes
it very stable gives you a place to
route all your cables this big stand
does such a good job at routing your
cables that razer gives you a set of
these green cables that route right in
through their plug into all the plugs
come out through the back and each one
of them terminates in a USB a or USB C
or an HDMI and you can just plug in
whatever part you need without having to
get down there under it and and plug in
and unplug stuff manually every time you
want to change something
of course since it's a razor it's got
chroma lights right there on the bottom
and it will work in sync with your
chroma lights on your laptop or your
keyboard or your mouse or your mouse pad
or anywhere else like that so if you
have everything together just turn off
the lights and enjoy the show we've seen
a lot of range of concept pieces in the
past that have been great to look at and
then fun to play around with but I've
never actually come out
it's coming out in the first half of
2019 for a very used about six hundred
ninety nine dollars but wait I've got
one more surprise for you it's not part
of the razor blade 15 advance that's
coming out later in January but razor
did show up two prototypes greens that
may come in future versions of this one
with a 240 Hertz screen which look
fantastic and one was a 4k OLED screen
you almost never see an OLED screen in a
laptop but I really think it's the Holy
Grail question for gaming laptops if
that OLED version ever comes out I'm
gonna be very excited</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
