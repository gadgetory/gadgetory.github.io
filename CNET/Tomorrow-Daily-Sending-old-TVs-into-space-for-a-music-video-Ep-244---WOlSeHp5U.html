welcome to tomorrow daily the besties
talk-show in the universe I'm Ashley ask
ewa and well this is a little bit
different than what you're used to right
so you're used to a big set and another
person and a whole bunch of other stuff
this is tomorrow daily mini this is
gonna be a tiny episodes for the next
couple weeks while we get our brand-new
studio up and running uh but you know
it's gonna be a really exciting time and
I have something really fun for you guys
to do so our hashtag of the day all week
this week is gonna be TD host and we
want you to guess who our new co-host is
somebody you've heard of probably uh
I've heard of him I've heard of him it's
it's a guy oh I get away clue uh TD host
and if you guess it and you're the first
person to guess it on Twitter
oh no maybe I'll dig Mabel dig in a box
of stuff find a prize for you
so I'm saying all right guys let's hit
headlines Canadian company Errol billow
is celebrating right now after setting a
new land speed record for human powered
vehicles pretty cool stuff so this
actually happened last week at the 2015
World human-powered Speed Challenge
competition which I have never heard of
up until this point but good for them
and this bike was ridden by the
company's founder he wrote in this speed
bike and hit eighty six point six five
miles per hour in this thing not quite
88 so it wasn't able to go back to the
future but I am really impressed by this
because a team of fourteen people built
this bike so not a huge team of people
they were able to set the new land speed
record which is some pretty impressive
stuff so nice work arrow bellow okay
let's talk about a director who decided
to take some very old technology and
turn it into a new thing by sending it
up into space I really like this trend
this is really exciting so director Joe
Connor was doing a music video for
Kelvin Jones he has a song called call
you home and he took two old Sony TV's
retro TVs and sent them up into orbit
using a weather balloon and rigged a
bunch of GoPros all around them pretty
awesome and did it twice so he could get
the shots that he wanted out of it
really impressive stuff and like I said
a really good way to get some new use
out of some old technology so you can
check out that video if you are so
inclined okay
last thing on our headlines we got to
talk about clothes specifically
virtual clothes and a magic mirror this
comes from a Korean team called my
design lab the project is called Mirror
Mirror it uses a sensor to scan and
track your body and a projector to throw
pixelated clothes on you now you can
change those clothes with a wand that's
infrared or you can actually draw on the
clothes with that wand and get those
clothes custom printed specifically for
your body it's a pretty interesting way
to feature customized clothing I mean
we've seen customized clothing before if
you've ever made a pair of custom
sneakers online it's kind of like that
but just taking it to a really far far
step ahead of what we currently use ok
so we're done with headlines let's talk
about back at our hackett all you dog
owners out there can finally rejoice
because if you've ever been frustrated
at taking a selfie with your dog and not
getting your dog to look directly at the
camera pooch selfie might be for you
this is a 3d printed clip that lets you
mount a tennis ball onto the top of your
smartphone I know you're thinking this
sounds like the worst idea in the
universe because if your dog really
likes tennis balls and you're holding up
your smartphone trying to get your dog
to look at the tennis ball it's gonna
lunge for the tennis ball and then take
your phone in the tennis ball away so
I'm gonna say hack it but if you want to
spend 13 bucks you want to get a good
selfie of your dog and their
well-behaved I say go ahead and get in
on that it's on Kickstarter right now
but I might trade to get my dog to take
their selfies some other more
traditional way like sticking peanut
butter on the top of my phone I don't
know I don't know let's talk about
photographer of the day
our phone talker for the day is Nick
Nick used his iPhone 5s and he writes to
us and he says Nick here I took the shot
in an iPhone 5s in Scranton Pennsylvania
I love that reflection was thinking of
getting the 6s plus to up my photography
game definitely use this photo thanks
guys
well uh you're very welcome yes we
definitely did use this picture so thank
you Nick and if you're out there and you
want to submit your phone tog Rafi you
can do that you can email us tomorrow at
Cena comm you can find us on the
Internet we're all over the shop if you
want to follow us on social media
