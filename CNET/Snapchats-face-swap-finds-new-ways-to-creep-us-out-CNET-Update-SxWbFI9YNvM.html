thanks for the nightmares snapchat I'm
Bridget Carey this is your cnet update
the face swapping trend has a new twist
on snapchat you can now face walk with
any existing image in your phone's
camera roll you used to need to have
your friend nearby to do the effect in
person but now it can be any photo you
saved as long as it looks like a face it
can be even an animal or a cartoon but I
must warn you face swapping with your
own selfie is the stuff of nightmares
perhaps face swapping with yourself as a
sign that the trend is dead but snapchat
did actually kills something else paid
replace every snap you get can be
replayed once but you can no longer buy
extra replace for a dollar it appears
snapchat wants to focus on making money
through advertisements and other content
deals so what sort of content you ask
well MTV is now bringing back its old
show cribs just for snapchat that's
according to a report from variety the
show MTV Cribs launched in two thousand
and it gave viewers a tour of celebrity
homes this new snapchat version of the
show will do the same it launches in
June and it airs once a week now there
are actually a few other shows being
made just for mobile apps some original
content is hitting verizon's go 90
streaming TV app there's one comedy
called replay it's about an aspiring DJ
that goes through the same day over and
over again it's similar to Groundhog Day
and there's a show on go 90 called
relationship status the show explores
modern love and each episode is 11
minutes long but if you rather not get
your television from a chat app designed
for Millennials you can still find a
show on the old-fashioned live TV but
Google helps you find it in a new way if
you search for a show on google it will
pull up listings of when the show is
airing and on what channels you can find
it it also will tell you which streaming
services offer the shows you may not see
it right away it is coming soon that's
all for this technique is round up and
you can head to cnet.com for the latest
and follow me on twitter from our
studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey
