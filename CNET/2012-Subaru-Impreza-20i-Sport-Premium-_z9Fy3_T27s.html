good little car except for a couple
little things ugly and thirsty not great
traits in the very competitive compact
car segment so let's take a run in this
2012 heavily revised Subaru Impreza 2.0
I Sport limited that's a mouthful
check the tech and see if it can address
the issues now the fact that we're in a
sport limited trim level on this guy and
they've got like 19,000 trim levels
means we have a very limited selection
of technology standard or optional this
guy is uniquely without check boxes to
add gear for example that's your head
unit you cannot get the six inch LCD
touchscreen guy which would also have
navigation not available on this trim
it's available on several others but not
this Impreza
you also have am/fm radio but you can't
get HD radio in this car I mean can't
get it at all you do have however a USB
Jack which is very forward for thumb
drives or iPods aux is down there as
well and notice in addition to CD you've
also got bluetooth streaming audio and
Bluetooth hands-free is standard on this
car as well audio system for the output
is six speakers base then there's a
bunch of Alucard stuff you can do you
can option a 10 inch subwoofer for 500
bucks you can option a pair of
additional tweeters for 120 if it's not
brassy enough for you or you can upgrade
the speaker's overall for 250 bucks it's
an upgrade of 4 speakers I'm not sure
what they do with the other two leave
them crappy I guess what you can get on
this guy and we do have it is the CVT
gearbox there's no true cog based
automatic just the CVT continuously
variable it also comes with paddles on
the wheel as is the fashion these days
and as you can see you've got a gate
down here for automatic mode or over
here is a simulated manual where it
pretends like it has gears we'll see how
well it works on the road
now under the hood on this 2012 Impreza
is something small that is actually a
big story this engine got smaller from
the last generation down from two and a
half liters to just two litres flat-four
boxer engine it's a sube after all
you're going to get 148 horsepower out
of the sky 145 foot-pounds of torque not
overwhelming numbers but they do get
this car to 60 in about 8 seconds if
you've got a manual that slides almost a
second and a half slower with our CVT
but the payoff is in the mpg 27 36 now
on this car with the CVT the outgoing
model is like 20 27 that's like a
different world but let's see how it is
on the road
now CBTs are either real good or real
slippery yeah this one is a big fan of
Nissan's version this gearbox but this
one tends to have pretty good stiction
it doesn't give you that butterball
feeling that a lot of them do so good
points on that and again it makes a big
difference in mpg you pick up like 2 mpg
city and highway respectively by going
with this transmission the car doesn't
feel as slow as it looks on paper that's
kind of the point of a car like this
which is not a performance ride you're
not going to go to the track with it so
who cares how fast it really is as long
as it feels sprightly and it does now
part of the goodness of a boxer engine
is that it lays real low center of
gravity is down just above the axle line
which gives the car a nice low center of
gravity around the front about the
steering and pointing wheels so the car
handles rather nicely considering that
it's got kind of humble origins about
the only thing about this car I had a
hard time living with day in and day out
is this sound coming out of what I think
is from the gearbox it sounds like a
belt rubbing on something all the time
not like it's broken but like it's going
to make me insane and that's unfortunate
because this cars otherwise fairly
refined and well bolted together I think
it's a CVT thing so I would have to
drive the manual just to see if it was
much more refined than quiet but I bet
I'll end up going the CVT anyway because
it's a better real world choice and this
one seems to be well executed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
