a cheap cash-in by taking an
environmentally and socially responsible
attitude the brand differentiates itself
from a market full of Beats imitators
the companies smiled to make a
headphones stand out for a couple of
reasons firstly they are luridly
coloured but more importantly they're
constructed from renewable materials
which includes s'appelle which fittingly
is wood also used to make guitars for
$30 headset it's very well put together
and there are some great touches
including a rugged connector and a
fabric cover you also get a little carry
case to store them in if you're a fan of
Bob Marley's or reggae in general you'd
expect them to give strong bass and
deliver excellent vocal detail yes they
are very good at delivering detailed
bass and if you like any bass heavy
style then you'll likely love the sound
of these headphones vocals do take a
backseat though due to the sheer amount
of bass but they're good for other
genres such as jazz and even acoustic

freebie headphones and perfect if you
want something that will rock a little
bit harder it's been ty Pendlebury for
