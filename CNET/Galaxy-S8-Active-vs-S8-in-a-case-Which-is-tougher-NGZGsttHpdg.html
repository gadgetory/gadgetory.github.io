pretty much think a tougher meteor or
all-around sturdier version of the
Galaxy S phone and when you look at the
Galaxy f8 active that's basically what
you have at least on the surface level
they actually have very similar specs
from the excellent camera and even that
button on the spy
basically if the f8 active seems like a
more expensive version of the s8 with a
built in case so what do you really get
and couldn't I achieve it all by just
putting a touch cape on this Galaxy s8
well from a drop test to a dunk test I
decided to find out first test the look
compared to the thick f8 active the
Galaxy s8 is sleek and small instead of
a glass back you've got plastic that's
easy to grip it'll still charge
wirelessly to the s8 active has thicker
sides that come with their own bumpers
that's good but these screws on the side
purely ornamental we know because we
unscrewed them one thing that set the
past active phones apart were all the
buttons that were easy to press with wet
or gloved hands but this year's s made
active loses those three physical
navigation buttons under the screen and
the button on that side that used to
open up a health app or any other app
you wanted is now programmed to fix P
voice and that's it
phurba s8 in a good case and really
there's no real design advantage on the
s8 active second test water-resistant
both the Galaxy s8 and s8 active are
water-resistant but after last year's
galaxy s7 active drowned in our pool
because of a design flaw that affected
some units one that Samsung later fixed
of course we had to see if this year's
phone faced the same issues it did it
both Galaxy s8 survived 28 minutes in
the bucket third test freezer burn
for a third test we pop the phones in
the freezer for 30 minutes in addition
to being water resistant the phones are
rated to withstand dust and extreme
temperatures they both came out again
chilly but fully functional fourth test
beware of sudden drops the SI two
actives real claim to fame is that you
don't have to worry about it when you
fumble the phone from your pocket or
while taking a photo so we dropped the
encased s8 and the s8 active side by
side on both the front and back and
peered at the phone for cracks they both
got three or four very short hairline
scrapes from their spills but no major
cracks or splinters phones fall and
break all the time so that's expected
and even with the case if it falls
screen slide down on an uneven surface
you could be out of luck with your
screen so what did we learn from all
this about a $35 protector like the
spigen tough armor case can probably
shield your regular s8 from life's major
messes and spills without you having to
pay $100 more for the same hardware gun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
