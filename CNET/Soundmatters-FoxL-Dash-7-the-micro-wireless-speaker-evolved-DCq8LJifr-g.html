speakers on the map with the jam box but
sound matters is the company that
provided key audio components for the
jam box while quietly selling its own
well-received speaker the Fox l like the
mini jambox which also apparently uses
some of sound matters technology the new
foxhole - 7 is a very slim speaker
that's only 3/4 of an inch deep it's
thinner than the mini jambox but longer
and can be propped up vertically using
the included convertible case stand or
lay down flat so the speaker fires
upward like the jam box it doubles as a
speakerphone and works well in that
capacity overall it's a really nice
little speaker that comes in a few
different colors and obviously travels
very well and I like the fact that it
comes with a case something that jawbone
didn't include with the jam box mini as
far as connectivity goes there's an
audio input for non bluetooth devices
and a port for connecting Salamanders
optional fox ello palm-sized powered
subwoofer you can charge the device via
micro USB or an AC adapter that offers
faster recharging battery life is rated
at 12 hours for wireless streaming which
is better than average for this type of
speaker for its size the dash 7 sounds
quite good and plays as loud as the
larger foxhole v2 however like the mini
jambox it does have its limitations you
can only get so much bass out of a
speaker this size and it just doesn't
sound all that great with bass heavy
material and complicated rock tracks
especially when you crank the volume it
will distort with certain tracks also
it's hard to keep propped up on the
stand when you raise the volume because
the speaker does vibrate and will slip
away from the magnetized case it's
strongest with acoustical tracks where
it comes across most clearly and also
does well as a mini sound bar for movie
watching on a tablet or laptop the only
issue I had with it is the price as it
stands it'll cost you around $220 while
the mini jambox can be had for around 50
to 60 dollars less
despite the mini sleek look I think the
dash 7 does have some design advantages
I like its rounded corners and it's a
little lighter than the mini while
feeling almost as sturdy in the end both
the mini jambox and the Salamanders fox
will - 7 are very
much about the convenience of having a
tiny relatively decent performing
speaker that takes up the little room in
a bag there are better sounding $200
wireless speakers such as the ue boom
and bose soundlink mini that are about
twice the size and weight and they're
the better choice if you want better
sound
however the dash 7 is right there at the
top of the micros wireless speaker class
I just think it should cost a little
less I'm David Carr Noi thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
