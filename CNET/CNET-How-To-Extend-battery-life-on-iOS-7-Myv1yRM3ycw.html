look handy new settings and a boatload
of features that have good intentions
but really just stuck up your phone's
battery life so if you noticed your
phone is draining faster since updating
to iOS 7 or you want to know how to get
more juice out of it here are some tips
background app refresh is a feature that
lets background apps stay active while
you multitask the problem is that by
default all your apps are unable to
refresh in the background which is a
huge battery hog head on over to
settings general then background app
refresh here you can disable the feature
entirely or you can disable just the
ones you don't absolutely want to
refresh iOS 7's automatic updates aren't
generally a problem but the last thing
you want is 15 apps to start updating
when your battery is at twenty percent
so turn that feature off just go to the
iTunes and App Store settings and
disable this updates option now you can
update your apps whenever it's best for
you one of the biggest battery drains is
always location tracking usually that
applies to using mapping apps but hidden
in your settings menu are a whole bunch
of new settings that sneekly track your
location under privacy go to location
services then scroll all the way down
and choose system services some of these
settings are designed to improve your
experience for instance popular near me
tracks your location to give you a pre
commend ations based on where you are go
ahead and disable any features you don't
absolutely need including this frequent
location setting at the bottom spotlight
is super useful because it lets you
search for almost anything on your phone
and the way it works is by constantly
crawling your phone for new data and
indexing it that's a huge battery drain
back in settings go to general spotlight
search and uncheck the items you don't
absolutely need indexed with that and
all the other adjustments you should see
a nice boost in your battery life if you
have any questions or tips of your own
