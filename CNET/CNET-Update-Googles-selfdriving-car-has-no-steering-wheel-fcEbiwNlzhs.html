a ride I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your cnet update google revealed a new
twist on its self-driving car project if
the car doesn't need a driver it also
doesn't need a steering wheel or gas
pedals that's the idea with Google's new
two-seater prototype once you get in
just buckle up and type in your
destination on the smartphone app it
will use sensors to safely avoid
obstacles in the road and if at any time
there's a problem well there is an
emergency stop button and you can
reactivate your trip with a go button it
has plenty of time to judge traffic and
avoid obstacles because it only travels
at a max speed of 25 miles an hour and
that's safe but it's not a practical
speed limit for everyday use and it
can't go on highways so for now you
could just think of it as more of a
futuristic personal shuttle to chauffeur
you between buildings on a work campus
or university campus Google would like
you to be able to buy one in three to
six years but there's also the issue of
a little thing called laws the few
states that do allow for self-driving
cars require a human behind the wheel to
take over in an emergency it may not
look like a very safe car from the
outside and you are putting your life in
the hands of a robot that's using google
maps but hey it looks like it has a cute
little face with a nose and a mouth so
that should help ease your fears now you
won't be able to autopilot your car
anytime soon but auto translating a
video call that's another matter
Microsoft will be rolling out a
real-time language translation feature
on skype by the end of the year it's
called Skype translator now there was
this live demo on stage during a recode
conference or skype quickly translated a
conversation between two people speaking
english and german is vah justified not
alone
feast is it true that you were soon
moving to London we're getting just a
bit closer to a Star Trek future now if
only Microsoft can make a food
replicator so Google is working on
taking cars to the next level and
Microsoft has the next level of video
communication but over at Samsung it
wants to improve health tracking
technology it's working on better
sensors that go into wristband health
trackers and a better way to collect a
ton of data about your body and share it
with you and doctors they call their
device the sim ban but this is not for
sale it's for other companies to build
off of the point is maybe we can have a
wristband that makes real sense about
our body's health instead of just
getting points for how many steps we
took in a day that's your tech news
update you can find more details on
these stories at cnet com and be sure to
follow along on Twitter from our studios
