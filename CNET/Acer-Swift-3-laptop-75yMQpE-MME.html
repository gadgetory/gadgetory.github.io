not gold that's how I feel about the
Acer Swift 3 featuring a stylish
aluminum design that's only 18
millimeters thin it looks like it could
be an expensive notebook from far away
it's glass front panel with protective
rubber strip and chamfered edges weren't
some superficial comparison for the
MacBook Pro with models starting at $500
it's one of the only affordable laptops
you can buy with an all-metal design
that's this cool looking and has this
many ports but spend some quality time
with the Acer and you'll understand why
it's not quite a premium laptop it's
1080p HD screen which can hold back 180
degrees is satisfyingly sharp in
resolution but its luminosity is too dim
the maximum brightness setting is too
low and it does nothing to help deflect
the many reflections the glossy screen
attracts another disappointment is its
shallow keyboard it's just not
comfortable to type on for some reason
the cursor keys are all cramped on the
bottom right corner and the chamfered
edges closest to the keyboard feel
uncomfortably sharp it also has a short
battery life
it lasts at 11 hours in our video
streaming test but I was only able to
get about three and a half to four hours
of battery life when using the laptop
brannad I was doing a lot of web
browsing and streaming video but I used
it the same amount as I would any laptop
during the workday lasting about half a
workday is just unacceptable for me the
Acer Swift 3 has an impressively stylish
construction and it's worth a look if an
affordable laptop that the sharp design
is your main goal but if you just want a
cheap notebook you're better off looking
elsewhere</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
