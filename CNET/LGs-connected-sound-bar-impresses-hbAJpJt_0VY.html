boon for budget home cinema with some
excellent low-priced gear coming out in
recent years led by companies such as
pioneer vizio and Sony with the la s7
51m musicflow soundbar LG has entered
this illustrious group this is a product
that looks great sounds great and offers
an unexpected wealth of features for the
money at around 400 bucks you're lucky
to find a sound bar that even supports
bluetooth not only does this LG have
bluetooth but it also boasts internet
connectivity with this speaker comes
LG's multi-room system music flow it
allows you to stream music from your
phone your network or from services such
as Pandora and Spotify the system has
HDMI in and out but it does lack an
on-screen display many functions are
instead controlled with the remote or
with the music flow app while this is a
four point one channel system with two
fronts two pseudo surrounds and a
wireless subwoofer you can also add two
wireless h3 speakers as dedicated
surrounds given the number of features
it has and how slim the unit is we're
all kind of blown away by the sound
quality it's not cupped muffled or boomy
it's very open and detailed sounding and
also sounds really good with both music
and movies which is kind of rare Shaw
dedicated speakers and a receiver will
give you more sonic warmth but at this
price is no other products which can
match its mix of features and
performance the LA s7 51 and music flow
sound bar is therefore highly
recommended this is ty Pendlebury for
