gentlemen i am your host eric mack and
i'm joined once again by stephen Beecham
kelsey Adams Bonnie Burton Jeff's
Berkman in the cnet studios in San
Francisco and especially from Minnesota
escape it demonic oh I knew it was
coming my still life Oh getting rave
memories or Ren Faire so as always if
you want to join the conversation for
the crave cats wouldn't be talking about
drones today you can tweet us at krave
and you can also join our live stream
chat room at I believe it's
livestream.com / crave cast or just
google creative live stream I today Emma
live from my hometown Taos New Mexico in
the offices of the award-winning taos
news my hometown newspaper one-time
employer who lets me borrow their
broadband and one of the big stories are
here around Taos this past week that the
town is covered and cnet readers might
be interested in was the day long
communications blackout that our entire
town experienced last week a fiber optic
cable outside town was cut and
apparently that single cable is a
responsible for all the cell phone
service all dsl and cable internet
access and some of the landline service
in town as well so simply texting your
friends was suddenly replaced with
having to guess where they were and
literally drive over to talk to them
face-to-face it was crazy I ended up
driving the headline would have been
great if it was like help I'm trapped in
the 1880s like I feel like they would
have been better cuz even in the 1980s
we had really big giant cell phone spray
am I thinking right yeah we have pagers
in the 80s yeah we did we have them yet
oh I miss large brick size criticize
accessories hi bricks I pray um so you
know next time you come to Taos which I
highly recommend you might want to call
or text ahead to make sure you can get
in touch with us or better yet you could
just send a drone to Scout things out
and see the beautiful scenery for you
and
which brings us to today's topic of
discussions which is keeps hurting their
what I recorded that drone really works
landing hey drone to the face yeah like
that it's like the voice is suddenly
high pitch to Susan careful careful
tragic haircut yeah we're dedicating you
can't podcast a drone fly at the same
time it's not dangerous huh I got this
stuck in my dog's tail lift up the drone
show us show us something how big is the
dress around sighs this is I'm not
judging you meme yeah yeah it's how you
pilot it Bonnie this is an extreme micro
drone yeah it's a it's pretty nice my
daughter loves it and drones are you
know quickly revolutionising a number of
parts of our lives if you want to talk
about today the least of which is it
it's if he's providing these gorgeous
shots that i think steven has ireland
they'll help us celebrate the other
thing happening today which is st.
Patrick's Day which I would be remiss in
not mentioning as a member of the
MacNamara clan of limerick ah this is
all shot with with drone just give you
an idea of what is possible today I mean
normally you'd need like you know a
hundred thousand dollar fee for to pay
for a helicopter for these kind of shots
yeah like those relaxation videos that
you can watch on netflix to like
meditate were theirs right yeah there's
this really nice footage it must have a
big range yeah the camera must be great
quality too it's got to be 4k looks for
yeah yeah Wow no condos there why am I
in San Francisco look at all that open
space and clips too I know I went and I
went looking last night for some other
kind of Saint Saint Patrick's Day
footage and even a day before Saint
Patrick's Day there was already a number
of
people had recorded footage of early st.
Patrick's Day parade I really like this
night footage I love like Ireland
overall yeah you like that it's like I
feel like we're God makes it in a little
bit yeah we're good good it's like I
really should be doing inspiration it's
rational yeah send money to drone church
okay let's look at the there we go Oh
God okay this is uh this is uh where's
this one let me see this Pittsburgh uh
drone st. Pete our seat Patrick's Day
parade and they watched long buffalo
Buffalo what it in slow motion for her
well things are I had a lot to drink I
don't know if that parks around for
dinner there's the drone for this yes
great cool that's cool and I mean you're
really in five years ago there we go
you'd have to have a helicopter to get
this footage and now the next day it's
everywhere online or they would do to
look like some sort of crane you know
it's always like some when I was at the
Rose Bowl parade years back they always
had all these crane cameras and now i'm
wondering if Rose Bowl parade would be
better with drone footage at this point
definitely this is great oh no
Pittsburgh basically having a drone tour
of every Jones a little too close to
those girls yeah is it though I think
from the way she was folding her arms
that girl had said yeah okay yeah way to
be kind of creepy with the drone but
it's there sparkman another one who
zoomed in i was just saying if this is
Pittsburgh it looks really nice from
above don't go down to any lower sorry
Pittsburgh sorry I know right oops last
five years um I love this footage it's
great because when you see it from that
distance you realize how I think they
can go pretty high I don't know have
they done any sort of test to see how
far up in the atmosphere drunken
flexible fibers well when Adam Savage I
wrote the story about Adam Savage
testing out that it was a DJ I a drone
and he had to really I guess we'll just
show video that some point but there's
like a really nice camera attached to
that and he took it really high up and I
was wondering how far can you take a
drone before it starts freezing can you
take it out tonight I don't know it
depends on the on the padrone right i
mean yeah I guess Google and other
companies are working on drones that
will basically be in the upper
atmosphere source told just a matter of
technology NASA is working on some space
room so I guess it just doesn't really
it's all about the outer coating of it
techno really doesn't know everything
sound or look cooler doesn't it is not
from a distance yeah so you know when we
were we decided we want to talk about
drones today and we were going back
through the crave archives and there's
just an insane amount of stuff we've
covered about drones like literally just
from the last year I mean we've done
we've written on some interesting
footage of theirs drones that have flown
over killer whales as they're migrating
those drones that have gone into the
ruins of Chernobyl and given us a tour
of that there's drones that have flown
through the world's biggest cave and you
were talking just now Bonnie about you
wow how far can these drones go and
technically NASA is working on a drone
submarine that could be launched in the
2040s to literally go explore the ocean
of Titan one of Saturn's moon so you
know the potential of drones is kind of
incredible and we wanted to talk today
about the potential and the problems of
drones this is the the Titan submarine
throne yeah that is a crack gasps is
working on right now I know right I'm
when you thread it ring for Nessie to
pop up a giant space squid yeah oh yeah
I know when's our offworld colony gonna
be there that's great so what do you
guys think about drones is this the kind
of thing that like you actually get
excited about or is it just kind of
another weird Mazel team I'd like to do
a quick survey of us how many of us have
own drones right now like I don't have a
padrone my dad about why shouldn't see
we should say drone or quadcopter cuz
there's a difference between the two
what is the difference what is this
colony's I feel like it's you
nothing that point I bring this up is
every time we write about any kind of
quadcopter or drones story I'm seeing it
and we only have a hat we only have the
like the tag for drones there's no tag
for quadcopter we get a bunch of
comments from people going this is not a
drone this is not a drone it's a
quadcopter because there's a lot of bad
I think PR with drones especially
military because obviously military use
unmanned vehicles flying vehicles these
drones to for military warfare so I
think some people are trying to get away
from the that just the usage of generic
usage of the word and I think conversely
people feel like calling your quadcopter
drone is like trying to make it sound
more badass yeah I really have a payload
it's just like calling your gremlin and
Lamborghini it's not no I don't know but
it's it's I love quadcopters I think
they're great but I think there's a
difference between a quadcopter you got
like an Amazon a radio shack and a drone
that's military-grade that could wipe
out a whole town so yeah by ten dollars
yeah eventually this is why radio shack
when tenders because the quadcopters
were destroying towns I like said drug
smuggling drone I thought that was
hilarious yeah well she million won this
morning so according to rotor guru in
our YouTube chat room 400 feet bonnie is
the legal height to fly consumer
quadcopters but that's the leak that's
just the law that's not the actual how
far they can go up it's just how far
you're allowed to go up right right okay
right here's be great I'm just curious
how far like I'm waiting for our first
plane crash story where too many people
had drones that went too high and
knocked a plane out so that's when i'm
kinda like birds getting on the engine
yeah I I wonder I'm sorry I'm giving all
these horrible ideas there was at least
one there was at least one emergency
landing there was an emergency landing
somewhere in the US of A because a drone
got too close to a commercial flight so
it has happen okay yeah okay anyway we
should continue our talk and not let me
give any more bad ideas a cattle truck
in front of one gets the bad idea I'm
just waiting for the lawsuits to
compiling in well Bonnie said yeah so
let's anyway well that fire throwing
drone yeah they're on the drone I mean
that's at the end though I'm sorry Eric
I mean I guess I feel like you know the
main potential is there some really cool
potential for for science obviously I
mean we've written about drones flying
like literally Oh into an over volcanoes
well ones right whale one is really cool
yeah of the what does that 55 the whales
that are left is that the five that are
left no sorry that's a pot on our
podcast oh yeah they're so majestic but
you know also drones have been used to
kind of check out the Fukushima radiated
areas and yes you know there's really
interesting potential for that but uh
the generic was worried the Chernobyl
one's great cuz how often are we get
none of us are gonna take a trip to
Chernobyl so it's kind of cool I'm cool
and also eerie kind of like the
Auschwitz tour that there was done with
the drone as well yeah it's just an
eerie tour of destruction and decay and
and sort of similarly bunny that one you
did about the drone that toward the Napa
earthquake damage yeah they can go into
places that people can't go yet check
out disaster situations see if that was
your big rescue me this is like the
first like good use I know to this was
last year when we had that huge
earthquake and I mean that huge by 1989
standards but still it was pretty
amazing Mohammed Astor how much damage
that was done in Napa and I wrote this
story this was kind of like before we
had a lot of drone footage of just
regular people taking drone footage and
he was doing this for insurance purposes
but it was really interesting to see all
the damage and he was going in and out
of buildings that had some pretty
massive destruction from this earthquake
and you can it's kind of cool because
you see people in the street like waving
at the drone cuz this is before like
everyone had a drone everyone had a
quadcopter so they're like hey look at
the sky but this is pretty amazing
footage and I and you know unfortunately
when we have that big earthquake that
they keep saying it's going to happen
here
yeah we're gonna get more just like it
did this guy get fined I don't think so
now a long time ago no this is an August
in 2014 so this is before all those
restrictions were in place he didn't go
up too high I mean it was mostly just
building rooftops um when we get to the
Adam Savage footage of him doing the
quadcopter footage he goes really really
high up because he wants to see how far
I mean he's a mythbuster so of course he
wants to see how far I up he can take
the drone and it's really crazy high and
then he brings it back down pretty
quickly because he doesn't want to freak
everybody out but uh that's that's the
kind of I mean that's what we do when we
get electronics we want to test their
limits right we want to see how high
they can go up fast they can go so can
we see that I don't know giving a fine
yeah I know we could talk about other
stuff in between sorry so there was some
there was something like I remember
maybe a year ago somebody had used a
drone to basically get a similar footage
but it was a tornado wreckage in the
Midwest and like floor with that and
then sold that to a TV station and was
fined ten thousand dollars because it
was an you know unregistered commercial
use wait cuz commercial use was still I
don't know if those yeah once he's right
I don't know Steven yeah once you sell
the footage cuz it's like there were
like the beer delivery drone to the
Amazon drones and that's the other thing
are you guys excited about the the
potential for you know like drone
delivery services and what Amazon was
trying to do which apparently the latest
round regulations jive with yeah let's
hear from her gesture I feel like her
gesture hasn't spoken yeah I mean I so I
shoot i use amazon all the time so um
the idea of having drones being able to
deliver things more quickly and the
tingling probably not necessarily more
safely to us so it's M&amp;amp;A i don't know i
go back and forth on the delivery Joan
aspect of things because I I don't
necessarily want to see you know
thousands of drones buzzing about over
the lovely town of st. Paul but um you
might get sued in
well might be glad to have one come to
your women I no no I feel like the wind
chill and ice would take those drums
down pretty quickly they'd freeze in the
sky would assume so I mean it's weird
cuz Parks and Recreation during their
final season they did it because it was
set in was it 2017 it was good because
they totally covered drone so if they
had kind of like a fake google called
grizzle calm and it's like a combination
of Amazon and Google using big data to
spy on everyone in the town in Pawnee
and it was great because they had this
whole episode about drones and of course
Ron Swanson shoots one down because he's
like what is this doing over my you know
property and that's not a big joke
because in Wyoming and Colorado there
you know considering legislation where
it's okay to shoot a drone if it goes
over your property so I have a feeling
there's gonna be a lot of drones used a
skeet shooting um and I don't I don't
know what the what's gonna end up
happening but if you're going to start
using drones for delivering everything
from books to wine better be careful
where you fly over cuz you could get
shot down well yeah and then there's the
possibility like if a drone comes in
here yard in films you you don't know if
it's just going to a neighbor to deliver
something right it's some peeping tom as
somebody mentions in the chat room
paparazzi could misuse them it's gonna
be like neighbors gone wild drums gone
wild footage yeah you don't know and
also I'm really surprised that paparazzi
hasn't gotten it all into this i have
seen drones spying on miley cyrus okay i
have seen excel well that makes sense
Samrat she is doing it well there's so
many like backyards in the hollywood
hills of crazy crap that's going down
with celebrities yeah that if they were
smart the paparazzi would i see this is
like bad idea podcast no bad idea is
like how come they haven't gone to the
nude beaches yet yeah yeah well no those
nude beach where exactly the most
picturesque yeah if you know what I'm
saying but yeah I think that they're not
they're pretty much right but see if I
had a drone these are all the plate I
would be going over Skywalker Ranch I'd
be going over the Pentagon I'd be going
over a body farm which is where they
keep all the corpses for the FBI to
check out to do research like I would be
going over the worst place as possible
well Skywalker Ranch is awesome but body
farm would be horrible drone footage I
would imagine
is rotting so someone do that unless
you're into that someone did crash at
the White House oh that's right that's
right in the White House front yard I
don't know why I call the yeah we did
see it's kind of your do you only pay
yer white out the lawn what I call the
yard like it's like some sort of hail
bill in the fray last year got some
interesting footage anyway so yeah crack
one crashed in the White House lawn by
apparently a drunk former employee take
this government and shove it yeah yeah
we've all we've also seen drones caught
smuggling drugs like that's actually
happened as was in three kilos of meth
apparently um but you seem some internal
crash Gary yeah what is on the whole
debate of if your robots or drones do
illegal things are you held responsible
like but it's one of those autonomous to
it was doing it don't ya love no one was
driving I want to be on that jury and
double crossed its owner and set up in
business for itself yeah it's like it
saw too many episodes of Breaking Bad
and thought I get this the drone was off
I don't know where this stuff came from
it's not mine it's not mine look I don't
even have hands I'm just carrying here's
the drum actually right here it was an I
was a six it had six copter so what any
think what did the hexacopter copter
could that cause the dodeca copter huh
could that copter look any more guilty
look at it's like a copter much that's a
mug shot they're rebooting the wine
under the bright lights yeah it looks
lately drunk yeah it's great i love that
i can't wait till we start having like
drone and robot mug shots because their
owners are not gonna take responsibility
and they're like what's the AI and and
it's learning it's not my fault hey
Anthony didn't you cover some other
stories of drones kind of misbehaving or
being used in the various ways that I'm
leaving out uh yeah so I did those two I
did the White House and the math
smuggler then we also so we had a there
was a tech blogger at I think popular
science who went on fox and friends to
teach drom safety oh yeah and just as
he's starting to talk to them about how
to keep your drone at a trouble he
crashes it into the cameraman
meant to do that but yeah it's Fox News
so you never know yeah I love that I
love they trying to teach safety and the
safety does not happen although i'd
assume you know like like eric over
there it's kind of hard to fly a drone
while trying to talk and ya know
podcaster be on video at the same time
so the kitten will cut him a little bit
of slack and i'm not just saying that
because i used by for Popular Mechanics
I did I've been doing it of course this
whole time yeah I love that every time
area was recently do the drone it sounds
like a dentist office gone wrong really
really scary sound that drone aren't
that you guys want to see the segment of
the guy crashing and have it yeah hang
on business it could come with some real
dangers for everyday Americans Dave
mosier's here Dean generator of popular
science magazine he's here to break down
how drones work now the government might
have good reason to regulate them first
off how they work we sought a little in
the hall that looks like a remote
control and that looks like a drone
that's right you got a remote control
you got 20 ways they need to back this
up that's clearly too technical
information move it around you quiet
custom GUI is the drone that landed at
the White House it looks eerily similar
to Fox News making it political which
means there's a nice little Obama let
that thing land right that's why your
father but the whole the same guard
thanks Obama thing tells me you know I
see these all the time that this was the
same drawing look at my shot green right
that's the one from the White House that
apparently was driven by somebody
expression yeah it's coming off violin
tune it's probably about 30 seconds
you're doing journalism this is called
journalism but why is it important to
regulate in your mind I will women like
the regulation because these are really
powerful little devices there was a kid
in Brooklyn who was actually killed by
one he was 18 years here ago like these
clubs do you like I didn't hear about
that I don't believe this little it's a
lower power one then he was using but
it's important and that was he holding
on to it as he jumped off a cliff things
you don't want to give them initialed er
do you don't want to fly them in the
planes and cause I which is we're
getting to let you follow a drone
efficient this is a phantom DJ one DJ I
I'm not sure what they need super camera
to use for me we don't know why those
particular companies yeah that's right i
will sell mess with texas useful and the
real on trash day all right here you go
she's gonna crash it right aerial
obscene this has got some sort of a
little here we go here you big brother
big brother so you can fly these over
fields you can see how your crops are
doing check out your crops there there's
all sorts of really useful sort of
somewhat benign uses but you know once
that they figured out how to license
these you're going to see them probably
everywhere and I mean with famously
amazon says it going to use these to
drop off packages can you visualize that
I could you know what I'm worried about
those those those are big drones and
Safety's gonna be at your toes did you
turn my team can you turn the camera man
cameras looking at the camera man well
there we go that was pretty scary
comments are in our in our chat room
here says that when issues it didn't
have GPS lock I'm gonna define an
enclosed space this is what happens when
you don't have gigs running things and
gay geeks cuz this is the thing if you
start having all these like people
running drones and cop cop quad quad
copters that don't know what they're
doing cuz I don't read the manual before
it's that thing like this off who knows
what you're having there I know right so
I feel like it's up to us the smart
people do not let these things happen
but I do I don't know if we're going to
get to this but i do love footage of
when drones are killed so I like it when
animals attack drones and quad copters
and this is oh yeah you have this yeah
yes yeah this is now keep in mind this
is a mom kangaroo protecting her Joey so
this is totally respected bull for a
kangaroo 22 yeah they're kangaroos are
supposed to be sort of ill temper yeah
well they're great boxers so immediately
that she sees the drone and run average
Wow
so great you give the hawk yeah the hawk
the hawk is my favorite yeah the Hawks
are pretty awesome now here's the thing
this is you know animals don't take well
to flying mechanical things their size
in their area and birds are notorious
for taking down quad coppers and drones
but this is great oh here we go oh he
just got home you gotta see this hello
man the slow mo is great look at this
hot coming in for the kill Gorgeous
George I went one of these roads
paparazzi and like Sean Penn punches the
drum Yeah right how does it Hawks are
very scary though I golf all the time
and I always Seahawks just killing other
birds ya know I you're ruthless and you
don't want to go anywhere joke you can't
go anywhere near their nests because
they will attack everything in anything
there's no Mississippi kites are the
same way there another bird that really
are notorious for attacking anything
that goes near a tree that has an X in
it so I I don't know why i like seeing
drones destroyed by animals but i feel
like that should be a TV show i would
watch that or at least even animals
attack drones drones i would watch that
i would watch endless amount of footage
of any animal destroying a drone or
quadcopter so i'm just putting that out
there but yeah there's more and more
footage especially a lot of robot robots
and drone makers that are trying to make
drums look like birds I'm that's just to
cause trouble just purely trolling the
end okay we really want them to look at
well I mean this is the whole thing with
the military right as they wanted
surveillance drones that actually could
look like hummingbirds and they were
using the Middle East but in the Middle
East there wasn't that kind of bird that
existed so it was kind of a lot of
planning and actually I the musical made
a pterodactyl at that point that would
be a no right I would love it turned out
like what if they made it look too much
like a bird so you just see footage
that's just kind of like right you
know hey or fake or actual big bird yeah
great but no they are trying to make
them look a little less
a little more animal or bird like or
animal like so they can get away with
surveillance but the unfortunate part of
this is the more you make it look like a
bird the more birds will attack it so
they're having problems should make one
who looks like Mothra yeah i mean i
don't know the possibilities are pretty
endless and they're trying to do more
and more insect looking drones so they
can have mosquito surveillance and that
sort of thing so we'll see swarm of
locusts I mean the military has a lot of
money to do this they can do whatever
they want and when once the military
rejects it we get it at stowe military
should do cat drones because say this is
the look luckiest dad in the world no no
one would ever suspect oh yeah yeah why
not they could have warned me about this
oh hey military this is your next road
yeah that no one will notice that at all
little warning for the cat lady people
oh that guy did it cuz he learned one of
that come on let's go do you have a
union do you have a unicorn chaser drone
video for Kelsey so she can forget that
port I like the Star Wars one oh yeah
this is star wars ones so here's the gay
one I want to do one quick call at a
rude monkey in our chat room pointed out
a use I had never heard of this a Mayo
Clinic he says is actually studying
drone delivery of blood and plasma to
hospitals and clinics instead of using
full-size helicopters to be faster in it
that's pretty cool yeah about that I
can't wait till he uses a plot line on
vampire diaries hijacking blood drones
the sand don't ya know people could
hijack them for money order that's so
gonna be on CSS on yeah the only problem
will God CSI cyber the only problem with
that is if it wrecks that's a gruesome
wreck if legal injury talk about your
mug shot oh yeah I want a drone the
carrying blood to fall on you that is a
bad scene that's a that's a Carey moment
waiting to happen but that'll be in the
next reboot that's kind of cool though
that least they're thinking of you know
life-saving ways for drones to help us
so thanks
so just almost as important as that is
Star Wars like a half a dozen Star Wars
their own stories uh if we want to do
the one that yet so this is the one I
wrote about this weekend this weekend so
this date on the cameras wrong because
just like all most of us we don't set
our date right so this did not happen in
2012 because this copter quadcopter did
not exist then but this guy suited up
his speeder bike vintage toy with a
scout trooper on top and then put the
camera in the scout troopers helmet so
you can get the point of view of a scout
troopers speeding around like it's
indoor but it's really just part the
point of view of this guy cheaper
speeding on Endor is illustrative
fireballs I know yes so cool though
because I was so expression a lot less
than them I there's no Ewoks throwing
sticks at him I was so impressed at how
this is I mean it looks top heavy right
it looks like it would fall and yet it's
doing a great job that's a good point
actually yeah because usually when you
put action figures or any kind of toy on
a drone it's gonna fall immediately but
bunny does in fact know this idea yeah I
tested this out on many things uh
Chewbacca and drones don't mix the fur
gets caught in the quadcopter fans just
say no oh god um but that's a crash
pretty awesome and the cool thing is is
that he has the guy who did this has a
hole in a hole I like I'm not a hole he
has a hole god I'm so excited
instructions on how to do this yourself
on magazine com noni so you can make
this yourself if you have these toys
which I do which I totally want to do
this I just don't have the quadcopter
but I'm totally gonna make one of these
I just let they put a camera in the head
cuz you could do talk about surveillance
no one would know I don't be so stoked
to see that they wouldn't care if it was
like if you saw that at a nude beach
you'd be so excited I mean it way better
than Birds or unitary tactile because we
would be so excited now just be like oh
come on in yeah look at her look at her
yeah cleared but what I love about these
two total of about these crafters is a
lot of them have put tutorials up on
magazine com or instructables com so you
can do it yourself and I think that's
the whole point two is more and more
people are tinkering with these things
they don't feel like I have to be the
only guy with yeah like this one I think
this is the one it's either them a lot
millennium falcon or yep yeah and if it
lights on it dude how cool is this this
is pretty cool he just cut it out if
like some really light rubber material
yeah and then he painted it the LED
light kit on it so I was wondering if
they were heat issues no no heat issues
at all so cool look at that that's
better than the original hunk of junk
okay it's very it turns really well yeah
so much control you hovered with that
thing yeah would help if I got out and
pushed it might you don't have to
impress me you know oh my God we're
gonna just keep putting we know all the
Millennium Falcon quotes I always say
this but it does bother me that I don't
see compartments to smuggle stuff and I
feel like that's important part of the
women that was where she bacchus it no
see he's actually smuggling the
quadcopter that's the beauty of it
brilliant yeah don't tell me the odds
sorry I think that one in there and it's
also the footage is great too because
we're there filming it actually looks
kind of I mean it obviously it's earth
but it's kind of space yet so this is
the time after the in scepter oh sorry
now this still tie fighters just I'm
fighter and scepter which is Vader's TIE
fighter hmm geek alert um pointy this is
pointy but that phone did is this are
the same guy I got a text from
wilwheaton so I had to hold up my phone
Hut name-drop see ya same guy I think
it's even the same drone yeah it's the
same guy the same guy did the ammonium
Falcon did the inspector yeah same same
model dro knees putting different body
on top of that oh my god that's so cool
I wanna see him do you like an OB ones
ghosts John now here's a baby all right
you can't do all of the vehicles and
star wars because they don't think they
really lend themselves for copter
capabilities but like slave one I think
would be a little difficult Abby wing um
yeah even um god there's so many like
I'd love to see a Probot Don John cuz it
would be great for surveillance cuz
that's what but yeah that's what they
were used let's say sorry cool totally
sound cool yeah I don't know I you know
where I was talking to Stephen about
this earlier before the the podcast
why aren't we seeing any Star Trek ones
cuz i would love to see the enterprise
or a Klingon ship maybe I don't know I
thought it would be cool to have other
ships involved come on Firefly fan yeah
I was just out Browncoats I want to see
a serenity let's see a serenity drone
yeah Kickstarter sorry well um for harry
potter fans there is sort of like kind
of like via drone equivalent of
Quidditch which is so this thing that
Anthony wrote about what what's dyro
Anthony hot Anthony yeah so I don't know
if I could describes I bro it there is I
row in a statement it be that they're
they're trying to make drones basically
balls and sports so you know like a
tennis ball you use a little racket to
send the drone back and forth to someone
no I keep thinking it suffice all of
these people in a park I would beat them
up because I first of all you're
pretending to hit a ball which you could
do without a drone for free and also the
second thing is most kids are gonna want
to whack the crap out of them yeah yeah
so anybody under the age of 20 is
probably gonna destroy it within five
minutes I think that's yours for though
I think because you can use a drone to
play with another drone with this thing
and so I think it's for people who
already have a drone and they're trying
to find new stuff to do with it if they
haven't you're trying to justify a
purchase their drone is lonely and needs
a drone friend to play racquetball which
I would understand my wrongly they go to
drone der yeah dad your own der just
wait that's you wait hover left hover
right yeah now if its drone versus drone
that's kind of cool but this just looks
like hipsters and apart or should be
there should be a spy vs spy license one
and yeah so it really is hipsters in a
park and sadly they so this was launched
as a Kickstarter campaign and they only
raised about 2,000 out of their $50,000
goals so this project was not funded as
cool or weird as it was nobody wanted to
be looking like that in the park it's no
hoverboard Kickstarter but what is
really yeah i don't know i just it seems
like I I guess I shouldn't mock people
for trying to do innovating new ways to
play in the park but one seems so
silly it just seems like in a very
expensive hipster hobby where's again if
it's a drone on drone type thing which I
know sounds dirty but if its drone on
drone type sports that's cool but if
it's just people pretending to hit a
ball in the park or brackets and it's a
drone hovering around them I kind of
feel sad for them it's like if you if
you wanted the embarrassment of playing
the wii but outside I don't know I feel
like it'd be cooler if it was a way to
get people to exercise like if you had
drones chasing you like zombie run but
it's a job hell yeah dude well people
already have to chase their drones I
don't know like I saw a lost drone
poster in my neighborhood oh I gave I
gave Stephen the link but i think i have
actually shown that here i think i saw
yeah yeah yeahs por los drone it's just
like a lost pet thing and there's the
there's the area that they think it
probably got lost in then there's a
larger area drawn on that it might have
escaped tuned well maybe we'll start
seeing more and more drug mappings hmm I
don't know people they also kidnap
drones we also like a month ago or two
months ago posted that video of a guy
who his drone was gonna fall into the
water and just ran it like yeah that was
ages on the last second oh they exercise
so just play near water so quick poll to
wrap things up before we have to go is
do a quick poll uh how long do we each
think it'll be until we actually see
drones in our lives on a daily basis I'm
giving it five years oh I feel maybe as
soon as two I feel like we have drones
on in our lives on a daily basis now
anyway Stephen I think for you
professionally hate you we all work for
Craig okay because where you grew up if
you didn't grow up in California I grew
up in Kansas so the only way I could
think drones being used as opposed to
just kids being bored and they want
something to do is for farming
practicing the really small crops crop
dusting is not a bad idea actually cuz
crap testings really super dangerous
ain't like Dustin crops boy might be
illegal now actually I don't know but I
wonder about people growing pot up in
calif like california or their period
because you need to sort of patrol your
boundaries and Walters i got
there's been some stories that have been
floating around the internet about DEA
using drones to find pot fields uh and I
was just saying like I can't wait till
they start finding all dead bodies
because every law and order episode
someone finds a dead body in a park so
now why don't go to the park drones are
gonna be staring well if you watch
secrets and lies you could be number one
suspect so that's why yeah right so I
don't know is really like I feel like
drones will be used more and more
there's a recreational drone so then
there's commercial use drones right so
there's medical drive I think
recreational drones were already medical
insurance I need a drone for my glaucoma
okay oh my god that's such a great idea
I need like a lowers my high blood
pressure I need a helper drone like a
helper monkey anxiety driving an IT
drone um with water balloon let me take
it on the plane I need it I think we're
already there recreationally I think
there's already people have drones for
fun but as far as commercial use drones
I think maybe I'm gonna say we're a year
away I think we're a lot closer I'm
gonna say dramatic pause I'm gonna go
for five years because it seems like a
really good idea and I just expect
somebody's gonna screw it up I think
you're gonna do a price is right we're
gonna get a year in a month okay you're
in a day one dollar Bob I'm gonna go
away out a limb here and say I don't
think it's gonna happen oh really cuz it
regulations yeah I think it's too
complicated too dangerous I don't think
it's gonna happen why we don't have
hover cars yeah what do you say well we
may not be the country that does it
there might be other countries to make I
mean liechtenstein Japan UK had the
mistletoe drone before we got the
missile tone drone what did I do that
was well that was weird cuz the TGI
Fridays want that happened here in the
United States it was a press event and
the pret the journalists knocked it out
of the sky and hit her in the nose like
that was do not taunt the drone don't
taunt the drone I mean muscle tone drone
is just that's high pressure dating
right there one piece of flair how did
it keep its kind they even know they're
on a date yeah I nobody has like
military flash look at that look at this
what happens he goes in for the kiss
come on hello like with my brother and
sister like this guy well depends on
what state you're in it's gonna mess up
your hairs you don't look good
custom I don't know I don't be dry so
that's the thing like it may not be us
it may be Japan and maybe UK where they
don't have the same regulations we do as
far as what's in the sky and what we're
allowed to shoot down and I don't know
terrifically Danny what's your take from
Minnesota yeah uh yeah I'm probably
biased cuz I live you know in the middle
of nowhere although you know million
people live here but um we're probably
still two or three years away Eve and
recreationally so probably I don't know
five to ten years to start seeing drones
flying all around us well here's the
thing to in the Midwest more more people
be apt to shoot them down out of the sky
I little more progressive than that but
maybe now where I'm from Wyoming and
Colorado definitely they already have
that in city council meetings where are
we allowed to shoot drones that come
over our property so I think their trail
Colorado yeah i think it was deer trail
colorado they're less worried about
amazon more worried about big brother
that's you know that's more of a militia
thing i think but anyway i I don't know
I I would like to see more drones I just
don't want me to see my sky flooded with
tiny little drones with tiny little
packages everywhere so well what do you
want me when you say tiny pack something
profound and Nene did yeah sorry
profound or profane either I don't know
it's a tuesday i mean here's the thing
if i get a drone the first place i'm
flying in this area 51 so okay oh
they've already moved everything to the
new place anyway yeah what the apple
complex yeah hey that's a good segue
wasn't there video of a drone and that
new apple i think we're actually
wrapping up oh sorry sorry Eric yeah
Kelsey Kelsey uh Kelsey goes you want
you to take us out yeah keep us on track
go take us out with a teaser for for the
flash completely ever go okay so they're
fast um the flash has been gone for a
month and the new episodes finally
tonight I'm really excited and one
reason I was talking about it with Eric
was that I did a couple posts on crave
about the show and one of them is about
that prison that ridiculous prison that
they have where they lock everybody up
forever with no no rights and no food no
human contact and it's nothing to read
not even a bed right doesn't look like
this
so the network is actually trying to
defuse that I mean not in response to my
post but just a lot of people have been
asking and so they're doing a series of
blog posts now by Cisco is one of the
characters about what great care he
takes everybody only it's so disgusting
like they have one female prisoner and
it's all about how he liked barges in
she like turns her back and tries to
make an go away that you talked about
her boyfriend and he's all mad that
she's friends sending him okay so here's
a romance tip guys you can you can
disappear somebody or you can complain
that she's friends ending you you really
can't do both yeah without sounding a
little slimy sir wow that's like dating
Sims at Guantanamo Bay dating to write
that should not be necessary and yet
apparently the CW's confused about Wow
anyway but I love the show I'm looking
forward to it that's tonight yay hey all
right well I think that's all the time
that we've got for this crave cast the
best of us okay take care of yourself
and we'll catch the next month on the
crib
