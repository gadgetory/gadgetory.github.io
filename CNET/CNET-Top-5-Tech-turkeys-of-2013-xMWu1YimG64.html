gadgets we get to see week to week
people have a tendency to gloss over the
products and trends that aren't faring
so well so with the year coming to a
close it seemed an appropriate time to
look back and reflect on the heights
tech trends that went nowhere in 2013
starting off at number 5 smartwatches
these may still yet become a thing but
this was not the year of the SmartWatch
that everyone predicted people finally
got their pebbles and Samsung did a good
job spinning that Galaxy gear SmartWatch
but most of us are still trying to wait
to see what Apple can do see if they can
actually make these things cool I have a
feeling that the nerds stink on this
trend may have to air out a little bit
before we ever see an eye watch at
number 4 desktop PCs it's been doom and
gloom for the desktop computer for years
now but 2013 was supposed to turn the
tide we saw a genuinely exciting and
innovative Windows 8 machines and all
shapes and sizes hybrids and giant
touchscreen tabletop PCs plus a
meaningful bump and processor
performance there is a perfect storm of
reasons to upgrade your desktop computer
right now but no one is doing it we're
also not going for number three Twitter
music launched in april this year
Twitter music sent shockwaves to the
music industry
oh who would it kill first Spotify
iTunes Pandora will our children even
remember a time before Twitter music I'm
willing to bet most of you probably
forgot this thing existed until I
reminded you I don't even know as
Twitter remembers it exists and their
post IPO haze they probably don't really
care it's just a way for them to stream
music to their yacht party
speaking of companies with more money
than sense at number two Facebook home
the latest attempts from Facebook to
completely take over your phone washed
with the equally doomed HTC first
facebook home replaced the entirely
functional homescreen of your Android
phone with a window into your friends
Facebook activity you never have to
leave Facebook again it's just always
there in your pocket desperately trying
to figure out how to monetize everything
you do not sure why people didn't go for
and that leaves us with the number one
tech Turkey of 2013 at number one
blackberry
remember the good old days when rim
executives are so high on life and gin
that they had to be tied down during air
travel and they still had the winning
spirit to chew through their restraints
these days morale is so low they can't
even muster a scandal not that it would
matter you could have my class of
readings back to working with Justin
Bieber holding a burning Canadian flag
and no one would even bother to report
it at this point so there you go five of
the biggest tech industry fails of 2013
more top fives including my top 5 tech
