Bridget Carey on cnet com and it's time
to get loaded today's top mobile players
are all well known their samsung LG HTC
motorola but this year expect to hear
more about two other smartphone vendors
ZTE and huawei previously these makers
really had most of their business in
China but they've been making a big push
to get into the US market at this week's
Mobile World Congress trade show in
Barcelona Spain they got plenty of
attention Huawei showed off the world's
fastest smartphone and first 10 inch
tablet with a quad-core processor and
ZTE it announced 15 different phones
prepaid phone providers like metro pcs
and leap wireless are starting to carry
their lower cost phones and t-mobile
even carried a huawei tablet facebook
has introduced three new advertising
methods for brand pages when a brand or
company page makes a post such as the
status update or photo that post can be
pushed out to fans and show up as an
advertisement on the right side of their
main Facebook feed page there are also
new spaces to place an ad like the
Facebook log out page Facebook has 37
million users logging out each day so
that's quite a few eyeballs and mobile
users will see more ads too and their
newsfeed and on the mobile log out page
amazon announced it has more than a
hundred thousand ebooks in its kindle
owners lending library and it just
started with about 5,000 books back in
november now the wording can get
confusing but this has nothing to do
with your local library rather it's a
perk for amazon prime paid subscribers
and allows a customer to check out one
book a month from the selection with no
due dates amazon also said it's seen a
growing number of customers reading and
buying independently published books
others can get on kindle devices through
the Kindle direct publishing program and
so far those independently published
ebooks have paid out 1.8 million dollars
to authors Netflix subscribers are
saying goodbye to nearly a thousand
movies from the instant streaming
library as Netflix has lost the rights
to stream movies from stars the movie
channel cut off its four-year contract
with Netflix and thereby cut off access
to Disney movies and other
classic it's like Beetlejuice and
Scarface recently netflix has been
focused on creating several original
series as it competes with HBO for
viewers as smart phones autocorrect can
be a spelling lifesaver or cause a
massive misunderstanding as one student
at a Technical College in Georgia
discovered the hard way a student meant
to text the phrase gonna be at West Hall
today but instead of saying gonna
autocorrect changed it to read gun man
be at West Hall today to make it worse
the text was sent to the wrong number
the receiver alerted the police and
authorities locked down West Hall middle
and West Hall High School ya gotta check
your texts are you gonna be in trouble
those are headlines for today I'm
