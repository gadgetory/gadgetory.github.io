Mac monster trucks and McMansions so it
makes sense that we're finally warming
up to the idea of gigantic phones in
fact there have been a bunch of these
phones out recently that stretched past
the traditional four to five inch screen
size bordering on tablet territory
I'm Donnell Bell and this top five I'm
counting down the five most fabulous
phablets we could find ranked by CNET
senior editor Jessica dual-core starting
off at number five Galaxy mega you want
a big screen from a big brand here's a
6.3 inch from Samsung if it looks
familiar it's because it's basically the
Samsung Galaxy s4 except it's designed
for giants you can find it on Sprint and
US Cellular AT&amp;amp;T has one on contract for
about 150 bucks
the only catch here is that while the
scree may be large the resolution is
stuck at 720p still if you're going for
shock value this is the largest phone on
this list up next at number four the LG
g2 this one swings to the other side of
the spectrum
it's a 5.2 inch screen here that barely
puts this thing into the phablet
territory it's big enough to dwarf the
iPhone but small enough to use about
severe hand cramping 4 star review from
CNET and the availability is on every
major carrier so that makes the g2 a
solid choice at number three with a six
inch screen the Nokia Lumia 1520 this is
the biggest Windows Phone money can buy
it's more like a surface mini you get a
20 megapixel camera a 1080p HD display
and a quad-core Snapdragon 800 processor
that is a first for Windows Phone it's
around $200 on contract exclusively with
AT&amp;amp;T though so that's not a deal-breaker
and Windows integration it sounds more
useful than cycling then this could be
the phone for you if not how about
number 2 HTC One max landing firmly back
in Android territory the one max is
clearly the result of HTC catching
Samsung fever squeezing a flagship phone
for as many spin-offs as they can it's
easy to forgive them though since the
one and all of its family are
pretty awesome its unique take on
Android and there's some great camera
features here
HTC also threw in a fingerprint sensor
on the back of the max which worked for
us most of the time and so that leaves
us with CNET's favorite phablet at
number one the Samsung Galaxy Note 3
another big brother to the s4 and the
brand that single-handedly made the
stylus cool again assuming they were
ever cool you get a beautiful 5.7 inch
screen quad-core processor an excellent
camera and impressive battery life which
is a rare find in a phablet so there you
have it five phones so big people will
swear you've lost weight more
information be sure to check out Jessica
Thome courts spec by spec comparison of
the note 3 the one Max and the Lumia
1520 and for more top 5s from me
