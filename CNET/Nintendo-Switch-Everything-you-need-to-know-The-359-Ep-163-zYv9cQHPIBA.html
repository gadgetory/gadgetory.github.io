it's time for episode 163 I'm pretty
sure of the 359 podcast holy cow guys
it's so good to see you how are you
alfred Inge and Roger Cheng I'm
fantastic how are you doing I'm a little
tired after our journeys and the cnet
road crew roadshow yeah CES but I'm
feeling good a little bit of context
right we haven't had a YouTube stream in
a while largely because well first week
of the year we were at CES second week
our intrepid producer was out in a truck
for the Auto Show so we couldn't really
do the YouTube stream with him we were
able to podcast going but you know you
need someone here pushing the bunny yeah
exactly it's a little bit more
complicated the stream on so this is it
this is our first week back on YouTube
we've got it we've got a great show for
you we're talking about Nintendo we
didn't get a chance to talk about it
last last week because the news hit hit
on Friday right so we're gonna break it
down alfred was actually at the event
will talk about Nintendo's switch will
also talk about nokian blackberry trying
to get back in the game and whether or
not they have a shot so as usual if any
questions leave them in the comments
section we will get to them after the
podcast right on it's good to see
everybody again thanks for coming back
and we'll be in the chat in three
minutes and 59 seconds from exactly 32
welcome to the 359 we talked about the
top tech news of the day only the crap
you want to throw in I'm Roger Cheng I'm
Alfred Aang Nintendo is back with the
switch the console costs three hundred
dollars and launches on March third but
it's already sold out in pre-orders and
almost impossible to get the Nintendo
already had a decent 2016 between
Pokemon go and Super Mario run will this
be Nintendo's you to dominate gaming I
don't think it will be okay I they are
targeting that's kind of their goal
right now they don't want the whole
family friendly this these games are for
kids kind of demographic anymore with
these if you notice in these commercials
that they've been putting out for the
switch it's all you know Millennials
young adults people with disposable
income Brett who are playing it you know
and they're showing them going on planes
you know on the way to work like on a
bus so so this isn't really like the
casual gamer market oh we had hit a
success with when we write no they're
aiming for more of a
cross between basically they want that
casual gamer but they also want the
hardcore gamers to come back for this um
there again aiming at people who have
jobs right if you notice you know people
traveling that's kind of but also you
know they there they've been stressing
this is a home console like they they
don't want you to say so it's bring it
down break down the switch why why is it
called a switch and then what what
what's the appealing aspects well it's a
tablet form factor so it's basically you
can take it out from the dock on your
television and then still play like a
tablet you know on the bus or you know
going anywhere by and the experience is
the same yeah yeah the only difference
is the on TV it has an output of 1080p
okay whereas on the tablet its maximum
output a 720p right but there's joy con
controllers that basically they they
come off of controller they attach on
the tablets you can go you can do gaming
yeah or you can even use them as motion
sensored controllers and kind of like
the wiimotes when you played with them
okay yeah vagator had one to switch it's
kind of like um like a cowboy withdraw
yeah yeah let me pull it out and then
you know there's some sort of game where
you're milking it yes yes there is um
why because it's the it's Nintendo it's
supposed to be you know fun and
interactive we've got like a party
icebreaker kind of game so they're still
going for that demographic on that
that's that's really interesting like I
said it's three hundred dollars which is
a pretty reasonable price especially
given the xbox yep and the playstation
or kind of similarly priced at this
point and it's coming in march third but
it's almost impossible to get already so
next up our own jessica doll court has
an analysis on the return of blackberry
and nokia remember those brands those
story names were have a lot in common
right now i mean they both struggled the
last few years you mean they're pretty
much irrelevant and now they're
essentially licensed brands other
companies have sort of taking over the
brands and slapping them on top of
android phones Albert have you ever
owned a nokia blackberry phone yes I had
the indestructible nokia with a snake oh
yeah and I also had the blackberry pearl
right before I switch to the android g1
the blackberry pearl is really it's one
of those phones that that people credit
as bringing the smartphone
get out to the major mainstream because
it was sort of a a slimmer phone you
know hey it still had physical keyboards
at that little pearl ball and it was a
huge hit Yeah right until the iphone
came and destroyed all of that but it's
just it's interesting that these other
companies it's a these other companies
are basically paid to use the names and
it's just do you think that there's
value know for those names actually
bring these guys back I don't think
there is I think if the phones are you
know I or dud as far as I quality goes
right it doesn't matter what their names
are now and they're going in two
different directions like note the Nokia
is six which is announced a few weeks
ago it's going to China it's more of a
low-end phone alcatel is actually making
the new blackberry phone it's right now
it's codenamed mercury I look to be more
of a high-end affair I don't we'll see
if any of this actually works out but
you know I'm a little skeptical so for
more of these stories check us out on
cnet i'm roger cheng I'm Alfred Aang
thanks for listening first and foremost
for those asking the banana on the seat
is my lunch oh I thought restore scale
maybe if we had a Nintendo switchin here
to Cosette that your entire lunch so
that's kind of sad well that was part of
my lunch I just I threw it on the chance
is it won't little late for breakfast in
New York true first and foremost the
price thing is definitely a polarizing
factor which I'm kind of surprised but I
didn't think 300 sounded that while that
for game console here's the thing though
the people are eighty dollars that's
like way more than an xbox or a
PlayStation so yeah the controller I've
heard that across the board I make
that's always a pro controller she mean
how many ketosis comes with the system
the the two things that go on the side
of it the joy cons okay so what if you
want to just get one that's fifty
dollars and that's if you like kind of
wanna do multiplayer with your friends
you know on top of the 300 for the
console know that guns with that comes
with it and then 1350 gets you a two
player setup no no no no no against your
half of it gets you half of it it gets
so you know how there's the two
controllers on the side yeah each one on
its own is 50 doll know if you gotta
sell them in pairs but yeah they're 80
bucks is a pic yeah they're eighty
dollars as a pair why would you buy one
if you want to milk liao yeah clearly
okay that's you wanna know if you want
to just offer it as a
single like thing for somebody else
because you don't need both controllers
to do multiplayer you can use
multiplayer like one-on-one but there's
certain games where you do need both of
them like their game arms which is kind
of like wii boxing i saw that that look
kind of fun yeah but you need both the
controllers do it you can't I can
imagine many of the games not needing
but why would you gotta buy the one like
I feel like it's if you if you want to
play the like little Pargo I guess you
don't like the second one their concert
/ flu asst I mean go back to the wii
with the moat and the the nunchuck they
weren't necessarily paired right you had
to buy the nunchucks yeah yeah there is
there's a mentality wait so when you're
buying the but it wasn't $80 will you're
buying the pair do you also gain like
that center piece that connects the two
or no how much is that part I haven't
looked at that price yet wow wow so
that's means actually cost really start
to add up after all yes that's then
that's the cost issue here it's not that
oh it's a three-hundred-dollar concert
you thought $300 not terrible for like a
brand new console with like which is
right now when you start nickel and
diming it yeah and then the other thing
too is like why am I paying three
hundred dollars for a console that only
has five games at launch oh but Jake
says it's still a hundred dollars less
and buying a ps4 or xbox one with the
one controller yeah however after this
comes out I cannot imagine a world where
the both of those don't drop price to
compete yeah well do you I mean is this
system really competing against the x
box appears no because also in the chat
and it's very well known knowledge that
Nintendo's not for hardcore gamers I
know that that's that's fair they want
to be the family game center they
cornering that market yeah it's a harder
market to kind of give in your evil it's
it I feel like they're really going
through this this code but let's tie
holder because it did they want to be
they don't want me casual gamers but
they also don't want to be hardcore yeah
so they've got this like super thin now
that's right they're basically looking
for kind of like the nostalgia value of
it like I mean the game he was good for
casual game yes that's why I was such a
huge hit totally and it was a family
board game night right the way you was
trying to be able bit differently I
think that's why I failed yeah really
know as well as much is targeting I
think it's again it's targeting you know
working like T naught teen sorry but
like models yeah we get like Millennials
with disposable incomes they keep
showing people traveling and playing the
games and unless you know
all these teens and families are
traveling together all the time on
planes to play video games it's it's
gonna be you know people that have jobs
that like require them to travel
remember the Sega Dreamcast had the vm
you unit the memory card with a little
is that the thing with this little
screen yeah yeah I got you to take a
portion of your day and you say get it
at first yeah but yeah that was not well
no but this like the ideas I mean I kind
of like the idea that like I can
basically play zelda my TV and then
we've gotta go I could just yeah take
the screen for my dog plug in the
controllers and like bring it over to a
friend's house to that guy fun yeah I
don't like this only online multiplayer
world that we've built for ourselves i
still like that you know bullet popcorn
two liter am I do yeah let's play some
games let's throw some halo course at
won't be on Nintendo but my point was by
this time bi-mart rolls around ps4 xbox
one they've been around a minute it's
time for a price drop that's true in
general yeah I mean if you whether they
are trying to fight with Nintendo or not
yeah I mean there's like a deal about
every two weeks now for those where you
can get like a packet bundles usually
bundles are like 250 and what do we
think we're gonna see bundle wise for
Nintendo probably when splatoon two hits
right well they've already kind of got
like a collector's edition thing with a
legend zelda of course but that's like
one of the very few which is another
thing that they're kind of filtering on
launch titles yeah really light in well
that's that's gonna be a launch title
that I think that's one of the few know
yeah that that's got me together say the
game in action like that's pretty sweet
oh sure i'm not trying to discredit
zelda at all but i'm saying the
library's thin yes yes do have a lot to
look forward to before the end of the
year so i'm imagining a splatoon bundle
and a super mario yeah the modesty
odyssey yeah what did by the way did you
see the mario odyssey game in action
like doesn't go to the real world where
he's like I think he's only in the real
world to go back to his brilliant
apartment in in New donk city right well
in the real world like humans are like
human scale and Mario still like a
little too scared yet is super weird for
me like they could really get my similar
that's the average plumber height I
guess so sar to any plumbers watching
that really threw me off like is so is
he not human then is he like is this a
statement that Nintendo's trying to make
about Mario it's an odyssey all right
you know remember has all the radiation
from the Mushroom Kingdom his warp
here in C comes back and we're just
chasing after taking all those mushrooms
Wilson like Homer's Odyssey when he sees
like the Cyclops and all these like
monsters and stuff this could be Mario's
version of it that's true there's a
thought I think it looks sharp I mean
it's few and far between that a mario
game isn't fun I just heard that Mario
can pay rent in new dog city not likely
from experience well he's like grabbing
coins from everyone he's got a pair
right like don't worry I'm just I've got
my coin I just imagined like the the
movie version of this or what the guy
just running around like from his hand
down pockets grabbing money and running
a people at what's happening well we saw
them they just started it did not oh is
that curb stomping the mushrooms growing
up onto that hey shanna to pancreatic of
old nintendo more like no thanks though
wow good r-iowa sharp yeah who out there
is interested in the switch I mean I
think there's nothing because you're
certainly people artistically wrong with
it but who here thinks that they're
going that direction are you going to
drop what you have you have you changed
plans as its really enticed you were
interested to hear I mean clearly people
are interested right if you can't even
get this thing anymore it's old yeah
we're there there's no food demand but
whether or not there's long-term to man
is still they question for me I think I
think that's part of Nintendo's plan to
make sure that there's long term demand
though that's why instead of you know
packing all their games at launch which
it used to do which is the common
strategy they've added we're gonna
spread it out so you know by the time
you get bored of you know rough of the
wasp attuned to that kind of makes sense
like I am I have attention for like one
or two games at yeah I don't need a huge
library right off the bat but what I
want is a commitment for games down the
line through the life the system what do
they say about third-party developer
support like I mean I they've got the
first probably titles down obviously
Mario and Zelda but like who else is
jumping on this bandwagon well Skyrim
was you know heavily promoted okay all
right they also one of the NBA 2k games
got it um a lot of time no no grand
theft auto no that's fancy I don't think
you're ever gonna see grand theft auto
on a Nintendo console but Final Fantasy
does have a chance of coming back
depending on where what are they is it
still Square Enix where's that come back
standouts great awesome sonic one
is one of the big towers the first
Bomberman game uh new one at that look
2010 oh well yeah little R and again
yeah back to the roots yeah I was
actually playing bomberman you know like
the night before the announcement is
just getting ready Gideon no I didn't
know I was happening I just play
bomberman regularly oh the good game it
is speaking of Sonic mania were pretty
sure that sonic 2017 projects coming to
switch as well right the new 3d one on
retro man i really i think it ain't no
this is sonic mania is the retro
throwback right right by sonic 2017 is
the new brand new there's no full title
for yeah it looks like sonic generations
to we saw the teaser for a while ago and
various coming to fill of any 3d sonic
game very honest don't ya side mania
look we're all speculating here and
what's going on mania i'm interested in
the same approach that capcom did with
like Mega Man 9 yeah so are they
bringing back street fare to yes I'm
exciting but it's not even that much of
like a bringing it back it's for it's
like 20th anniversary okay or so and the
in the exclusive what kind of because
they're taking um they came out with
super street fighter 2 ultra HD for the
PlayStation 3 a few years ago okay yeah
and the graphics look pretty much the
same on that it's basically a remake for
just with like better graphics I guess
so many editions are there's like party
mode now where you and a friend can play
together to beat up the computers oh
they had a clip of like ken and ryu just
like ganging up on m bison and one
really yeah i played that very cool and
then there's two new exclusive
characters there there's evil Ryu which
has been in other street fighter games
and there's also violent ken which
apparently finally unless you Asian
violent before anything so what like on
offense is original can just sort of
like passive can now by default I wonder
if that's some kind of a saurus to
America but do they do anything
differently just like slightly different
colors there's like different like frame
a mortal kombat trick okay something
like our socal swap now that's what I
think a large consensus in the chat is
generally like this looks okay I don't
know if it's going to boom on the launch
day a lot of people like I'm gonna wait
see yeah I think they're wrong I mean
look at all the pre orders that have
been like sold out already
uh I mean there are a lot interesting is
not gonna sell yeah then what I'm gonna
break any records on this one oh no no
um I'd however however bones says looks
like the best nintendo console since
Game Cube Wow I don't think he's wrong
wow I did I think I can agree with that
in terms of aloma game in terms of what
the terms of quality of gaming I think
in terms of Zelda was a big factor and
buying it for Harrison Harrison Hale
okay um yeah that mean the zelda game
look beautiful say I can I got a lot of
pre-orders there were a lot of
pre-orders that look right here in the
chat I'll do we know what backwards
compatibility is gonna be like it's not
gonna have any there are they gonna have
a similar arcade or weddings like the
damage endo shop yeah like an emulator
there there were games yeah they're
working on a virtual console for its new
membership subscription you know so this
is the first time that Nintendo is
actually going to make you pay for your
subscription services sounds about right
that was coming along yeah but one of
the things that they're doing with it as
a reward for any subscriber is you get a
free nintendo nes or you know super
nintendo game every month but you only
get it for that month yeah that's like
that's kind of like what would a UH was
a little bittersweet for me like having
the game for the month and i think it's
gone you can buy it I'm sure yeah but
it's a free game like they didn't know
Microsoft and Sony give free games yeah
right and you keep those games yes what
titles would be a deal maker for you
like we talked about Mario we talked
about splatoon here I'm gonna bring up
mariokart mariokart yet but a new more a
card like you just revamped about it are
eight right just so there's no one
solution schedule-wise coming out
between arms puyo puyo tetris Xenoblade
sonic fifa kingery says if madden gets
on there it's a done deal for him i'm
sure that would be a dumbbell front yeah
they've got EA sports there so yeah you
imagine man is gonna be there look just
give me the gamecube virtual console and
give me super smash brothers melee HD I
can't imagine what they're gonna do with
the next myth I will annexed smash
though I will buy a switch just for that
and have that one game on it I just give
you super smash brothers it's all I why
who doesn't want some ass come on
everybody let's smash yes
specifically many hours melee but yeah
what what deal breakers or deal breakers
are makers in the chat we're interested
to see what what's going to bring you to
the switch yeah i'm trying to think back
like for me I would love to see a new
Prince of Persia oh yeah hasn't been
exclusive to anything by right I would
be interested to see the mechanics of
work in this and I think that's a good
platform for it personally if it went
more the stylized like the prince of
persia like the reboot one that came out
in the xbox 360 in like what two
thousand eight that really reboot no no
it went kind of the other way it was
more cel-shaded oh really yeah oh I know
you're talking about I'd like to see
something like that I'd love to see Star
Wars come back to Nintendo see like a
rogue squadron exactly Rogue Squadron
when you know squadron again yeah but
got rogue one we need like right the
chronicles of rogue won the game in
Rogue Squadron format I'm definitely
into that hey here's another bold
question do you think this is just like
a souped-up nvidia well yeah it's
running on the same like kind of engine
but didn't they do this exact same yes
setup yeah what year was that um 2014 or
2015 it was a shoulder yeah those two
it's two years old yeah I guess so and
they actually just updated it to the
shield so yeah this is what it's more
it's nice as a room on Android right cuz
that no Club Claudio's a man after my
own heart Metroid no yeah we haven't had
in awhile especially with this new
system to that like the way that they're
trying to do where you can do
multiplayer if you like can hand off one
controllers your friend but then it
comes to this whole like screen watching
kind of thing yeah but what if two
people have their own switches there we
go that's where it gets interesting yeah
imagine the mobile k so do you talk to
each other yeah yeah no they can yeah
okay okay they showed it off in one of
their um in the first trailer for
directly then bring your switch over
your friends place when they did that
splatoon tournament ideas like Lane says
they need a Pokemon game I don't know if
they're gonna put a Pokemon game on it
I'm sure they went home yeah but pokemon
snap to take the switch out in the field
and get the
augmented reality gonna do that though
but what is that they're gonna do that
though they would do that on the 3ds
which has the camera on it you're right
and potent as always as excessively
you're right you're right it's on Wi-Fi
how's it can I yeah it's it is there's
got one okay yeah but is it uh it well
there's no cell connection like pokemon
go when theoretically will work on this
thing no yeah I my thinking outside the
box I'm an interesting note that Reggie
brought up when I spoke to him well one
me and Scott spoke to yep so battery
life is a big concern for it so it's
only got about like two to six hours of
battery life depending on what game that
you're playing some pretty big scope
yeah uh they said legend is auto run you
about three to four hours wireless oh um
but it has USB see on it and um battery
packs like the like power banks like
they'll end up working for it with us bc
theoretically plug into like if you're
thinking like an airplane the USB le
yeah looking there yeah but also like
the fact that it has like battery packs
on it is that's really interesting to me
so that that that was a good move on
their part yeah uh I mean you brought
this up in your in your interview like
this is this is kind of a portable
gaming device but they have a 3ds and so
yeah which is a huge hit for them
Holly's to coexist as much as you know
Nintendo wants to say they're not gonna
cannibalize each other and it's not
gonna cut into their market it
definitely well I think the way that
they're trying to keep them apart is the
types of games I think it's because he's
saying that these are higher quality
game yeah that in Nintendo is basically
saying you know we're going to keep the
games for the 3ds kind of more like
kitty and you know family friendly kind
of stuff which makes sense as a parent I
don't know if you'd want to buy your kid
a three-hundred-dollar console that
because it's portable it's probably easy
to lose or break yeah yeah um and that
as opposed to getting your kid a you
know hundred two hundred fifty dollar
like handheld 3ds right um where that's
not like as likely to happen right it
folds in is a little bit more terrible
yeah like that's the thing like yes but
I have a kid old enough to have all
these things like I'd become
uncomfortable with them like lugging
this tablet like advice around like just
like I'd be uncomfortable with them you
know what
ipad right like yeah it is dropping
break I've seen that happen when it'll
make cases though like they do for
mobile phone so what is a case of in the
case around the controllers well it's
really kind that's what that awkward
setup is but then also as a kid though
if I like what like I'm probably gonna
want a switch as opposed to a 3ds we're
just one of those things like if i get
if there's better games on it brand
there's you know more engaging like
gameplay and would you only school
online services question though would
you feel comfortable playing the switch
on the subway probably uh yeah i read my
tablet on the subway all right like I'll
be like I feel like I just a target for
a mugger at that point everything I
target for a mugger I'm always a target
for a mugger that's true Jerome is
wondering if Nintendo plans to go VR
with the detachable screen and maybe an
additional headset I think they'd have
to introduce additional hardware for
this because I can't imagine I it's
exaggerated it's a pretty big screen
which looks like this which is a
cardboard with this strap your face oh
man that's a good love right now there's
no plans for VR but they do the camera
does have like a our capabilities so
okay I am interested in kind of like if
they're doing something similar like
Pokemon go yeah it's on the move you can
I guess yeah I can see ya for sure
animalcrossing Dark Souls a star fox
Doctor Who star fox yes i can today not
retire starfox because of the last one
yeah the last one kiss it was terrible
it wasn't terrible but it was just
severely underwhelming just get a 3ds
and play the star fox 64 remake on it
that's what I do it's great I have a
phone I don't need another portable
device don't look around a lot of people
the demo just get your star fox I don't
see a donkey kong country yeah I was
less sums less enthusiastic about that
one but that's got a hardcore following
oh yes absolutely absolutely I'm sure
all these first you know these first
party games are coming they have to be I
think animal crossing oh they're gonna
keep that hokum on stadium probably yeah
it works better in that what the heck's
pokemon stadium it was pure battle oh
