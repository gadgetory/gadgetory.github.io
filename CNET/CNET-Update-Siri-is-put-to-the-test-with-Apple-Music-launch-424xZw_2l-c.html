Siri play the theme from CNET update
Apple music went live Tuesday morning
with the release of the iOS 8.4 software
update
adding the new streaming service inside
of the main music app on the iPhone and
iPad you also find it in the newest
version of iTunes on the desktop Android
is getting it - yes Android but it's not
until the fall also inside the music app
you'll find the beats 1 radio station
it's a live 24/7 broadcast with real
deejays and advertisements and you can
listen to all that for free with an
Apple ID but as for the Apple music
on-demand part that costs $10 a month
and you get the first three months free
you'll need to manually cancel before 3
months or it'll start charging the
credit card you have on file with Apple
to disable auto renewal click the icon
to manager account then click view Apple
ID select subscriptions then toggle off
that way you won't be charged when the
trial ends
Apple music tries to learn what you like
and offer custom playlists that match
your taste but first you have to tell it
what you like and hate based on these
broad category bubbles and you keep
diving in deeper telling it what artists
you like now one of the things that
makes apple music unique is theory you
can ask Siri to pull up the most popular
song on a certain day this song from a
movie or the most popular song from an
artist not all artists have allowed
their songs to be played on Apple music
you may find yourself spending time
trying to stump theory and she will not
always get it right
play the song from Breaking Bad nope
that's from the Twilight movie Breaking
Dawn Walter White would not approve in
other news the car hailing service uber
is working on building its own mapping
service uber now owns some of
Microsoft's Bing Maps technology along
with the data center and reports say the
deal also included about a hundred
former Microsoft employees uber is
trying to move away from its dependence
on Google Maps by creating its own map
system and although Google was an early
investor in uber
it seems Google and uber are becoming
competition not only are both companies
getting in the instant delivery service
but both are making their own
self-driving cars and speaking of Google
it just updated its hangouts messaging
app for iPhone and iPad yes it comes to
Apple before Android the new layout
makes it easier to send things beyond
just text and that includes stickers you
can also send multiple photos at once
Google says the Android versions coming
soon that's it for this tech news
