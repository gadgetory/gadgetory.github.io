Apple watches on my wrist one from 2015
and one from 2011 Apple made a watch
before but it was called the iPod Nano
and I wore this for years proudly why
did I do it well it was fun and it
didn't cost that much you could buy an
iPod Nano for 129 or 149 and then you
get the band separately but you could
attach it look at the time ton of nice
watch faces but it was an iPod it stored
eight or sixteen gigabytes of music it
actually had apps so you could use an FM
radio voice memo I had a fitness tracker
Nike support so it acted like a
pedometer what did it lack well it
didn't have any bluetooth for one so it
was completely disconnected from your
phone had a headphone jack for listening
to music but if you wanted to put music
on it you had to actually connect a 30
pin cable and sync it to your computer
to get all of your music and podcasts on
to it it also didn't have any of the
other extra features like heart rate
monitors or Apple pay obviously any of
that stuff but it was more affordable
and it was simpler that's something that
the Apple watch for all of its extra
features maybe could aspire to a bit
more now you can still buy an iPod Nano
but it doesn't have this little design
you can't turn it into a watch anymore
you got to pay $350 for the Apple watch
maybe Apple will make a more affordable
watch someday in the spirit of the
detachable iPod Nano that'd be a pretty
fun idea</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
