speakers like they used to
they're all made of plastic now even the
$500 ones a British company name is one
company trying to redefine what a
wireless speaker is with its new Muse
ear Ange
the Muse oqb maybe a $1000 speaker but
it also looks like one it's completely
covered in metal and all of its
appointments feel premium especially the
gorgeous touch panel with its weighted
aluminum volume control the removable
grill hides a tiki mask full of drivers
which also includes two passive bass
woofers instead of a port this enhances
bass response and also means you can
stick the speaker in a corner without it
getting Bhumi the mezzo is foremost a
Wi-Fi speaker and it comes with a remote
control app for both Android and iOS
it lets you stream music from your
networked computers as well as stream
Spotify and tile or if you want to play
music from your phone there's also
Bluetooth pitted against this high-end
competitors the name is very very good
but still not the best for the money it
offers a very vocal forward sound which
offers excellent articulation but it's
limited by the size of the cabinet and
can sound boxy or veiled with some
instruments if you want a speaker that
looks amazing and sounds good to the
muse oqb is a nice piece of equipment
yet it is part of a very competitive
field and many people will probably be
better off spending half as much on the
Sonos play five</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
