pretty simple all you have to do is dump
in the ingredients and let the Sam mixer
do the hard part plenty of companies
make stand mixers but there's one brand
that stands out above the rest so Sam
mixers you know brought not only a lot
of power to to mixing at home but also
the design changed if you think about
the shape of a KitchenAid paddle
attachment it's like a some width kind
of broad flat beater and in the design
of it allows for a creaming motion which
is when butter and sugar are smeared and
a flat plain and then fold it over each
other and when you look at doing
something by hand or with a hand mixer
and that's just cutting the butter it's
it's not folding it over
it's just slicing it very rapidly so
being able to have a machine that
incorporates so much air into an baked
goods to do those and batters really
change the style of baked goods that
were available in America
the first version of the stand mixer
arrived in 1919 from the Hobart
manufacturing company which would
eventually become the brand kitchenaid
we talked to Megan Elias a historian and
the director of Boston University's
gastronomy program about the new
machines that arrived in the kitchen
during this time it comes along really
with electrification when you start to
see electricity in ordinary people's
homes which is really the 1920s I mean
you have electricity you can have
appliances so mixers first of course are
in like professional kitchens they have
them the smaller version that comes into
the home kitchen they're really an
object of the post-war period so 1920s
people are still going out for their
entertainment but it's in the 50s with
super urbanization that families started
really inviting other folks over and
having parties in the household as
people hosted more gatherings in their
home KitchenAid wanted to give them a
product that was worth showing off
something that was less industrial and
it felt more like it belongs in the
kitchen how do you make appliances more
approachable the answer across the
industry was to add color
we've always tried to be on the leading
edge of color so we went from having
just a handful of colors maybe 15 20
years ago to now we have over 90
different colors the ability to
personalize the stand mixer added two
kitchen aides appeal one of the early
projects I was involved in as an
engineer was launching several new
colors
I remember our customer service manager
that was in-house come to me and was
asking for some samples of the new
colors and stuff and I wasn't sure
exactly why and they actually knew of a
customer that was constantly calling in
and asking about new colors because this
person actually collected them in fact
some people design their entire kitchen
around their mixers paint job that's
just something really you know powerful
about the allure of that kind of
customization and that you can have you
know these bright alluring colors for
yourself as I mentioned earlier I I got
one in the cup Burke and he read and
paint in my kitchen to match it does
seem to be a way that you make a
statement about what kind of kitchen you
have right is it a is it a kind of
throwback retro kitchen and you have a
paint mixer like pale green one or are
you being like a modern slightly
masculine kitchen with a black mixer or
a steel mixer machinery in the kitchen
expanded what desserts you could make it
home before this people ate more pies
they more puddings
there are lots and lots of different
kinds of desserts that you don't see
anymore but the stand mixer makes
specifically layer cakes much easier to
do and so that becomes the standard of
wow he really did something we invited
professional Baker and editor Stella
Parks to show us how stand mixers make
angel food cake possible
what's really cool about my method is
the most angel food cakes you'd start
whipping the meringue and then you ask
really careful like add a little bit of
sugar add a little bit of sugar add a
little bit of sugar so the thing is that
method is based on 19th century
technique when people just have the
Godot ver hand beater hand crank
situation but with a mixer as powerful
as the KitchenAid you can literally just
put all the sugar and egg whites in
there and then just whip it up so the
goal of this kind of meringue is as a
really runny meringue you don't want it
to be anything that is stiff by any
means but you do want it to have enough
structure that it kind of it begins like
mound up on itself in the bowl and
that's how you know it's ready this
particular technique is based on the
availability of a stand mixer and it's
not something you can do without one
it's not something you can do with a
hand mixer so it just it's it's
definitely a recipe that's tailored to
the power and design of a modern stand
mixer
our business is all about building kind
of a passion around cooking and part of
that comes from the memories of using
our product with you know our mothers
and our grandmothers or our dads in the
kitchen and the fact that the design has
been consistent since the early 60s the
product still looks like what we would
have remembered with our parents in the
kitchen in a factory in Greenville Ohio
about 1200 people paint inspect and
assemble KitchenAid stand mixers much of
this work is done by hand you find that
perfect mix of quality and design that
kind of touches that nerve with people
the first thing comes into mind is like
what coke went through with New Coke
they had a product and they had a design
they had something that worked and then
they changed it you know we really
haven't it worked really well in the 60s
it works really well now our product
looks just as good in the kitchen now as
it did 50 60 years ago each stand mixer
has a history take this yellow model
it's almost 50 years old and it's still
making cookies these things last for so
long people get attached
I had this beloved you know KitchenAid
mixer that was like the family mixer
growing up that I learned to bake on and
I was coming over to like visit my
parents and I was like driving to their
house it was like a rainy day and I
pulled into their driveway and I saw my
precious baby sitting on the curb by the
side of the road just rained on this - I
know it's like I jump out of the car
like pull it in and you're like I'm all
like wet and dirty cause like dirt
splashed up on it what are you guys do
man capably it was like I don't know it
was like seeing your dog it but there's
something it was like this precious this
precious memory of my childhood just by
the curb so I took it back up to their
house and you know honestly at that
point it it really did need to be sent
off to the farm but I just couldn't bear
to be aware of that transition I just
it's in a better place I need to not
think about it
it's just very important that that
people never have a bad or negative
memory of the product about it not
working or about it not doing its job
because then they're not going to have
that that desire or passion to own one
and and most of our customers are
passionate about what they do in the
kitchen and they they really want that
product but it's important that that
they always have good you know memories
and and solid memories of it working
when they were a kid and when they were
growing up
