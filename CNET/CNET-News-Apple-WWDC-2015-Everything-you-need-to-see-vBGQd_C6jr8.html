millions and millions of songs that we
have on itunes for you recommends
playlist and albums that we think you're
going to love now let's talk about radio
beach one its worldwide it is live it is
broadcasting 24 by 7 and it is coming
from New York LA and London and that is
radio Siri is a great assistant but the
best assistants are proactive so say you
like to run in the morning and when you
do you'd like to listen to music well
now your phone can learn that about you
and when you plug in your headphones can
offer up now playing automatically right
on the lock screen and this is all
context sensitive to the time the place
and even the devices are connected to so
you do the same thing in the car later
on and it might offer up the emo the
audio book that you've been listening to
let's start here on my iPad and what I'm
going to do first is double tap on the
home button and you'll see our new task
switcher of course often when I'm in an
app like Safari I then I just want to
quickly check my messages so now with
just a single finger swipe from the side
I can slide it right in with what we
call slide over and of course it's fully
interactive right here I can take a look
maybe type of response put it right back
I'm back in Safari let's bring in
another app I'm going to bring in the
new notes app just like that now
sometimes of course I want to stay
working in notes and Safari both at the
same time so i can just tap here on the
divider and now i'm in split view
they're both completely active in fact
for the first time ever multi app
multi-touch i can move them both at the
same time now your first task of course
in a demonstration or whenever you wake
your mac is finding the cursor and el
capitan makes this easier than ever i
just do that little shake we all
normally do there it is it comes right
out to greet you it's really handy now
in Safari I have some sites that i like
to keep around because i refer to them
on and off throughout the day and now in
safari i can pin those sites just like
this so there's i'm going to pin my
twitter site here and of course have
been following the Warriors go warriors
we're going to get
done now we've done something totally
new to El Capitan and it's the ability
to work really easily on to windows side
by side so I'm just going to click and
hold here on the green button and you
see it then prompting me to pick a side
I'll just drop it in and you notice i
get an expose of all my other windows
let me pick the new news app just like
that thank you i am really excited to be
the first person to show you our new
news app it's right here on the home
screen the first thing news wants to do
is get a sense of what i like so it's
going to give me a short list of really
great choices to choose from and you'll
see as I tap additional recommendations
come in on the bottom to give you even
more choices so I read Atlantic wired
New York Times an ESPN so I'll tap Done
news creates a personalized feed called
for you it's based on the choices I just
made and it's all my news in one place
you can see it looked great it's easy to
scan and it updates every time I check
news with the expansion of Apple pay in
the new types of cards we've decided
it's time to rename passbook to wallet
one place for all your credit and debit
cards loyalty cards boarding passes and
more we told you last year that our
ultimate goal was to replace the wallet
and we are well on our way to doing just
that we don't mine your email your
photos or your contacts and the cloud to
learn things about you we honestly just
don't want to know we all of this is
done on device and it stays on device
under your control
and if we do have to perform a look-up
on your behalf for instance for current
traffic conditions it's anonymous it's
not associated with your Apple ID it's
not linked to other Apple services and
it's not shared with third-parties why
would you do that you are in control
that is intelligence an iOS 5 what if
you could go forward in time and
actually see that information update on
your watch face well we're supporting
that and watch os/2 was something that
we call time travel and you'll be able
to rotate your digital crown and you can
go both forward and backward through
time and the information will update
right on your screen when I rotate the
crown you can see it's changing the time
and it's showing me things that are
coming up so you can see all the
information that you like to see in the
time that you want to look at really
really fun way to interact with time on
your watch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
