Percy met in New York and I'm here with
ebay okie globe-trotting DJ EDM
superstars
see you thank you for coming in yeah so
anyone who's seen any of your shows your
fans know technological spectacle is a
key part of your performance can you
talk about any of your very favorites
whiz-bang showstopper technological
performance elements my LED wall is kind
of like the narrative thread that runs
from the beginning ahead of my show it's
a huge visual of the song and then you
have the lights and you have the
ambience and the feelings that really
elevate your emotions and certain webs
and flows of the songs just seemed like
the evolution of festivals festivals are
entirely this experiencial feeling where
it's obviously more than auditory you
know it's like you're seeing there being
like completely overwhelmed by your
visual stimulation the lights they're
like kind of strobing at you and
obviously the energy around with all the
people plus a good cake in the face
really make you realize got a Steve Aoki
show which is very important to me
are there any tech spectacles that
you've really wanted to pursue but it's
the technology just isn't there yet
anytime you wear some sort of like the
oculus rips kind of technology and you
try to apply that in your shows it's
been a fail it hasn't worked yeah
because it's just like it's just too
clunky it needs to be easy and it's got
to be like ding you know like it's got
to be like already in your brain or
something I think we're all trying to
integrate more tech into our experience
because that's that's the driving force
of my business is is providing that
experience to my fans through my like
you know I make the music that brings
them into my show right
they're like excited like see me play
you know these songs that they're
hearing in their car or with their
at the parties and they come for that
you know for that reason and then I have
to present it in a way where they leave
going that was the most insane
experience your interest in technology
and feature ISM imbues your music yeah
you talk about some technological
progress that really excites you okay so
for music making it's it's been an
ongoing evolution of going from big room
studios to a singular laptop and
headphones so that's been the evolution
to make that easier you know I think
Tech is supposed to make things easier
for you so like the things that you love
to do it's like about how accessible
that is to your life what do you think
about on the consumption side of music
we've seen this transition from owning
CDs to downloading tracks to streaming
where the universe of music really is
open to anybody at any time as much as
you want how have you seen this movement
to streaming impact your career or
impact the popularity of EDM okay so
impacting my career has helped me
immensely because I cross the onerous
constantly the streaming platforms allow
me to jump into producing songs with you
know with the k-pop artists like BTS
because of streaming artists like BTS
are global and are getting massive
attention in America that you know a
country that doesn't speak Korean but
they love BTS or working with Latin
artists where like streaming once again
has has increased the global
globalization of Latin music to to to
the point where my song with daddy
yankee that's a entirely spanish song
song is bigger in countries like france
and italy than it is in spanish-speaking
countries you know because of streaming
streaming is a big deal
but my songs that are streaming in big
ways are songs that where I've jumped
into different worlds like working with
Lou Tomlinson from one direction it
would just hold on and now my new song
Pretender with AJ or little Yaya another
genre-bending
record I suspect you know high string
you think you so much for coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
