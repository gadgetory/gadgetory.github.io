worries I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your cnet update Big Brother could soon
be reading your emails if a bill in the
US Senate is passed next week there's
proposed legislation that would allow
law enforcement to access email and
social media accounts without a search
warrant government agencies could access
facebook posts Twitter direct messages
and files in Google Docs with only a
subpoena a warrant needs to be signed by
a judge to show probable cause and the
FBI and homeland security could get full
access to internet accounts without
notifying either the owner or a judge
this bill is scheduled to be voted on
next week Facebook is taking a page from
google plus and testing out photo
syncing for some users on Apple devices
photo syncing could be a huge privacy
worry for many it automatically uploads
all the images on your phone or tablet
saves them to facebook on a private
folder in your profile and you can later
choose which photos if any you want to
share publicly it's supposed to make it
easier for you to post more photos on
facebook and google+ has a similar
feature right now it's being tested on
iOS apps but there were reports it was
tested on Android phones back in
September it's not something Facebook is
hiding there's a blog page posted with
facts on how it works and going back to
Google+ it's now allowing you to link
your YouTube account with anonymous
nicknames back in July the only way you
could link your YouTube and Google
account was to change your YouTube
handle to your real name but that's not
the case anymore you can even rename
your Google+ page into your YouTube
channel identity because not everyone
wants their full name on their YouTube
channel there could be a problem with
the latest Apple TV software update
first reported by AppleInsider some
users are saying their Apple TVs are
dead after installing the update and the
box just has a blinking light with a
black screen other users say the
streaming box can no longer connect to
the internet if that happens to you see
if Apple's customer service will replace
it for you with a new one for the first
time you can buy a Skype gift card skype
is free when you want to chat between
two users logged in online but it costs
money when you want to call a mobile
phone or home phone or
a text message you'll find these cards
in stores or you can buy them online if
you're still having woes over apple's
new maps here comes Nokia's app called
here maps it's a free app powered by
navteq and users can view matt's get
real-time traffic data a satellite view
you can save map areas for later viewing
there's also the Handy step-by-step
voice guided navigation as well as the
ability to share a map with someone else
the app is designed for iPhone and iPad
but Android users could see this in the
coming months that's your tech news
update you can find links to all these
stories on the blog sina com / update
