I'm cnet's car tsuboi joined by Cena's
senior editor Jessica dole court big
amazon event this wednesday in seattle
we are both going and to confirm
everyone's invitation today members of
the press received a copy of this book
mr. pines purple house with a note from
amazon CEO Jeff Bezos apparently it was
his favorite childhood book we don't
really know what it's going to be
unveiled at this event this should give
us some clues right hopefully right I
did pour over it trying to unlock those
clues what stood out was that they want
to do something really different okay so
the rumor is that Amazon is going to be
unveiling a phone and this book is about
50 white houses all in a row which is a
common complaint in the smartphone
industry so at the end of the book mr.
pine paints his house purple in order to
stand out now I don't think that means
that Amazon is going to be releasing a
purple phone because that would be too
literal but it does suggest that they
want to really stand out from the crowd
they've already taken on tablets so it
might be the smartphone's turn now
there's also been some rumors about some
of the phone's features potentially
including 3d whatever that means right
so 3d can mean a lot of things amazon
did release a teaser video that showed a
device it was off screen but people's
reactions to it where wow this is really
cool comparable to anything I've seen
I've never seen anything like this
really innovative I love it and it moves
with me and that it moves with me part
people are really latching on to and
thinking that that means that there's
some sort of 3d experience in the
interface and maybe it shifts as you
move with viewing angles things like
that 3d could also refer to spatial
gesturing that's something that
smartphone makers have been working on
and there are reports that the device
could be studded with infrared cameras
and that would track motions as well a
lot of other manufacturers have tried
you know 3d capabilities and let's face
it a lot of manufacturers have tried
making smartphones but they're not
always successful what makes amazon
think that they could do a smartphone
well and a 3d smartphone well two really
great questions first of all 3d in the
past meant dual cameras on the back to
take 3d photos and then also meant 3d
gaming
we're at a place now where processing
power is even more robust than it was
before so if we were to talk about 3d
gaming which this focus really isn't on
then that is something that could be
supported with much richer graphics than
before I don't think this means 3d
photos as well so again 3d has a lot of
different meanings in this industry and
I think that that could just be a
catchphrase for actually something
really different like gesturing for
example as to why amazon wants to make a
smartphone I mean why not people sort of
wondering how Amazon was going to break
through with the tablets because they're
a digital portal for goods and then they
also have their electronic you know
publishing right so a lot of ebooks and
magazines and things like that but they
have made a success out of the kindle
fire they use google android as the
backbone but it's not purely strictly a
google experience because you can't go
into the play store and just download
anything amazon actually stamps its own
kind of experience on top of android so
that's what i think that we're going to
see here with smartphones what they
typically do in addition to that is they
highlight their own store and they also
bring the price down to make it very
competitive right so at this point i
think that amazon's brand has cachet and
they'll be able to travel with it a
little bit another thing is the company
is huge and it's wildly successful and a
lot of money rimming with money so they
could afford to take some mistakes and
take some risks what are they to lose
exactly yeah well it'll be fascinating
to see on Wednesday do you think Jeff
basis would be making the announcement I
would be surprised if you weren't
especially since he's putting his name
on the book exactly Jessica thank you so
much and be sure to tune in to cnet
before the event starts around ten
o'clock on wednesday morning Jessica and
Roger Cheng we'll be live-blogging
before the event that starts at
ten-thirty yes thank you so much cygnett
