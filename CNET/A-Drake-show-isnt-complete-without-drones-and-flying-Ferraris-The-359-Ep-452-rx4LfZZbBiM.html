the USB implementers forum reminds
consumers that USB if' logos are
displayed on certified USB products so
the next time you're shopping for a
reliable USB charger cable or device
look for the logos get the whole story
at enabling USB org welcome to 359 I'm
Rutter Chang I'm Afra dang concerts are
no longer just about the music our
resident Drake's superfan I was at the
artists concert at Madison Square Garden
earlier this week and he's here to break
down the technology actually a lot of
technology that was in the show right
yeah there's a lot of tech going on at
Drake's concert of whom I am NOT a super
fan you know one of it like when he's
performing you know in my feelings the
whole stage turns to this giant iPhone
10 there's another part where there's
like some basketball challenge where the
stage looks like this Tron thing going
on it's like Tron yeah yeah and then
let's talk about the drones name oh
that's the most technologically advanced
thing going on right so they have about
88 drones fly out to two of his songs
and like how to do this whole choreo
thing at one point they're all flying
around him like he's in like the middle
of some sort of drone tornado right and
they're all autonomous so there's no
pilot they're like controlling these
things and I've seen the drones show at
the Bellagio from Intel at CES and I
have to say like this one definitely
looked a lot more advanced than that one
did you know but it might be because
they were much closer so Intel's drones
are really good for like outdoor shows
like right the Super Bowl or the
Olympics
these are all focused on being indoors
which is a lot more challenging because
you don't really have a GPS outside or
anything like the space is smaller right
yeah yeah yeah so what they do is they
have this kind of like small satellite
inside they call it the catch
localization unit yeah just think of it
like a small satellite indoors that like
scans the entire place and then like it
basically makes a small GPS map of the
building that you're in right and then
it sends coordinates to these drones and
tells them like you should be here at
this time and like where you going all
that and the key thing here is a lot of
this is automated right it's not like
individual pilots or anything yeah so
they basically just spend maybe like a
day or two teaching
like the tour grew like how you should
do this and then they send them on their
way if there's anything that goes and
goes wrong with it they can like take it
over from like remotely so they don't
need to go on tour with Facebook if
Drake or anybody like that and I looked
at the remote control for it it only had
like four buttons this thing looks
intrusive understand it's literally like
a plane stop or something yeah it's like
play stop abort and then like like start
or something like that yeah all right
ZTE is taking a big step towards
comeback with a debut of the axon 9 Pro
this is the first phone since the
company has come back really was
virtually left for dead after those US
sanctions forced it to stop its
operations as you remember President
Trump stepped in forced to compromise
between the Commerce Department and ZTE
allowing the company to get back in
business
this phone by the way isn't available in
the US but what do you think like this
is they've had this huge controversy
scandal around them
ZT kind of dead in the u.s. there is
there like a hidden app on the phone
that's just like Thank You America for
sparing us er well since it's not over
the u.s. I highly doubt it but maybe for
the acts online bro it's part of the
deal like if are the settlements every
phone's gonna like pop up like we love
America as the greatest greatest but
what do you think like do you think Z
T's reputation is damaged e-rep employee
oh yeah yeah for sure that's it we're
done I mean like even though like they
continue to make productions like that's
it's it's very hard to to you know win
over like perception you have like you
know you make like one mistake and like
ZTE has but the thing is like a lot of
the reasons why I was banned from like
production was not like a security issue
or no it wasn't it was more about like
they were dealing with with Iran and
North Korea yeah alright lastly Twitter
was offering an interesting test it was
a recommendation list for who to
unfollow on your Twitter list yeah so it
was like an automated set of accounts
that they would pop up that like you
don't really like engage with that much
and the idea is like well you know hey
if you're not really talking to this
person like maybe unfollow that maybe
you have a better experience
on Twitter that way right so there's
like a very limited test a Twitter said
they only showed her like a small amount
of people and the idea was that you know
if you follow people that you interact
with a lot maybe you have a better time
on social media though this is very
counterintuitive to how a social network
usually works but it's all about
building up connections having a big
follower base having more people follow
you and just this this is sort of the
opposite of that I'm very into it I'm
very into you know hey you know what I'm
not friends with you anymore because
Twitter told me not to be it's not about
quantity it's about quality yep alright
for more of these stories chicken sounds
seen it I'm Roger Tsien I'm out for ding
thanks for listening thanks everybody
for joining us for the recording of the
audio podcast it'll publish later you
can find out how to subscribe by looking
in the links below in the meantime as
always go ahead and send in questions
and comments I know for some of you on
YouTube land the encoder was giving you
a little bit of trouble so we apologize
for that
I hope it's fixed keep me posted thanks
for telling me in the first place in the
meantime the first question is coming up
is for Alfred and it's what is the life
and battery like for these drones yeah
that's a good question so they're meant
to basically last anywhere from like
four to eight minutes but they go right
back to their their charging stations
right after and they can be fully
charged within an hour obviously it
doesn't take an hour in between the
songs or anything like that but yeah
they can be fully charged within an hour
and they like are supposed to fly from
like four to eight minutes which is the
perfect amount of time for like a short
performance like this song or something
like oh yeah though you we didn't get
into this but the the drones weren't
even the most visually stunning part of
the show you mentioned the a flying
Ferrari yes I sent down for me how is
there a flying Ferrari okay so this one
was more like not it was like a balloon
kind of like you've seen those like
flying like like shark balloons or
whatever yeah so is basically that at
first I thought like oh like do they
have it on like wires or something like
I and then I noticed it looked like a
legit yeah yeah but it was like yeah it
was just basically a big balloon with
the propeller in the back like
controlling where I was going yeah that
that got a lot more attention than these
drones did I would argue that like you
know it's hard to tell the difference
right now with these drones between like
are those are those like the lights that
are just on stage are they actual like
drones flying around like I asked people
around me what they thought of them and
they didn't rub their do they saw in
Ferrari yeah there it is yeah and you
also saw we didn't get a chance to Oaks
watching the video saw this this wasn't
just the only instance where drone was
used in a show
search the SOI had yes so we saw some
footage of the the lamp ones yeah and
it's from the same company actually so
yeah they partnered with Cirque de
Soleil for these drones that like they
were quad copters oh so they were
different model okay and they had like
these lampshades around them obviously
these drones also have the lights so
like in their show it kind of looks like
there so this is the drone this is it
yeah that's the lamp oh yeah yeah yeah
it looks like way cooler than what I saw
yeah that looks a million times better
yeah but to be fair though they also had
a lot more time to like prep for that so
with the Drake show they like they got
the request and sent them to the
production crew in like less than 30
days okay and how long did this search
the sleigh won't take that I don't know
but I'm longer yeah yeah okay okay so
essentially they're just drone puppies
following him around
yeah is that what you're saying there
drone white fog peace puppies I don't I
don't know if they're puppies I want to
walk they're like fireflies yeah
fireflies is a better way to way to call
it yeah that are more coordinated my
dream my dream is to have all city do a
concert with an only they only perform
fireflies and and that's that's the
ultimate combination of this technology
there's no better use of it
it was interesting though the sore the
end of your story you kind of mentioned
how beyond these big scale events they
kind of see an opportunity for smaller
so yeah if I get weddings yeah I don't
know reunions like small little more
intimate
because of the way that these things are
used like because it's so simple the
idea is you know with with other like
big spectacles you kind of have to have
all these like pilots and like engineers
even though they're autonomous they have
to be there make sure nothing goes wrong
or anything like that so what they want
to do those like you know for a wedding
or for like a birthday party or
something like that like it's so simple
that you can just order them in and then
like they'll just do it on their own
oh my god how soon before we see drones
perform their weddings or is that
already a thing I'm it might be actually
I might like some I'm sure somebody out
there has had has done that they you
know they could have crazy rich Asians
in that scene they could have just
waited for these drones to be oh yeah
I'm not gonna spoil it just in case you
haven't seen it you should watch it
either way work don't I'm not I'm not
advertising you should watch it I'm
saying that I liked it anyway go on
Brian
well the drone thing is kind of cool
just because it's a new level of special
effect for live entertainment yeah and
we've been limited to things that you
can either pick up or tie to a string or
project on a stage it's kind of cool to
see this implemented there I wonder how
soon until we see that in like a 4k
movie or a 4d movie theater though oh
yeah that would be my biggest annoyance
with it though is and this is this is
not a knock on any company or any drone
show or anything like that is that the
inevitable factor that will come is now
you'll have advertisements with drones
like it which goes back to like Minority
Report like every sci-fi movies like
these floating add back yeah oh you say
a sci-fi movie at least say Blade Runner
dude like at least give it a good one
way way minority reports a good movie no
it's not come on we reference Minority
Report all the time actually have a lot
Minority Report what I've never watched
Minority Report extremely precious until
the new Blade Runner came out I actually
never watching over like original Blade
Runner either okay I shouldn't you
weren't alive during the original what
else I don't know if I was alive during
Minority Report when either was oh my
gosh
when did Minority Report come out anyway
the point is it like one ads in the sky
are terrible right and it's it's
inevitable that this will happen
Terra
yeah we're definitely gonna see them
yeah we can't wait for uh like eighty to
a hundred like small drones in the sky
writing like drink Pepsi or something to
be fair like the Goodyear blimp did that
as well but I think it's much more
feasible with drones yeah yeah yeah and
the blimp just the one blimp yeah you
could like send hundreds of thousands of
these things out there just giving
everyone terrible and it's capable at
and yeah but the good news is they only
last eight minutes so they're just gonna
Dyke dive-bomb oh no an eight minute
commercial though that's ridiculous
the Goodyear blimp stayed up for like a
day yeah but you already saw it flying
in floated away like could you imagine
the drone just keep following you oh my
god they'd be awful
they just chase you down yeah I was
picturing in my head why I was talking
about the 40 movies like when it'd be
cool to see something like Alfred
Hitchcock's the birds and how the drones
fly around that's you in the air oh it's
just like like you said Pepsi so an
interesting part of so like verity
studios drones is that like so they're
not also trying to use it just for shows
that they demo that I went to the next
day they showed off like oh we can
probably use this for we can use this
for like business cases to like they
showed an example of these drones like
being taught to recognize like bar codes
so they're in a warehouse and then what
about scanning everything so the guy
that made Verity studios he was also a
co-founder of kivett or something like
that that like they were sold to Amazon
and that's now Amazon robotics but he
developed all this AI for BOTS that like
can go around and scan like okay
barcodes and stuff and like that's like
the Amazon uses like his technology now
basically so he's saying like we can
apply this to drones as well and he
showed this like demo video of like
these drones flying around a warehouse
and like scanning the barcodes I'm like
moving on and so that's very cool like
from that perspective okay cool so let's
switch topics and talk about ZTE this is
coming in from Jacob Lombardo the
Chinese manufacturers of phones aren't
going to get any popularity in the u.s.
unless they're sold in carriers no
manufacturer has partnered with Verizon
which is the largest in the u.s. and
that's why they're not popular are they
going to change that how are they going
to change that and any idea of
manufacturers potentially partnering
with carriers so that's non-title
accurate after ZTE probably has had the
best track record they've sold phones
who carries for a number of years there
I would say they probably had the most
success that of the the batch of Chinese
handset makers that are out there you
know they had their name in myosin
Square Garden I believe their big
sponsor at the Golden State Warriors or
may not figure out the name of the arena
is there or yeah the Houston one as well
and David they had phones at 880 18t
crooked t-mobile most of the carriers
usually budget phones which is why you
didn't hear a lot about them I think the
the axon duo was a dual screen phone the
the axon em yeah right the the two
screen phone that folds that was sold as
a as a pseudo flagship phone at 18 T you
know it saw whatever that was actually
sold it was actually some people thought
I was like a concept phone thing no no
no that was a legit phone that was sold
at 18 t stores I don't know how well did
problem that that well probably not that
well but yeah I think that's the big
question mark now is now that ZT is back
from this controversy they still have
this all this baggage will in the US
carriers work with them it's interesting
to note that you know we reported that
t-mobile will be partnering with one
plus another Chinese handset maker for
the oneplus 60 that is one example of
you know a company that's got a decent
amount of buzz partnering with the US
carrier so you could see a little bit
more you could be a little bit more
hopeful in that deal but with ZT it's at
this point lots of question marks about
how they'll they'll be able to thrive in
the u.s. switching gears again let's
talk about Twitter I love this question
from Hunter Lee what do you do when
Twitter recommends you unfollow your
partner because you don't interact with
them enough do it do it that's a
statement move for a second well I mean
why would you tweet as somebody you live
with potentially that's that's the thing
they're like I don't interact with my
partner on social media at all just
because I'm like I talk to you everyday
I don't understand
actually I will interact with her if I'm
making fun of her publicly so you're
you're a great great boyfriend yeah
but yeah I mean but there there's been a
lot of articles on on like you know how
relationships change once like now that
like social media is such a big part of
your lives
there's a an article I believe it was
either in the Atlantic or The Daily
Beast at the time where the idea was
like oh if you don't view your partner's
like Instagram stories like they think
that you're like something like that
you were probably there that's a lot of
pressure why would you look at the story
when you were already there what if you
weren't there though maybe you're not
but potentially you are what the hell is
that argument I don't know but it's you
know kids these days yes the darn kid is
a young in the old folks yeah yeah we
just don't understand it it's connection
to it I yeah but I I like so I follow my
partner out of like a courtesy kind of
thing I don't I don't really I don't
like she knows this she knows that like
I don't like or comment on any post
right um so it's just like yeah on
Facebook my wife and I we comment and
like each other's posts all the time
yeah we don't we don't do that I mean
she's no she's on histogram like in
stealth mode she's not on Twitter at all
so I think the Twitter one is the one
that's most this is not it's not
necessary friends right Twitter's online
I would I would say this for Twitter if
it's getting in the way of your
relationship or your friendship with
somebody you should probably unfollow
them there's so many if it's getting
away of your relationship you should
probably stop using Twitter yeah there's
so many people that I know that like are
cool in person but anytime I see them on
Twitter it's like these tweets are so
bad dude like it's just like these make
me not want to be friends with you
so I unfollowed them and I tell them
that's why he doesn't follow me I mean
like I don't think it's rude to not
follow your friends on social media uh
yeah I've made this argument of a lot of
people who like I hate these tweets but
like I have to follow them because like
we're friends I'm like you don't know I
was for me it's more important like on
Facebook because that is how I connect
with friends on Twitter hey that's their
slogan jeez damn yes is our paycheck
yeah in advertisement yeah no I mean
that's like Facebook is more personal as
opposed
Twitter which you know I kind of use it
as a newsfeed all right disseminate my
own stories but that's why it's yeah
like I don't feel the need to follow
people on Twitter who are my friend I
think I think you know more outlets
should do that more social network
should tell you like hey like this guy
is clearly annoying you maybe you should
just not be friends with them on social
media you can be from outside I like it
yeah cuz it's like if you want to stay
in touch with them like you like what I
do is I so on Facebook right now I only
have like 30 friends and I actively go
on like maybe like once a month I'll
look and just see like I don't know why
I'm friends with this person I know I
just like remove them and if I want to
get in contact with them I just send
them a note on messenger which is also
available on Facebook so it's just like
there's no reason for us to be friends
here it's just like if I need to talk to
you though like I'll just send you a
message I like it
it's very slimmed down the stripped-down
social network right there alfrid do you
take this woman to be your lawfully
wedded wife to have and hold in sickness
and health is that a question from a
viewer to follow and retweet those were
my vows to how did you how did you get a
copy my vows Scott I wonder if that's
like a thing like a stipulation my god I
imagine it is for some couples but not
not here not with me that's so gross
though
I signed a prenup so that you wouldn't
get half of my followers if oh my god
that's that's probably happened hasn't
it I hope not
I'll be a hard thing to to enforce yeah
sure
also like you don't really share
followers like when you you do have to
become friends with their friends though
in real life we're on Twitter in real
life and by deep well yeah as a leak
over yeah yeah I mean I tried I don't
but you don't split friends though like
in in the yeah yeah you can split
friends oh no definitely can
oops I'm sorry oh yeah it's happened
Alex Mitchell equates liking and
commenting on each other's posts as to
making out in public displays of
affection whoa yeah okay well yeah I I'm
not a fan I think it depends on the
context of the posts I'm not a fan of
gushy yeah it's like I love you posted
like my wife and I don't do that that I
find that I did do that on purpose one
time just to troll another couple that
was like very open on Facebook where I
was you would do that I only show
romance to annoy other PS this guy I had
a friend I went to college with and he's
a grown-ass man he was like 27 at the
time and he got a new girlfriend and it
was easily as the most steady girlfriend
that lasted more than like four days
that's entire life
and like by the fifth day on Instagram
it was like hashtag wifey material and
I'm like oh we're done here Wow
yeah you got to show the world who
you're in love with man like it's you
know like show some appreciation every
day now if Twitter can recommend that I
unfollowed those people that would be
good I would like it if Twitter just
goes to complete sentence like this
guy's clearly a dude yeah yeah yeah
Twitter now just start starts like
proactively tell like even if you try to
follow somebody's like don't bother you
don't want any part of this stuff do we
really need the the algorithm to tell us
that can't you just unfollow on your own
you could yeah I think there's
especially if you have if you fall like
10,000 people I think it is hard to
maintain it actively a lot of people
follow away yeah there's people that
have bots that like wolf mass follow
accounts and then by the next week if
they notice that these accounts don't
follow them back they'll unfollow those
accounts so like oh there's a lot of
people where like if you notice you
could just get random follows from
people that have like millions of
followers basically that's what the
account holder like the follow action
was done by a bot okay as the unfollow
action will be as well but it's like a
real person behind it it's like it's
it's a form of like growth hacking that
is like very annoying if you've ever
noticed somebody who's like got a large
following that keeps following you but
like it has followed you more than once
that you've never followed back that's
why got it well there you go so it is
the bots going to suggest the bots to
unfollow BOTS pretty much yeah well if
you're just having conversations with
each other right now
that's actually the new 3:59 yeah
we're all gonna be fired and replaced by
BOTS this whole episode is actually just
computer generated from an AI that's
watched the other 451 episodes and like
generally mimicked our awkwardness yeah
yeah I actually really do want to do
that I really want to take like all are
like scripts from our like previous
shows and like just feed them into a bot
and like see what it comes up with that
could be like and then we just read that
script for an episode that could be an
entire episode for sure if you do that
that'll be like a specialist that'll be
like 500 or something for us yeah and
I'll make it I'll edit that video for
you we'll make that alright we are just
about out of time any closing thoughts
who's another stage show that would be
cool with drones
that's farming up to you guys and to the
chat who do you think would have a cool
drone show probably Tyler the Creator
yes because his whole album is like
based off of like not like whole album
but like the artwork for a lot of it for
flower boy is like bees and stuff that
might be cool wu-tang clan with the
killer bees coming out on stage trying
who else
that's that's why I got nothing Rodgers
old he doesn't go yeah when I go to a
concert now like I I'm so tired what is
this thing end oh you know it'd be great
if Katy Perry's the dwarf drones for
teenage dreams and then it's a plaque
the line like do you ever feel like a
plastic bag and it's just a drone like
as a plastic bag flying around yeah but
actually it's just a drone the
accidentally flew into a classic could
they just get like a plastic plastic bag
with like you know fans that blow it
around yeah look man do you like a
plastic bag I kind of feel like one
right now I don't know and on that note
it's a perfect place to end the show and
end the week hey we want to say a
special thanks to our friends over at
USB who have sponsored this entire month
and it's completely self validating and
that's kind of cool for us because we've
never had a sponsor before yeah go check
out and get information and look for the
logos when buying official USB items
find out more in enabling USB org and
Roger you wanna take us on out of here
