with Greg Duffy of Dropcam Dropcam is a
great camera from using the clot using
cloud service to monitor your home or
pets or whatever you want from a
distance tell us what's new yeah so this
is actually drop cam HD so if you've
seen our previous product this is 16
times the resolution it's 720p it's got
night vision it's got to weigh on hold
on hold on night vision tell us where
that's applicable so it's pitch dark in
your home you have any of the lights on
and you and a burglar breaks in you can
see them plain as day you put it in a
baby's room when it's dark and they're
sleeping you can see them sleeping and
you can talk to them that's right so
two-way audio means that you can hear as
well as talk back so you know we hear
lots of use cases for this one is like
yelling at your dog to get off the couch
another one is going at your husband to
get off the couch that's something I
hear from a lot of wives you know and
basically gives you a way to interact
with the scene in front of you which is
really cool to the first time you've
ever been able to do something like this
with Dropcam it's great when is it
available how much so you can pre-order
them now and it's a and they're going to
ship at the end of January it's 149
dollars which is also really amazing
because drop comeco was 279 yeah
terrific thanks so much thanks a lot
