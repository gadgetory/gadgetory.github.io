the past few months I've been putting a
lot more time and energy into my website
tested comm we do one day bill I do a
lot of one day built on their out of my
shop I've been doing a bunch more did
two yesterday what did you do uh I built
with some Legos and the other project
secret right now but I so uh you know
trying to I've not existed in the last
fourteen years without Mythbusters we've
filmed
full time since 2002 so for instance my
wife has never known me not having the
show so I'm finding a new life work
balance right now you know one of the
things that I've always admired about
Mythbusters is that your weren't afraid
to fail and I know that you do a lot of
testing and thinking and experimenting
beforehand was that part of why you
think it was success successful that
people saw you you know your brains
working and churning through the ideas
and then having it play out I do think
that that is a significant part of
mythbuster success it's really hard to
look at your own legacy from inside the
thing that you're making in fact it I
think it's almost impossible but that
aspect of the show the aspect where we
show the process and we show it honestly
because the process is you know to make
anything is super messy and involves
mostly wrong turns in the end it looks
linear because all you're looking back
through is the right turns
but those wrong turns are where we all
learn incredible amounts about what we
do and you know there's no other show
that's ever gone back to results it
already came up with and said actually
we got those wrong we have a new
methodology we have a new way of
experimenting and we have a new answer
and I love that about our show I love
the idea that we've shown that science
is is messy and can lead to changing
your mind even about something you've
already concluded
lastly I'll say that the thing that was
great about doing it was those
narratives were honest narratives when I
look at
shows that have attempted to copy
mythbuster success and there were a lot
of them what I see when I watch them is
a producer writing down a Mythbusters
kind of episode and then everyone just
films that and a lot of reality TV has
done that way one or two people write
down the whole narrative and everyone
just buttons it down so it's barely
reality for us we certainly plot an
episode we plotted all the episodes
before we started filming them but when
things happen that we didn't expect
which is most of the time we could
change we could shift we had a very like
life crew who could get us a different
location if we needed one and so
consequently the the places those
narratives went were genuinely really
generated by our interest and by what
was happening to us in the episode and
that that's significant it's funny some
of the most simpatico crews I have
worked with over the last 14 years have
been the bomb squads they did a bomb
tech I think the personality of a bomb
tech whether for the military or for the
any government agency reads like a
description of me it is that I see a
commanding officer of a military base
showed me once that like you he's given
a chart look for bomb techs and look for
these qualities and it read like a list
of my personal qualities like
irreverence dark sense of humor willing
to work with other people thinks outside
the box good team player innovative
problem solver works within parameter I
mean it's really is like all of these
things it's it's been a you know it's
been an amazing 14 years I have never
had a career as long as I've had this
show and I realized the course of doing
it that really Allah that I've ever done
for a living is tell stories and that
turns out to be the only thing I'm
interested in doing
even when I was gluing details on the
side of a spaceship for a movie
every detail that I would put on has a
story to it in my head then it doesn't
work aesthetically unless you know the
narrative of the ship that you're
building and
the ship that has Mythbusters that I got
to spend 14 years learning how to build
is unparalleled so I just I look forward
to telling more stories in the future</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
