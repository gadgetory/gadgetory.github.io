taking a look at Samsung's curved OLED
TV samsung says this is a world first
time here with Scott Cohen from Samsung
to ask him exactly what the thinking is
so it's got tell me why is the
television curve what's the thinking
well this is a concept piece and what
we're looking to do is show case what we
can do with LED there are going to be
many applications I most people aren't
aware that all that's been using our
phones and cameras Crean's for a long
time so showing a large screen curved is
really showing off what we can do the
curve here is going to give you a little
bit more of an immersive viewing
experience but again concept piece so we
are pushing forward with our 55 inch LED
which will come out we're using RGB
sub-pixel structure instead of using
white LEDs which is going to give us a
better color accuracy and better color
gamut cool ok so you think it's going to
be a bit more immersive not just to show
boating showing what we can bend con
exercise where are we going to see this
on sale anytime soon you will not see
the curved Oh LED on sale this year you
will see our 55-inch on sale this year
and you can also see them right behind
me there the flat version of this so
Samsung is a known for being quite
experimental with displays between some
transparent screens over there elsewhere
on the stand and rumors a flexible
smartphone displays where do you see
things going in terms of panel
technology in the next say two years in
the next two years I see panels getting
bigger the average consumer size will go
I mean just a few years ago was 46 inch
we've seen to go up to 55 and now
possibly 60 I co-led becoming a bigger
factor the advantages of LED with power
consumption and the color gamut and the
blacks the speed and all that I see that
becoming a bigger factor and I see you
HD the ultra-high definition of 4k stuff
becoming a bigger playing a bigger role
in the next two years Scott current
thank you very much let us know whether
you would watch a curved television or
whether you think TVs should remain flat
and normal on the West wave cnet here at
CES 2013 and this is Samsung's curved Oh
LED TV</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
