taking a first look at the National
Geographic talk a broad light now that
is the name of the phone provided by the
National Geographic brand but it's not
who makes the phone the phone is
actually made by a company called blue
and it is the blue DJ light phone so it
is being used in this case in service of
the talk abroad program which was really
aimed at tourists travelers students
people who really need a phone and a
single phone number that they can be
reached at all times while they're
abroad and overseas so it's an
interesting service I'll get to that in
a minute but first let's look at the
phone it is extremely simple in fact so
simple that it does not even have a
volume rocker I would never recommend
this phone for day-to-day use it's a
very poor construction very cheap
quality seems toy like doesn't have a
lot of extra features it does have a
penlight it also has an FM radio on here
which is nice and players for video and
audio playback so that is good but the
address book is bare bones and so is
much of the rest of the phone it's also
very small text into my hand a really
small screen to less than two inches
there are two SIM card holders on here
one of them the talk a broad
international sim goes into there is
another sim slot as well so you could
technically use it or at least store
another sim card in there also beneath
the battery there's a microSD card slot
so you can load in music and any videos
that you want so why would you ever buy
this phone well if you're interested in
the talk abroad service it gives you a
sim card that we just saw with two phone
numbers one for the u.s. one for the UK
basically anybody can call either of
those two numbers and reach you wherever
you are you can also dial out the
service is prepaid in the sense that you
buy a $29 bundle of credit you can keep
buying more more bundles of credit and
then every single thing that you do
basically outgoing costs a certain
amount so checking voicemail will cost
45 cents texting somebody will cost a
little bit of money most of the incoming
texts and phone calls will be free for
you so that's good it is a GSM world
phone
so with the taco broad sim card you will
be able to use it in over 230 countries
around the world I highly recommend if
you're interested in the phone and the
service that you look at my full review
on cnet com because all of the rates can
get a little bit confusing so this is
your first look at the blue DJ light
which is also known as the National
Geographic taco broad light I'm Jessica
doll court for seen it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
