podcast i'm veronica belmont and i'm
james kim and what are you craving this
week we've got all the highlights from
our crave blog right here we're going to
talk about yeah and also stuff that you
guys have sent us in so this is episode
number five yes and an episode number
four we talked a little bit about a
Bluetooth robot and we said we were
going to try to build it so this week we
got together and sat down and tried to
build it here's a clip welcome to robot
boy that was a lot of work yeah I took a
little nap that's only 30 minutes tell
anyway 30 yes no it was yeah that was a
nice work last night I spent three and a
half hours last night yes building the
rest of him and I want to introduce
everyone to des bottes why is he des
bottes I don't know as you need not
yourself yeah it's kind of a cool world
don't you think Dad lots anyway this is
a part of the lego mindstorms NXT kit
brand-new and it's ages 10 and up and I
had kind of trouble with this thing as
you as you can see more like early time
flies or not but this does work it walks
around it has these sensors right here
and I don't know I'm gonna run a little
program for you whoa Oh No boca okay you
know what here we go he's fine that's
cool anyways got it there he goes okay
that's good sink I think there's a
reason why there's a heart on his side
right here anyway let me turn this guy
okay here cover it over the robot right
over there okay so we're craving a lot
this week only oh yeah we got some
reader email in yes about a nice pair of
headphones they're called the the
Panasonic retro painted piano headphones
and they're really cool they've got like
the two cans on the side and there could
five different colors two hands and the
really neat and retro looking and the
sound quality is actually really great
as well which is probably the most
important that's cool speaking of
headphones I just found the stuff at my
desk was actually a jasmine tea found at
your desk yeah she just show up is
actually Jasmine says she's a big
big-time snowboarder and put this on
looks like a regular protective helmet
accept check it out right regular these
are very nice built-in headphones with
built-in bluetooth so you're on the
slopes and you can listen to good hifi
audio and catch your calls you know why
you're like doing a Daffy or something
which brings me to the other crazy
person that just read this morning about
the audix padded hat I think that it's a
little cooler than this I think this is
a little hard core this is just a
regular knit hat with you know it's from
Motorola
another company in partnership with a
Burton and basically have a built-in
bluetooth headset inside of nice yeah
that's a pretty good idea anything that
when they built in like when they put
like buttons yeah yeah yeah clothing
Jordan does a lot of that subject they
have to make it look good though that's
the main problem yeah a lot of times it
doesn't look very good yeah speaking of
not looking very good so konica minolta
is of course the printer copier yes and
they have a prototype of a new printer
that first of all does printing and
copying and all that good stuff and then
it has it has an LCD built in which is
pretty normal pretty standard also as a
DVD player so I guess if you're at the
office you want to watch a movie that's
cool the weirdest part is it has a latte
machine a lot of machine that's not the
weirdest like this is like an
all-encompassing office gadget okay and
i know i said the weirdest part was a
lot to every i didn't think that was
weird the weirdest part is that it's
covered in psychedelic flowers
like this is your copier this is your
copyrighted drugs yes it's psychedelic
one mfp what's that multifunction
printer yeah not what you thought just
say no anyway so the new black jack is
out you know what that is yeah the phone
samsung I've been dying for a new phone
I've got a real cheap e so I've been
waiting for a cool small smartphone that
I could use and great it's that we just
had the dash you know I like this one
better for some reason smaller thinner
the keyboard is decent so you know
that's why I can't stand working for a
technology company sometimes always
something there's always something
better you get something going to create
more you crave it man yes nice time yes
so anyway if you guys have anything else
that you want us to crave or you crave
