welcome to the app abide it's all the
good and bad stuff inside the world of
Apple we're back from comic-con 2011 and
we were welcomed with open arms back at
the office plus I brought you some
goodies back with me but first let's get
to the show now the macbook airs are
here in our cnet benchmarks rate the new
13-inch air as one of the best
performing laptops on the market even
out doing the 13 inch pro but what could
possibly top that well macrumors reports
the big a is currently working on an
ultra-thin 15-inch macbook notebook and
it's already in the late testing stages
Apple did tell us that this was the
direction that we're moving forward with
after the very first macbook air release
the unofficial web blog claims this will
be the next macbook pro line with a 17
inch model also in the works now there's
no timetable for release yet the last
update was in late februari and even if
they did update it would be at the end
of this year so don't hold your breath
for them anytime soon until we get some
more real information but does it make
sense to completely remove the optical
drive on the proline and limit you to
purchasing apps only through the mac app
store so that apple gets a larger cut of
the profits of course it does that's
becoming the Apple way and you might get
a sexier form factor but that's a bad
apple and look at what they did to the
new mac mini how many people are really
going to buy that thing it looks like a
cool shiny paper weight for 799 it also
looks like you won't be waiting too much
longer for the next iPhone that's if you
believe the China times we have
pinpointed the release to the second
week of September the reports of Apple
stores reaching out to past holiday and
part-time employees to help out from the
middle of August to the middle of
September the China times also reports
that the ipad 3 may be delayed until
thanksgiving because of component
shortages but i'm still saying it's not
coming this year apple doesn't need to
release an ipad 3 just for a higher res
display and a little speed boost six
months later it just doesn't make sense
now with all those rumors who can you
really trust these days 9to5 mac reports
asian case manufacturers who have
historically been on the money with
unreleased apple products are now
shopping case design
for the next gen iphone the case molds
point to a larger display a larger home
button and a thinner profile and it's a
similar source to the one that leaked
the ipad 2 case designs also up to this
point Mac os10 lion seems to be a
success after 1 million copies were
downloaded on the first day alone the
number one issue that is probably
driving you crazy is the inverted scroll
directions that mimic devices like the
iPhone and iPad but if you want to turn
it off so it functions the way you're
used to just go into your system
preferences then select the mouse
settings remove the check box then
you'll be back to what you're used to
now line also has some great features
but my personal recommendation is that
for your high end power user who does
work with photoshop Final Cut Pro Tools
or any high-end programs don't do the
update just yet but if you're more of a
general user who uses the I apps and
word processing the update will be
worthwhile there are also people who
have had trouble during the upgrade
process so apple has released a new
update it's a patch from Mac OS 10.6
point 8 to fix this and you probably
want to get this if you haven't already
alright let's take a quick break and
show you how to use one of the best
features in lion called versions with
mac OS 10 lion you get autosave
inversions two new features that are
going to save you a lot of trouble when
it comes to editing documents with
autosave inversions you don't have to
worry about losing any unsaved work
let's open Tek set it to show you how it
works once you make an edit you'll see
edited show up at the top bar of the
file click it and you'll see a little
menu lock lets you lock the file so that
no more changes can be made it's useful
if you want to create a template or just
prevent your dog from being changed if
it is a template you can use duplicate
in this menu to quickly create and open
a copy of that file now if you're
editing the document and realize you
want to get it back to the way it was
when you opened it click edit it and hit
revert to last saved version below that
option is browse all versions now the
autosave backs up all your changes you
can browse all versions of a document
click browse all versions to see how it
works right now only a few apple-branded
apps like text edit and I work support
autosave inversions but hopefully other
apps will be updated to incur
break these features thanks for that
video now in more fun news we were away
last week so we weren't able to report
about the fake apple stores that were
popping up in China that captured the
look and feel of a real Apple store
while selling authentic apple products
you Chinese people are amazing now the
stores were so believable that even
their own employees but they were
working for an actual apple store now
two of the stores have been closed and
not because they're completely ripping
off apples retail design but due to lack
of proper permits also Apple might one
up the stores with one of the best Jedi
Mind Tricks of all time according to a
survey released by pricegrabber thirty
five percent of all respondents intend
to purchase the iphone five without
seeing anything or knowing anything
about the actual device fifty-nine
percent of the people said battery life
was the most important feature and
forty-six percent of the respondents
said 4g was an important feature
especially after a few episodes ago we
told you how many users think their
iphones already have 4g alright let's
announce our giveaway for the mi SI
gadget keyboard and the winner is chris
from albuquerque he went deep into the
archives to find out some of the brands
that I rockin he'll be receiving the
awesome bluetooth keyboard case combo
and since we're back from comic-con we
have a killer giveaway thanks to our
friends at performance design products
or PDP we also built the kick-ass Mortal
Kombat arcade stick they're hooking you
guys the Apple biters up with the
official captain america iphone 4 cases
like the one you see here but you won't
be able to throw it like a shield or
protect yourself now we have five iphone
cases for you three ipod touch cases to
give away to send us an email to the
apple byte at cnet com with the reason
for why you deserve a case and if you
beg hard enough you might get lucky
alright that's going to do it for this
week's show thanks for watching and
we'll catch you guys next time for
another bite of the Apple
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
