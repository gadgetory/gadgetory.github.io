Fitness wearable tech it's a huge trend
that's really hot right now and we want
to show you two of the best that will
help you track and improve your overall
activity level now the first one this is
called the Fitbit one and it's 99 bucks
it's a product you can clip on and
during the day and track your steps
distance calories burned and stairs
climb now during the night it also
measures your sleep cycle and sinks that
data wirelessly to your smartphone or
computer so you can keep track of it in
set goals and it's really one of our
favorite fitness devices now the other
product we like is the jawbone up and
it's not a clip-on but a wearable
bracelet it comes in a variety of colors
and we know that style is important and
it's 129 bucks this gadget also track
your steps distance traveled and
calories burned and sinks this
information by plugging it into the
headphone jack of your phone what sets
it apart is its app that really has
detailed charts and good looking
graphics that showcase your activity
level and your friends so you can
compare and you can tell here that I had
a healthy four hours of sleep and I
wasn't even in Vegas another cool thing
about these devices is that they both
have vibrating alarms inside of them so
you aren't waking up suddenly to a
blurring radio and trust me it's more
pleasant so there you have it you may
not have thought about Fitness tech but
these are top two picks we're checking
out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
