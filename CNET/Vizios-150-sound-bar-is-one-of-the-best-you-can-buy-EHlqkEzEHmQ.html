like digging for gold and I'm happy to
say that this time we struck a real
nugget the SB 3621 ne8 sound bar from
vizio mouthful of a name aside this is a
kind of product that makes my job
enjoyable a crazy cheap a hundred and
fifty dollar sound bar that sounds
fantastic
it doesn't look or feel cheap though it
has a sturdy construction with a fabric
coating and a big friendly control panel
however the incomprehensible LED display
is as terrible as previous videos but at
this price we don't care it's refreshing
to see that even though it's cheap the
vizio has a full-featured remote control
meanwhile the wireless sub may be on the
small side and it only includes a five
inch woofer but it's able to put out
plenty of full sounding bass features
aren't bad either two digital inputs a
coaxial and an optical plus USB and a
3.5 millimeter jack
you also get Bluetooth connectivity for
streaming music but it's the sound
quality that really sets this product
apart with action movies you'll get
excellent detail and intelligible speech
most sambars can't do music but the
vizio can it sounds natural and full in
a way that only molds $400 or more can
do until now I've said there's no reason
to spend more than $400 on a sound bar
but with the SB 36:21 I'm now saying
just buy this this sound bar is the new
budget King
