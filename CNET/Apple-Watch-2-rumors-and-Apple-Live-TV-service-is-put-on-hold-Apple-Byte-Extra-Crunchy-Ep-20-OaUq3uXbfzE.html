building in san francisco california
it's the apple byte extra crunchy
podcast with your host Bryan tongue what
up Stephen yo what's up man west coast
to the west coast oh that's right you're
in LA I should have said from somewhere
in LA brian Tong some random corner
what's up everybody welcome to apple pie
extra crunchy this is episode 19 steven
we sell jobs i neva so night it's pretty
amazing so what we want to do guys there
is so much to talk about we have apple
TV news we have apple watch 2 news we
also have that that iphone case you know
what i'm talking about that iphone case
to talk about so we have a lot of jump
into we also always make this show all
about you guys and you guys continue to
call us 1 800 61 62 63 eight is the
number to reach us at leave us your name
where you're from get your comments your
messages and also if you guys have bad
apples of your own because sometimes we
throw them on the show we want to hear
your bad apples because it's all we're
all like simple we're all like kumbaya
sympatico we're all like the same right
yeah you know what I was also thinking
is if they have bad apples and they can
like illustrate it via video like tweet
us a video like a vine or an Instagram
video or something and maybe we'll put
on the show I thought that we kind of
fun to that requires a lot of effort but
if they do we will reward that effort
that's all I'm saying yes so let's get
into it I'm a report from Bloomberg kind
of dampers hopes of what Apple is trying
to do with their live television service
the report says that Apple is said to
have suspended their effort to develop
the live TV service and what is really
behind this is that les Moonves at a
recent conference told people that Apple
has put its live TV plans on hold
there's a follow-up article on recode by
Peter Kafka that basically Apple has
like they're used to been throwing their
weight around and been asking the
content creators networks to really
build this slim down base package for
about thirty dollars or just under it
that has maybe a dozen to 14 channels
but then the networks are saying look we
don't
on our other networks for example ABC is
also has like ESPN they have disney they
don't want their other networks to be
left out of this base package because
more most likely people will just buy
the base package and they may not want
those extra cable stations that's where
the friction is happening Apple's trying
to say no this is what we want to do and
the content creators are saying and they
are the ones that have all the power
right Steven they're the ones that
Affleck on tenth they're saying um no we
really don't want to do that so because
of that it looks like at least as far
back as a couple months Apple has pretty
much bowed out of pushing you know to
push this live service out who does it
hurt the most it hurts consumers and
really their Apple TV product right I
mean after we probably needs to have
this live TV service and they just keep
on talking about it this is the future
of television well guess what the future
of television still isn't here I know
we'll all the television broadcast
stations are getting on board and
they're putting all their stuff online
themselves so you know why why would
they need apple I think is their
argument already we need you we're just
going to put our stuff online and lock
it down ourselves and also I mean look
you see that a lot of content companies
they're actually making some of their
channels or networks are programming
just directly available through through
an app now right like to an apple TV app
CBS has one NBC has one we already know
about Hulu HBO has their own they're
starting to say forget it we're not
going to give Apple all this we're just
gonna build our own apps that people
come to us you know Apple is the kind of
the middleman but their apps live on
other platforms as well it's not they
don't have to just go to apple and again
I kind of repeat this story where when
itunes came up with the itunes music
store the music industry was in shambles
they were trying to look for ways to
make money and itunes was the way for
them to kind of reinvent itself through
digital distribution there was nothing
else really out there but I don't need
itunes did not save music at all no they
know they heard I I mean it's argued you
could argue that it hurt them where I
yes it actually slowed everything down
and I think maybe a lot of the TV
broadcast companies have seen that and
they you know they see what history has
proven so the little scared to get on
board hey steven has a music guy do you
feel like the itunes store
the music store was kind of part of the
I guess I don't want to say the death of
the album but people can now just kind
of pick and choose a single song and
just forget about the album do you think
that was part like that hurt the album I
think it did hurt the album it changed
everyone's listening habits also you
know everyone listens two things on
shuffle they don't really listen to
albums anymore but yeah I mean it kind
of fragmented music a little bit you
know in it it into you know just kind of
slowed progress of music I guess but I
some people call me call those old guys
in the last thing because we were
complaining about the headphone jack so
y'all I gotta put that in right now so I
got it I got it like stay away from
saying things like that like you know I
don't know innovation we want innovation
for sure no no you can say what you
could say whatever you want they just
wish they just wish they were here with
us that's nice my planing about it um so
you know I think though if Apple doesn't
release this live TV service next year
let's pretend it doesn't even come out I
think it's a huge fail for just the
Apple platform as a whole it just shows
how little power Apple has in in that
side of the business now right from a
negotiating point they're trying to put
it put it down the these these networks
don't need them people are yes people
are consuming content online but people
are still also still watching TV quite
honestly maybe not as much but they're
finding you know episodes or shows that
they want through other avenues and
Apple TVs live service will not save
anyone and that's why they don't no one
really watches TV live anymore anyway
you know like you our own episode the
next day on netflix or something like
that so I feel like live TV sort of
dying except for sports and like got you
know big event thing so you know
absolutely right it's all over there I
think the way that TV can evolve though
and it would require you know the
networks to really develop a specific
app is somehow someway you know you have
like if people playing around with a new
Apple TV there's this QVC app and I like
use an example where you can like buy
stuff while they're talking about on on
the television or on the video display
if we can start actually doing live
pulling in live interacting through like
an actual app that is ubiquitous and we
can really interact with the show like
what if you
could when you're watching a late night
show even though I don't even watch
late-night show TV anymore what if you
could like there's like three options on
the bottom of your screen and you could
choose what question that let's say
Fallon or Kimmel or whoever asks next
just cuz it's like the audience question
right yeah like bringing that hyper
engagement we still haven't seen that
yet we've always talked about
interactive TV that's just something
that I just want to see even in sports
would be fun to like you know if there
were poles and just guessing what
happens in the game you could voteban
you could see a little pole in the
corner that that hasn't happened yet and
I know people are trying to figure that
out you've been trying to figure that
out for years you could argue that
American Idol and shows like that do
have do have things like that you know
where people call in and vote and stuff
so you that stuff is happening where
they try to get the audience everyone's
like every show has a hashtag now and
they want people to go talk about the
show so you can argue that that yet but
yeah I agree with you it needs to be
built out more like I mean YouTube like
I can go on this YouTube right now with
all the people watching us and chat to
them and you know talk to them in real
time so and say hey it's a yo-yo I'm
gonna can I just type ii yo right now no
I'll we come alone they're like yeah
that would be cool but I don't watch
anything live that's one of them to say
so Apple watch um so that's Apple TV
news it's kind of a little Bugaboo my
phone just went off with the text
message I hope you didn't hear that
maybe cuz i chatted hello guys in the
youtube anyways as transitioning over
apple TV kind of a bummer but we'll see
how that all plays out Apple watch 2
News this rumor comes to us from nine to
five mac and 9th if I Mac again geez
breaks like a ninety percent of the big
news these days I swear they report that
Apple plans the March Apple I'm March
Apple watch to event the next generation
apple watch will be reportedly coming or
announced in march with it expected to
ship out and be available sometime in
April which would be pretty much a year
after the original model went on sale
the crazy thing about this is they also
reported a while ago that they were
actually already working on prototypes
for this 2nd gen apple watch before the
first Apple watch even went on sale oh
wow so they've been sitting on this for
a long time they've been playing with
is with you know a built-in Wi-Fi on the
watch which is something I've asked for
so it's completely independent of the
phone if when you're around Wi-Fi a
FaceTime camera has been played around
with the idea of it with Apple a thinner
form factor but still around the same
battery life those things are nice I
still don't know if even those things
make it compelling enough for me to want
to get one like quite honestly I'm
looking to sell my like I haven't said
this yet but I'm looking to sell my
Apple watch I'm gonna sell this weekend
cuz I just don't use it yeah I literally
don't use it I'm like you could probably
still get most your money back to i mean
i don't think that I'm gonna I'm gonna
find out how much money i can get back
on it I really am if i can get
two-thirds of my money back that's
pretty good deal yeah i bet you can get
more cuz i think appreciation they don't
they know dude appreciate you know i'm
gonna yeah me maybe i should be like
used by brian Tong seen it and it's
gonna be like a fifty bucks yeah yeah I
they don't want that um nine if I Mac
also reports that the iphone 6c that
rumored kind of budget four-inch style
phone will also potentially be announced
at this March event we will wait and see
but that's kind of the latest around the
Apple watch to a lot of people have been
like tweeting and asking should i buy an
Apple watch because you see all these
sales for them that are around a hundred
dollars off right best buy has a good
deal pineapple wats get a hundred bucks
off who wouldn't be like hmm maybe i'll
give this a chance I'm telling you don't
give this a chance that's coming from
Bryant on to I'm serious like I'm
serious like I'm wearing my Apple watch
right now I feel like half the time now
I don't even charge my Apple watch dude
I just wear it every time I see you
wearing it it's not on it's just black
it's so true it's so true I mean that's
it's become more of like a fashion
bracelet than an actual watch it's kind
of sad right that's funny so um but just
a word of recommendation I would I would
at least if you haven't purchased an
Apple watch yet if you're going to do it
and you're really curious I would at
least wait for the second gen it's just
gonna be better that's just the bottom
line um so we'll see how that goes now
if we're talking about products at Apple
is actually just released Steven you saw
I'm sure you saw what
Apple smart battery case look like did
you did you see it I'm looking at it now
and it looks to the first time you've
seen it it looks like looks like an iPod
Touch trapped within an iphone something
it's huge yeah I I said this is what it
looks like when the iphone 6 swallows an
iphone 5 yeah so this is Apple smart
battery case um and this this whole
thing like it's the irony of this all is
that we talked about last week how Apple
was rumored to be potentially removing
the headphone jack to make an iphone
thinner to bring a potential lightning
cable adapter that would allow you to
use lightning enabled headphones this is
all you know stuff that might come down
the road and by making your phone
thinner right you're by Apple being so
insistent on making everything thin it's
going to reduce your battery life and
now apples like releasing their own
battery case that's great like that
makes and you know they're saying oh
yeah you know we want to give it as an
accessory like there if you have seen
this and I know like eighty percent of
you have seen this by now by the time
you hear this this thing is fugly dude
it is like there is no way if Johnny
I've really signed off on this I will
not call Apple the best design team in
the industry right I cannot I refuse to
I mean there's it expands the size of
your phone oh my gosh by look at that
huge it's over dinner waiting slides
into another lightning cable there's
like a lightning cable and you plug in a
lightning cable to a lightning cable
it's it looks okay I'm gonna get I will
give it to I will give it props on two
on two parts now the actual cases
rubberized so it does make it easier to
put the phone in again this is a
category that has been around for like
four to five years mophie and incipio
have had actual battery packs like this
yeah so I will say okay fine Apple you
made it like rubberized so it's easy to
put in they also because it's linked
with their software you can actually see
like through your notifications how much
power is left on the phone as well as
how much power is left on the battery
pack so I'll give them kudos
cool yeah but i'll keep my kudos for
those two things the biggest thing
though that is also bothers me is that
this battery pack it's 99 bucks it has
eighty percent an 80% recharge for your
iphone the other battery packs out on
the industry that quote unquote our
little bulkier but let's be honest
they're just designed better cuz they're
smoother they give you a hundred percent
charge so this Apple battery case
doesn't even give you the same amount of
power charges the other ones too when
you said it was a hundred dollars I
almost threw up in my mouth I can't
believe it that expensive I can't
believe it's that expensive if you
tasted the head for the baguette throw a
hundred dollars a hundred dollars man
and my gosh people were you know some
some guy was like oh why are you all
you're just hating on the iphone case
like do you even like apple look I will
tell you here I will tell people over
and over I just expect more from Apple
like Apple has been one of the greatest
tech companies to you know revolutionize
new industries and take things and
evolve them and just do great things but
it's really been like a year where
they've released a lot of stuff but a
lot of them have had like kind of major
flaws with them apple TV half baked
apple watch half-baked iPad pros like a
Microsoft Surface copy but not as good
you know it's just a bigger iPad and
then they released this battery case
it's like to me it's like what's going
on over there you know what I'm saying
step backwards yeah yeah yeah it's it's
definitely it's something you know if
anyone said something has changed of
course the leadership has changed and
the philosophy has changed because this
is a product category that has been out
as an accessory for like I said for 25
years I really feel like because Tim
Cook is all about margins and making
money he said look they can see the
retail data they know what's selling
they said to themselves look these
battery cases are selling a lot let's
make our own battery case we put an
apple logo on it and people are gonna
buy it I really feel like that blew the
vent out behind the last sentence you
said we put an apple logo on it and
people are gonna buy it that is exactly
what they were they were thinking
probably I'm serious you know what I'm
saying like look they they took the
iphone which they were only going to
produce in one size they saw what Sam
son was doing with their larger screen
phones and it was taking market share
away Apple made their own large screen
phone people started not in droves but
people actually did start coming back to
Apple because they finally had a large
screen phone yeah it you know it's so
you know Tim Cook's thinks more from a
pragmatic business margin standpoint um
you can say the Apple watches you know
they're they're like cool fresh product
but it just doesn't do enough so I just
think that I'm really curious to see
what they do next year because that'll
really I already have a lot of evidence
in front of me from this year but next
year to me is even more pivotal it's
like if we start feeling like this is
truly a different company I already feel
like it's a different company but that
will tell me if they are truly a
different company moving forward it's
definitely been the narrative the last
like year and a half right Apple
something's wrong with Apple like I just
hear it a lot you know so it's it's
tough next year is gonna be very
interesting what's right yeah and you
know someone I was talking to someone
and it was like they brought up a point
Oh none of this you know the classic
none of this would have happened if
Steve Jobs was here and I don't know if
that's necessarily the case on all
fronts but i do think certain things
would not have happened no yeah i do see
that all the time which is funny i love
that none of this happen wws JD ? get
that I'm like oh goodness so um you know
that that's my frustration the
smartphone case that's my frustration
with Apple is we're not seeing the same
Apple that we've seen before and there
it's just in little ways in all their
products and it's just one of those
things that people that are the true
zealots that they don't want to hear it
there they like get frustrated when I
point this out I'm looking out for you
and for us and for those of us who spend
our money on tech and there are plenty
of other options and it's not that I I'm
hating on them I'm just keeping it real
and I think some people misinterpret
that you know they get their feelings
hurt so I will give them props so for
this one thing that a a caller called us
about actually last week about oh well
you know the ipad take advantage of the
USB 3.1 the port well Apple this week
released a lightning to SD card reader
so it has a lightning cable connection
and an SD card reader connector it is
the first adapter for the ipad pro
that's going to take advantage of the
USB 3 points do you remember we were
talking about this yeah that is cool
that is kind of cool and that would
allow we were talking about like you
know they need pro apps to encourage
people to actually use this as a pro
machine they need will Apple make an
adapter that actually allows you to do
this we were kind of pondering it well
they came out they they clearly listen
to our show and made it in a week Oh
totally totally right all over video
producers around CNN are gonna love this
because we have card readers like
everywhere all over the office so you
know for someone like I just went to ok
I this sounded really bad i was like oh
humble brag i just went to this star
wars press conference yeah ok bridge and
let's take all these photos that I had
to upload but it would have been cool
just I did use my laptop to process them
in a blah blah blah but it would have
been cool just to be able to stick that
card in and then just throw it right
onto my ipad just so i could have them
and look at them on the ride home you
know oh yeah totally and just play with
them and then post them or whatever but
i think this is super useful in just
give me some actual pro apps Apple
that's all I'm asking for ok yes that's
all I'm asked for sir would you consider
doing actual like pro audio work on
anything but a computer honestly beach
i'm just curious sure I mean yeah you
know I'm a fan of using any tool
available to me and you know there's
like lots of music apps on the iPad
another I use acid this us silly acid
Steve Jobs used ass yeah sony acid on
the pc i use that all the time but I do
the only thing I really use an ipad for
and music production is just as a
controller so i can be in the same room
with a band or something you know and
you can still control your pc from a
distance so that is very you guys are
cool pc yeah like you know i'll have
like my pro tools interface on on the on
the ipad and I can hit record I can be
within the room with the band and like
kind of be helping them and you know
cool so that definitely works out but um
you
I mean I'm a fan of using any technology
that is available to me that's good
stuff alright beach' we're gonna crunch
do some of these because we've got we're
gonna get to all your calls just some
quick updates Apple released a flood of
software updates again so we're gonna
kind of hammer through some of this I OS
9.2 has some new tidbits there's things
like it has support for that USB camera
daftar we just talked about a mail drop
this is a cool feature that some of you
may or may not be familiar with if you
go to if you log into your iCloud
account on a web browser and if you go
into the settings of your mail app
there's an option to turn on this mail
drop feature that allows you to send
files up to five gigs in size ooh that
is awesome yeah so I OS 9.2 supports the
mail drop feature now also you get the
the big it's the biggest thing though
that's still bugs me probably bugs it
should bug YouTube beach is that the
podcast app on tablets still does not
play video fullscreen after this update
still plays it on this freaking like two
inch by two inch square that is crazy I
can't this thing out that is so horrible
that's a bad out I hope I wanna yeah I
want people to call with their bad
apples gonna be like it shows a bat
Apple your show the bat Bieber bite
rules man you talking about is there a
you know we should start the Bieber bite
we could cric each week we could
critique a new song the reason why I'm
thrown about Bieber bites because
there's an update to the Apple music app
too and they have bieber right here
featured as ya know the image that they
used what is it about our show that's
like four weeks in a row cuz better man
the bieber fever is alive it is there's
a funny there's a funny meme that came
out someone wrote that if if Justin
keeps on dropping this many jams I'm
gonna start becoming a believer okay
back on topic is TV OS also basically
Mac os10 got an update watch OS 2.1 got
an update but TV OS has some really cool
updates it now supports Apple music if
you have an apple music account so you
can through Siri play your Apple music
the remote app one of the things that we
complained about earlier now works with
the new TV OS 9.1 so that app that's on
your phone or your tablet that you can
use to will now be able to be used as a
controller for your Apple TV which is
really cool on this again is for the new
Apple TV and according to a BuzzFeed
report a John pets Kowski who spoke to
Eddy Cue said that they are working by
the first half of next year for the
apple remote app to be compatible with
with the Serie Siri voice control nice
so you can just talk directly to your
phone pretty much eliminates you having
to use any type of you don't have to use
that Apple TV remote at all you could
just use your phone or your tablet
exclusively so they are working on that
that's awesome and I love the picture of
Willy Wonka they're showing the apps so
beautiful uh just a wrap up things
before we have this call I love this
this is a this was posted where Banksy
you know him kind of the urban street
artist but who also has infused kind of
political messages with some of his art
that you know there's actually a guide
for certain cities of where you can find
a Banksy um there's a few in San
Francisco actually are there really I
gotta go see ya huge few of them I don't
know if they've replaced them or not but
there are few Banksy's in San Francisco
so what Banksy did here is he created a
new piece that puts Steve Jobs it's on a
wall but he puts steve jobs in a Syrian
refugee camp so this is Frances infamous
I'm not even I really apologize if I
mispronounce this I don't know if it's
kelis kelis refugee camp colace I think
the future champions called Calais but
and he painted a picture and actually
you all can call us and correct us but
Banksy painted a picture of Steve Jobs
standing with an original mac in one
hand and a sack over his shoulder with
the caption the son of a migrant from
Syria because Steve Jobs his father was
Syrian who was a migrant who came to the
US that's right and so it's it's just
kind of clever right just Banksy making
us a man he's holding a mac in one hand
he has kind of like a sack over over the
other but it's in the actual camp this
genius Banksy is a
genius you know power it the power of
art right that's that's all I'm saying I
mean we just you know in America we have
all these crazy politicians saying let's
ban ban Muslim let's ban the Syrian
refugees and here we are one of the most
influential people in the world is from
in the exact place we're trying to ban
people from yeah yeah real real smart
guys yeah so you you guys can check that
out and just see what I just wanted to
bring it up I thought it was a cool
message and something that's just you
know just worth pondering as we say
there's a great there's a great
documentary on HBO about Banksy to I
recommend highly recommend it's
fantastic did you also see the UM oh man
what is it called off the top of my head
not trick store but there's a movie
documentary where someone created
basically because at the time this kind
of modern street art was becoming so
popular was like when Banksy was really
more advertised as a mainstream you know
thing and someone created a fake faints
Banksy ish Banksy like art exhibit in LA
and people like thousands of people
wrapped around blocks to go see this art
exhibit from an artist they never knew
they'd never heard of but it was because
he was kind of like a an upcoming street
artist and the whole joke is that banksy
was the one who actually did the whole
thing to trick people to see if they
would fall for this whole like the
phenomena of Street pop culture art oh
really now I haven't checked that one
out it's what do you know what it's
called you remember it is it called not
exit through the front door I what is it
I bet you someone knows this I cannot I
can't remember for laughing but you know
let's go to the let's get the calls and
I'm gonna try and find that movie while
we do that okay okay cool so we had a
bunch of we had a lot of phone calls
this week which is totally awesome we
had to narrow down to five four times I
got mob on it I felt I don't have on it
okay here's the number one call here we
go hey Brian Josh from Ohio was just
wondering if Apple does go ahead and
remove the headphone jack from the
iphone what do you think of the idea
that they'll pair a charging port for
the rumored earpods along with the new
iPhone because that's something that
what they would do thanks
thanks for calling man um I could see
them I could see them doing that I just
don't like the idea of charging
headphones yes like there's a point
where you know I just want a quick grab
plug them in or okay let's say if they
are chargeable I still want to just grab
them and use them instantly without ever
having to worry about their battery
power yeah and you know if if you have
to plug him into the Lightning port
you're actually gonna drain the battery
of your phone as well if they're not
fully charged that's true that's a
that's another issue um but you know
they they could go that way maybe maybe
they pull a fast one on us and they put
two lightning ports on it and once for
charging ones for headphones and what
was it was this one kid with yeah right
I could live with that and was the kid
the guy who said that we rolled above
was it about the headphone jack issue
yeah so is he weird you know me last
week me and Brian were kind of upset
about this headphone thing because
basically not not because of you know
just changes coming to the iphone but
because it's gonna cost us more money
and also because we're gonna have to
charge the headphones like we're talking
about right now but someone said these
older guys they call this older guys in
the cob saying these older guys don't
understand innovation mobloc I do I'm a
big fan of innovation I you know I would
love to have the her headphones I've
talked about many times but yeah my main
concern is just it's gonna cost more
money you know we're gonna have to pay
more money we're gonna have to charge
more use more energy so yeah that's
that's my main gripe but it just doesn't
seem as convenient quite honestly to me
yeah yeah it doesn't seem convenient
like trust me uh we're not for
innovation we're doing a show about
apple buddy I if we were doing us like
maybe I don't know like an analog tell
analog TV enthusiast collector show then
then you could tell us we had about
innovations yes like we yeah we were
like artifact collectors then then then
your point would be taken very well you
know one thing about the headphone jack
or that the lightning bolt headphone
output thing that we were talking about
last week and you were saying it would
put out audio at like 48 kilohertz
something yeah yeah I'm wondering that's
gonna sound really good but is it gonna
is it like a lot of the files that we
listened to on our phone or lower bit
rates than the 48 so its gonna do it's
not it can't upscale anything so I just
I'm trying to still wrap that around my
head it's not gonna like upscale the
audio for you but most likely not yeah I
just I just I'm trying to think of how
that's gonna work but anyway yeah just
something I was thinking about I mean
it's something that we could talk about
all day the premise to me is though if
the motivation is to remove the
headphone jack just to make the phone
thinner that's what's dumb because you
lose battery power life which is
probably the most important thing if you
can give me double the battery life and
you make it thinner and remove the
headphone jack I probably wouldn't care
as much yeah and I like the really odd
having two lightning bolts two on the
bottom would be cool to light means give
me two lightning bolts please and I'd
and I don't want to buy an iPhone smart
battery case no oh no holy crap okay
next call do you really think um someone
who would be using the iPad pro would
really be editing 4k video because i
feel like if someone's gonna be editing
4k video with their 4k camera or
whatever or therefore k iphone or
whatevs um when is they be using like an
mac like seriously but um love your show
I I love his tone like seriously I think
you make a great point but think of it
this way all these tech tools that we
have with us what if you're someone
who's a videographer and you're shooting
something in let's say Antarctica like
polar bears and how about like the ice
caps melting in or some sort of nature
environment where you don't have access
to much stuff you shoot some video
content you want to edit the video
quickly on the spot you dont have space
for a desktop like the actual ipad or
even a laptop but the actual ipad does
have the power to actually do that and
it is more of a matter of the software
being a true pro version of software
being available but like i've edited
videos and posted them on my phone so
you know if it happens to be 4k whether
it's even just someone standing on a
street talking the fact is that being
able to or edit any kind of video on any
devices is really what we should all
strive for so I think that it has a
bunch of applications to use it's just
that it's just not there yet and it
should be there so that's what my
thoughts on that yeah it also argue that
today you know we're editing everything
in Instagram and yeah divine so we're
editing tons of video using really
cheesy apps so I don't I don't really
think it matters you know I don't think
it matters unless you're doing like
really Pro high level stuff you probably
gonna want to wanted like a big computer
but I don't think it really matters
anymore like I don't think they're gonna
be editing the next x-men apocalypse
movie on an iPad anytime no no so
fellows this is luis calling from
Charlotte North Carolina again and I
just want to go ahead and talk to you
guys about this all of these headphones
the e l eight titanium headphones
they're coming out now with that
lightning cable and it seems like what
you guys talked about last time on Apple
getting rid of that a head jack
headphone jack seems like it's coming to
reality these people dalat of money on
this technology or develop this cable
system now to incorporate it with
lightning and seems like that might be
the way that Apple is going to be
heading to what are your thoughts on
that I know you guys were kind of upset
about that I'm upset about it I think
it'll be disastrous because it's just
feeding more to the Machine more money
more devices more adapters so anyways
love your show thanks a lot I don't want
any more adapters is this guy one of
those old people he's one of those old
guys one of those old guys no I you know
what they Phillips has a few actual
lightning compatible headphones there's
very few on the market but like you said
there are some manufacturers that are
making them is it the direction they're
going it looks that way I Apple put in
this in they're made for I programmer
made for idevices program they put in
the specifications for people to start
building headphones with lightning
compatibility and it's just up to
manufacturers to do it so if app
start quite honestly because Apple
dominates a lot of kind of the action of
how accessories are made and blah blah
blah look at when Apple just changes the
form factor of a phone and they do this
on purpose so they can not only make
more money but accessory makers like
that because they can make more money to
even if it's a pain in the ass for them
to be like wait we just made a case for
this phone a year ago it kind of keeps
them on their toes so it's this has this
trickle effect and if Apple does really
push out a phone that has a lightning
cable connections solely for headphones
it's going to have a trickle effect they
yield that power and it has a pretty
quickly to everyone Adele yeah Barry I
mean once once the headphone
manufacturers find out that indeed Apple
is going to do this if they do again if
they do you'll you'll start seeing leaks
from headphone company sit like oh this
company is working on a lightning
headphone this one is too blah blah blah
because it's just so much harder for
them to keep it under wraps oh I do
think this is where they're going and
they're hoping to go and we'll just have
to see how it all plays out but thanks
for the call I like that one that might
be a big thing next to your lightning
headphones mmm mmm mmm okay next
question hello guys my name is Colin and
I'm from British Columbia Canada and I
have a question regarding about the 13
and 15 inch macbook airs as are
supposedly supposed to come out next
year do you guys know if it will have a
Retina display or not and because i
personally would love to see the macbook
air finally get that beautiful edge to
edge glass screen at the other macbooks
have as well as the design
characteristics of the new 12 inch
macbook that would be a winner for me it
would be also a winner for me as well
yeah I think that look if they're doing
like you said merging the best of both
worlds this new form factor that they're
doing if it's a macbook air the fact
that a retina already exists with a
machine that is thinner I've got to
imagine it's almost a no-brainer that
will see a Retina display in these next
13 and 15 inch it's designs it's been
long and
so I would be shocked quite honestly if
they don't just because retina displays
now have been out for at least man maybe
even three years maybe even three years
now yeah so putting it in a macbook air
form factor isn't even as thin as this
ultra thin design so they should be able
to do it by now quite honestly so we'll
just wait and see how that how that
shakes out cool all right last call okay
hello this is dominick from Saskatoon
Saskatchewan Canada I have a simple
question I heard you guys room rain
about the fact that there's a potential
of a 15-inch macbook air we have no
specs or anything like that I know about
but do you think it's worth holding out
for since I'm still contemplating
between gain the 15-inch macbook pro or
potentially this new 15-inch macbook air
do you have any guesses or what you
think like what's your opinion on this
who do you think it would be for thanks
love to hear about it love the show take
care of by all right as a loon Escritt
ludicrous would say dun dun dunna dun
hold out done hold out what's so stupid
I would okay here's here's my take on
this I would totally hold out not even
just for the screen itself but sky lake
which is the next generation of
processor which is gonna be faster and
even more energy-efficient will give you
more battery life out of your laptop
that's the skylake processors the number
one reason that if anyone is looking in
the market for a laptop right now you
should wait uh we I want to give props
cuz mike from maryland also called kind
of about this same thing and so i wanted
to show him some love he's like he's
like oh yeah they heard my call right
now but you know that's the biggest
thing wait for Sky lake you'll also get
arguably a Retina display and that's
gonna be worth it enough quite honestly
uh that's you know form factor may
change and that'll that'll be another
advantage so I think right now there is
no reason to buy one right now unless
your computer just broke and you're
desperate if you can wait it out even
wait it out till May June of next year
because they may not come in March they
probably will announce these around WWDC
that is typically when they've done some
of these uh laptop announcements but if
you can wait that long wait it out
rust me just wait it out so hold out
hold out all right man that's it for
calls I think we're all we're all we on
her I think we're all set yeah saweet
the weekend begin the weekend I'll right
everybody I'm just a reminder if you
guys want to be a part of the show call
