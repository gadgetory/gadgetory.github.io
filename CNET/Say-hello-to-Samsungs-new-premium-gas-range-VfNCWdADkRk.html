we're taking a look at one of the new
ranges that Samsung just announced it is
the chef collection slide in gas range
now this range is pretty top-notch it's
part of the new chef series and it has
basically a ton of new features that are
pretty awesome especially if you are a
aspiring home cook who wants to cook
more like a pro so essentially we've got
five burner cooktop
we've got one big one here that's
basically 1800 BTU so you can do little
walk style cooking has very high you
know burn and very very high heat so you
can get you know really fast cooking
times we also have a very nice LED
display here that's built into a lot of
the high end devices that Samsung is
making it'll allow you to control the
oven and also select you know what kind
of cooking you want and control the this
large oven in here which is a full
convection oven and has a very large
capacity so you know basically it's a
very high-end has very nice look we've
got kind of like a brushed steel big
knobs here that control all the burners
and this will actually control the
warming-pan we also have if you take a
look right here this is a basic grill
pan that's very very heavy heavy duty C
pretty sturdy its reversible on inside
here it has a grill that you can you
know slide some sausages on there little
bacon action and then on this side you
can put your you know pancakes and your
you know things you want to like cook up
for breakfast something like that so
that just sits right there and there you
have it we have a very high-end
impressive stove here that costs
basically twenty eight hundred dollars
pretty expensive but very very alluring
I have to say so there you have it this
is Brian Bennett for CNET and we just
look at the chef collection slide in gas
range by Samsung</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
