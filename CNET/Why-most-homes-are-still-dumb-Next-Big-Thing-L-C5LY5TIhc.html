common experiences and concepts for
almost all of us a smart home though
remains anything but it's still very
niche very sort of exclusive a lot of
folks are still entirely content walking
over to the wall flipping a switch or
having a thermostat that learns
absolutely nothing
what's holding back that smart home
revolution I would suggest a big part of
it it's four C's first I would say you
got a look at cost a light switch today
cost what three dollars a smart light
switch 30 on up same thing goes for
irrigation controllers smart thermostats
connected lightbulbs consumers are not
seeing that much of a multiple of
benefit to match the multiple of price
increase then there's complexity we're
all born basically knowing how to
operate the traditional home I mean
little kids can figure out how to do it
with barely any instruction real simple
real obvious when you go to a smart home
now suddenly it's an app infused
experience and the apps are all
different for each brand they don't
always talk together well they are a
varying quality of interface now you can
integrate them on certain centralizing
platforms like like Apple's home for
example or Samsung smartthings but that
can be a whole weekend project and maybe
not for the faint of heart the brightest
spot in this area and the biggest story
recently in Smart Home has been Amazon's
echo which not only has almost every
smart home device clamoring to be
compatible with it but then lets you
control those devices via natural
language there's this factor of
compulsion most smart home devices are
replacing something which does something
very simple flicking on a light switch
adjusting a temperature these are not
very complex tasks not a lot of richness
there consumers are having a hard time
seeing how you can make something so
simple a whole lot better
finally cohesion the smart home I
believe really leaves the ground when it
becomes a smart thing in and of itself
right now too often it is a box of smart
things these dissimilar smart devices
that aren't really beautifully
orchestrated together into a home that
lives and breathes as a unit to
anticipate your needs better now until
that part of the market really starts to
jail and consumers can see that they can
do that and do so with simplicity and
reliability I think the smart home
remains a little bit niche its job one
in the smart
market now we've always seen the end
user the consumer be the main driver of
adoption in consumer electronics they
make the decision they plunk down the
money they buy it and go use it smart
home is a little different we also have
to look at the Realty market and the
home building factor to other parties
that may have a lot to do with adoption
different than we see in the smartphone
and television market for example know
