in the seven inch tablet category
remains one of the hottest right now so
we're throwing in the top two big boys
it's a prized five-foot out between
Google's new Nexus 7 and Apple's iPad
Mini our judges for this fight are
senior editor Eric the tank man Franklin
senior editor Donald bring my bell and
you-know-who reeling a ding dong that
will take all three judges blind scores
and average them out to the nearest
tenth of a point the final price pipes
for me an average of all rounds using
the same system
let's get ready to rumble round 1 design
the new Nexus 7 brings a thinner and
lighter design at 290 grams that weighs
less than the iPad Mini with a thinner
bezel but we all missed the leathery
feel from the first generation now the
biggest change is its 7 inch full HD
1080p display that's the highest
resolution on the market for a tablet
this size and it's even brighter than
the current iPad Mini now the iPad Mini
brings apples superior design with an
all-metal body construction that weighs
more at 308 grams it's still a beauty
but it feels a little less inspired
compared to other Apple products it
brings a robust 7.9 inch display that's
larger in size but its biggest drawback
is its 1024 by 768 resolution and that
just doesn't cut it anymore don't blink
but the new Nexus 7 takes this round
with a 4.3 and the iPad Mini gets a 4
next round controls and user interface
the new Nexus 7 brings the latest pure
jelly bean 4.3 experience with multiple
users and restricted profiles for family
members it's super clean and snappy with
androids customization for widgets
creating folders and the ability to
create folders directly in the dock
notifications are still a staple here
and swiping from the top-right get you
quick access to your key settings the
iPad Mini brings iOS 6 and no one will
argue it's still the easiest
pick-up-and-play
interface on planet earth the home
button has multiple functions to access
current apps and a few basic settings or
you can hold it
Ceri you also have a notifications
pulldown but its lack of customization
really hurts it and even ios7
won't radically change that when it
releases Google gets a perfect 5 and
Apple gets a 4 doctor averaging two
rounds the new Nexus 7 leads big next
round is features both tablets bring
Wi-Fi Bluetooth and 4G LTE options but
you won't find any memory expansion
slots here the new Nexus 7 comes with 16
or 32 gigs of storage and a quad-core
Snapdragon s4 pro processor that
delivers but we're talking about the
most feature packed 7-inch tablet here
Google now voice search and commands are
unmatched in speed and accuracy Google
Maps is a killer app and is still more
trusted than Apple's you'll have gesture
typing by tracing over letters to make
words Android Beam brings NFC
capabilities and you can now stream some
of your content wirelessly to a
television set with the chromecast
it brings significantly better speakers
on both sides with a technology called
surround sound that no current iPad has
and the new Nexus 7 can even support
wireless charging now the iPad Mini
comes in 16 32 and 64 gig flavors with
an older a5 dual-core processor that was
criticized when it first launched Siri
has a prettier interface when you're
looking for sports scores a restaurant
but Google now is just better and
Apple's Maps is still improving but
still trails behind you can view the
content that's on your iPad Mini 2 a
television set that's connected with an
Apple TV if you live in the Apple
ecosystem and it's that ecosystem that's
Apple's strongest feature with its App
Store that really has the most tablet
dedicated apps the new Nexus 7 shines
here again and takes another perfect
round with five and the iPad Mini gets a
four next round is web browsing and
multimedia Google's new Nexus 7 brings
the best mobile browsing even without
flash support with Chrome that has
features like an incognito mode for
private browsing and syncs your
bookmarks across devices now the iPad
Mini brings Safari which is just as
solid with a snappy pinch and zoom it
also has cloud syncing of bookmarks on
other eye devices and a
reader mode but chrome works on both
platforms and it's our browser of choice
now video quality looks great on both
devices but the new Nexus 7 clearly has
the edge when it came to Netflix and
YouTube streaming with its brighter and
significantly higher 1080p resolution
screen the gap between the iTunes Store
and Google Play Store is really closed
but Apple still brings a little more
exclusive content overall both tablets
have front-facing cameras and five
megapixel rear cameras that shoot 1080p
video and continue to usher in the Oh
give it to me take pictures with your
tablet movement this round is all about
the screen and Google gets its third
perfect round with the five and the iPad
Mini gets a 4.3 chapter averaging four
rounds the new Nexus still leaves big
round 5 is performance both of these
tablets feel fast and snappy and the
Nexus might be a tad bit snappier but
there's no major noticeable difference
we've talked enough about the screen so
let's get to the battery life and in
CNET's video playback drain test the new
Nexus 7 gave us an impressive eleven
point four hours of video playback just
a bit behind the iPad Mini which still
boasts an industry best 12.1 hours of
apple juice for a 7-inch tablet now in
an ideal world we'd want the most pixels
in the best battery life but we also
call it first world problems
the iPad Mini gets a 4.3 because it's
screen resolution is holding it back and
the new Nexus 7 gets a for the final
round that decides it all is value the
new Nexus 7 16 gig Wi-Fi model starts at
229 the iPad Mini 16 gig Wi-Fi model
starts at 329 then you go to the 32 gig
Wi-Fi models where the new Nexus is only
30 more dollars at 269 compared to the
iPad Mini
that's 429 and that's $160 difference
now let's say you want to get a 32 gig
4G LTE version of both while the new
Nexus 7 is 349 and the iPad Mini is 559
for a 210 dollar difference
that's just a brutal now there's nothing
to dispute here the new Nexus 7 takes
this round with the floor and the iPad
Mini gets a two point seven so let's
average out all six rounds and in a
battle where the new Nexus 7 jumped on
top early the iPad Mini was outmatched
and nearly every round and Google's new
Nexus 7 is your prize fight winner Apple
is clearly more than just a little
behind now and we'll wait and see if
their next iPad Mini can make this a
competitive fight in the future i'm
brian tong thanks for watching and I'll
catch you guys next time for another
prize fight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
