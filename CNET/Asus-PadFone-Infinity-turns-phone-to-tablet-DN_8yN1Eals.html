I'm holding in my hand the Asus Padfone
infinity which is a 5 inch android phone
but with a bit of a twist now it docks
into this 10 inch tablet so that you get
an android tablet so as you can see it's
a 10 inch android tablet with an HD
screen because it's Android you can
download all the usual apps have all
your apps on here but the twist is that
it's the phone docked into the tablet
and the tablet element of it is actually
just a screen so when you take the phone
out it all disappears all this really is
is a battery and a dock for the phone so
the actual CPU and the the brains of the
phone is all in the phone one of the
advantages of docking the phone into the
tablet is that this has a much bigger
battery in the in the tablet which means
that you can recharge your phone up to
three times just by docking it in here
well it is a bit of a dumb screen it
doesn't actually do anything for itself
the phone has a 13-megapixel camera
includes a burst mode that captures a
hundred snaps at a rate of 880 shots per
second shoots 1080p video and it has
android 4.2 installed on it it's
certainly an interesting idea but asus
wants a thousand euros for this which is
seems like quite a lot considering it's
basically just a phone and a screen but
we might see the price come down when
this actually comes to market i'm rich
