well if you had one such computer 10
years ago you could get paid ten bucks
thanks to a settlement of a class-action
lawsuit why because the makers of DVD
drives Sony NEC Panasonic and Hitachi LG
were accused of colluding to inflate the
prices of their optical drives the
lawsuit alleged that when computer
makers like HP and Dell wanted to buy
some drives these makers would all share
their bids with each other to keep the
prices high but we're talking about
something that happened more than a
decade ago the legal drama has been just
dragging on for years and now finally
there's a form to fill out to claim your
rightful payback it's pretty easy to
submit your claim go to optical disc
drive antitrust calm provide your name
email address and how many computers or
drives you bought between 2003 and 2008
there's no proof needed at least not
from this form but it says they may ask
for proof later although I don't think
many people kept their receipts from
computers bought in 2003 if you're
having trouble remembering what computer
you used in 2003 allow me to help take
you back to that quaint time there was
no iPhone so music was in these things
called mp3 players we were all partying
in the club like it's your birthday we
just found nemo and ben affleck he was a
Marvel superhero not DC before you get
too excited about your ten bucks i
should mention it's not for everyone
this is only applicable for residents of
23 states so like half the country's out
of luck and you cannot apply for money
if you had a Panasonic computer but if
you do apply do not expect to see the
money anytime soon because the lawyers
are waiting to see if other optical
drive makers are going to settle to
squeeze more out of this I'm Bridget
Carey foreseen it wishing that all your
$10 dreams come true</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
