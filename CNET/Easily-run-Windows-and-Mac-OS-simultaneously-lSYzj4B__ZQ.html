available to the public and it's got a
lot of cool new features it's extremely
useful because it lets you run Windows
and other operating systems on your Mac
with features that let you interact
between the operating systems
efficiently
I'm Jason Parker for CNET and today I'll
be looking at parallels desktop 10
format and the new parallels even the
little things are made easier the
launcher window lets you drag and drop
ISO files or disk images like a Windows
installer right into the interface to
start installation you also have a
selection to choose modern ie test
environments Chrome OS from boon to
Linux Android OS and more I'm going to
use Windows 8.1 in this demo in this
latest version of parallels desktop when
you start an installation you can
configure parallels to give you the
optimal experience depending on what you
want to use the OS for whether you
choose productivity games only designed
or software development parallels will
customize the install to give you the
best experience when you start a virtual
machine it loads up just as it would on
a Windows desktop once you're all loaded
up you can use Windows in its own window
for easy access to Mac files or you can
switch to full screen to get the full
experience running in parallels
coherence mode is not new in this
version but lets you use both operating
systems in a more seamless fashion in
coherence mode you'll notice my Mac
desktop in the background but that I'm
running Gmail in Windows 8.1 in a window
with coherence mode I can treat the
Windows app as a regular app on my Mac
for example I can compose an email in
Gmail then drag and drop an image from
my Mac desktop directly into the email
in Windows the latest parallels also
lets you use Mac services from within
Windows you'll notice in a documents
window in Windows 8.1 you can see
folders for Dropbox iCloud and Photo
Stream but they point to each of those
services on my Mac you'll also be able
to use other Mac services here I can
right-click a file in the Windows
environment choose share on and you can
see Mac selections in the context menu
from here I can choose to send an email
using my Mac email client and it will
automatically switch back to my Mac open
email then attach the file with
parallels you also can interact
the other direction for my Mac desktop I
can right-click on a file from the
finder at the bottom of the contextual
menu I can choose reveal in Windows to
open it directly within the Windows
environment parallels desktop 10 for Mac
is available now for $79.99 or is an
upgrade for $49.99 you'll have to wait
to use some of the new features into the
assembly in iOS 8 become available this
fall but even without them parallels is
easier to use in this version offering
more ways to seamlessly switch between
operating systems
I'm Jason Parker prasena and this has
been a first look at parallels desktop
10 format thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
