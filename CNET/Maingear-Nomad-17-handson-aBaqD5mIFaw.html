taking a look at the main gear nomad 17
now there is still a place in the world
for big desktop replacement laptops even
though a lot of what we've seen lately
are super slim ultrabooks are kind of
inventive touchscreen hybrid convertible
laptops every once in a while especially
if you're a PC gamer you're gonna want a
big honking tank of a laptop like this
the problem is even if you're willing to
spend $2,000 or more in one of these
systems if you get it from a boutique PC
maker like main gear like Origen a
couple of others you'll get great
attention to detail watch the
configuration options a very powerful
system but it's built into a very
generic body some companies use a
Cleveland some companies use an msi body
like this particular case right here
what you end up with is something that
does not exactly look like maybe you
spent $2,000 on it laptop wise at the
very least in main gears case they take
some automotive paint and give you a
custom colored back lid with a kind of
baked on almost glisteny car finish to
it but there's so much cool high design
stuff going on in laptops right now it
doesn't feel particularly modern that
point aside when you can do with
something like the main gear no man 17
is it started about $1,500 for a decent
set of components but then you can
upgrade all the way up to a quad core
Core i7 on the latest Nvidia graphics
big hard drives even big SSD hard drives
this particular configuration there's a
little bit north of $2,000 and we could
have gone up even more if we added let's
say like a 256 gig SSD to it performance
wise this or any of the super high-end
the laptop you're gonna spend this kind
of money on which is below our
benchmarks away and everyday use even
things like HD video editing or
something other some other tasks that's
very sort of intensive like that no
problem at all
I'm Dan Ackerman and that is the main
