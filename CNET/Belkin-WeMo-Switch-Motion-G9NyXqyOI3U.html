got the Belkin Wemo switch and motion
detector to look at today
this is basically a socket that you can
power on and off with your smartphone
and that's a really cool thing because
you can plug anything into it and then
make that into a remotely controlled
device the Wemo switch sells on its own
for $49 but for $79 you can get a
package with the Wemo motion detector
now this device plugs in just like the
Wemo switch but it connects to this
motion detector and then you can use
that to power the Wemo switch either way
if you get the Wemo switch or the Wemo
switch and motion you're going to
control it with the Wemo app and this is
an app that you can download for iPhones
for iPads and also for Android devices
the Wiimote app is really easy to use
it's really intuitive and simple and the
great thing about it that I like is that
when you first plug in your devices it
walks you through the setup process it
gives you step-by-step instructions on
how to connect it to your Wi-Fi network
and how to get started with automating
with the Wemo app you'll be able to
create what they call rules and these
just dictate what the device does when
different things happen so let's say you
want your lights to come on at 8 a.m.
you can program that really easily and
let's say you want the lights to come on
when you enter the room and trigger the
motion detector that's really easy too
this is all pretty standard in the world
of home automation and it makes a good
entry point at the price point but the
great thing that I'm really excited
about with the Wemo is that it offers
full integration with if this then that
or if IFTTT now if tis a great free
online service that connects your
favorite web services social networks
and online tools and makes them do
things together so when you do something
on Facebook something happens on
Instagram or when you do something with
your Gmail account something will happen
on Twitter but I'm really excited about
what the Wemo is that it's fully
integrated with it so you can hook up
your motion detector and make that this
if the motion detector is triggered then
you get a tweet or you send a text or
you can have the vet be the Wemo switch
if something happens online if someone
tweets something or if you send a text
to IFFT it'll
your lights on and this all might sound
a little gimmicky and not all that
useful but if you use your imagination
there are some really cool practical
uses for this let's say that you want to
have a notification on your cell phone
when your kids get home you can have the
motion detector trigger a text that
comes to you while you're at work my one
problem with the Wemo app is that it
only shows you the rules that you make
in the Wemo app it doesn't show you the
recipes you make on it and if won't show
you the rules you make on the Wemo habit
this means if you use both the Lemos
rules and ifs recipes which I think most
users are going to you're never going to
have all your rules and recipes in one
place and you'll have to use two apps to
use your devices one use for the motion
detector that I really liked is that you
can set it up in the morning oh sorry
about that you can set it up so that in
the morning your lights come on when you
wake up just by waving your arm so my
alarm clock goes off in the morning I
want to get up but I'm really bad at
getting out of bed so I just wave my arm
in the air the lights come on and I have
an easier time getting out of bed if you
can think of a use for the Wemo that
justifies owning it the price is right I
say go for it if you can't and you think
it sounds a little gimmicky don't rule
it out just yet I recommend you go to
WWI F TTT calm and try if down if tis
free you can try out all the integration
with your social networks and if you
find recipes that you like or you enjoy
thinking them up and experimenting and
find cool uses for if the chances are
very good that you will really like this
