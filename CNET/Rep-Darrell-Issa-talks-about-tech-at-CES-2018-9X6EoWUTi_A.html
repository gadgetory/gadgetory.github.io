Issa I've represented San Diego and
Orange County now for almost 18 years
and I'm here at the Consumer Electronics
Show a place I left when I left my
business career 17 plus years ago and
you've been coming to the show for how
long now 37 years it's interesting
because in the last year the way that
Congress approaches tech has changed
dramatically right it feels like the
honeymoon is over
wait compare it you know when you take
the Russian interference concerns when
you take all the debate over privacy and
security do you think that that like the
the favorite son of the government type
thing is over you know there's always
been two problems the tech is faced one
is they've been naive about the impact
government could have on their on their
business models and that's obviously
coming to play every day the other one
is that for a long time
tech had a tendency to be all together
United for common things free-trade
liberal immigration of tech workers
better education but now we've begun
seeing various aspects of tech like you
saw in net neutrality where one group is
pitted against another and they go to
government to argue it out that almost
always means the honeymoon is over
because no matter what government does
they're answering one side or the other
side's preferences you've announced that
you're leaving Congress right you are
announcing that your posts at the end of
the term I will moving on without your
voice and you were a point person for
Trump on tech is an issue when he was
president-elect right and during the
transition losing that voice what do you
think happens how does tech talk to the
Republican establishment in charge
well decades ago we moved the Supreme
Court out of the Capitol and the
assumption was if they move that across
the street they they'd be irrelevant the
court has only grown since it had an
independent voice and an independent
location
I'm not leaving Tech and I'm not leaving
being a voice and as long as the
president and people advising him still
listen to my view on h-1b
or on quite frankly on feeding text
demand to do here what we want to do
here versus exporting opportunities uh
I'll be there and I'm going to continue
but I'm not selling my house in
Washington I'm not gonna be a lobbyist
but I'm certainly gonna be an advocate
for the things I believe in this last
year one of the other things have been
going on detected Trump which a lot of
the conversation is that we've seen the
tech executives coming out against him
in many different ways when it came to
the travel bans when it came to
transgender rights right we had we kept
a list on CNN everyone at times they can
I appreciate that liberals will never
liked wrong well and and no hear me out
look this is about liberals not liking
Trump the travel ban had so little to do
with with tech they were people
especially the second one people who
were were not coming to accept jobs at
Apple they were not part of it it's the
you know you're not you're not having
that challenge but having said that
those those politics are never gonna
change
I've never gotten a check from Apple
supporting me and yet I've been one of
their champions on issues and that's
okay you know your politics and your
policies don't have to always match so
is free trade important to to the tech
community yes is a Democratic Party a
protectionist party yes is is tech
unionized no is Democratic Party the
party of unions yes so you have all
those issues in which people's politics
and policies don't match and I think
it's important to understand that it
shouldn't be about politics when it's
about the best interest in American
people you should be able to pick a
party for whatever reason you want and
pick policies if you will all occurred
so in this case this administration may
never be the choice of the executives of
high tech but it can in fact be good for
the tech community good for employment
now this president probably appreciates
more the building of hotels and and
older technology then he fully
understands what goes on in Silicon
Valley or what goes on in the biotech
areas of San Francisco in San Diego and
yet the policies can be consistently
good for those industries and I think
that's where somebody in my position who
perhaps agrees with the president on
some things not on others can bring the
alignment of the policies that are good
for the United States I would certainly
say that tech leaders who are officers
of public companies are really
ill-advised to make those statements
because those statements quite frankly
are required to be in the best interest
of their stockholders and often they're
not not neutrality we saw the vote
happen there's been a lot of backlash
specifically from this area of the world
when it comes to the tech stuff so where
are you kind of feeling at this point
now that we see this debate happening
again well you know obviously you have a
view and it's biased because you just
said there's a backlash well there's not
just a backlash there's also a relief
rally the the changing of the control
and the managing of if you will access
to bandwidth was in fact one side
lobbying for a benefit to them as they
saw the reality is that I I do video
conferences every day over the Internet
I use exclusively voice over IP and you
better believe I want a prioritization
and net neutrality implies that you
won't give me a prioritization for those
over other traffic in a typical home
when your Apple iPad decides that it
wants to upload two backup
you know your ipad guess what your VoIP
doesn't work right unless you have a
prioritization which should be a smart
switch that's able to differentiate that
traffic so I think there's a difference
between quality of service controls and
neutrality well you say there is but the
reality is the FCC said we will
determine all of that we will rather
than unfair competition rules will
determine it you know for four decades
we have had the Federal Trade Commission
have the ability to look at both
monopolistic behavior in per se and
unfair trade practices and intervene if
there needs to be more of that I'm all
for it but the idea that you would move
something that is vaguely communication
to the FCC was a power grab by one
chairman and so I'm absolutely on the
other side of it and I think in the long
run the companies and I I'm considered a
friend by virtually all of them in the
long run they're gonna find that
enforcement of unfair competition is
much more interesting way to to protect
themselves you know and it's by the way
it's not a new issue you know during the
classic question of I'm the Outdoor
Channel but I'm I'm going through a
cable company that has a in-house
competitor and they treat me unfairly
those issues have been issues that
Congress has looked at and the FTC has
an obligation to look at for a long time
and you know stronger enforcement maybe
but just throwing it upside down because
it's slightly different than the past
was a mistake I'm glad it's rolled back
but now the question is will we get the
Federal Trade Commission to step up at
the plate and be aggressive on every if
you will viewed slight that may occur so
that there's a fair investigation and
when appropriate action I think that's
definitely something a lot of people
agree with and to be clear my point of
view we're talking about we're talking
about sir
that show overwhelmingly Americans were
against that and so it's not about me
yeah I know I I pretty don't want to be
called bias when it's literally surveys
out there saying the vast majority
people are against it but you know what
that's a few ask somebody if they're
pro-choice they say well everyone's for
choice if you ask somebody if they're in
the abstract if you asked me if they're
for net neutrality
you've already you've already gained it
if you ask are you for the government
determining what priorities are a
bandwidth who can or cannot get an
advantage whether or not I can get a low
cost low bandwidth well somebody else
pays more to get more that I pay a
premium to get a shorter latency time
well somebody else says I'm not in I'm
not as worried about that and I'd like
to discount if you ask them if they want
those choices of plans and different
economics to go with it they're gonna
say yes so yes net neutrality sounds
great but if you actually break it up
and say would you like to have choice to
be able to if you will get a lower cost
for a lower service or a higher cost so
that you can get a preferred service
that gives you something better
people are always going to say of course
I want that yeah and I think just to
challenge that a little bit the surveys
often actually split up net neutrality
versus what was described as it we can
debate why subscribe does but that was
when those things changed and people
were overwhelmingly supportive of not
pulling you back so I'm curious then I
imagine I know the answer already but
the calls for Congress to cement this so
that we don't end up back and forth and
back and forth and Congress makes a
decision that it votes on and it's over
you're not you're not in favor of that
you know I'm not and I'll tell you why
these institutions need to be overseen
they need to do their job and there
needs to be if you will not a guarantee
that it's their job whether they do it
right or wrong the Federal Trade
Commission has tried to get itself for
example into every time somebody gets
hacked they decide that they're going to
go in and essentially tell them for 20
years how to run
they're businesses that practice is
prob'ly outside of the unfair
competition portion they they have
eventually victimized victims sometimes
falsely are my old committee
investigated it and found that there was
excess there so at times when like uber
didn't tell people for a year that it
had been hacked and then you have people
whose information is out on the internet
and they don't know anything and the
government's not stepping in to do
anything about that well there's a good
example where first of all there are
civil remedies and those are being
pursued and for an amount greater than
ubers capital worth we'll see how that
plays out yeah so well but you know the
laws are in place to make people whole
at least up to the worth of the company
but you know the Federal Trade
Commission is is not about finding
people when they failed to disclose
they've gone after people who were in
fact had active break-ins mechanical
break-ins were they and and they were
simply victims so you know it's
important when you look at the
government who is by the way not told
you when they've been hacked not told
you accurately that my Social Security
my medical records are out there with
somebody so you know one of the
challenges there is we can all say we
should have but the question is when
should Congress write a law how
stringent should the law be and in fact
will it accomplish anything to reduce
the amount of times in which people's
meant to you know personal information
is made public or stolen so it's
interesting because the CIA disclosure
was a big discussion this year right
they had the they had the
vulnerabilities that were released on
the web a lot of companies had to
scramble to fix that so on some level it
creates a question of well okay it's
okay for them to try to try and figure
out you know get into terrorists phones
and whatever but once they find them and
they hold onto them and it's something
it gets released we're all in danger you
know it's a dangerous world out there if
the CIA doesn't do its job people will
kill us
people will bomb our embassies people
will attack Americans so that's just a
reality that we we know exist today and
so there's a balancing act
but there's no balancing act on the
Constitution it reads as it reads and it
has to be respected as it is and until
three-quarters of the states in addition
to a supermajority of the Congress
changes that our job is to stick to it
and you know particularly on the fourth
amendment which is what we've been
debating we've got a gun show coming up
in a few weeks here - half the size less
than half the size it's interesting it's
like small arms industry so the
interesting thing like I have many
friends in the military I spent my time
on a gun range like but what's curious
is that smart guns technology that could
potentially help save officers lives and
protect other people's lives we don't
see much of that here we don't we saw
one gun last year you know the we
obviously have a very this location has
special significance considering the
last few months well you know we can
have all those discussions any time you
want the question I'll get back to you
is when our police going to only carry
smart guns themselves because the
greatest single hazard to a policeman
whether we like it or not is his own
firearm there's my point and so and so
when we look at smart guns before we
start saying they have to be everywhere
the very expensive weapons that we're
willing to buy for law enforcement
should in fact be officer specific as
soon as possible
the technology is maturing and I would
hope that we'll see that you know the
same is beginning to happen in in
military development not necessarily in
a pistol but in the larger weapons being
inherently more secure after the loss of
so much weapon tree that the Iraqis had
our ability to have to fight against our
own equipment has taught us that there's
a need to be able to neutralize I think
a lot of people agree with you and so I
guess the question is why hasn't
detected
stepped-up why haven't you written a
purchase order well I'm not the military
but there's a police force in San
Francisco have they written a purchase
order I can't speak to it but why
don't--you're you live in San Francisco
I do well then I suggest you lobby your
police force because they could be the
first in the country you can do a whole
question of if the technology exists why
wouldn't the San Francisco Police
Department be the first in the nation
that you know this this is an industry
that will show you what is possible and
will supply you what you're willing to
buy and and so I'm not gonna be at that
show you know coming up but I'm sure
that each of those manufacturers tell
you the same thing you give me a
purchase order I'll deliver your product
sure thanks a lot thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
