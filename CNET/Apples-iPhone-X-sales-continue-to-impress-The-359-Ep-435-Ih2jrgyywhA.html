Fox Rubin and Alfred Inc good morning
guys hey what's up so professional now I
know you're a real pro dude well well
done I've done this for a minute I feel
like I can't curse anymore on this show
I really shouldn't
you really shouldn't you did it like
it's so willingly when Katz Meyer was in
here earlier he did it first like what
am I supposed yeah open yeah and or
exactly sound like my kids anyway today
we're gonna be talking about Apple
earnings which were announced yesterday
as expected things were really really
good for Apple we'll try to break it
down a little bit more and give you guys
a little bit more insights about it
you're gonna say so has a lot of money
and now they have many more they're
they're gonna continue to exist for a
little while longer and then the rest of
the show we're gonna focus on Facebook
they took down an influencer campaign
ahead of the midterm elections well
yesterday and they also announced some
ways to limit your screen time today so
we'll get through all that stuff but
anyway sending your questions and
comments BVG we'll get to as many as you
can at the end of the show and let's get
to the podcast we'll see you guys in the
chat in 3 minutes and 59 seconds from 3
to
welcome to the 359 I'm Ben Fox Ruben I'm
Alfred Eng Apple reported stronger
iPhone sales in its latest quarter but
it seems the bigger news is the tech
giant's transformation into a services
company services revenue jumped 31% for
the quarter as more people used Apple
pay Apple Care and iCloud this could
mean that Apple won't really care if you
regularly upgrade your phone because
you'll be paying them anyways I mean I
think they should care if you regularly
update your phone though that's where
like all those security features come in
yeah okay fine I think they know they
would want to care about that but yeah I
think most of them revenue coming from
that it was a bit of a shock to me just
because I thought most of it would come
from its hardware so most of it does
come from hardware but this was the
biggest growth area by far other than
other products which includes like the
air pods and the home pod I was gonna as
that's a much much smaller section so
the home pod doing I mean like they said
apparently Tim Cook was like very
bullish on literally everything but you
know as with other tech companies it
doesn't get into a lot of specifics so
that's that's a bit of an issue one of
the other things that's that we're
really waiting to see is is that they're
expected to come out in September with
three count them three new iPhone case
three and their average selling prices
on their iPhones is up because the
iPhone 10 is 999 dollars the larger
iPhone 10 that is expected to come out
in September will be $100 more than that
so just keep giving them your money yeah
but I think that you know originally
when they first announced the price of
the iPhone 10 I just thought who is
going to buy that that's not gonna sell
at all and Here I am extremely wrong
right because that that is a big reason
why like their revenues have been
soaring yeah I jump ship and I switch
the same song but apparently I am an
extreme outlier because everybody else
just willingly handed over their money
anyway next up Facebook said it took
down a coordinated quote influencer
campaign ahead of the midterms 32
accounts and pages were removed
alfrid that doesn't really sound like a
lot to me I mean it's it's not a lot
when you consider it's only these
accounts but if you think about like how
many account how many other people
follow these pages their Facebook had
said that in total 290 thousand accounts
followed at least one of these pages
which is that's a large amount of people
and then they like these 32 counts were
you know responsible for about 30
real-life events that had taken place
where people showed up to and like
protests and counter protested when this
was something that was not like done
genuinely which is exactly the same
playbook that the internet research
agency did which was the Russian troll
farm now that's the exact same playbook
that they had it was you know post this
really divisive comp contact content
whether or not it's from the left or the
right political view the whole idea is
to sow chaos and you know have people
not trust the political system and just
generally be angry with each other that
being said even though it's the same
playbook as what Russian trolls did it's
still unclear whether or not they were
the same ones that were behind it but it
is clear that you know this managed to
slip through even though Facebook
implemented all these measures to
basically stop that from happening so
they're catching on to Facebook's tricks
and kind of getting around it again and
more of a cat-and-mouse game cat and
mouse game continues last up Facebook
and Instagram which is owned by Facebook
unveiled new features today to help
people limit their screen time on both
apps there's a dashboard that helps you
track how much time you've spent on
either app and alerts that tell you if
you've gone over your set time limit is
this something that you think you would
use as an adult no but I think this is
more for parents that I don't think
you're right kids no I think that if
I've read this on myself I can just turn
it off that's correct but I think that
like people do need like a light nudge
sometimes to say like hey you've had
your face in your phone I mean I might
be a different case just cuz I don't use
social media that much like on my own
anyway so and I don't need an app to
tell me not to use it I just don't use
it but I can understand if somebody else
who is weaker than me might not ouch
feel that way well everybody remember to
follow me on in
to Graham such sweet thirst from Ben Fox
Ruben if you want to read more about
these stories check us out on CNET I'm
Ben Fox Ruben I'm offering thanks for
listening okay thanks everybody it takes
me a minute to do these things back here
I'm pushing a lot of buttons I know I
know a lot so as always it's the end of
the show for the recording of the audio
podcast and now we'd like you to go
ahead and chime in with your comments
and questions so that we can continue
the conversation about the topics at
hand
wow that was thrown some pretty harsh
shade Alfred the weak side weaker than
you I'm very powerful that's not
throwing shade at like other people for
being on social media like I'm not
saying that they're weak it's just I'm
extremely powerful he's a strong man so
I get like over 9000 yeah muscle most
people would be weaker than me so it's
not like but I think you're wrong about
the fact that like so parental controls
have existed for certain types of
devices I think Amazon has done a really
good job with them on tablets yeah for a
while but what's happening now is that
whether you agree with the concept or
not the concept of phone addiction is
much more prevalent than it used to be
and you know just the argument that
people check their phone dozens and
dozens of times a day yeah I think it's
good that they allow that option for it
you know what's really funny is that you
need to have the app to do it which is
basically download our app on your phone
because you can browse Facebook and you
can browse Instagram without needing the
app I use this app to use apps less
that's what I do I thought that's an
interesting point I go on Facebook on my
phone but I only use like the web
browser for it and because I don't have
the app I don't get notifications for it
all the time I don't get like pinged all
the time about that I'm not inclined to
just go and click on it so it's kind of
like hey here's this thing to help you
use us less but you can only use this
thing that makes you use it more
to access it it is it is so sense to me
it is obviously interesting and/or
ironic that the concept being pushed as
far as limiting your screen time is
being presented by the folks that
actually created the problem in the
first place so they're obviously trying
to create a certain level of like
positive PR about it who knows if people
are actually going to use this feature
right it's like if Marlboro like came
out with like nicotine patches or like
slim cigarettes you know like the like
they did do that you know like those
where they were like there's less
there's less the Catena and tobacco in
these they're less addictive because
they're slightly thinner so they yeah
the other thing I wanted to mention in
the show in May Google also came out
with similar controls for its next
version of Android and yeah and also
expect to see this kind of thing in the
next version of iOS iOS 12 so it's not
just Facebook that's moving in this dorm
that makes sense to me though because
like that's on your phone like on its
hardware and you can do that for every
app it's not like like you can do that
for a snapchat you can do that for
Google you can do that for YouTube
funnily enough all of them in their
demos of it always used Facebook and
Instagram because I think they
recognized that that's where a lot of
this like really bored yes but not all
the time Google did do it for YouTube
though which is where I waste most of my
time as because I like to be a you know
be a part of the community with our
viewers and watch all the crappy videos
that are on YouTube as well nice thirst
yeah job follow me on YouTube cool
that's at sea net let's get to questions
and don't forget to smash that like
button here's a great question from our
wallet did Facebook tell its fans about
the pages that they removed so that they
would know that they were being
influenced by a shady coordinated
campaign oh that's a fantastic point
it's a good question a did that for the
first instance they did that for the
first batch that they had deleted with
the IRA accounts they it's unclear if
they've done that for these 38 accounts
that have been deleted 32
- sorry yeah I mean some of them are in
our story
like for instance black elevation
resistors and mindful being as as stolen
warriors so it's not like they're hiding
the fact of like what the pages were
called but it is a good point as far as
like anybody that did start liking these
pages they probably should have alerted
folks and said like hey this was this is
part of an influencer campaign they get
you to vote for I don't know Mickey
Mouse or something yeah but I'm not sure
if they've told people that have seen
these posts yet only because you know
they they barely even informed like
congressional members even I I spoke
with Senator Mark Warner office who said
like they had only reached out to them
yesterday like the day before they made
the announcement mhm
others knew like a week before like the
DHS knew like a few days ago and they
apparently their Facebook it's been
working for the FBI on this but I don't
know if they've like actually reached
out to people that saw this content yet
so one other thing I also wanted to ask
you doing the podcast was is this good
news that they announced this these
takedowns of the influence campaign does
it mean that they're on top of their
game ahead of the midterms or is the
opposite
I've seen some takes on this you know in
the sense of oh they're being more
proactive now like actively calling this
out and letting people know about it
before like journalists or congressional
members find out about it and it is
interesting so in the last one the last
you know misinformation campaign that
was like something like about that was
like millions of people that had seen it
whereas this one is like a much smaller
scale with like 290 thousand which is
still a large number but compared to
what like right last like three year
influencer campaign was like you know
not that much so I think if Facebook
wanted to they probably could have swept
this under the rug but I think that they
are trying to make amends with all the
mistakes that they've made in the past
you know you've seen from their earnings
with Mark Zuckerberg where he talks
about you know we're applying all these
fixes and we're working hard to earn
your trust back and stuff that you know
they are trying to be as transparent
about this as possible
is interesting though that they are
being trend
parent about this an election content
but not so much like their policy on
misinformation and other things that
also hurt their bottom line
geez I wonder what you mean so let's
swing into a question from Josh Boyd and
well more of a comment than a question
it's not immediately related to what
you're talking about but I don't think
they're dissimilar in any way shape or
form
I like how tech companies are advocating
to use their products less I feel like
these are just PR moves to help with
their images could this be applied as
well to this sudden activism from
Facebook to try to clean up the mess
that has come out of their lack of
quality control historically every move
from a major company is a PR move like
that's I wouldn't disagree with that yes
uh-huh
mark it down in the chat sounds well got
along today sounds rather blunt but I
don't think that's completely wrong at
all yeah I feel like everything a
company does is to make itself look
better and you know if they if they keep
touting it then you know oh look at all
these like things we're doing that like
no one actually uses like yeah III think
I don't think a lot of people are gonna
use this like time limiter tool that
Facebook is rolling out I think parents
might roll them out for their kids but
the thing is is that on an iPhone and on
Android phones that makes sense because
you have like parental tools to like
manage like stuff stuff right you don't
really do that on a social media account
you like if might if like your kid had
like a Facebook account like that kid
would only have access to that Facebook
account you wouldn't be able to be like
oh let me manage your Facebook and see
what messages you're seeing or anything
like that you mean you can technically
do that on Facebook mess with your kids
which is another bag of worms that I
won't get into but I think the idea like
this is something that like you would
have to manage yourself on other devices
like you had you can have parental
controls on it you can even do that with
Nintendo switch like they have the
parental controls tool on that but on
like Facebook and Instagram like that's
your own account like you can't like
pair it with another account where like
your parents would have access to it so
like you're gonna be the ones to do that
I mean I guess as a parent you could
tell you a kid like give me your phone
I'm like changing the limiter on that
see if I follow you the point is is that
there's no accountability yeah because
just change the limiter change because
it's your account I got you right this
is different it's it's so the one that I
know the best about because I cover
Amazon are their tablets and the parents
set those and when you're done with
those time limits you're done yeah you
know you basically have to let go and
bug mom and dad because that's hard ways
to do well not only that but like the
kid does not have the password to like
actually like login to the parental
congest and change it so and if it's
only app based like what's to say like
that it'll also function like when
you're on desktop which I don't know how
many people still use like computers but
whatever what's the computer yeah yeah
get out iPad I can't help but think I've
got a really annoying cat that has zero
portion control so I got one of those
time to automatic feeders and the
concept in my head is just like yes
there's a time to automatic feeder to
try to help portion out the food for the
cat but I also let the cat try to refill
it like there's no point in this is that
a weird analogy I guess the cat refill
its own food I don't know that that's in
my head like the cat has full access to
the big bag but then there's like the
timer out there so like the point of
this that I guess the point I'm trying
to make is this limiter thing is kind of
like a total bunk unless you give a
third party yeah yeah that that makes
the most sense
Wow there's actually a feature that we
could develop ourselves where it's like
we would call it like Alfred does it
where if you hit a certain time limit
Alfred will come to your office and slap
the phone out of your hand and say
you're done for the day
and that's that's the accountability
that we're looking for I often do that
with people in our office and they're
not really appreciated oh we really like
that's really helpful and it really
helps me reduce my screen time so thank
you very much for that coming in from
Josh Boyd a again he says digital
wellness will be the 2018 tech industry
buzzword I don't think he's wrong
let's go ahead and take one from Rikki
be is interesting do we find it shady
that Facebook released all this found
false data for the accounts after their
stock
plummeted mmm I think they're looking
for a win that's obvious and if they
could spin this in a positive way then
good for them
so I'm I I just don't know how to take
it like like look at it because in some
ways it does present them as being
proactive but in another ways as Alfred
said it's it's a cat-and-mouse game and
it shows that an influencer campaign was
able to like trickle through anyway I'm
not sure of their stock really affected
this that much I mean I don't think they
thought you know Oh or investors are
worried about the US let's put out those
news that there's even more like
disapprobation going on yeah I don't
know like I don't think that that like
their stock like drop was was an
influence in this if anything you know
it would have made their stock worse but
I don't know like I don't think I don't
think like this announcement like really
did anything for them like money-wise it
didn't really impact the stock that much
because after the stock took like a
giant nosedive it's basically been like
flattish for the past couple days
because I don't know investors just are
not ready to jump back into Facebook
because the stock like caved so badly so
you might be right that this piece of
news doesn't really impact things one
way or another related to the stock
nothing matters is is the moral of this
story thank you on the flip side of the
coin do we feel like Facebook is just
getting kicked while it's down after
they lost a ton of market value like
kicked by whom by us I guess in general
by the audience or possibly by well I
guess any sort of critic whether it be
governmental or company or they've had a
really lousy year and I think a lot of
it is really justified like they are
getting kicked while they're down but
they've also screwed up a lot in a
variety of ways like whether it's
through influence campaigns having lousy
financials that pisses off walls it's
being kicked while it's down though
because that implies there's an active
like measured going against it I think
it's been years of Facebook failing to
prepare and like everything is falling
down on them now yeah I think they can
and look they're still one of the
biggest companies in the world they're
still ridiculously profitable Mark
Zuckerberg you know he lost like
something like 16 billion dollars in one
day after the stock tanked I think he's
still worth I wish I remember either way
he's worth still tens of billions of
dollars he's gonna be just fine
so even with a really bad year with how
much they've actually cratered and done
poorly there they're still in a very
strong position and they're not going
anywhere
yeah I'm sure they're all crying in
their pools of money right I guess what
you're trying to tell me is I should
probably get that money back I donated
to the fake Mark Zuckerberg Kickstarter
yes okay yes please do I'm gonna look up
how much marks me money is how much mark
money mark dollar since dr. Pressler has
Hucker books there hasn't been like into
oceans like 11 type of movie but like
trying to steal from like a tech
billionaire instead I haven't seen the
new ocean's 8 okay so so I did think I
thought he might be worth seventy
billion dollars but after losing that
much money I didn't think it was
possible I'm looking at the Bloomberg
billionaires index and yeah he's the
sixth richest person in the world and
he's worth seventy billion dollars so
poor guy canapé okay six No
see this is why the chats good we like
having your guys's feedback outside
perspectives and makes us think more
critically about the coverage we try to
deliver to you so as always thank you
and while we're at it let's give a shout
out to Val who's joining us live for the
first time long time watcher first time
in the chat what's up Val let's talk
Apple cuz we have to swing it back over
to the iPhone we got some feedback from
guys like Mike Shaw who says I've had
the ten I keep wanting to call it the X
I'm sorry for two weeks now I love it
the cameras amazing mimo ng an emoji is
like dictating text with added fun great
if you're into ENFP also off-color
Emerald Network says I have the iPhone
10 - and it's amazing my classmate has a
galaxy s 9 and the 10 still beats it in
speed and the camera keep sending us
your feedback we want to hear more about
about your personal experiences with the
iPhone 10 if you have it
and possibly what you're looking forward
to the Apple might be bringing to the
table in the near future here's a
question from Drew Nelson is Apple
really a services company like Microsoft
is it seems unlikely that's a unique
perspective we haven't talked about yet
it's it's more just to clarify it's more
that it's moving in that direction like
for instance services were up 31% this
past quarter but there's still 10
billion dollars in revenue compared to
iPhone sales which were about thirty
billion dollars so the fact is is that
Wall Street and a lot of business folks
are paying attention to the fact that
services revenue are growing so quickly
that this massive tech giant is kind of
in the middle of this really big
transformation and that's kind of what I
wanted to touch upon there's still very
much a devices company but where they're
headed in the next couple of years could
be really interesting and it could also
really highlight how they sell to you
where they package one device but then
they package it with like a bunch of
different subscriptions and that's how
they continue to make their money and
you know make like figure it figure out
like okay we're gonna sell you an iPhone
for let's say a thousand dollars but
then you're gonna have all these
subscriptions tacked on we're we're just
gonna make more money off of you as you
own the iPhone from Ricky B do y'all
think the slower data speed on the
iPhone with the Intel chips will affect
any of their sales or people's
perception of them great question
I mean unless it's a like noticeable
slowdown I don't think so
like even if they changed the chips and
they just matched the same speed as
everyone else's like I think the
advantages of the iPhone or iOS for a
lot of people are you know it's security
the camera and just being a little show
off that you have an iPhone I genuinely
think that the Intel chips are already
in a bunch of iPhone devices this year I
believe they're in AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile but
don't don't like take that to the bank
but either way people don't really
complain that much about them and it
obviously isn't harming iPhone sales so
the fact that they're moving or they're
expected to move completely in the
direction of Intel there's a little bit
of risk there bud they already tested it
out
here and it seems going fine like unless
it's completely noticeable I don't think
it's gonna change a thing Intel is
definitely slower than Qualcomm but it's
kind of as you saying like the point is
is that like how much are people really
gonna notice the difference
probably not that many unless you're
like a really heavy power user
the only difference we're gonna notice
is if the actual Intel chips shave that
Qualcomm dollars off the bottom-line
price on these phones which knowing
Apple I'm gonna guess it well actually
and it cost more now so just just
because you said that I really hope they
bring back the Intel commercials though
with like the the people and the bunny
suits that are dancing around and like
the do you remember those you sure that
wasn't like a Showtime thing that you
saw like really late at night are we
sure alfred was alive when those came
out okay both both of those comments
we're pretty good I have no response all
right we're getting down to the wire
let's take another question from Mike
Shaw do some people think the 6.1 LCD
iPhone quote-unquote iPhone 9 will
outsell the other new iPhones what do we
think
it seems the iPhone 10 is the bestseller
and it has been so I would expect that
the like the most expensive ones will
continue to be the top sellers baffling
to me but I guess the idea is that like
why would I buy the iPhone 8 for like
what like seven eight hundred dollars
somewhere when I can just pay the extra
200 for this thing that's like way
better you know I mean like if you
really show yeah is it really better
though if you're already paying that
much for it though why not just like
give a little bit more for something
that thing that you is exactly what
Apple wants you yes you can came for
bragging rights without any foundation I
disagree with this and I I think there
isn't gotta be decent amount of
foundation plus like I think it's very
important to show people that you have
more money than them or you're more
powerful than them in terms of influence
or social status
I'm verified on Twitter by the way I
just said moly knows yeah seem to be I
bring this up at every party that I go
to
no one likes talking to me but you know
what I don't need to talk to them I'm
verified on Twitter I don't I don't need
them good job I also have an iPhone 10 I
don't but I did I tell it I'd be awesome
can you get me verified on Twitter
I'll try to I'll try to see where I can
do something there's something weird
going on with Twitter verifications
right now I'm sorry oh we got we got
verified before like things went south
if anything it's cool to not be verified
now did you say so
I do say so okay one more question
before we call it a day from our wall up
one more time will Apple ever give us
touch ID back one of the reasons I'm
still rocking an iPhone 6s for one
bless your heart because that's the
phone my girlfriend has and that thing
is just circling the drain so it the
fact that you've kept that alive is
impressive I'm still using a 5s just
because I don't want to get an se I
think that there is a race right now
though to try to get touch ID or
fingerprint ID stuff like underneath the
screen itself so that you don't need the
physical button for it if there's any
way that it comes back it most likely
it'll be in that form we talk to we
touch upon this yesterday a bit and it
seems likely that if you are really
interested in like an inch screen
fingerprint ID you're much more likely
to get it in a Samsung phone like a
Samsung flagship phone as opposed to an
Apple phone it seems that Apple is
moving in the direction of face ID and
may not actually go back to touch ID
which is unfortunate but I would at
least be a little bit surprised if they
decided to like push back and do touch
ID and face ID well the thing is one
phone like that wouldn't really make a
lot of sense based ideas like something
you can only use like on the 10 right
now though mm-hmm so I mean unless every
phone is gonna have all those like AR
features on its front facing camera I
don't know I mean maybe that's the route
that they're trying to go at though it
seems that way I mean like that's why
they would have like three different
iPhones three different iPhone tens this
like next upcoming year and no I have no
idea what the hell they're gonna call
them whether it's like the iPhone 10
Mini iPhone 10 plus and I don't know
iPhone 10 point oh I'd be okay with an
iPhone Mini okay just give me a small
phone I don't need this like taking up
so much space in my pocket all right one
more question came in under the buzzer
from Matthew - er can we please get rid
of notches Oh No
with notches didn't you hear the comment
Stach people love their iPhones they
love the iPhone 10 thing about I think
we should have more notches like some
notches on the side at the bottom - it's
either gonna be that it's either gonna
be that or it's gonna get to the
headphone argument that like some one
day Apple is going to backpedal get rid
of the notch and they're gonna get
praise for being courageous again I mean
they'll get praise no matter what they
do
that's our this is a pretty funny Apple
bashing I mean I'm enjoying myself well
I wish we could keep it stretched on for
the entire day however we do have to go
thanks for joining us and thanks to our
new sponsor USB and Ben you want to go
ahead and take us on out of here yeah
