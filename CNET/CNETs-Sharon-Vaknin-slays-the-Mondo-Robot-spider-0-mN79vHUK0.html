plaza of CES just outside the cnet booth
in a very large space so that we can
take a look at a 50 foot snake and a
mondo spider we'll get to that later but
first I'm here with one of the creators
of eat art so Charlie tell me what we're
looking at right now so this is
titanoboa it's a 50-foot long
electromechanical snake and it's a
actually a recreation of an ancient
dinosaur snake the easter exists 60
million years ago what why why an
ancient dinosaur snake well the idea was
that the ancient snake went extinct
because the climate cooled down so now
in the face of modern climate change
we're resurrecting this beast is kind of
like a vehicle to generate discussions
about energy issues okay so you guys are
trying to make a statement with this
50-foot long mechanical okay just tell
me how this works yeah like it well so
this is a project that kind of blends a
whole bunch of different disciplines of
engineering with art so that's kind of
our our target is we're going to try and
get people excited about engineering and
technology using a crazy mechanical
sculpt it but how is it built it looks
like a spinal cord to me yeah so what
you see is there's a twenty custom
welded aluminum vertebrae and between
all the vertebrae's you've got cylinders
that are kind of like the muscles of the
snake and they work with hydraulic fluid
it's kind of like the blood that pumps
through the snake so um you said it's 50
feet but I noticed that there is a tail
sitting over there in the corner so what
happened to the tail yeah so we just
took the tail off temporarily as we're
getting set up here and we're getting
rolling because sometimes it tends to
whip around and have a bit of a mind of
its own so have there been any injuries
so far uh no usually we try and put
ourselves between the snake and whatever
else well its operating just so that we
can if anybody's going to get damn
it's gonna be okay good cuz I don't want
to get damaged um so this thing is 1,200
pounds and I'm really excited to see it
go and about all of you guys are excited
to see it so let's make this thing
happen okay okay everyone signed
liability releases oh my god whoa okay
this is insane I cannot believe how
smoothly this thing is just snaking its
way through the parking lot charlie
don't get hit okay so now I see why the
tail was taken off because I do not
think that we could handle it um so yeah
James over there is operating this
titanoboa wirelessly with his remote
controller so he has the most awesome
job right now yeah he is the snake
charmer he's the perfect driver for this
machine and he's communicating with one
of the several brains along the spine of
the snake they're all working in tandem
to coordinate that movement okay how
long did it take you guys okay I heard
you brought this to burning man right we
did so we're our nonprofit organization
called a art is funded these products
are all funded by grants from
organizations like burning man and
sponsorships from companies like Lenovo
who brought us here for this event so so
tell me how the heck you guys managed to
keep this thing functioning when you're
at Burning Man and we all know it's a
dust bowl where things are just flying
you can't breathe so how the heck did
this thing survive it was pretty rugged
like we had a lot of technical
difficulties up first year and you know
dusts contaminating connections and
and things but we're going to take it
back hopefully this year with a lot more
robust set up and be able two different
kinds of motion and hopefully have a
better time of it okay so I heard that
you guys can actually monitor the
Diagnostics I don't know if it's for the
snake or for the spider via your
smartphone yeah is that true we what we
got here is this like like it's on a
tablet and we've got all the kind of
voltages battery levels motor speed
pressure and all the sensor values so we
can see what's going on via Wi-Fi from
the snake as it's running so we got it
working on like phones and tablets and
stuff it's just a preliminary version of
this app but yeah it's so it's an app
can i download it can i monitor it while
I'm at home wondering how my snake is
doing on to i think you know you have to
be close enough to get the Wi-Fi signal
that's coming over to the snake's head
but ok so from my hotel room across this
yeah probably ok um no now I want to
talk about the spider yeah so let's yeah
let's do that ok guys we're moving on to
the mondo spider all right so you so
first of all did you actually get your
hands dirty did you build these things
yeah so I this is this titanoboa was
originally my idea and then I brought
more people on board on the team and as
we got more and more into it I
transitioned from doing like welding and
it's already stuffed more should just
kind of be in the project organizer
because there was about 15 or 20 people
working on this thing all volunteers in
the evenings and weekends and stuff so
ok so you bringing up the word
volunteers kind of makes me want to ask
is this what you do full-time is this
lucrative how do you guy are you guys
like all living in one bedroom and
building things by night we all have our
day jobs where engineers some of us are
students artists and technicians and we
just we all share this kind of common
interest of making these crazy machines
and we do in our spare time and and yeah
so were you expecting it to be such a
hit ah no when we first when we first
started with this with the splatter we
just were kind of driven by this desire
to make something really cool and then
once we had built it it became clear
that that desire was kind of weed hidden
pond something that was actually
valuable and could be enjoyed by lots of
people okay because I am ready to enjoy
this thing um the great thing about the
spider is that it is actually operated
by a person sitting in it and today that
person is going to be me so I'm oh yes
maybe like John kind of explain how the
spider works so thank you so much so I
have John and Ryan with me so tell me
about how the spider works and the
spider is a big magnificent piece of
Clockwork yeah it's very a lot of words
yeah it's very easy to operate as long
as you're properly trained so oh sorry
real quick I am not properly trained
well that's hopefully we can get you up
to being properly trained in the next
couple of seconds Oh so the first thing
you have to do is figure out how to get
in okay and then we'll show you the
controls and some of the emergency
safety maneuvers okay but before but
before I go in I'm just kind of curious
as to how this works right I'm not an
engineer so pretend well that it's
actually a totally closed loop zero
emissions machine so we have a mobile
side that makes complete sense to me no
one of those ok we have a mobile solar
array which charges a set of lithium
iron phosphate batteries like you might
see an electric car okay and then the
batteries run electric motors the motors
run hydraulic pumps the pumps robin
hydraulic where are the solar panels the
solar panels are back in Vancouver oh so
it's already been charged up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
