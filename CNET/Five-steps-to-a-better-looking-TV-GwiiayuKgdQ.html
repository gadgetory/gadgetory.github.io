have to go beyond the default settings
the screen ships with and that's because
the TV needs to be customized for your
room specifically so here are five tips
to help you get a better TV picture
first disable any extra smart features
like the soap opera effect that's the
setting that tries to reduce blur but
really just makes everything look like
another episode of days of our lives on
this Samsung the setting is called auto
Motion Plus and it can be turned off in
picture options for this TV I also have
options for things like digital noise
filter and MPEG noise filter in that
same menu turn off those extra features
too
before you go any further check to make
sure the aspect ratio is correct I can't
tell you how many times I see these TV
setups where the picture is cut off
because the resolution is set
incorrectly for most TVs you'll find
access to that setting on the remote
like this picture size button in this
menu there are a few options like 16:9
for three wide fit and so on if the
shape of the picture looks funny as you
switch between sources like DVDs or even
older TV programming you may need to
adjust the aspect ratio so that it fits
the content like aspect ratio make a
habit of accessing your TV's modes as
you switch between programming for
example on this TV we've got dynamic
standard natural and movie but on many
TVs you'll also see options like sports
and games you can also use one of these
as the base for some fine tuning so I
can choose dynamic for example and then
head over to backlight brightness
contrast and color for incremental
tweaks there's a lot to cover here so
check out my video on how to calibrate
your TV by eye to find out what these
settings mean and how to set them
correctly if free styling menu options
sounds scary we've got a cheat sheet for
you whenever CNET's TV expert David Katz
Meyer reviews the new TV he also posts
recommended picture settings for it in
our scene at forums his posts include
all the basics but he also dives into
specific color settings white balance
and even those extra features we talked
about if you don't see a cheat sheet for
your TV give tweak TV a try it's another
trusted resource with a huge library of
recommended settings now if you really
want to get your hands dirty and adjust
your settings so that the screen is
unique to your room specifically you're
going to want to get a calibration disk
these are DVDs that take you
step-by-step through a calibration
process where you'll adjust TV settings
using the help of on-screen graphics one
example is Disney's world of wonder
blu-ray DVD what's great about this guy
is that there are options for amateur
and advanced users plus the whole
process is super user friendly it's
about twenty bucks on Amazon and when
you're done you can pass it on to a
friend with these tips you should be
well on your way to a better looking TV
but if you have any questions about the
process hit me up on Twitter and check
out how to see Netcom for the full
written guide for this video
