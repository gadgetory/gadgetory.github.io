these days because so many cars already
have the parts in them to enable it let
me show you first of all here in the
front these are your front parking
sensors lots of cars have these I bet
you're a does you know pbbbb these
corner sensors a little less common but
they're starting to pervade across the
automotive industry now in the back of
course we have more sensors as well as
the rear camera they look straight back
which gives the car the ability to do
some image recognition especially of
what's along the side here in terms of
the kerb distance and of course other
vehicles often have side cameras under
the mirrors and front cameras that can
also be taken into play all you have to
add to that is a way to turn the wheel
that's where electric power steering is
very critical lots of cars are using it
now for fuel efficiency let's drag on
the engine but while you're at it that's
a computer addressable steering rack
unlike the old dumb hydraulic rams it
all comes together with software let me
show you ok I enable the automatic
parking and now the cars says is
scanning for a parking space on the
right side a parking space is big enough
for this vehicle that's the key thing a
lot of people can't judge that very well
ok does it sound one pull a little
further forward and then it tells you
where to put the car into reverse now
hands off the wheel and just nibble it
back I'm just gonna use creak once they
get this thing rolling and just work the
brake hands off and it's reading all of
its sensors camera it's looking for the
distance to the cars distance to the
curb angle of the car working that
electric power steering rack that's a
key technology this space is really
tight it's gonna require some backing
film now I'm watching at the back here
so I don't bump into that car right
there it says here to stop going the
drive it goes full lock
all the way forward and they're coming
to come back in a minute
this nibbling logic to me is really
impressive that says stop now go back
and reverse let's see how this is going
to work
that's pretty good then I'm gonna pull
it forward do a little last nibble that
is a pretty good parking job
