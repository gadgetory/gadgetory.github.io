SmartWatch based on looks alone I bet
you'd assume this handsomely styled
timepiece is your average analog watch
you'd be very mistaken because as its
name suggests the notifier channels
smartphone alerts and other useful info
right to your wrist hi this is Bryan
Bennett for CNET let's find out what
this gadget is all about price at one
hundred and twenty nine dollars the
notifier is relatively affordable at
least compared to fancy smartwatches
such as the metal pebble steel which
clocks in at two hundred and forty nine
dollars to me the no defiers classic
watch face also looks more sophisticated
than the original pebbles plastic
construction and iing display what gives
the notifier smarts away are a tiny dot
shaped light in the corner along with a
thin OLED screen running along the
bottom of the watch face the notifier
connects to both Android and iOS devices
via companion apps and a wireless
Bluetooth connection right out of the
gate the notifier app is configured to
provide warnings for incoming calls text
calendar appointments email and staple
social media events the watch's software
is also aware of what applications are
installed on your phone you can then
turn on alerts for these apps or even
better add them as your device app
roster grows another interesting feature
in the notifiers arsenal are vibration
patterns essentially you can have the
watch buzzed almost Morse code style
distinctively to match each type of
message for example vibration patterns
like long short long means you have a
call long short short means you have a
text and so on the Martian notifier does
have its drawbacks for one while its
splash proof it's not fully water
resistant that means
no showering or swimming with the
notifier strapped on you charge the
device through a micro USB cable and
port located under a flap unfortunately
the charging contacts are dug in really
deep so you can only charge the watch
with the no defiers USB cable and it's
oddly long tip I'm Brian Bennett
foreseen it and you
taking a first look at the Martian
notifiers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
