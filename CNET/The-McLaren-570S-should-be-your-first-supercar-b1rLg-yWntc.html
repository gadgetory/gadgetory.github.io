the 570s might be MacLaren's new
entry-level model but it could be the
most important car from walking's finest
ever
the 570s is the first car in McLaren
Sport Series unlike their stablemates
these cars will be fully rode focused
there is not the same emphasis on
downforce as there is on the 650 s and
p1 rather attention has gone in to make
this a real car you can use every day
design-wise McLaren have given us an
incredibly elegant package starting
around the front the headlights are a
slightly muted version of the ones we
get on the 650 s and the p1 still aping
that speedy Kiwi logo but in a much more
refined and subtle way the front
splitter is a lot more aggressive
slightly reminding me of the Lamborghini
front end and these creases in the
bonnet look awesome and they're
functional they channel air around the
sides of the car one of my favorite
details is how these slide lights
follow the line from the air channel
behind the wheel leading to the side air
scoops the side air scoops look much
more like they do on the p1 than on the
650s but a subtler and more elegant
version thereof I also love the air
intake above and under this door line
here back here this flying buttress is
awesome and again functional channeling
and down the side of the car and to
where it's needed over the deck lid the
deck lid actually features the two
nostrils the same that we get on the 6
mm 5 LT the rear in total is a softer
affair much more refined than is on the
650s and the exhausts have now been
moved to a lower less likely to burn the
cameraman position closer to the deck
there is nothing entry-level about the
looks of the 570s in fact I think it's
the best-looking car in their lineup if
money was no object and I was going on
looks alone this might be the way that I
go these early sketches of the 570s
show how all these design cues were
planned from the very beginning the
first concept of the car by Rob Melville
already shows their front end and the
side air scoops amongst others so why is
this car so important previous
MacLaren's have been aimed at the very
top of the market that people may who
casually shell out for the latest
supercar without much thought people
whose collection wouldn't be complete
without the latest bedroom poster car
the 570s though is
lower down the market looking to take
some customers away from Porsche for the
same money you could get a 911 Turbo S
or an Audi r8 v10 plus zero to sixty two
times are all within point one of a
second of each other and top speeds are
almost identical the 570s even has more
power than the 911 and more torque than
the r8 it's also the first time you can
get a McLaren for under a hundred and
fifty thousand pounds which altogether
makes this an extremely attractive
choice
the McLaren we know is only really about
five years old and it's incredible to
think how far they've come in such a
short period of time they've broken into
a club of the very exclusive members a
club that has names that been around for
decades and yet their cars are now
counted amongst and in some cases
beating them rapidly the company has
gone from a single car lineup to having
three distinct categories that cater to
a wide audience McLaren is giving people
what they want be that an apex predator
hybrid hyper car or in this case a more
affordable road focused sports car what
they've achieved in such a short period
of time is nothing short of unbelievable
this car is going to sell like hotcakes
McLaren is aiming to be producing 4000
of these by 2017 that will more than
double the current output if that many
get made over enough years there are
going to be a bunch of these circulating
around the second-hand market right
around the time some of you watching
this right now will have earned enough
to take that plunge on the used supercar
market so this is extremely likely to be
a lot of people's first supercar
the 570s has a 3.8 liter twin-turbo v8
kicking out 562 brake horsepower and 442
foot-pounds of torque so your 260 is 3.2
seconds and it tops out at 204 miles an
hour making this the latest member of
the 200 mile an hour plus Club a very
prestigious group indeed but 150
thousand pound question is how is it to
drive
now this may be aimed firmly at the
sports car market but this thing is
supercar quick there are a variety of
driving modes available meaning you can
dial in exactly how ferocious you want
the throttle to be and how you want the
chassis to handle sports mode across the
board is pretty much where I've had
everything today and that has just given
me the right amount of fear and
excitement exactly where you want to be
with this kind of car the handling
characteristics are pretty neutral
meaning you can put it into a band as
fast as your nerves will allow you and
the car will react pretty much how
you'll expect it to this isn't a crazy
oversteer II monster nor does it dial in
loads of understeer to keep you safe
it's right down the middle in that sweet
spot the brakes are perfect they're firm
you need to be strong on them to get
them to do what you need but they are
predictable linear and they give so much
feedback you can trail break into a
corner and know exactly where you stand
with the car the 570s has skinnier tires
then it's other stablemates
giving you that slightly more dynamic
and exciting feel out on the road you
can still take it out to the track and
of course or attract noise but the price
point that this car is at is going to be
someone's daily driver it has to be easy
to handle and with active mode turned
off the throttle is soft enough to still
keep you safe keep you comfortable if
you buy this and this is your first
supercar and you've never driven
anything with this kind of power before
you're going to feel comfortable safe
and relaxed then as soon as you know
what you're doing and you know how to
turn the systems off a little bit you
can have a lot of fun the engine sound
well
is that very characteristic v8
turbocharged sound where the rawness of
the v8 has been muffled by those to
interpose it's not a thunderous roar and
it's not a a gut-wrenching scream it's a
turbocharged v8 sounds again what you
expect that's the price you pay for that
extra bit of power turn off active mode
let the car do most of the work and
everything softens up to an extremely
pleasant ride this is a car that you
could use every day although I wouldn't
pick this spec with the extra
lightweight seats that only adjust
laterally and not up and down also like
many sport seats these aren't made for
the broader backs gentlemen the speed of
the steering rack has been improved
so you've got that little bit extra
control and on these windy roads you
have the confidence just to throw it in
in the sport mode that I've got selected
it gives you just that tiny bit of
slipped just to kind of get your pulse
racing without you ever really feeling
in any kind of danger
it is remarkable what they've done with
this car and in fact it makes me
question if it was my money would I want
to shell out the extra for the 650s yes
it's a sharper car a faster car more
track-focused absolutely but for me
personally I would only very very rarely
take a car to the track I would just
want a great car great design great
performance that I could use out on the
road and I think if a lot of buyers were
honest that is what they want as well
both the 570s that'd be a far more
attractive prospect where you're getting
supercar Luke's supercar performance and
a supercar badge for high-end sports car
money
there's a couple of concessions in the
570s to making a more effective daily
driver there's way more room up front in
the bonnet thing also for the first time
on a McLaren there are two windscreen
wipers and two vanity mirrors
there's cubby holes everywhere a cup
holder down here which is new from a
clan as this center console has now been
broken up to give you access in between
and these hidden door pockets which are
fantastically deep a really really good
place to leave and forget your phone as
I found earlier there is no doubt that
this car is firmly aimed at taking
customers away from Porsche but it's
actually a more apt comparison with the
Audi r8 v10 plus consider that car there
is a new generation of it coming out
soon with a slightly redesigned body but
all-in-all it is very close to the car
that we've been seeing for quite a long
time now the second-hand market is
flooded with great examples and you can
get a 2008 model with 40,000 miles on it
for about 50,000 pounds now
then consider that coming right up
against the new Audi r8 is this a
McLaren at a price point that a lot of
people are going to be able to afford
this may be aimed at taking customers
away from Porsche but I think the Audi
r8 needs to be scared
MacLaren's in the past have been accused
of being a little less soulful than the
competitors and it's something I feel
they've taken to heart with less focus
on downforce a set of skinnier tires and
plenty of combinations of chassis and
drivetrain settings as well as driver
aids you can dial in the 570s can be a
safe and comfortable everyday car that
just so happens to be eye-watering a
quick set up to your liking though and
this car comes alive the right
combinations of settings can get this
car to misbehave and reward those
drivers looking to find the edge the
name McLaren has been on fast car since
the 60s but the company that makes this
is incredibly young
despite that the 570 feels like it comes
from a company with way more pedigree it
ends a journey of McLaren that's taken
them from effectively a start-up to one
of the most appreciated supercar
manufacturers in the world
McLaren has with the 570s well and truly
solidify this existence in the super car
manufacturers world no longer will it be
a motorsport company that every now and
then drops a road car it's up there with
the great names out of Italy in Germany
that are in the minds of children when
they first learn about the wonderful
world of cars right up to the point when
they might finally get the chance to own
one
not only is the 570s to me probably the
best-looking car in MacLaren's lineup it
has the performance to match if this is
the beginning of a new era for McLaren
they're off to a hell of a start</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
