CES in Las Vegas it's what's today
Thursday and this is CES then depth now
we just announced the best of CES Awards
the cnet best of CES Awards I want to
talk about those with two of the main
people who put those awards programs
together that war program together
that's to my meteorite Lindsay turn time
the editor-in-chief of cnet reviews and
John Falcone execu meda turn to her
right wow what a great lineup of
products we had this year it's pretty
exciting um so I want to talk about some
of the main products and then some of
the how we come up with these the
decision now we choose these products
out of I think there are 30 100
exhibitors here at the show probably
they're all introducing five products or
10 products or in the case of Samsung or
LG probably dozens of products each and
of those we picked 10 then the number
one product because it's already all
over the web was that LG 55 inch oled
display let's talk about that product
why is that the best product of all CES
it's we've been waiting for OLED TVs for
years now and they've finally arrived
and there it's everybody I've talked to
says you know you can go oh it's a
pretty TV and it's thin and then you
look at it and you're blown away the
picture is amazing the bezel is pretty
much not there it's just a beautiful
thing to look at it's four millimeters
thick and we'd see no LED TVs before
even here at CES but they were always 20
inches maybe 30 inches the largest one
they they've shown it was always a
prototype this is what we're being told
is a real product coming later this year
55 inches so you know a real size and
what's really cool about OLED is it kind
of combines the best about plasma and
LCD so it's got the thinness and the
energy efficiency of LCD but it has the
better picture quality of plasma like
infinite blacks it's a self emitting
displays there's no backlight so there's
no this compromise to get with LCD yeah
I would say if you and you know if you
have a lot of we don't know how much
it's going to cost yet but at we all
know later in the year and it's probably
going to be expensive but if you buy the
price is going to come down at least LG
is saying in a few years and if you buy
a new TV two or three years from now
this is the kind of chance TV it's going
to be i just bought a TV wasn't like
David start saving I wanted to point out
this is really like neck-and-neck
because samsung also at a 55-inch oled
competitor and it was as close to a coin
flip physically get and it was what made
the difference while LG provided a
little more data about it basically
that's kind of interesting so if you're
in a highly competitive space and you
want to win an award the morning
devotion editors the more information
about information will tip the scale
over by the way I went and I saw that LG
display over and whatever one of the
halls is that you're right it is
spectacular it wasn't that it was mobbed
to also i have to say i tried on the 3d
glasses 2 is also a 3d display and
although everybody who knows who watches
me knows I can't stand 3d it was pretty
cool and there was no crosstalk that is
another hospital managed with pass no
blasters very neat stuff now the
audience winner this year was a product
called the razor project Fiona first of
all what is it and why is it called a
project it's called a project because
it's very much a prototype probably not
real product but in terms of we don't
expect it to be entering production
anytime soon and there wasn't a lot of
details on when we available whatnot but
basically a Windows 8 tablet with a
gaming centric Windows 8 tablet that has
controls on the side of it kind of like
a split PlayStation control there's a
full pc with a gaming bent and it was
just I don't think we had before
a gaming PC that had the controller is
built into it was just a tablet though
yeah so the whole thing is embedded in a
do you hold is the idea the only like a
steering wheel and exactly that require
a whole new gaming software then well I
don't know if it has the the motion
stuff but just having the controls on
the air now of all the products and this
was our the audience choice so this is
based on cnet readers and viewers voting
for this product was project product
product project what were some of the
other products that were in the Audience
Choice category that also had a shot of
winning the the accolades of the
Phillies here so all of all 36 I think
nominees overall were eligible and the
two runners-up for I think the sony
xperia s cell phone and what was the
third one it's not coming to another sir
that Sony Xperia S is actually really
beautiful what's most xperia i think
everyone was the seagate 4G enabled kind
of nazdike a wireless hotspot that also
was a server okay from seagate i believe
ya audience that sounds like a good
campaign there to get that product into
the audience winners so now the sony
xperia s it was close to be an audience
choice winner in that product is that's
a mobile phone what's so different about
this particular mobile phone you know
III think that's kind of segues us right
into the suggestion of phones and
tablets here at the show it's because
Apple isn't here it's all about Android
basic
and it's just kind of the next wave of
newer better android phones well except
for the one at one which is actually
when is look let's use that let's use
that a segue to talk about what one in
the category of mobile phones which was
the Nokia Lumia 900 which is not an
android phone now I found that that's
our editors choices I found that to be a
very interesting winner that an on
android phone was the best cell phone of
the show considering you know we got the
galaxy note and all sorts of weird new
phones cool new phones why the Nokia
it's it's the best example of a Windows
Phone out there right now and if any
windows phone is going to make it the US
market it's going to be this it felt
kind of saying earlier this morning
there's no compromises windows phone its
4G beautiful screen and camera it is a
really a great form factor people see it
they like it they want to touch it sigh
with it it's very thin it's got that
great aluminum frame it's it's it's the
last best chance the last ad and I think
a very very good phone now so the
hardware is great the internals and the
externals are great do you think that
Windows come this time next year that we
will be seeing windows seven phones be
successful against the Android onslaught
I think that if they are it's because of
this phone really i'm not i wouldn't put
money on it but i do know that every
time somebody who hasn't seen a windows
from current operating system takes a
look at it you know people go on my head
I don't even want to look at a windows
phone but when they do get their hands
on it they start playing the operating
system they're almost always surprised
and at the very least intrigued because
the software is very different from that
I used to I will oh and I would second
that I have a demo windows phone right
now and I would say to people after give
it a look it's it's it's a good platform
the app support of course is not there
it's just in the third place but the
phone itself and the built-in apps are
quite good it's their place with like 30
or 40,000 ass yeah when there's tens of
thousands of apps that if you know if
you don't want to have a really deep
bench of apps right all you really want
us to take some picture
and keep in touch with people and take a
look at your calendar you're you're
going to be it's enough it is except if
you want to be in the Geico sphere and
get all the cool new apps that all the
little tiny starts are working on
they're not working on windows phone 7
they can't afford to right no definitely
not is definitely in third place and so
it's I think there's a real uphill
battle there because you're not going to
win is that the windows team is just not
going to get the kind of exposure from
having this cutting-edge I think we have
seemed to see how that compares against
blackberry basically this blackberry is
really suffering the marketplace and
it'd be interesting to see if windows
phone 7 makes inroads against Blackburn
maybe more so than Android nine work now
I just want to talk about this briefly
is none of our cats tricular category
which is car tech and I want to mention
this because you talk about blackberry
so there are no blackberry mobile phone
products on our list but the QNX car to
mobile apps platform was our car tech
winner I just wanted to mention that
people because that is kind of a vestige
of the blackberry ecosystem in the car
which i think is very interesting place
which me of course qnx is a real-time
operating system which relates a lot to
transportation it's a good for things
that there aren't that are more embedded
so it's what they're building their next
generation smartphone OS right as well
we'll see if they make it that for him
between you and me I'm like I'm not sure
we'll see sorry blackberry okay uh now
there are other interesting books out
there what do you guys think was of all
the products we saw here CS of all the
top 10 of this the bestest he is the
most important product was it the TV or
their other products that was arguably
more important to the technology economy
than that I am really fascinated by the
3d printers there were two 3d printers
on our list there was the MakerBot
product and the free systems product
right to make or maybe about part 1
because it can print in a couple colors
by toad on colors you mean a couple of
materials yes yes colored materials yeah
going what I just love to think about is
this idea that you know five ten years
ago the process of creating words
to certain extent videos became
accessible to everyone so everybody
became a publisher it changed the way
that we consume media and information
this product will let really anybody
with a little bit of money it's two
thousand dollars and as a friend who
knows cat or fado cad make prototype
products in their home and imagine that
if that picks up people who are small
inventors or just have a really
interesting idea just start to make
their own stuff I mean if you're wealthy
and you can afford that you could just
make toys for your kids in your house
it's kind of it's a very interesting
thing to think about to think about all
the possibilities that could come from
being able to quickly fabricate products
in your own home John you going to get
one make your own chest chest kits
exactly I'm probably going to get one
but I idea of that is really intriguing
and they've been nothing it's been
around for a while 3d printing but the
president's like 50,000 to 20,000 to
5,000 now just two thousand dollars
that's really kind of changing the game
making it much more accessible now I was
a little bit involved in the decision of
the emerging tech category where the
MakerBot was the one hour award there
were there other categories that were
very contentious where there was a lot
of argument and how does that resolve I
mean we thought I don't know how many
editors here I did the math I think it's
one percent of all editors journalists
at CES are ours I'm not kidding but how
do we make the decision when there is an
argument to where the most argued about
categories well the way that we the way
just quickly the way that we come to
this conclusion is that we have editors
who are selecting their experts in a
product category they're out on the
floor they're writing about these they
nominate three and then they decide that
beat team decides to group which is
going to win in that category and then
all of the scene of editors get together
in our editorial trailer and we we
hashed it out everybody gets a pitch for
the product that they think should wins
in their category and then we talk about
it we debate and then we vote and and
where aside from arguing about 3d
printers where
we have the most contentiousness 3d
printers was tough to choose between the
MakerBot and they keep 3d one because
they're so close it was similar on the
Samsung and LG 55 inch OLED very similar
products a lot of them were less
contentious I mean it's my understanding
the nokia was a unanimous decision among
the four beat editors on cell phone so
that was interesting and sometimes that
says more about it then if it's
unanimous and there's not a lot of
contention that is fifth is interesting
a fighting over something maybe a better
indicator of success what do you think
that looking at all the products that
were here that all the products that
want all the products are we're
nominated do they as a group indicate
particular important trends in the
technology industry I mean art is
thinness a trend or their other trends
that you see reflected in these products
I think I mean thinnest design there's a
whole discussion in the tech world about
moving past the specs and it's much more
about design and user experience and I
think that's very much on display here
first of all it's like more specifically
in certain categories I mean ultrabooks
ultrabook told that was true that they
every laptop shown here was pretty much
an ultrabook but that almost made them
not stand out so much which is why we
won't the HP envy spectre which had a
cool implementation of Gorilla Glass in
the case and on the palm race and
everything else so it took that idea and
went a different way with the design
that was kind of cool well the other
interesting thing to note is that part
of the reason we're in ultrabooks didn't
win for us overall is because we're
looking all these ultrabooks is saying
well they don't they don't have the next
one is operating system we're gonna have
to wait till fall for windows 8 and all
of this and for the new audio bridge
in tow so we can't recommend pretty much
an entire category because we think that
what we're seeing now is a good hardware
prototype that is not the full
experience and so this just demonstrates
how it a show like CES no matter how
great an idea maybe there's a whole
there's this whole ecosystem that we've
been talking about and if the software
or the services aren't there yet see
there's the hardware speaking of not
there next year at CES Microsoft will
not be exhibiting but it will be the
year when Windows 8 is here what is that
going to do to all the vendors out there
who are making windows products or that
you flying without the the mothership
support you think they'll be all right
they'll be all right i mean when they
say microsoft's not going to be here
microsoft will be here it'll be here in
partnerships it'll be here on hardware
and certainly we know we've been a lot
of stories about how there are 250 Apple
employees here at meetings and roaming
the floor same for facebook here and
here are two different things so right
like Google doesn't have a booth but
there's a million Android devices and
phones and tablets or things so they're
very much here all right so we're at a
time last thing a product you're most
likely to buy from this list in the
coming months well i just bought a TV
but if i were going to buy a new TV i
would buy the LG John probably quite get
to hear that I think is really cool is
this simple TV sort of d yeah break
bringing your own storage EBR product
that we always get question what's this
cord cutting products and this product
from little startup called simple TV
looks really promising that was our home
theater winner yes John Falcone Lindsey
turn time thank you very much thank you
