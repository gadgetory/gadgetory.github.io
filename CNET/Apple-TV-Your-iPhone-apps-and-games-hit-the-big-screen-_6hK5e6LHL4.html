love about apps on your iPhone or iPad
and blow them up to 65 inches that's the
promise of the new Apple TV the Apple TV
box has been around for years but the
latest version is bigger better and more
expensive starting at 150 bucks in the
US both versions can connect to your TV
and stream movies and television shows
from apps like Netflix Hulu HBO and of
course Apple's iTunes Store so how is
the new Apple TV different it starts
with an all-new remote the new clicker
has a touchpad on the top much like the
one on your laptop computer with it I
was able to swipe around browse titles
and blow through long lists of apps with
ease it's very responsive and feels a
little bit like using a big phone from
across the room the combination of the
slick remote and Apple TV's blazing fast
menus along with awesome Search and
rewind make streaming video feel more
responsive and polished than ever other
devices from Roku Amazon and Google
allow voice search and Apple TVs Siri
does too
I could easily find TV shows and movies
by titles and look up actors and more
just like those others but Siri is a few
other neat tricks I could ask for good
movies or just search within Netflix or
even ask for sports scores if you miss a
piece of dialogue you can ask what did
he say an Apple TV will rewind 15
seconds and show the captions what did
you say you can also launch apps or even
get siri to tell you a joke Siri tell me
a joke although unlike on iPhones and
unlike Alexa on fire TV serie on Apple
TV doesn't speak loud but the biggest
difference between the new Apple TV and
other devices is the potential power of
the app store including games and other
apps all of the initial games use the
remote for control and while it can be
awkward at times it's fun to see
favorites like Crossy road and asphalt
on the big screen
if you bought games for your iPad or
iPhone you can play many of them on
Apple TV for free an Apple TV also
promises a fresh big-screen look for
apps that aren't related to TV or gaming
you can check out real estate via Zillow
look for places to stay at Airbnb
or even exercise with app called sova
that works with Apple watch to track
your heart rate with Apple's clout and
motivated developers I expect thousands
of apps to hit the big screen soon
whether you'll actually want to use them
on your TV as opposed to your phone or
tablet remains to be seen
