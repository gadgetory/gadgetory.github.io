inside scoop my guest today is senior
editor seth rosenblatt toy car hi Seth a
lot of news recently about affairs and
other improprieties coming over email
yes you should all thank former general
petraeus for that exactly all right so
let's say that one of our viewers wants
to have a fair send some covert
information sure give us some tips on
how to keep your business a little more
private okay let's start with the basics
so there are things you can do that
don't involve very technical solutions
you can go to a cafe that has free Wi-Fi
that's not near your home office or the
hotel you're staying at that doesn't
actually mask your IP address or
anything technical but it separates you
from the places that you usually go to
harder to trace that back to use
absolutely another very easy solution is
to set up an email account that does not
have your name attached to it that does
not have any personal identifying
information in it and does not contain
anything in the subject headings of the
emails you send from that account just
don't make it so obvious than exactly be
smart yeah okay so what about some more
complex or techy solutions that are
harder to try sure one thing you can do
is a program called hotspot shield which
will mask your IP and change it to a
different IP address so that the the
Internet address that you're sending the
email from is not the actual one that
you're using it routes it through a
different one you can also get a VPN and
make sure that again that you're using
one that is known for having good
privacy protections and that all can't
ultimately be traced back to you only if
the government subpoenas the information
from that company and again there's
another service called tour which has
been around for a very long time which
will create layers and hide your
activity the problem with what happened
to Petraeus is that the emails the
government has access to without a
subpoena for up to 180 days so you'd
think that the director of the CIA would
be smarter than that please be wrong
right the bottom line I guess is you
know keep your nose clean don't get into
this kind of messy
exactly digitally or electronically
absolutely at the end of the day if you
really want to send a secure message
carrier pigeon I think is the way to go
yeah probably the safest I mean maybe
even old fashioned post card or letter
could even be better than sending an
email absolutely I think at the end of
the day an email is less like a secure
letter with a with a seal and a stamp
and all of that and it's more like a
postcard if you have the technical
know-how you can just flip it over and
read it yeah sadly I don't think this is
going to the last time we talked about a
probably not business being exposed to
email probably not thank you so much so
flat I'm Kara Tsuboi thanks for watching
