getting into wearables leapfrogged with
the LeapFrog LeapPad that I've got on my
wrist this is meant for kids aged four
to seven and is an activity tracker plus
a virtual pet that sits on your wrist
it's going to cost $40 when it comes out
in August and it syncs with an app that
works on iOS Android or the LeapPad
ultra tablet but it connects through a
PC if you want to be a parent control
the settings make sure they don't play
with the extra features too long because
what it does is play mini games you can
control one of the virtual pets so you
can do control unicorn you can control
robot little dragon you put them through
a salon you train them you do fun
virtual pet things but you also do
activities and this has an accelerometer
and it tracks your activity throughout
the course of the day and it fuels the
ability to unlock new characters plus
there are little mini ten-second
challenges that you can trigger with a
button right up here it tells you what
to do there are 50 different challenges
most are active a few were meant to cool
down there are things like walk through
mud or pretend your popcorn jump like a
tiger and make a loud roar here we go
right toes okay
I'm winded like the unicorn and I earned
a jewel the final models band is gonna
be a little bit different more like a
watch band this has a little bit more
like a slap bracelet design the design
is water resistant and has a mini USB
attachment for connecting to your
computer
no Bluetooth on this and the screen here
is color there is a speaker but there's
no touch screen you interact with the
buttons well see how this does but it's
one of the first game of fight activity
trackers that I've seen
leapfrog leaf and and I'm out of breath</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
