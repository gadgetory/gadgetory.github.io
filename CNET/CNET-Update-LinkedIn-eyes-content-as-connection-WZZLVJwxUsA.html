your cnet update the professional
network linkedin has had a fantastic
year of growth it continues to do better
than analysts expect and the company CEO
has hinted that he sees LinkedIn's
future as a professional publishing
platform it's becoming more of a place
to exchange ideas with other peers and
companies rather than a site where you
just upload your resume and leave you're
seeing this in some products like
LinkedIn today it's the emails and home
page that show top features and news
tailored to you and the influence or
blog posts from business celebrities
like Richard Branson and you'll be
seeing more of a new type of AD called
sponsored content where companies can
pay to promote white papers and best
practice documents to a brand's
followers it's like a professional
version of Facebook sponsored stories

in public records and news about your
neighborhood has been shut down it

by msnbc.com which was renamed to NBC
News and NBC just said it wasn't
profitable and pulled the plug on every
block which had pages for 19 cities
every blocks creators were pioneers in
the push for open data and hyper local
news and it was a place you could find
data like local crimes building permits
restaurant inspections it also provided
a forum for locals to talk to each other

search for tweets that are older than a

favorited retweeted and simply just got
lots of clicks and breaking news in the
over reported world of the vine app
since this looping video 2 was released
it was marketed as a way to make a
six-second video but actually it's a six
and a half second video you just can't
trust any company these days to tell you
the truth we've seen movies based on
board games toys and amusement rides but
get ready for a TV show based on a
social media game the wall street
journal reports that farmville is being
made into a half-hour television series
and if you're keeping track at home
Angry Birds is also being made into a
cartoon series spotify sap is

Spotify songs and create playlists but
