welcome to tomorrow daily if the best
ski talk show in the known universe I'm
Ashley together
i'm jeff kannada hold onto your socks
it's time for headlines some of earth's
biggest minds want to send a spacecraft
at a fraction of the speed of light to
their nearest star system they're
calling it star shot famous cosmologist
Stephen Hawking an investor Yuri Milner
unveiled a plan to send tiny nano craft
into outer space
those nano crafts would use light sails
and a ground-based light Beamer to
propel themselves up to a hundred
million miles an hour or 20% of the
speed of light that would make the four
year light trip to Alpha Centauri take
about 20 years which is a much quicker
trip than traditional spacecraft which
would take about thirty thousand years
Hawking stressed the need to look to the
stars because earth quote might not last
forever
unquote that's pretty cool but how long
will it take to get information from
those spacecraft back to us about thirty
thousand years that's too long that's
too long for the info what idea well
have to do some research on that
hey street art may be changing forever
with an introduction of a smart spray
can this motion sensing spray can was
developed by a team at Dartmouth
University this invention
allows for large-scale replication of
images without any skill on the part of
the artist two webcams and a cube with
QR markers keep track of the cans motion
and position relative to the wall and an
algorithm controls how much paint is
released and where as the painter moves
the can along the wall the team
responsible for the cans has it's kind
of a modern spray paint by numbers
it's spray paint by numbers you don't
need any artistic skill to be able to
make a giant street art mural that's
amazing I guess that's really cool I
guess that's cool I feel like I like the
idea of wanting to be a really good
artist and maybe this but really are you
the good artist or is it the spray paint
can I don't know I mean if it's is it
now is it just a fax machine or like a
copy machine kind of yeah just a live
cop
you are the machine you're the copy
machine stuff do you think we should
talk about um I'm kind of intrigued by
both of them these are pretty good
stories today I think it's gotta be star
shot I feel like we got to talk about
getting into the next star system over
at 20 percent speed light that's pretty
amazing it's pretty mean to think that
we could actually explore that far into
our into our galaxy is pretty wild I
mean let's talk about it on Thursday yes
you can be a part of that conversation
by using our hashtag hey yeah and if we
like your tweets we'll put them in
Thursday's show but you got to tweak
fast because we're we have some
scheduling stuff so right now uh that
being said let's check out our photo of
the day tonight's photographer of the
day is awesome arc who took this picture
with his iPhone 6s plus yeah awesome art
writes and says hello Ashley and Jeff my
name is Omar and you have my permission
to use this picture of my wife and I we
are at the cloud gate sculpture in
Chicago aka the Chicago Beam a friend of
ours took this photo on my iPhone 6s
plus and boy were we surprised at how
well it came out especially since the
weather kept switching from snowing to
sunny I hope you show it for your April
monuments and points of interest themed
love the show watch it all the time your
fan from Purdue University awesome our
Lopez and then he says my firt he tells
us how to pronounce his first name but I
thought this was cool his name is a
combination of his mom and dad's names
Oscar and Martha and also because his
name's Martha his mom's name is Martha
he also has something in common with
Batman and Superman yeah pretty great
hey I have a my own version of that
exact picture I've stood in that exact
spot and taken that exact picture along
with thousands of others I love that so
much yeah
if you guys want to send in your
landmarks monuments and points of
interest pictures this month email them
to tomorrow at cnn.com
yeah make sure you tell us which device
you use to take the picture give us a
pronunciation of your name I really very
much appreciate that you give us
permission to use it on the show and we
always love a little story about why you
took that picture
we're also everywhere on social media
and if you want to share the show with a
friend to give the gift of tomorrow
