full-frame sensor and very good image
processing it's no surprise that the
sony cybershot DSC RX one delivers
fabulous photos of course for its $2,600
plus price tag I'd expect no less
thanks to its sturdy magnesium alloy
body and its really nice functional
shooting design shooting with the Rx one
is a fine experience as well it has
pretty much the same interface as Sony's
DSLR style cameras with a few exceptions
like an exposure compensation dial and
manual aperture ring that are common for
this type of fixed lens enthusiasts
compact the aperture ring feels really
nice with useful feedback a few design
quirks bother me including the heart to
use record button and the awkward focus
mode switch plus the flash doesn't tilt
and I wish it had a bigger grip plus
there's no manual focus peaking when
shooting in movie mode which is really
annoying the camera doesn't have any
notable features like GPS or wireless
connectivity but it has a full set of
manual controls for both still and video
and most of the cost of the camera
probably goes towards the spectacular
Zeiss 35 millimeter f/2 lens I do think
it needs some sort of built-in
viewfinder you can buy an optional one
like it's great EVF or the Zeiss optical
viewfinder but they're both quite
expensive beyond the high cost of the
camera it's not the fastest camera
especially if you use autofocus but it's
not irritatingly slow either the
trade-off for the lens seems to be some
sluggish driving for it if your primary
criterion for buying a camera is image
quality this wins for best compact
photos look sharp colors can be accurate
if you adjust the settings it renders a
broad tonal range and the image
processing for mid-range iso
sensitivities is excellent
you can shoot JPEGs as high as ISO 1600
and if you shoot RAW you can probably
eat out a stop more video looks very
good as well even in low-light there are
a few more edged artifacts than I'd like
though you can still get extremely good
cameras like the Rx one that cost at
least $1,000 less because
they're equipped with an aps-c size
sensor the photo quality isn't quite as
good but for a lot of folks it's good
enough the sony cybershot DSC RX one
really isn't for everyone just a lucky
few</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
