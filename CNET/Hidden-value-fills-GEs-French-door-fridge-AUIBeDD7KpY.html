I'm taking a look at the GE g NS 2 3G
mhes this is a twenty two point seven
cubic foot french door refrigerator for
a budget-friendly $1,600 now if you just
did a spit-take when I said a
budget-friendly fridge cost sixteen
hundred dollars bear in mind that French
door models tend to run at the higher
end of the spectrum there's definitely a
difference between this guy and the
$3,000 $4,000 premium French door
fridges you might find there's no spill
proofing on these shelves which as a
messy person I really want to dump
things on other things and then not have
to worry about cleaning it up no folding
shelves are making the organization
easier it does have a turbo cool mode
and an energy saver as well as an easy
to use control panel so it's not like
it's bare-bones it's just less than the
premium competition the most interesting
part of the fridge is that it actually
does have a water dispenser just maybe
not where you'd expect it would be it's
actually on the inside of the fridge you
have to open both doors in order to get
your hands in there if you try just with
one door I felt like I was the before
shot of an infomercial I was really
struggling to squeeze my arms in there
and turn it on cool in theory not so
great in practice I also had an issue
with the last GE fridge I reviewed the
GE artistry without cheap the freezer
felt this one's a little bit better
it's a drawer which I prefer over the
hinged door but it still has that wire
basket which is gonna make it easy for
your food to fall through and just isn't
as good as a solid drawer down there
what you don't lose for this thing is
performance at the default setting of 37
degrees the entire main compartment kept
within a degree of the set point the
doors ran a little bit warm so it wasn't
perfect but then we turn the temp down
to 34 degrees and once again it did
really well with accuracy
it's 22.7 cubic feet of space is
probably gonna be more than enough for
most families it fit most of our
standard groceries that even fit a few
of our big stress test items
so the GE g NS 23 GM h es might not be
as feature-rich as its premium
competitors but really if you want an
entry point into French door fridges
this thing performs well and makes a
really solid competitor for more be sure
