its first consumer electronics product
meet Dolby dimension a headphone that's
been designed first and foremost for the
home entertainment experience with an
emphasis on home yes the $600 headphone
can be worn around the streets on-the-go
but the idea behind it is to be able to
get immersive sound from your TV and
mobile devices in your home without
bothering anybody around you well it's a
little heavy at three hundred and thirty
grams it's comfortable to wear and looks
and feels swanky with a synthetic
leather finish and sturdy aluminum frame
it rinds be a little of parrot zeke
headphones it comes with a charging
stand that has a magnetic connection and
there's a USB port for charging the
headphone on-the-go but it's micro USB
not USB see I also thought for the price
it should have come with a more
protective case than the simple cloth
case that's included you're probably
wondering whether this is a surround
sound headphone and the answer is sort
of but not really
equipped with a Qualcomm Snapdragon
quad-core processor the headphone has a
digital processing feature called
virtualization that Dolby says
dramatically enhances the sound of all
your movies shows and music and when you
play content created in Dolby Atmos you
automatically get the best sound for it
over a Bluetooth connection while you
shouldn't expect true surround sound I
did think it created more of a theater
sound than your typical premium
bluetooth headphone does with everything
sounding a little more amped up and open
the mix was balanced and dialogue was
clear and well-defined meanwhile the
head tracking feature makes the sounds
seem like it's always coming from your
screen even when you turn your head it's
supposed to create a more consistently
realistic experience I thought it was a
little weird at first but then I got
used to it this is a noise cancelling
headphone and the noise canceling is
quite effective at the same time there's
also a transparency mode Dobby calls it
life mix that allows you to hear
everything around you and talk to people
while you're listening through the
headphones the microphones are
incredibly sensitive and with the
transparency set to the highest level
you can literally hear sounds that you
normally wouldn't pick up such as your
hand rubbing lightly against your
clothing
on the right ear cup there are touch
controls for volume pausing and playing
tracks and skipping tracks forward and
back
tap the ear cup twice and it toggles
between transparency mode and noise
canceling mode aside from the power
button the only other buttons on the
headphone are three source buttons
designated by three dashes you pair the
headphone to say your TV or an Apple TV
connected to your TV a tablet and a
smartphone and then you use the buttons
to quickly toggle between the devices as
you switch from one device to another
but the life mix and virtualization
turned on you can get up to ten hours of
battery life and up to fifteen hours in
a power conservation mode these wouldn't
be good numbers if this was a mobile
headphone but the ideas that you'd watch
for a few hours at most then put the
headphones back in their charging dock
you can get two hours of battery life
from a 15 minute charge and fully charge
the headphones in two hours at its price
point this is obviously not a headphone
for the masses but it's a fun headphone
to use for movie and music listening and
will appeal the folks who want more of a
home theater experience at least when it
comes to sound without disturbing others
around you or contrary tuning them out
