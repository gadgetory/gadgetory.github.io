know that it is a really horrible
experience that leaves you feeling
groggy and just awful so I'm Australian
I live in the US and that means that I
go back and forth between the two
countries
early life I've tried pretty much
everything to get over jetlag and the
conventional wisdom says that you should
do things like avoid nothing stay
hydrated and also expose yourself to
light so you can adjust your body clock
more quickly and there are a bunch of
different light therapy solutions on the
market right now including crazy
headsets like this one from air feel
like I'm something out of Star Trek like
Geordi LaForge or something but there is
a new solution from a company called
Loomis tech and it's actually integrated
into a sleep mask so it's totally
unobtrusive and it works while you sleep
so it's based on research from Stanford
and I'm here now at Stanford va sleep
labs to talk to the founder and CEO of
Loomis tech find out about the
technology and then I'm gonna road test
it on my next long-haul flights
tell me all about this I notice it
doesn't look like your average sleep
mask yeah so for us having the sleep
mask be comfortable was paramount
but the real technology is in the
hardware so we use this Hardware module
to emit short light pulses during the
night that tells your body the Sun is up
when it's not and in that way we can
actually hack your biological system so
how much can you hack that biological
system like how many times earnings can
I effectively compensate for in one
session on average we can adjust people
three to four hours in a single night
well if you're traveling from San
Francisco to New York you can arrive
with no jet lag
no way no jet lag at all oh my gosh so
how much will this compensate for for
like my 14-hour flight yes so if you are
heading to Sydney from San Francisco we
would expect you to use the mask one
night before your flight to prepare your
body for the upcoming adjustment and
then one night at your destination and
be ready to go after that okay and so
when I wear the night before my flight
obviously that light pattern is gonna
stop playing when I'm asleep now am I
gonna wake up the next day and feel kind
of like I've been reset to Australia
time you might solely have definitely
had users who feel that they are more on
Australia time like they'll be hungry or
at a different time you'll certainly
feel tired at a different time and so
that's what we would expect partial
adjustment the first night and then
completing that once you arrive it's the
night before my flight between San
Francisco and Sydney my bags are packed
and I've put in my flight details in the
app so all that's left to do is get into
bed and let the mask do its work good
night
good morning I just got into work after
my first night using the light therapy
mask and I have to say I feel
surprisingly refreshed which never
happens very unlike me so this was a
nice change when I was going to sleep I
noticed there were a couple of flashes
going off a little weird at first but I
got used to it and the most important
thing is they did not wake me up when I
was falling asleep and when I was asleep
which was great so now all I have to do
is finish up here at work and head to
the airport
as in front of me we've this seat back
like immediately off to takeoff
and I'm in the middle seat so about
three hours into the flight somewhere
over the Pacific between San Francisco
and Sydney yes I am in the toilet I am
so sorry I do not normally selfie blog
whatever from the toilet anyway I am
gonna start using the sleep loss tonight
however it is not going to be online
therapy worried it's actually just gonna
be used as animal black mask and I was
told that that I actually don't need to
do the light therapy on the plane itself
just walk out the lights I get some
sleep
as always it could be super distracting
on the plane
so we landed about 6 a.m. this morning I
got a couple hours of sleep on the plane
maybe five or six and didn't feel too
bad at all when I woke up and I actually
got home and I went for a run which is
unheard of guys absolutely unheard of
like made going for a run the day after
a long-haul flight doesn't happen so I
have one more night left of light
therapy that is tonight but I feel
pretty good right now like very little
evidence of jet lag so I'm super excited
after two nights of light therapy I feel
fully adjusted to Sydney time but what
if it's just a placebo effect to make
sure I'm using it again on the return
journey
two weeks later I am super tired right
now you know not wear the mask again on
the plane I'm just going to sleep
normally and then use it one more time
when I get back to SF and cross my
fingers and prove that jet lag is a
thing of the past but right now
hi it I mean I feel like as soon as I
get on that plane I'm gonna fall asleep
just kidding I don't actually feel all
that bad so I'm back in San Francisco
this is the second day after I landed
and the question that you want answered
is how do I feel like did it actually
cure my jetlag well I definitely feel
like I'm recovering a lot faster having
used light therapy than if I didn't and
that's kind of the whole point so here's
what I really liked about using the
sleep mask I loved that you could just
basically enter all your travel dates in
the app and then set and forget like you
didn't have to know anything at all
about light therapy plus if you don't
feel like you've adjusted fast enough
you have the option to add another night
of my therapy inside the app - what I
didn't like is I was concerned that when
I was asleep like I had no way of
knowing if the light therapy actually
worked apart from the app saying yes you
know your light therapy is complete so
Lumos tech is going to be coming out
around the end of 2018 fingers crossed
because I really do not want to do long
haul travel without this ever again like
it's maybe experience so much more
bearable and so much more pleasant so
that's my jetlag test I hope you enjoyed
it if you like this video please give it
a thumbs up leave me a comment and let
me know what you want me to try out an
experience next find me on Twitter find
me in the comments thanks for watching
I love my now Aaron my hair</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
