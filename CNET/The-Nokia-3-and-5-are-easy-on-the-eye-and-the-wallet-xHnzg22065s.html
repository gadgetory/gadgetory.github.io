into the world of Android they're not
all-singing all-dancing super phones but
they do both have trump cards very low
prices the three is the entry-level
model it's got a 5-inch display and a
quad-core chip which is just about
powerful enough for tackling your
everyday whatsapp and Twitter needs it's
pretty sluggish when swiping around and
it's camera isn't up to anything more
than the odds snap of your dog in the
park
however it's attractive slim design and
price of only a hundred and twenty
pounds in the UK means it's worth a look
if you only need the basics from your
phone the five is the larger of the two
with a 5.2 inch display it's got a more
powerful octa-core processor which makes
navigation much smoother than his little
brother and his camera can capture much
better shots with stronger colors and
more even exposures the all-metal design
makes it feel like a more premium device
as well as does the fingerprint scanner
that you'll find on the front at 180
pounds of Auk the Nokia 5 is quite a bit
more than its smaller sibling but it's
all round smoother operation and better
camera means that's money well spent if
you want to indulge more in gaming and
photo editing on the move</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
