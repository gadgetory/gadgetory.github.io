through his website Infowars he has
become a hotbed of conspiracy theories
including that 9/11 was an inside job
which isn't true or that the Sandy Hook
murders the children were a hoax also
not true and all sorts of other things
these websites pulled the plug for info
wars on their social networks because he
had broken their policies there's a lot
of concern over the last couple months
that he whipped his followers into a
fear where they would harass or even do
worse to a lot of these families who
were impacted by all this there was a
story in The New York Times about how
the parents of one of the kids from
Sandy Hook couldn't go visit their
child's graves because of how much
harassment they get so there's been a
lot of concern that this stuff needs to
be handled people who follow Alex Jones
and Infowars say that this is a free
speech issue whether or not how they
impact people is not the point
the point is that these are the largest
social networks in the world their
populations are larger than any country
on earth and thus Infowars and out zones
should be allowed to say what they say
the people who are against them say no
harassment is not okay these platforms
have rules against this kind of behavior
and they need to be enforced
there is a lot of bad stuff that happens
on the internet every day and these
social networks Facebook YouTube all
these people continuously have to close
accounts and remove content all the time
what's interesting about Alex Jones and
Infowars is that they are very public we
know who alex jones is and he continues
to do what he does
despite warnings from the companies it's
gonna be very interesting to see how
Alex Jones and Infowars respond so far
it doesn't appear as though that they
have changed the way that they do their
their work in the way that they publish
but are really interesting to see that
it also be interesting to see how the
conservative movement changes and
responds to all of this the last time we
saw some serious movement against
conservative voices you've seen people
on Capitol Hill very angry hearings
about it you've heard the president in
states weigh in so this is likely to
become a much larger issue</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
