kitchen gadgets the question they always
ask is when they'll see an appliance
that cooks the food for you well we're a
little bit closer with the jeune
intelligent oven
this countertop convection oven is
equipped with the camera that will
recognize your food and then cook it
according to what it sees so let me show
you exactly how the jeune oven works
first you take one of the dozen or so
foods that the jeune can recognize and
put it on a tray like this bacon they
put it inside the oven and a built-in
camera in the roof of the oven will
detect what you put inside now one of
the downsides of the jeune is it doesn't
necessarily narrow in on just one item
it thinks that he put in rather it gives
you two options it thinks it's either
bacon or asparagus you pick the right
option and press start roasting and
it'll start roasting the bacon as you
can see it gives you the temperature
that it's roasting the bacon and a
countdown clock of when it will be ready
now the whole time the camera that's in
the roof of the oven is capturing the
bacon as it cooks and you can watch this
on an app so on the June ovens app you
can see a live video stream of your
bacon cooking and you can access that
stream later in a time lapse video you
can also check out the dashboard which
will show you which oven components are
in use while your food is cooking and
there's a progress timer so you can see
just how long you have left before your
food is ready right now
Jun can recognize more than a dozen
foods and the company behind the Jimmy
says that this number will keep growing
as it develops the software but right
now it's still not perfect
for example the Jun relies a lot on a
temperature probe to gauge the internal
temperature of food so it knows when to
stop cooking well just because an
internal temperature is good doesn't
mean it necessarily has to char that I
really like what foods and you can't
play around with settings like that at
least not yet
now there are a lot of features of the
Jun intelligent oven that I think
get to talk about in this video so for
more details including more info about
the built in scale and it's roasting
capabilities check out my full review
right now I would hold off on buying the
Jews unless you have a spare fifteen
hundred bucks and a desire not to really
do much in terms of cooking
I think the software will probably keep
evolving in the coming months but I
would just wait a second until we can
see what the June is really capable of</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
