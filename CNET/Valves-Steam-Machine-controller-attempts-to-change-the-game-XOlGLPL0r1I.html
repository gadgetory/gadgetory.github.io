again everyone America Franklin at GDC
2014 and today I'm taking a first look
at the new valve steam controller for
steam machines this is the latest
version of Steve control it still is
shoes analog controls or this kind of
distant platform it it's a lot of
getting used to but the real whole thing
the new thing is that it actually has
your face buggies now the previous vs
didn't as a B X Y have played about this
a little bit and the control is really
really sensitive and it takes a lot of
getting used to for me at least I felt
like a lot of times I would be
controlling my character and not
necessarily feeling like I'm actually
touching the disk so it's kind of weird
also the buttons are really really small
and a lot of times my felt like I was
pressing the a button l's actually made
me but just kind of weird as well the
shoulder buttons are a little bit shower
for me the trigger buttons really
shallow there's no real resistance it
just kind of clicks at certain point
which is really satisfying but I usually
like a lot of resistance of my trigger
my trigger button
my biggest takeaway is that it feels
comfortable to hold in my hand but the
disc based control methods going to take
a lot of getting used to I still prefer
analog controls but I've only spent like
five minutes in this thing also this is
still a prototype about the stove
working on it steam machines won't
probably be released until this later
this year the earliest service or a lot
of time to kind of affect it you know
knowing about and then I keep argon into
the hidden right once again eric
franklin here at GDC 2014 taking a first
look at the new valve controller or
christine machine
