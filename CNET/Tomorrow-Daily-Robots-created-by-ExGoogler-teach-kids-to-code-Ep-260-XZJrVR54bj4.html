welcome to tomorrow daily as a pesky
talk-show in their own universe I know
talk shows usually have more than one
person in them these are our many
episodes until our new sets finished so
with that being said let's hit the
headlines there's a very interesting new
drone in Japan that might turn heads if
it ever takes flight over Tokyo Rho M
semiconductor and its subsidiary lapis
semiconductor unveiled the or Izuru a
drone made to look like a huge paper
crane just like you made when you were
really into origami when you're 12 years
old
the or Izuru has a remote control and it
replicates the motion of an actual bird
in flight as it sails through the air
it's got a 3d printed skeleton made of
nylon filament and it runs on the
lazurite fly microcomputer designing the
or zuru took about three months and our
hom hopes to use it as a lure to work
with venture companies and startups
sadly you won't be able to buy the or
Izuru at your local hobby shop since our
hom doesn't plan on taking this design
retail so for now I guess you'll have to
just hope that they release the design
open-source and then you can build it
yourself alright moving from drones over
to personal transports the company
ninebot based in China bought Segway
earlier this year and now they are
unveiling the very first of their
products since the acquisition this is
the ninebot mini a much more compact
version of a Segway intended for more
discreet personal transport it's kind of
reminiscent of any one of the electric
transport options we've been seeing pop
up lately but it's got a major advantage
over its competitors price most current
options easily cross the one thousand
dollar mark to buy but the ninebot minis
price clocks in at the equivalent of 315
US dollars if you want to get your hands
on a ninebot mini as soon as they drop
well you're gonna have to go to China
next month since that's the only place
it'll be available for now but there are
plans for a European release soon enough
and if all goes well there I'm sure a
United States release cannot be far
behind
fingers crossed okay so now moving from
really cool personal transports to
robots our favorite topic on tomorrow
daily let's check out these cute little
robots that are teaching kids to code X
Google employee vikas gut
has a daughter and he got to thinking
about how he could teach her to code so
he founded a company called Wonder
workshop and it has one singular goal
making coding fun and easy he's using
robots to help achieve that end now dash
and dot are friendly looking robots that
kids can program with the use of a
companion touchscreen app so kids will
drag-and-drop code modules to choose how
the robots move and play and the app
sort of guides the user through the
programming process
now there's dot which is the single orb
and dot costs fifty dollars and has a
little bit of a simpler range of
abilities and can't move while - on the
other hand costs a hundred and fifty
dollars but has wheels for movement
programming since most kids here in the
US don't start learning coding until
high school and even then it's an
elective and not required Wonder
workshop seems like it offers a really
great way for kids to get into coding as
early as six years old which is pretty
cool so nice work Wonder workshop okay
guys that's it for our headlines it's
Monday let's talk about crowd funding
our we talked about robotic arms a lot
here on tomorrow daily and now maker arm
is going to let you buy a robotic arm of
your very own maker arm is a three axis
robotic arm that can perform a variety
of tasks including fabricating
assembling both resin and filament 3d
printing milling soldering and even
painting think of it as a really really
futuristic Swiss Army knife I mean it
even decorates cakes for crying out loud
look at this thing
they're also plans for third-party app
support and custom scripts in the future
and a browser-based control system lets
you pull up your controls for your maker
arm on just about any device as long as
the browser supported so smartphones
tablets PCs you name it as long as you
got a browser that supports it you're
good to go
obviously you want one right yes well so
do i but you're gonna have to shell out
fourteen hundred dollars for one on
kickstarter and it includes one tool
head of your choice now they want
$350,000 they've got just under two
hundred thousand dollars and there are
22 days left in the campaign so we've
got 22 days to find a whole lot of
change in our couches start looking
alright guys let's talk about our phone
