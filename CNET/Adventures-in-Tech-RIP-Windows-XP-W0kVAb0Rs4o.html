version of Windows so popular it became
a double-edged sword for Microsoft the
support for XP finally ends adventures
in tech stakes a fond look back at the
last of the great operating systems
developed under the codename whistler XP
was the result of Microsoft merging home
and business software projects into one
platform it was built on the foundations
of Windows NT instead of old-fashioned
DOS and hits shop shelves on the 25th of
October 2001 two days after the first
iPod went on sale
these were heady days for Microsoft it
had an iron grip on the PC market the
first Xbox was about to be released and
nobody knew yet that the iPod would
hurtle its biggest rival back to the
forefront of the tech scene happy days
indeed and for the millions of us still
using Windows 95 98 or ME Windows XP was
a proper step forward Microsoft took an
electric sander to Windows filing off
every sharp corner and pouring paint all
over every menu an icon the Start menu
was stretched to 2 columns it became
easier to burn CDs and you could switch
users without quitting all your programs
newcomers benefited from a soothing tour
feature that walked you through the
interface it was more secure than
Windows 98 though could be prone to the
odd virus and certainly wasn't above
occasionally crashing causing you to
lose all your pride
sorry about that there was one more XP
feature we all loved well not so much of
a feature more of a JPEG the iconic
bliss wallpaper is a photo taken by one
Charles O'Rear and is a photo of a hill
in California's wine country in 1996
array was on his way to see his
girlfriend when he took the roadside
snap which was bought by Microsoft for
an undisclosed sum you can visit the
beautiful Bliss Hill yourself using
Google Street View as long as you don't
mind shattering disappointment XP was
well received Sina gave it four stars
praising the new design which works just
as well for novices as it did for
hardcore users Microsoft boasted that in
its first three days windows xp sold
300,000 copies two months later it was
17 million XP was the OS of choice as
computer sales steadily grew with PCs
getting cheaper and more widely
available by 2006 it was estimated that
400 million customers were using XP
which was great news for Microsoft sort
of by the time Vista arrived in January
2007 Windows XP had been in the
spotlight for more than five years
customers and businesses became
entrenched unwilling to move to a
platform that needed more powerful
hardware and featured security pop-ups
so annoying that they could hobble even
the most futuristic operating system
today Windows XP is still reckoned to be
running on a third of the world's pcs an
enduring popularity that forced
Microsoft to extend support the
company's new problem is recreating that
success Windows XP harked back to a time
when our operating system defined your
computing experience today so many of
the services we love are available on
phones TVs or even in our cars making
the OS we choose steadily less important
and sapping the motivation to upgrade or
change an operating system of XP
significance may never be seen again
how will Microsoft react only time will
tell but even as we stride forward we
can fondly wave back at Windows XP</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
