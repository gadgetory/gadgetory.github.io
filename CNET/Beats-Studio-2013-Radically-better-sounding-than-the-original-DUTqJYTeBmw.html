relationship with monster we've been
waiting for the company to come out with
a new version of its signature
headphones the Beats Studio which were
released in 2008 and became a cultural
phenomenon well this is it the
reimagined studio and I have to say it's
definitely a better headphone all around
for starters the studios are 13% lighter
they're more comfortable and more
durable with no visible screws on the
headband those tiny screws tended to get
unscrewed and they were very easy to
lose these are active noise-cancelling
headphones and they now come equipped
with two modes of adaptive noise
cancellation according to beats one mode
is for music listening and offers
balanced adaptive noise canceling
between your music and your environment
and the other mode is for when you're
disconnected and just want to shut out
the world for better or worse you do
have to have the noise cancellation
turned on to use these headphones the
integrated lithium rechargeable battery
is rated at 20 hours it charges via USB
and has a five light LED battery fuel
gauge that indicates how much charge it
has left there's also an auto on/off
feature for automatic shutdown once you
unplug the headphones which is nice the
headphones come with a standard straight
cord as well as one that integrates an
Apple friendly remote and microphone so
you can make cell phone calls in terms
of sound the studio is what I call fast
and fun a forward sounding headphone
that's exciting to listen to it's not as
accurate or natural sounding a headphone
is something like the $350 Sennheiser
momentum but it delivers on the bass
front and comes on strong with the
detail in all it's a radically better
sounding headphone than the original you
do get a faint hiss from the noise
canceling and the noise canceling isn't
quite on par with the Bose QuietComfort
15 s but you also don't feel the
pressure on your ears that you often
feel when using noise cancellation
headphones that's a good thing so there
it is the new reimagined studio
available in the white you see here as
well as red and black it's hard to say
whether it's worth three hundred dollars
but it's certainly worth more than the
original Beats Studio which also caused
three hundred I'm David Carr noise
