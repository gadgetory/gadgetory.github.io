been using it pretty much every day
since it launched in March so that's
about three months and this is my three
month for view or three now one of the
top things I love about this phone is
still the design it's just beautiful
when you hold it in your hand it's got a
really large screen but I just love that
elegant curves on the side and I
absolutely love love love this purple
color on the back yes it does attract
finger prints and it gets all smeary and
that's gross but I can mostly ignore it
I get complimented on it all the time I
noticed that people will stop and look
at it even if they don't mention
anything to me I was at a cafe and I had
it face down on the table and I noticed
out of the corner of my eye another
patron at the cafe who was kind of
trying to like slyly hold up their phone
you know in a way where you're
pretending that you're looking at what's
on the screen but you're really taking a
picture they weren't taking picture of
me they were taking a picture of the
phone so it's definitely an eye-catcher
unfortunately it will break because it's
glass and I don't trust myself to hold
on to it I know that if it's in my hand
sooner or later it's gonna fall and
crack so I scoured the internet and this
is the best case that I can find
it's a speaking case it's purple and I
thought that would kind of like honor
the purple color I've tried using clear
cases but they kind of dull the effect
you know when you hold it in light at
different angles you really get this
great depth of color and I don't have it
with this case so that's unfortunate but
it was the best I can do split-screen is
one of those features that a lot of
Samsung phones have and I always liked
it and I would always use it for testing
but I never naturally used it until I
started using this phone every single
day and now there are so many times
during the week where I will open up
split screen and say I have the calendar
or a map or an email open in one screen
and I might have you know any one of
those other apps open in the other
screen it's really great if I'm trying
to
you know look at a schedule or a
timetable and find out what time and
trains getting in or something like that
and then send the information along in a
message without going back and forth
between multiple screens so that is
definitely a feature that I didn't know
I was going to use and like as much as I
do
I also really like using the edge
display this is sort of a bar on the
side of your phone you can put the tab
anywhere you want and you can fill it
with shortcuts for apps for people it's
very easy to get out of control and add
way too much information which just
winds up taking time because the point
is that from any screen that you're on
on this phone you can open this up and
get to a person or an app that you use
there are about a million different ways
that you can customize the Samsung phone
and while it can be incredibly
overwhelming when you're picking through
every settings submenu it's actually
something that I really appreciate I
know it's there and I spent a lot of
time actually at choosing the custom
color of the clock widget on my
always-on display and on my lockscreen
and that's something that really is just
for me but when the phone is laying on
the table I look over and I know that
it's mine it's just like a little
identifying characteristic like yeah
that's my phone I made it that color the
last thing that I absolutely have to
mention it has to do with unlocking so
this phone will let you unlock with your
iris or with your fingerprint and one
thing that I love about this that the
iPhone 10 just doesn't have is that if
for some reason you're trying to unlock
using your face your iris in this case
and the read doesn't go through the
first time the phone will offer you an
option to press a little button and redo
it and the iPhone 10 just doesn't give
you that option I also like that there's
this combination of iris scanning with
fingerprint unlock because between the
two of them I'm gonna get the phone
unlocked pretty quickly with the least
amount of frustration possible even
though I love how this phone looks I do
have one little complaint with the way
that the phone curves sometimes when I'm
in a note or an email or writing a text
message and I want to put my cursor at
the beginning of the sentence for some
reason the touch just doesn't register
it's like my finger just falls off the
side of the water
fall alright can we talk about the bixby
button for a second it's here on the
side and I never use it on purpose but I
launched it all the time because I carry
my phone either in my back pocket or in
my purse and when I'm reaching into my
purse and I'm grabbing the phone by the
top that is the perfect place for me to
accidentally open up Bixby it's just it
just hits the bottom of my thumb right
there so I wind up giving it a squeeze
and instead of seeing my home screen or
the lock screen which is what I expect I
always see this and I don't know how
it's possible that I'm still at level 2
for all the times that I open VIX me
it's got to happen minimum once a day
the camera on this is really good it's
got this dual aperture lens the galaxy s
9 has that too and then it's got the
portrait lens and although I really love
that this phone gives me the option to
take portrait photos I find that I don't
really use it a lot and then when I do
use it I don't know it just sort of
blows up the subject more than I want it
to so you know I look through the
viewfinder and I see this nice scene and
I just want to blur the edges exactly as
it is and I put on portrait mode and all
of a sudden like their face is this like
giant moon and my viewfinder I know
that's how it is with portrait mode but
I I don't know I love that you can blur
the edges that there's a sliding scale
on the galaxy s phones but it's just not
something that I use as much as I
thought and that's really one of the
main purposes to have the Plus version
that and the larger screen size the last
thing that I should leave you with is a
comment on the apps the Samsung native
apps just aren't very good I've replaced
every single one of them nearly every
single one of them from the browser to
my messaging app with apps from Google
instead or some other kind of
third-party app and I just wind up using
those a lot more so while the phone is
really beautiful and while I like a lot
of the customizations that Samsung has
put on top of Android I think that they
should just stick to those and move away
from apps entirely I mean even the
keyboard it's just it's awful I had to
replace it
I could not survive another
he using the native keyboard so I've
learned a lot about this phone from the
time that I first reviewed it until now
and I've got to say I would still
recommend it it's still a really
beautiful device perfect for a
day-to-day me it's there just those
little perks and caveats that aren't
exclusive to this phone really they
applied to any device that you buy so
there you have it that's been my
three-month review if you like what you
see subscribe to see nut and I'll be
back with more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
