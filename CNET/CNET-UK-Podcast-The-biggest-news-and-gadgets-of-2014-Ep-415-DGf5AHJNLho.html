the scene at UK podcast this is episode
415 for friday the 19th of december 2014
as Noddy Holder famously screamed it's
Christmas and we have a ho ho whole lot
of exciting stuff lined up including
bt's 12 billion pound Christmas gift to
itself and a look back at the most
exciting events of 2014 some of the
coolest gadgets as well now i'm luke
westaway filling in for return home
joining me in our high-tech London
studio this week is me and the oil the
one that isn't you or rich that's right
the other one that's on the podcast
sometimes hello it's me now it is just
the two of us this week I'm afraid
because rich is already basically
decided that is Christmas even though it
isn't yet we're still working and we've
already had our christmas lunch so we're
massively full of turkey and Christmas
cheer and as always we're filming the
podcast so do tune in on cnet or youtube
com / cnet if you don't mind seeing what
it would look like if two of the wise
men ate the third and all right but for
now Andy why don't you start us off with
the news
so some exciting news this week as BTW
has confirmed that it's currently in
plans right wait okay to buy ee what I
know but it is huge I don't but this
they're both so big do you have I know
you have so many questions and you're
right to be shocked as were we all when
this was when this came out so yeah it's
Sam we originally thought actually BTW
was looking to buy 02 and with a lot
talk that it was in discussions to tip i
owe to you because it basically want to
firm up its mobile app from the top cbt
is is the big hitter for home phones and
landlines and home internet and stuff
but it's mobile offering really got one
has got want it basically wants to just
instead of developing one from the
ground no he just wants to buy one so
why not buy the biggest which is EE has
the biggest customer database it has the
largest network reach i believe and so
it's put a price on a year of 12.5
billion pounds that's a lot of my whole
lot of cash honestly honestly I ok so is
it it is a thing that's really going to
happen or is it or is it not really a
things guys there there is some debate
because right now this is only there is
only talks at happening where is this
discussion going on and one of the
issues is whether or not the industry
watchdogs people like Ofcom and so on
are actually going to let it go through
because really in business it's not good
to have one company so big like BTW
having such a stranglehold on on
everything which it would do it would
have it's such a big presence in in home
stuff and also in mobile well yeah I
mean an EE of course recently trying to
get into things like TV and stuff so and
BTW already has a TV exactly yeah this
would be one mega telco that did your
home broadband and your mobile
everything and they'll be able to
basically so much just destroy everyone
else and and so in interpreters of fair
play these watchdog it's kind of a bit
skeptical right now so i mean is this is
this really going good this going to
happen is always it not going to happen
well lots of things there are there are
some discussions like it could be that
they just block
it right it could be but they said no
you can't do it and then BTW may go back
to trying to buy 02 as was originally
the plan that that that could happen
yeah I madrid airport 02 was smaller so
maybe it'll have fewer objections there
but analysts have said that Sam in fact
I couldn't quotes as it combines a UK
market leader in fixed line with a
number one mobile operator we believe it
is unlikely that ofcom would block for
deal but the combined entity could be
forced to dispose of some spectrum that
was an analyst who I were speaking to
the beeb yes to the old be there so
basically the idea there is that BTW
would be allowed to buy EE but it would
have to give up some of what it has Z
has loads of spectrum right they have to
sort of gift some out to try and make
things a bit more fair but i think this
I've got Finn this all has to go like
through European regulator basically
it's really early days it is early days
yet price may change as well because
particularly if if they do have to break
up he a little bit in terms of in terms
of what BTW is getting out of that deal
yeah presumably then it will also say
well actually if we're not getting what
we feel is 12 and a half billion pounds
of value from e.e yeah let's change a
price if the price changes and the deal
may then change it there are so many
things that still could happen and
winning swimming in variables yes but
that's some look exciting for next year
is it yeah all right more importantly
more important buyer what if you are any
customer is this is something if BTW
buys your the company that makes your
phone happen yeah is that going to mean
a big thing for you mmm yes and no um it
is going to be a big deal and this is
one of the major unknowns from you know
from ops ii most of our listeners and
perspective is well what's going to
happen and probably the biggest chains
are going to see is this a different
logo on the bill that arise every month
because you are you are tied into a
night contract you are when you take up
his contracts or 12 or 24 months you
know there they are legal contracts and
so what BTW won't be able to do as far
as we believe in the moment is is take
over your contracts because it's buying
e and its assets and the contracts in a
database of customers it can't come
along and turn your 20 panama of
contract into a 30 panama contract just
because it wants to be in breach of
contract what we don't know yet is
whether or not changing the owner of the
contract would make the contract itself
void so whether or not when the deal
happens you could say oh well I don't
want my contract anymore I'm going to go
to three well as you've changed I
presumably BTW would only want to buy EE
if it was keeping all this customers I
want to it wouldn't it it probably
wouldn't be part of the deal yeah any
risk that it would sort of let everyone
just sort of move away absolutely and
virat there are already in if you read
your contract their pages and pages long
for are a number of little clauses and
small prints in there that basically
mean that when things like I price
fluctuations because they do happen in
fat you know with Hadoop team mota
balance over the years yeah they
recognize it I like you a couple of
pence per minute which you know it's a
bit annoying but it is even got leeway
having a they're allowed to raise the
price by a certain amount yeah and I
really believe that revelation yeah and
i think the behind the scenes corporate
infrastructure is basically something
that you can't use as a reason to get
out they would have to be an actual
change to your contract itself that make
sense okay so obviously i'll tell you
who else because as you mentioned their
work this was strongly rumoured that BTW
might be considering buying 02 yes 02 or
e yeah so i think this looks is kind of
bad news for 02 because now kind of
everyone knows that it wants to get
bought but it didn't get bored and
actually kind of when you think about 02
it doesn't really feel like it's been
very competitive in the last sort of
year year and a half or something it's
not exactly been the most sorta yeah
they're with 4g every years or anything
like that so i mean is this is is the
thing to take away from this maybe that
maybe something is going to happen 202 I
mean well-lit game puzzle me also but it
but it I mean whether we can speculate
as long as we want and that sort of
thing to the case okay yeah we cuz
that's exactly what to do um you know it
could have been bought before and I
don't think it's going to damage its
name or anything because I think the
only people who are really going to know
about this are the industry analysts
like ourselves and our listeners who
really know about 02 maybe wanting to be
poor and as long as it's not changing
its own service but you're right it
hasn't been particularly competitive and
everyone we've got three offering 4g for
free to all its car
users and an e like you say getting into
things like TV and stuff as well as part
of its i'm offering 02 isn't quite isn't
quite doing there the same boat stuff so
it will see what happens next year okay
what else what are the news well we had
flight disruptions of quite epic
proportion we didn't and we all we did
how we did on friday and that was
following a technical failure of some of
the basically the airplane control
systems right in the airports so
basically no planes could take off or
land in London air space for quite quite
a few hours we just had all very
concerning it has all been fixed now
apparently Luke you know a bit more
about what actually went wrong yeah so
what happened was this way it was air
traffic control at Nats n 80s they said
that there was a technical problem
relating to basically their computer
systems in Sonic which meant that good
old swanukken olds well not good old
Swan eggs so I'm not letting the side
down frankly but they yes wanek um well
I mean how long's piece of string I mean
this is just one of those questions is
literally impossible to answer i take my
google c googling worse wanna kids now
all right well will you find out where
we're on it well you while you're on
that let me tell you that they actually
they thought that the whole system was
going to be offline for a lot longer
than it actually was yeah then
originally was talked about so they
actually fixed it reasonably quickly but
when you think about how many planes are
in and out of London every day just to
give you a sense of perspective in 2013
Heathrow handled an average of one
thousand two hundred and eighty six
flights per day where say when you think
about sort of a couple of hours offline
yeah yeah it meant that there was huge
disruption as anyone who maybe was
trying to fly in or out of an airport
that involved London over the weekend
will have known like my girlfriend who
was flying mere hours after that
happened and it was a momentary bit of
panic in my head about is that going to
be ok Swanna kinsa dently is down on the
south coast is near Southampton lovely
so there you go if it's the same sonic
which I assume it is that's right yes um
alright that's good but it did all get
fixed so I did look at fixed and things
are ok now and yeah things are ok now
thanks things
it's okay to end on that note Andy yeah
I don't need to put in a bit more of a
spin just for the sake of it I can just
let that sit nicely like a cool
comforting bath of cream right let's
just let's just leave that in there for
a moment what's blackberry bindu hell
has it been doing something library has
been doing something what is done is
today launched a new phone it's called
the classic and let me tell you why
classic blackberry classic blackberry
well is because it is very much a
classic blackberry it has gone back to
its roots on this in fact that is a
headline of the review that you may have
just seen on screen I'm looking at a
picture of it now it is I mean you use
of me right now yeah my lovely visage
you look at that beautiful mug you don't
need to be looking though to be honest
out the video feed for this because if
you picture a blackberry that's what
they've made it's exactly that it has a
three point I believe 3.4 Scott inch
square screen physical keyboard below
it's got fairly sort of mid-range specs
like a dual-core processor 720p display
it has the physical keyboard and that is
obviously what everybody has always been
asking for from blackberry phones like
when he tried to do an all touch screen
with the z10 yeah nothing did not sell
well nobody liked it nobody wanted it
wasn't what blackberry users ever asked
for so it's really is going back to go
about a classic form of this and it
hasn't gone for the high-end carbon
weave and metal thing that the q10 occu
30 one of the two and try to do that was
phone was really rather expensive so
this is a bit more does the job it's for
the classic users it basically a new
bold and not even that new just the bold
re-release for late 2014 I mean this was
the phone that didn't work the first
time so and so now it's a few years
later returned to its root but you think
it might work and is that right well I
think so it's actually it's now knowing
what its audience what I'd apparently
what its audience once is quite nice and
it's basically what it used to do right
because what we've seen interestingly
from blackberry recently is of course
the passport which is the square
blackberry phone completely square with
it with the wide keyboard and when we
first saw that thing for
just ridiculous but actually kind of
makes a lot of sense because it is super
tanish and super targeted here towards X
Excel documents and word word users and
stuff because that's exactly what it's
designed to do its for business and for
basically nothing else I mean a
blackberry seems to have given up on the
mainstream but you know if it can carve
out a niche if it can keep selling
phones to whoever the people are who
want a perfect square phone for Excel
spreadsheets here and and and on and on
and on and on then you know survival is
victory right in the in the in the
difficult world quite a buzz this I mean
it's them it's not even them yeah it's
absolutely going out for a niche but
then is a dedicated core of business
users and nice I mean gasps the street
saw the big markings definitely enough
to keep it and keep it going and if
you're in target things it's also
directly for that it's also a niche that
sort of blackberry is struggling to keep
as well because you know more and more
offices are like hey brain and I phone
you yeah you want your own phone you
want all your apps because that's the
main problem why blackberry can't go
after and like the broad audience of
people because he doesn't doesn't have
the app support people want that that's
why Android doing well in in budget
phones well karma underscore guns 21
says haters will hate no matter what BB
is the best and here to stay is it the
best yep it's the best and it's here to
stay outdoor fellow meanwhile says an
enemy should know when it has been
beaten and surrender rather than
continue to send soldiers to their
certain deaths blackberry you have been
beaten stop sacrificing your soldiers in
a pointless effort to try and stay
relevant just lie down and die show some
on already and that your final few
faithful supporters be absorbed into an
army with a chance of achieving some
level of victory and success that
Battlement very next yeah that comment
went on as well and I probably the
bigger right to stop it there and yeah
yeah I don't think a sacrifice nobody's
dying is just yeah people people still
do on blackberry they also might bring
name around unless they want it Liam
have it so we like blackberry now it's
the underdog nobody gets to be staffed
isn't it like blackberries now the
underdog we have the same with Nike we
wanted them to do well but now it's
microsoft name all over the phones like
do we want that
goodness seriously do we goodness we
fickle okay i'm alright so that's the
news um and that was looking at this
next week but now we're going to be
looking back a whole lot further over
the last 12 months it's the big picture
and we're going to do the Year in Review
so brace yourself
well what a year it's been we've seen
smartphone development finally slowed
down letting other exciting gadgets
finally get a word in we'll get to those
in a moment but we've also been asking
ourselves some really big questions
about how tech relates to modern life
especially here in the UK this has been
a year of big questions hasn't handy it
has it yes so a feature that I am now
renaming to Luke's big questions why
don't you tell me one of the one of the
conversations has been dominating the
tech world okay well one of the big
things and everybody will probably know
of heard of it's from headlines
everything is right to be forgotten the
right to be forgotten right to be
forgotten now it sounds like a big term
and it is because why it's one of Luke's
big questions oh that's why cool okay
now I understand what you're doing with
that article cool so basically what it
is is that under new EU regulations it
allows a person to request a bit an
article about them can be removed from
google search results now that has
sparked quite a lot of controversy and
because like most things of the internet
there are arguments on both sides so on
the one hand for example if a man had
committed say an assault in the 90s
which was written about online then that
man may have since served his punishment
and and right these wrongs and his you
know is apologetic for he's done and he
wants to put that incident behind him
and move on Oh for example if he was
wrongly accused one dude they would
still be news articles so you know
linking him to a crime I didn't commit
yeah which could be affecting maybe if
it's going for jobs maybe finding this
stuff absolutely you know so that is a
completely understandable yeah um sorry
yeah um yeah the others around on the
phone other side and argues that it will
allow individuals and also companies to
request articles and to be removed about
them that a negative peel the show that
they can basically control what in the
public eye so for example there being a
lot of stories particularly in Britain
about an MP sex scandals expenses
scandal and all this sort of thing
and these are important to be in the
public eye and to remain in the public
eye too so we're informed about what the
government's and you know what MPs doing
politicians in this stuff and and yet
these are also resort of articles that
could be in line to be removed upon
request by the people and which a lot of
people have argued that shouldn't happen
that's basically an abuse of the system
what I think is really interesting about
this has been Google's reaction because
you you very very fairly put across both
sides of the argument that so yeah I can
sort of see both sides of it i mean i
guess like on a on a personal level I
guess I falls somewhere in the middle
like I mean no one wants sort of like
excessive censorship or anything like
that but on the other hand it seems
reasonable to me that if you know if
there's information about you online
that sort of isn't representative of who
you are what you've done then you should
be able to ask Google to take that down
but google has not reacted well to this
so they called the verdict disappointing
when it came I think it was in May May
was the original EU decision and then a
few months later google revealed which
countries made the most requests for
result changes and 12,000 came from the
UK which were which is a collection of
requests that referred to about 44,000
URLs thought overall requests made
across europe google said that fifty
three percent were delisted as asked
which sort of suggests that there are a
lot of people asking for things that
Google would like are no well that's the
other word thing about like Google's
using its best judgement yeah exactly
and that's like what you do but there's
a lot of things it's quite cagey about
the systems and about as the process
that goes through to remove this so you
can put into submission but we don't
really know exactly how the conversation
then goes about removing this and who's
on this panel because I would think this
if it's an EU thing this should really
go to a third-party panel but perhaps
somebody to do with like libel law and
the courts like it could be a court
matter rather than google itself making
this decision because we have to
basically trust at google's doing the
right thing and is it removing it for
the right reasons well trusting that
google's doing the right thing is
basically what the whole world is spent
the last decade sorceress well yes right
i hope the other word think about this
eh
it seems to be part of a trend of
American or at least very very sort of
like it in international kind of
non-european countries kind of coming up
against these sort of roadblocks in
Europe or kind of in the UK like it
another example this year has been
attacks we've been talking a lot about
Google and Apple and Amazon just day
make some of the tech companies who sort
of operates you know through Island
taking advantage of a like a text
loophole that means that they operate in
the UK a lot but don't pay very much tax
went on oh yeah and you know it's like
is that is that they're I mean they're
sort of I suppose they're obeying
they're obeying the law yeah it's as it
is written it's very much a gray area
that isn't it because technically
technically they're not breaking any
laws but morally of course they're
breaking a whole number of moral issues
and and that's you know is this is this
right but then even that there are which
we discussed at length or there are both
sides to that if Apple and Amazon and
whoever completely pulled out of Ireland
because of changes in tax codes and
whatnot then that's a big member of
business and jobs so that a UK yeah I'm
sorry maybe I'm well I mean what day
though who knows what price you don't
know but the I mean the argument that
sort of made in favor of this is like we
need to encourage businesses to sort of
operate in the UK yeah but you know like
if they're not paying any tax do we
really well ya see ya all right so
although interestingly on that subject
this in the last few months we have seen
one of those tax loopholes which is
brilliantly called the double Irish and
has been has been closed yeah so you
know more exciting change yeah I'm all
right that's a pointing part of of the
years trends I think that's kind of a
negative side it's not all it's not all
bad it's not all bad what else is
happening ND well any is there any
glimmer of light glimmer of light let's
just pin the last year please that's
something actually when I put my head
back there was a nice clean Reviver
comes down to my face then so they were
which I think illustrates into my next
point quite well and is of course about
4G and the 4g basically has really
really taken off this year means been
around since I think 2012 when II first
launched 4g only in
london in couple of the places i yeah
yeah but it says this year we've really
seen it spread out all of the major
networks now have a 4g offering that
have either rolled into their existing
plans so three for example has just roll
it in it doesn't try to anymore that's
been great and we've seen it arrived in
so many more cities believe how many z
and now and i always liked all of them
we get a press release and they're
really sort of Yoos tiny town of those
little towns that sort of yeah yeah
don't no one even knew was there even
people who lived there what we have 4g
and we live in a town what's happening
who you um well in april one analyst
firm said that 4g is being adopted
globally faster than any previous
telecommunications technology yes nice
and in that same month in fact ee which
we've already discussed boasted it had
loads 2.9 million customers to Expedia
services that was in April and that
figure hit 5.9 million in October's so
those figures are really surprising
because when you think about what 4G
actually brings what better internet
connection brings like it's not just a
service its access to all your over
services having 4G may mean that you can
skype your family in different country
whereas on 3g maybe had to deport
connection we really want this you know
it's so it's accessing so many other
things i think also what's been really
cool is that we're now seeing the budget
networks and like a giffgaff yeah and
staff you offer just super basic cheap
sim only plans also getting on board
with 4g because when 4g first arrived on
we were quite negative about it
particularly towards EE sorry always
sorry yeah because it was so expensive
are you satisfied with cuz ii because
you're right last year e launched its 4g
network it was really really expensive
as a luxury it was a luxury ride sharing
that thing and it was they had a mega
premium strapped onto it because you're
the only network that was selling it are
you content now Andrew oil in December
2014 do you think that AE is more
reasonable are you disappointed with the
competition I do think it is more
reasonable i'm not completely satisfied
okay not completely alright but i am
almost there yeah okay not specifically
for me but from everyone else because
they were three with what they've done
with 4G is gray e still is the pricier
of the bunch but it does have the scope
to offer I signed up to Vodafone when it
was offering various deals with like
extra data and Spotify subscriptions
which I actually sure if it's still
doing so that basically they sought my
net my contract price down quite a lot
i'm steve spotty files I was paying 10
pounds a month anyway so by getting that
for free basically made my contract 10
quid cheaper so this is now TV as an
option as well though yes it is anything
at Sky Sports 2 so um yeah I love 4g I
mean I can download an episode of sons
of anarchy between 22 points on my on my
commute to train stations Wow yeah in
like in minutes isn't that underground
though using Virgin Media's underground
London Wi-Fi network no it's not and
that's terrible because the login screen
pops up all the time but we're not going
to talk about that and easy don't bring
it up again oh no that's over ground on
three actually although yeah I've got an
unlimited data thing I wouldn't be down
yeah sure stuff like do you find how do
you find three and since it's got afford
your screen two and four ah I quit you
quit I quit quit you quit he's wandered
off um what was I what you actually
asked him who knows I was knocked off by
how about showing yeah how do you find
cuz I I had capacity problems with three
before with 3g only yeah how do you
fight now people are moving on to 4G do
you find that it's a bit more stable
yeah actually I've found it pretty good
this year but you know we sort of live
and working in central London which yeah
means we sort of are in the place that
has priority of coverage only of course
really excited me what I thought was
great which I am doing this your hands
are going all excited when I went to see
Lincoln Park at the o2 a couple of weeks
ago 02 sold out and it was massive huge
everyone was there and i still had full
4g signal on vodafone and it worked hmm
in a 50,000 seat stadium and as never
happened to me before even on 02 and at
the o2 it like i can try and send a
tweet or something saying this is fun
and it won't satna just
wait just people tell me people trying
to do it I love amazing not brilliant I
love how deep in your like body tissues
and bone marrow your geekiness is you
come home and it's like oh how was a
Lincoln part giggling well Ollie it was
it was absolutely incredible i had 4g
signal by the time and it was
consistently working i was watching
homes under the hammer on iplayer and is
that BBC heaven henrich off for no yeah
well you know what you could have found
only watch cooking shows you have found
that out downloaded it and watched it in
the time it took for milk in park to
play the songs that made your childhood
come alive the do permit hybrid fear is
brilliant yep alright so those are
Luke's big questions or but what our
Luke's big products what are the biggest
products of the year Andy tell me some
of them well that's actual gadgets that
happened I mean obviously it's been a
year as every year as a year of amazing
products and flagships you had a new
iPhones from Apple we've had new iPad
have had a whole host of things galaxy s
fine yes fine of course le Algieri we've
had the reviews like Sony I'll train who
cheeky dad look that's that's one too
many at least um although i am actually
using one of them so i shouldn't argue
too much but what I want to talk my
particular yeah first of all it is the
year of Android wear and other wearables
like that's we had it we've had it
launched I've had it coming to our hands
and let me leave again quite quickly
welcome into our hands that showed your
wrist saturation okay all right what's
your favorite and favorite is the LG G
watch our because that to me is really
what Android wear should be it is it
looks like a watch it looks nice it's
round with taught like this it's great
Sultan do a lot but it's only the
beginning for Android wear next year i
think is gonna be very exciting yeah for
wearables we have of course seen the
Apple watch be announced but not out but
yes on set so I which might include it
because that is not a 2014 product as a
2015 products all right or maybe 2016 if
it goes you know we'll wait for that in
the back or maybe even the worst next
2015 although certainly the best um next
up galaxy note edge Frank samsung cool
reason being because finally we're
seeing a bit of experimenting in phone
this is why i liked the blackberry
passport
it's not just I ok finally there the
fight well you know the s5 Samsung's had
all four sales of that and it's had
drops in profit and market share and all
this stuff because people were just a
bit bored that it's the same thing but
again and the edge comes along edges of
it I know we're not I know it's about
the nice edge i mean the edges of the
galaxy is plastic like chrome fit plus
if it chips off it's not a great phone
it does everything you want it's just it
needs a lot of refinement they actually
the galaxy alpha with the metal body
really to them really really nice phone
that hope would see more of that from
Samsung so yeah the edge the edge is
cool we've you've played the world we've
had a retarded we've had a play we've
had a go our reviewers online what did
we give it did we like give it four
stars we've said it's not really good it
was an interesting idea I think it needs
some more software to work with this
edge thing but it's just good to see
something a bit different see Samsung
actually trying to innovate slightly
even if it's something that doesn't work
because it's try things like putting a
projector and its phone before and
something has always been one to
basically if there's a product that can
exist it will make it and throw
everything at the wall because it's got
the budget to make it in five different
sizes exactly and see what happens and
the edge actually you know it's just it
is different and it's quite cool and
it's a you know you take mine out in the
purple people ask you about it's unusual
a bit different alright so that's
watches and fines yeah else drones Luke
drones is what else throw no yes roan mg
um yes particularly i'm going to talk
about the DJI inspire 1 sorry so I was
CEO me we've seen these brilliant flying
machines coming together before so
previously drones for filming and things
and to do like these really amazing
aerial shots well well even if they were
dreadful you had to basically rent a
helicopter and have a massive budget to
get a pilot yeah or BBC started using
like there's really big six or eight
rotor things that cost about forty
thousand pounds and they've got cinema
level cameras strapping Eve but now
we're seeing from companies like DJ I
with their and phantom vision to drone
which is about seven eight hundred
pounds i think easy to fly little
quadricopter with a camera and you can
fly flew it over Chatsworth MO and over
Chatsworth has got this amazing footage
she doesn't know where you could have
could have got before and the inspire
one is their latest one that we've just
announced and they brought it into our
office in fact some flit around very
cool and this thing shoots in for Kane
it's got stabilization on it and it's
easy to fly easy to use and it's
bringing this really cool filming
techniques and stuff that you normally
ultra pro level fit for making
blockbuster films into the hands of me
and you like to only be given that for
Christmas and it's already yeah yeah
hasn't all been good news of drones we
have also had stories about people
flying those same drones on to like
Heathrow Airport and getting in the way
of planes which of course causes
national military panic which is bad
which is bad things to do so don't do
that oye yeah anyway so dr john jones
home and we've also there's one more
thing on the list is one more thing of a
list and that is oled tvs because for me
one of the things i'm very happy about
is a twist and stop seeing new
innovations in 3d and other dodgy
gimmicks that I don't think had anything
to viewing experience stop trying to see
both sides of the 3d thing now we can
all admit that it was just well yeah
that it was a bit stupid and OLED is
actually all about image quality is
about having vibrant colors it's bright
black levels are black so you get high
contrast good-looking panels and you've
seen plenty and efferent CES yeah you
really like them I'm a huge lead fine
actually so is David Katz me who is a
sort of TV review head honcho in the
u.s. I'm here reviewed a an LG I think
OLED TV this year and the the headline
in the review was best picture ever so
actually I mean we're hearing the sort
of not everyone is getting that into our
LED that may be sort of Samsung's not as
interested as it once was no but yeah I
like other TV want to watch so you know
it's nice that things are sort of maybe
sort finally moving in the old TV well
okay so but I asked them I actually also
asked on Twitter what a bunch of
people's favorite products of the area
to get a bit feedback what is this so we
had Chris well it's chris with the k hi
krista the cake was excited about the
Microsoft band the iphone 6 and the
samsung galaxy note 4 okay actually been
out for so I had this metal edge so
that's quite cool
Christopher Finn actually agreed sever
DJ inspire one is the thing he's most
excited about this year okay ben says is
still loving the pebble that's the
eating smart watch the galaxy owner
Galaxy Note edges novel all right we
agree with that Eunice says Apple watch
and the innumerable upgrade to 3d
printing they're actually really
printing is a good point I've seen loads
of cool things coming out they've been
3d printed and jack says the spork game
changer not really 2014 products hashtag
game changer no yeah well at 14 was the
year where this book really came into
its own into it yeah yeah this is this
isn't into sports yeah Andrew Marsh has
been Nexus 6 6 yeah we have a new yeah
okay all right big phone Freddie says
android wear as a whole so all right

streaming stick alright and Vidya nan

answer was 1792 that's the most they

that's that's a reasonable amount of El
it's not you can just go to if you like

are listening to the audio version make
sure you saw find the feed on YouTube
here because my goodness is pretty happy
about this it's just della okay right
it's time to move on that's enough
Christmas now let's find out what you
guys have been saying in the old
feedback okay Dave Lester says where
does not come from like right out the
gate there Dave with a really really
great question um I don't know that
comes in your nose I don't think anyone
really understands it no I think the
important thing is just not to panic and
not to ask any questions yeah leave it
be yep exactly mer at chabad AG says
best uses for an old computer from 2001
2 2004 era back when XP was the bee's
knees best uses for an old computer
potentially use it as a just a media
server actually you could maybe hook it
up to your TV and just use it to play
and play video files to do to do heavy
lifting know all things locally yeah
you'll be glad to know that in fact Cena
has written exactly this article 5 great
uses for your old windows computer was
that one of them suddenly wrote in 2011
it was actually means the nervous center
of a media center you could also think
about using it as a network media
storage or a home security monitor maybe
or just something as simple as a backup
storage all good and suggestion also
whoa Chris Roebuck addresses Murat and
says a try keep odd or Ubuntu of our mod
what is keep odd well then fact Chris
Roebuck follows that comment up with
actually that's my question have you
used keep odd or similar I've just
bought one for an old computer but not
really used it yet seems to work pretty
well for basic stuff I'm not sure about
more demanding apps so keep odd is this
IndieGoGo project that raised more than
forty thousand dollars which is very
impressive and it's kind of like a
little operating system on a stick it's
supposed to call something just seven
dollars I think and the idea is you'll
be able to take an old discarded or
potentially non-functional pc and revive
it and kind of make it usable and i
think the idea as well as it people will
be able to sort of share one old
computer but because they sort of maybe
we'll have their own sticks they can get
their own okay experience through it
Jonica yesyes good actually Chris after
saying Ivan I haven't used one no but I
do we should have interested too what
else have we got Mike bat says why do
birds suddenly appear when you're near I
actually keep birdseed in my pocket so
they can smell it yeah well that's that
answer then very concise Andrew well
done Andrew Rimmer says no questions to
ask except to say a big thank you for
all the insight and reviews throughout
the year happy Christmas and a great new
year all right I think there's a lovely
feedback point to end on and of course
the Christmas to you too Andrew yes

listeners unto all of our viewers and to
