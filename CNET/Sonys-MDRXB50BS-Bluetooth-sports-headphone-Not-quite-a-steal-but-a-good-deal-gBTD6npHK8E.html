bass sports wireless in-ear headphone
and what makes it worth considering is
that it's relatively inexpensive at
around $60 online it fits well and
sounds good particularly if you listen
to bass heavy music as you can see this
isn't the smallest in your wireless
headphone and its footprint is round
size of the beats power beats 3 Wireless
it's fairly lightweight however and fit
me better than the power beats 3 it
comes with a few different sized fins
and ear tips and I was able to get a
nice tight seal with the larger size
which is crucial for maximizing bass
performance this is a noise-isolating
headphones and it does passively muffle
ambient noise so you wouldn't be able to
hear traffic while you're running if
you're playing your music even at
moderate volume levels battery life is
rated at 8.5 hours which is decent and
the headphone is water-resistant but not
waterproof I can't say they seem like
the sturdiest headphones in the world
but they do only cost $60 there's a
built-in microphone along with volume
and track skipping controls on the
earpieces call quality was ok not great
this will perform better as a headset
inquired environments not say the noisy
streets of New York
they don't call these extra bass
Wireless in your headphones for nothing
as I said they put out a lot of bass and
it's pretty decent bass that's got some
punch to it and isn't - bumi these
aren't the cleanest or most detailed
headphones but they do sound
particularly good when you listen to
electronic or hip-hop music they manage
to maintain a mostly hiccup free
wireless connection anyway I'm David
Carter for cnet.com and that's the MDR
xB 50 BS one of the better affordable
wireless sports headphones currently
