HP launched a pair of high-end Android
tablets designed for the business user
the HP s pro Slate 12 and his little
brother
the HP pro slavery Congress in Barcelona
we're going in for a closer look
first up the big guy this is the HP pro
se 12 and as the name suggests it has a
12 inch display as you can see it's
actually in a four by three aspect ratio
which apparently makes it more akin to
using a piece of paper now it's got a
higher than HD resolution so all the
apps and icons do seem pretty sharp
it's running on Android 4.4 KitKat not
at the latest 5 version 5 lollipop it's
a bit of a shame but of course it can be
updated as time goes on now as you can
see it does have quite a premium look it
has this silverback which sure not
exactly stylish but it's exactly the
sort of thing you can imagine pulling
out of a business suitcase in a
boardroom meeting it has these
front-facing speakers as well which
makes it quite reminiscent of HTC's one
smartphone inside it's running on a
quad-core Qualcomm processor has clocked
at 2.3 gigahertz so that should be
plenty of power to keep everything
running along nicely now an interesting
addition is a stylus with this which
allows you to not only handwrite your
notes on the screen but actually use it
as a pen on regular paper and it will
track the movement and automatically
transfer that to the slate now the
little version as well the 8 inch model
has exactly the same feature so you can
get that depending on whatever size you
want to go for and here's a smaller
model lavishes has an 8 inch screen
which has a 2048 by 1536 pixel
resolution so again that is higher than
Full HD and it does show because you can
see their icons and text do look really
crisp as I similarly designed to the big
one with the same metal edging and the
front-facing speakers now this does come
with this case actually which apart from
keeping it nice and safe when you're
walking around does also come with a
good old fashioned notebook as well
it shows most of its internal specs with
the Big Brother as well including
Android 4.4 KitKat software and the 2.3
gigahertz quad-core processor so it's
really just down to which screen size
you want so the 8 inch model here
retails for 379 euros now that
translates to 425 dollars based on
direct conversion the 12-inch bottle hey
which I am struggling to hold now costs
529 euros or 593 dollars and they are
both on sale now I'm Andrew Hoyle for C
net and this is the HP Proust eight
eight and this is the HP Proust 812</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
