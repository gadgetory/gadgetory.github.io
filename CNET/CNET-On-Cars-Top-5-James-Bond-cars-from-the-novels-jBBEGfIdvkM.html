top James Bond cars from the movies so
I'm gonna take a road less traveled the
top five James Bond cars from the
novel's no less cool a lot more unusual
and I'm gonna rank them by their general
importance to the DNA of double-oh-seven
here we go number five the rolls-royce
Silver Ghost I know we're going back to
the brass age with this one but this was
Goldfinger's car in the novel and
perhaps the most interesting villain car
of all the books like the 1937 phantom
you saw in the movie
it's body was cast in gold for crafty
smuggling but the car in the novel hails
from around 1909 so you may notice it
looks a lot like a car from another
novel that became film Chitty Chitty
Bang Bang which Fleming also wrote
number four a supercharged Bentley four
and a half liter forget Aston Martin's
bonds personal cars were always bent
least in the early books he had one of
these blower Bentley's named that for
the supercharger fitted distinctively
ahead of the engine on the outside of
the body this is the car that Fleming
posed in for the cover of life in 1966
number three the lunchy of Flaminia
Zagato Spyder now here is a case of
poetic license the Zagato body launched
via flaminia was the hottest of all
those models but in reality was never
available as a Spyder a drop-top
no matter von married the woman in the
pink scarf who blew past him in an
imagined Spyder on the road between
Abbeville and Monterey in northern
France a scene immortalized in this
beautiful Robert Weaver painting for
Playboy in 64 number two the Aston
Martin db7 knows the Aston db5 from the
movie Goldfinger but in the novel it was
a slightly more quaint db3 that Bond
drew from the motor pool so it had the
amazing gadgets but the bar for amazing
was a little lower in 1959 so we're
talking about it having a homing device
but no Maps changeable color running
lights and a Smuggler's box to stash a
long-barrel colt 45
no ejector seats
okay the number one Bond car from the
bun books is the 1954 Bentley
Continental R this was truly bonds
personal car the one he bought with his
own money he had his modified into a
convertible and again had a supercharger
installed at which point the factory
washed their hands of the warranty
attaboy
it's one of the handsomest cars ever
made a point not lost on modern Bentley
look at the current Continental GT see
resemblance
