best beef talk show in the known
universe in our last week of shows oh my
gosh i am jeff kannada ashley skin is
out today and we're this is our last
week
so the 18th is our last show we got a
fun week of we got a fun week a stories
coming at you starting with today's
headlines last week we told you about a
robot that could give you a tattoo
this week we're telling you about a
tattoo that can give you a robot MIT and
Microsoft revealed duo skin this past
weekend a gold leaf temporary tattoo
that wearers can interact with the
circuits can be designed in standard
image designing software and then
printed directly to cheap temporary
tattoo paper the video shows off four
ways to use them as touch sensitive
input for tapping and sliding that
controls an object on a nearby display a
thermochromic tattoo that changes color
and design of the wearer's body
temperature rises a wireless
communication device that can be paired
with tech like NFC and a purely
aesthetic tattoo jewelry necklace with
light-up LEDs embedded within the
designs are beautiful but they're also
inexpensive and a three by four
centimeter NFC tattoo costs less than
three dollars I think this is idea of
wearable technology is is pretty cool I
mean we already have watches and
headphones and stuff
why not tattoos right why not we've been
watching hollow lenses development with
a lot of anticipation and this is a very
cool new app the team behind in 3s an
NES emulator that adds 3d visuals to 2d
games has a fun new toy to play with in
hololens they released a video recently
showing off their work with the
augmented reality headset and it's an
alpha build of an NES game showcase with
Super Mario Brothers
Donkey Kong Tetris and more running on
the headset it incorporates elements of
n3s with sprites getting a 3d
modification so when you tilt your head
the game seems more than just a
flat render but according to the team
it's not an easy job in its video
description the team says quote hololens
won't run most games at full speed
unquote and the alpha build was hand
tuned and optimized to work for hololens
in such a way that many games wouldn't
be eligible for this type of conversion
I'm ready for all of my retro games to
be brought into the future give me VR
give me a R I want them I want them in
the real world interacting with me
there's no reason why we have to leave
all of our 8-bit sprites behind just
bring them into the future with us
