wireless bluetooth speaker that's
designed for both indoor and outdoor use
at $300 it's fairly pricey but it
certainly is rugged and delivers big
sound for its relatively small size it
also has good battery life hi I'm David
Carr noise and I'm going to give you a
quick video tour of this speaker which
has been on the market since 2013 it's
currently bravin's top-of-the-line
bluetooth speaker and is the weatherized
version of its 850 speaker which cost
around 20 dollars less clearly one of
its strongest points is its build
quality with things built like a tank
and feels pretty hefty weighing in at 4
pounds it's rubberized on the top bottom
and sides and has a removable rubber
gasket that covers all the ports
underneath that gasket you'll find the
power connection and auxilary input for
non bluetooth devices a battery life
indicator and a USB charging port for
juicing up your cell phone or tablet
wireless range is the standard 33 feet
or 10 meters beyond the USB charging
port the speaker does feature a few
other extras there's a built-in
speakerphone and apdex for devices that
support it apdex is supposed to make
Bluetooth audio sound better but it's
really hard to tell if it actually makes
a difference for better or worse since
this is a larger portable speaker you
have to charge it using its own AC
adapter and not a microUSB cable as I
said it does offer very good battery
life up to a whopping 20 hours at more
moderate volume levels it also sounds
good for its size it plays loud has some
nice kick to its base and holds together
well at higher volumes it's a tad harsh
in the treble and isn't the most
detailed speaker that's par for the
course for these types of portable
Bluetooth speakers this is considered a
stereo speaker but because the drivers
are so close together you get little to
no stereo separation there is an option
to wirelessly join two of these speakers
together to form a left-right pair for
true stereo sound but I'm not sure how
many people want to spend $600 to do
that and all I like this Bravin and
think it's a solid choice if you're
looking for a beefier rugged portable
wireless speaker that plays loud and
features excellent battery
that said I probably prefer that $200 ue
boom because it's more compact and
easier to tote around I also like the
TDK life on record a 33 which can be had
online for around $150 and is a better
overall value I'm David Carr noise and
that's the Bravin 850 5's thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
