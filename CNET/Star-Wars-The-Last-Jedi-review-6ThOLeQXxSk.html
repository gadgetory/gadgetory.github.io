intrigue and betrayal in a shady City
and a Jedi student learns about the
force from an aging master this is the
new Star Wars sequel this is the last
Jedi yeah that sounds kind of familiar
forty years ago the Empire Strikes Back
set the template for spectacular sci-fi
sequels and last Jedi follows that
template closely maybe too closely once
you notice it the brazen nods to Empire
can be pretty distracting but set that
aside because this is the finest moments
of Star Wars remixed remastered and
turned up to 11 even with all those
blatant mimicry of the older film last
Jedi raises the action of his emotional
stakes the stars and beyond in
particular the storyline between Luke
Skywalker his former Protege kylo Ren
and his prospective student Rey ratchets
to an intensity rarely seen in the Star
Wars saga last Jedi contains some of the
most explosive twists and
heart-wrenching moments in Star Wars
history it's a stirring return for Mark
Hamill as Luke Skywalker and it's
certainly a fitting send-off to the late
Carrie Fisher in her final suitably
towering performance as general Leia not
everything is quite so out-of-this-world
though the plucky rebel Row is a worthy
addition to the crew but Benicio del
Toro shady hacker doesn't add very much
to the mix and Poe Dameron doesn't get a
lot to do besides look handsome but he
is so very very handsome actually the
whole thing looks absolutely stunning
from the first orders blood-red chambers
to the finales crimson and cloudbursts
and in between the deadly visuals and
gripping moments there are laughed by
the starship load from grumpy uncle Luke
droll droid bb-8 and yes even the totes
adorbs port so sure maybe the last Jedi
learned a few tricks from the Empire
Strikes Back
but as kylo Ren and Rey become perhaps
the most compelling characters in the
Star Wars galaxy
it seems the learner has become the
master</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
