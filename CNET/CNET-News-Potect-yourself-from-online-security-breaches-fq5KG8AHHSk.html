websites getting hacked in July the
accounts of 6.5 million linked-in users
and 400,000 yahoo users were compromised
and back in January Zappos suffered a
major security breach that affected 24
million customers to protect yourself
from future attacks there are a few
simple steps you can take like making
sure your security updates are current
use a up-to-date a heavily patch browser
I personally like chrome make sure you
keep your system patch that way you
don't get compromised me just surfing
the web contrary to popular belief it's
not necessary to change your password on
a regular basis academics pretty much
feel that by having people rotate their
passwords frequently at forces the
choose shorter and shorter passwords
things that are actually intentionally
weaker over time because people don't
have that long term memory when it comes
to passwords longer is better come up
with a memorable password come up with a
very large random string you store in a
password vault once you get a habit of
using something like that then you're
not going to be using the same password
in multiple websites if you are the
victim of a security breach run don't
walk to the nearest computer and change
your password and hackers are likely to
try using stolen passwords in multiple
online locations so if you use that same
email and password combo for other sites
change those as well in San Francisco
