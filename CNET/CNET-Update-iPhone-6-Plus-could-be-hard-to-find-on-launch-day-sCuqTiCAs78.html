bigger iPhone on launch day and
Microsoft is building a new world for
Minecraft I'm Bridget Carey this is your
cnet update apple says it's sold a
record number of new iPhones in the
first 24 hours of pre-orders selling
more than 4 million units of the iphone
6 and iphone 6 plus that's about double
what the iphone 5 sold on its first day
of pre-orders but we really can't
compare last year's 5s the same way
there was no pre-order option for the 5s
but there were nine million total 5s and
5c models sold on the first weekend in
stores so this year sales could beat
that just based on the pre-order numbers
the big question this year surrounds the
bigger iPhone based on these pre-orders
it's possible that the extra large
iphone six-plus could be harder to come
by on launch day the pre-order wait time
for the six plus quickly jumped to about
a month but you can still get the normal
iphone 6 and 7 to 10 business days we
don't know if that's because more people
are buying the plus or that Apple just
has fewer of the 6 plus in stock the new
iPhones go on sale in stores at eight
a.m. local time this Friday but even if
you're not getting the new model the
updated operating system iOS 8 will be
available to download on Wednesday
Microsoft is the new owner of minecraft
one of the most popular games in the
world right now Microsoft purchased mo
yang it's the Swedish video game company
that created minecraft for two and a
half billion dollars if you're
unfamiliar with Minecraft you could
think of it as a world of virtual Legos
people just have fun building block e
worlds and interacting with other
builders there's no story line but the
creative freedom of it draws in players
across many demographics there have been
about 50 million copies sold and it's
played across multiple systems that's
what makes this purchase so interesting
Microsoft now owns a game that's
playable on the PlayStation on Apple's
iOS and on Android normally Microsoft
own games like Halo are exclusive to
Microsoft systems microsoft says it will
continue to support n evolve the game
across those other platforms minecraft
isn't currently on Windows Phones but
you can bet it will be soon and maybe
minecraft on xbox or Windows could have
extra perks
talked a little about Microsoft and
Apple but to round it out there's also
news on Google the company's bringing
affordable Android smartphones to
developing countries with a project
called Android one it's launching first
with India this Android one phone costs
about one hundred dollars but it's not
just about the price it's also about
having that Android experience be
consistent across devices it'll run this
pure version of Android that isn't
mucked up with extra software and Google
will push out regular software updates
so users are not left behind with new
features come out a year later that's
your tech news update but if you crave
more head to cnet com from our studios
