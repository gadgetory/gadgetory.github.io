welcome to the apple pie for all the
good and bad inside the world of Apple
I'm back from my vacation and a lot of
you have been requesting to see more
skin well I had my very first sunburn
ever and it now has me molting like a
snake it's all very new to me but don't
worry Apple biters I made sure I
protected all of this for you all right
onto the stories in the real reason
you're here with some juicy good
next-gen iphone rumors a report from
korea aighty news.com claims our sources
have confirmed apple use liquid metal
technology to make a thinner and lighter
next-generation iphone the big a
acquired the rights to the patented
amorphous metal alloys that are first
liquid and then can be cooled into other
forms from a company called liquid metal
technologies in 2010 now apples use this
metal for smaller parts like the sim
card ejector tool but all I'm saying is
that i do not want my phone to come
alive and stab me t1000 style now the
article states the new material would
allow for a surface smooth like liquid
and they say the phone will be announced
at WWDC 2012 in june now those are some
pretty big claims but when will we even
see this phone we're thinking the
September timeframe but some people were
still hoping and clinging for the June
to July time period but fall seems even
more likely after a Qualcomm warned
analysts that is expecting supply issues
with some of its advanced mobile LTE
phone ships the same 28-nanometer chips
that people are expecting to see in the
next gen iphone now verizon is the king
of LTE for us phone carriers with its
network covering two thirds of the US
population right now but current iPhone
users will be getting to know a verizon
family data plan will be available
sometime this summer following Sprint's
lead alright let's catch you up to speed
with a Mac flashback trojan update this
first key lab says the number of
infected machines has now dropped to
around thirty thousand machines
significantly down from its peak around
600,000 max Java updates or Apple's own
removal tool has been able to take care
of most of them after one of the most
successful malware campaigns against the
mac platform now kaspersky officials
expect the mac platform to be a bigger
target because market share is what
motivates attackers and believe it or
not no
Mac is safe all right let's take a quick
break with a batch of tips and meaty
info to help protect your Mac from
malware whether you're a longtime Mac
owner or new to the Big Apple it's time
to beef up your Mac security hi i'm seth
rosenblatt and today i've got six common
sense tips on how to safeguard your mac
against the rising tide of malware step
1 get a security suite running a
security program is just common sense
good free and paid options include a
vast sophos clam xav Kaspersky and
intense tall a suite at the very least
use a browser tool that will check links
to make sure they're safe before you
load them the free avg linkscanner is a
good place to start step 2 lockdown
admin privileges the default account
that you create on your Mac is an
administrator account which can be
leveraged by the bad guys to infect your
machine simple solution create a non
admin account for daily use such as
email browsing and music and video
watching jump over to admit when it's
necessary step 3 stay on top of software
updates make sure that you let software
update do its job programs are rarely
updated on a whim so make sure that
you've got the latest versions because
they may contain security fixes this
includes the latest security patches
from software makers and Apple itself
step 4 ditch Adobe Reader if you can
adobe has been notoriously slow in the
past about patching security holes in
reader they've gotten somewhat better
but why risk it when preview and snow
leopard and lion can handle the basic
PDF reading requirements if you must
keep Adobe Reader around make sure that
it's always updated to the latest
version step 5 get rid of java and flash
you can disable Java by going to the
Applications folder than utilities and
unchecking the java version boxes under
the general tab be warned killing flash
and still enjoying the modern web means
switching to google chrome for
your main browser because it's the only
browser that comes with flash built in
chrome updates regularly and the browser
has earned its reputation alongside
Firefox as a safe browser that patches
security problems when discovered step 6
take control of your passwords unlike
Microsoft Apple helpfully provides a
solid password manager called keychain
as often as possible use strong
passwords this means random multi-word
passwords separated by spaces if you
want to get password syncing for
multiple device and machine support use
1password or LastPass people can and do
run max without paying attention to
security but as we've seen over the past
year attack centered on macs are almost
certainly going to increase all right
Thank You Seth for all the good stuff in
there now we're still waiting for OS 10
mountain lions official release date the
progress is being made after the third
version of the developer preview has
been made available with stability
improvements and if there are any other
new features that surface will let you
know about them plus Safari 5.2 and
Xcode 4.4 also received updates for
developers as well now the big e wants
everyone they can get to pounce on
mountain lion belt you need to have lion
first and it's primarily distributed
through the App Store so Apple is
offering mobileme users who are still
using an older OS a free copy of snow
leopard which will then allow them to
upgrade to lie in and then upgrade to
mountain lion while updating for mobile
media iCloud see that all made perfect
sense right and we also know Apple loves
all their glass store designs and they
filed a patent for ownership of the
design of the massive 12 meter tall
glass cylinder at their Shanghai China
megastore unique to the store is the
arrangement of its curved glass panels
now on my vacation i visited the fifth
avenue store in new york what up randy
and i was the first to make a joke about
apple replacing all of its glass panels
so would have visually fewer seams i
admit that glass cube looks even more
amazing than before but it's really not
as big as i remember alright we showed
you an awesome Kickstarter project last
week but it has now been outdone by the
ePaper based heavily in a class of its
own and has raised over 5 million
dollars up to this point it syncs over
bluetooth for your iphone
Android you'll be able to do things like
customize it with apps see incoming
calls before reaching for your phone
view notifications and reminders and
control your music directly from the
watch and it's something we'll be
watching all right guys it's time to
