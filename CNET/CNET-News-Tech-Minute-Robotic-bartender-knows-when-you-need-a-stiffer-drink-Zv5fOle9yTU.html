have to do to get a drink around here
turns out there's a gadget for that the
Monsieur this robotic bartender can
serve up to 300 different cocktails a
tablet serves as monsieurs interface the
android tablet connects to a
microcontroller which is the muscle and
it controls all the mechanics mechanics
like the peristaltic pumps their
metering pump which allows you to pour
down to a milliliter of accuracy most
drinks can be made in less than 30
seconds users can order using the
built-in touch screen or the
accompanying mobile app which also keeps
tabs on your drinking it can estimate
your blood alcohol level and after you
had a certain amount of drinks it will
actually give you a notification to
recommend that you do not drive and it
actually offer up an uber or a taxi
magic or a different taxi service and
this robot does more than pour it
incorporates artificial intelligence
Monsieur detects that you came home late
and that you're off of your schedule and
it offered to make you a double instead
of a single because you had a long day
at work convenient though it comes at a
price $1,500 for the four bottle model
and 4,000 for the 16 bottle version it's
not as technically sophisticated but at
sixty dollars Burke stones perfect drink
system is a cheaper way to make better
bevy's you'll have to supply your own
iOS device and download the perfect
drink app then connect the scale to your
device open the app and choose a
cocktail the app offers step-by-step
instructions on hundreds of drinks and
lets you know when you've poured the
right amount if you poured too much
alcohol into your drink by accident or
maybe it was intentional the app will
automatically adjust your ingredient
proportions so you'll still have a
well-balanced cocktail I think we can
all say cheers to that in San Francisco
I'm see me das cnet for CBS News
