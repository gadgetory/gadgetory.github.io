welcome to the Apple buy for everything
good and bad inside the world of Apple
the big news this week is the iOS 11
public beta for the iPhone and iPad is
now available and I'll always tell
people to try this out at your own risk
because you know not all your apps may
work properly because guess what it's a
beta but if you're rocking an iPad pro
kind of like this guy right here
trust me it's really worth putting it on
there to really feel how the iPad
changes like come on you have your dock
here I can take a nap here I can bring
it up here split-screen that action app
on top of app that's that's just a
little peek but we'll have a more
in-depth video out this week I've been
poking around it but long story short
iOS 11 really does transform the iPad in
come on I love it
now the iPhone 8 has been rumored to get
its own fingerprint sensor embedded
directly into the front glass panel at
Mobile World Congress in Shanghai
Qualcomm announced its new fingerprint
sensor readers that can not only work
underneath your phone's display but
through metal and glass and even under
water now vivo showcased Qualcomm's new
technology at the show running on
prototype devices based on their vivo
x-play six phone Qualcomm expects the
first commercial device to use their
technology in early 2018 the new sensors
will also use ultrasonic scanning which
means they'll be able to detect a
person's heartbeat and blood flow as an
extra measure of security Hey
they said blood flow now it's also an
indicator that the tech is not only
around the corner but with Qualcomm
offering a solution it's likely that
Apple's figured this out on their own as
well for the new iPhone 8 now do any of
you want to get excited about a new
sound effect in iowa's xi like are you
that thirsty yeah honestly I know a lot
of you are check this out a new charging
sound discovered in iOS 11 by Max Plus
on YouTube could be the sound effect you
hear four wirelessly charging the iPhone
eight it's called engage power dot CAF
here's what the normal charging sounds
like first and here's what engaged power
sounds like oh did that just send
tingles up your spine or you know maybe
somewhere else in your body now let's
hear it again oh yeah I like that
now both the name and the sound of the
file indicate it's related as some kind
of charging
purpose but of course it's all
speculation at this point all right
earlier rumors claim the new iPhone 8
OLED 5.8 inch phone will have a
lightning connector with support for USB
C power delivery that enables faster
charging like the iPad pro Barclays
reports that the new iPhone will come
bundled with a 10 watt power adapter
with a USBC connector and faster USB C
power delivery compared to the current 5
watt iPhone power adapter and even the
12 watt iPad adapter that have the
slower USB 8 ports now if this is a real
move that's happening it's about time
and that would definitely deserve a good
effort
ok the future of Apple's Mac line could
be growing if you believe the latest
survey from Verto analytics in a survey
of 6,000 current PC owners aged 18 years
and older 21% of Windows laptop owners
and 25% of Windows desktop owners said
they were planning to switch to the Mac
in the next 6 months not surprisingly
the respondents with an average annual
income of you know $150,000 or higher
showed the highest likelihood of making
the switch in comparison in their survey
of Mac owners only two percent said they
were planning to switch in the next six
months all right now this week yes this
week is the 10th anniversary when the
iPhone first came out so I thought it
would be fun if we turn back the hands
of time and show you the first review
from C net of guess what the very first
iPhone hi I'm Ken Sherman senior editor
here at Zenith comm and vonabell and
we're here with our very first look at
the Apple iPhone it does have a
touchscreen it's a pretty unique on a
cell phone and there absolutely no
buttons except one right down here that
takes it back to the home menu heard a
lot about this virtual keyboard that
pops right up the only thing I was
concerned about though is I really would
like the keyboard to be displayed
horizontally like this we'll just look
at the photos so we'll select that
picture of Donald C there he is and
there's a nice zoom in and pinch your
fingers together and you can see the
picture it gets close but of course it's
just the iPhone it's all about music and
video in a lot of ways go over to Donald
now right you can find your music you
can turn it into landscape mode here you
can flip through your music using Cover
Flow
find a album you want to play double
click on it find the track you want to
play
on that and it's already playing it's a
great device I just wish it was a
standalone iPod it's wrong with the
phone the phones great but sometimes you
know you just just want to be a longer
these phones are good and that's your
very first look at the Apple iPhone oh
that's awesome like it's always fun
looking back at Kent German and Donna
Bell from those days and see you have to
imagine the technology was so advanced
that it took two people to do the video
review alright that's it for this week's
show you can email us at the Apple byte
at cnet.com or tweet me at Bryant ah you
know what hold on before we go can we
hear that power engage sound again this
tickles alright thanks so much for
watching we'll catch y'all next time for
another bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
