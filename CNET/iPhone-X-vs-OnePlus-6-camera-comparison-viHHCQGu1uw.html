with the camera on the iPhone intent
spec wise they're pretty close they have
a dual camera they record video in 4k
but that one is nearly half the price of
the iPhone 10 this is one plus 6 vs.
iPhone 10 you'll notice the oneplus has
a slightly wider field of view which
means you get more in the shot but it
starts to work the trees and buildings
around the edges of the shot the general
shots of landscapes and scenery the
photos on the iPhone tend to look
brighter with richer colors while the
oneplus looks dala with less color
saturation but that's not necessarily a
bad thing and of course you can always
adjust this later the oneplus is more
true to life as you can see in this
photo of a car on a foggy San Francisco
day it's the same with the murals the
iPhone makes them look better than they
were in real life which is probably how
you would edit it yourself but it's a
matter of preference the oneplus also
has a pro mode in the default camera app
that gives you more control over things
like ISO focus and white balance
with video the differences are more
pronounced video on the oneplus has a
lot of contrast than the changes in
light and movement aren't as smooth as
on the iPhone if you shoot at 60 frames
a second at either 1080p or 4k on the
oneplus it's relying only on optical
stabilization so you get a lot more
shaking
they both record slow motion at 240
frames per second in Full HD
the iPhones shot is a bit clearer and
smoother but the oneplus also gives you
a super slow motion option at 480 frames
per second at 720p which is pretty cool
and at 2x zoom the iPhone 10 really
pushes ahead the oneplus relies on
digital zoom while the iPhones telephoto
lens serves as an optical zoom to get a
clearer shot the same applies to zoom in
photos but in this situation the oneplus
actually holds its own side-by-side this
shot of the restaurant looks good on
both images and it's only when you crop
in on the labels that you can see how
much detail the iPhone is able to get
the iPhone 10 also uses the telephoto
lens for portraits which means you'll
get a narrower field of view when you're
in this mode with a lot more detail and
faces the oneplus has a second 20
megapixel lens dedicated to portraits so
it can get a much wider shot with that
blurred background effect which has a
more dramatic blur this works great when
you want to capture more than just a
face in general the iPhone is a bit more
accurate at discerning what to blur and
what not to blur but it's by no means
perfect and neither one nails the color
temperature the iPhone makes people look
slightly redder with more contrast while
the oneplus washes out skin tones so
this one is kind of a toss-up because
the results weren't always consistent
and it depends on what type of portraits
you're planning to take both also have
portrait mode on the front camera and
use software to create the blur but
getting the effect on the iPhone is
tough and when it does get it and well
see for yourself
the blur on the oneplus was more
consistent and looks sharper thanks to
that 16 megapixel camera versus the
iPhone 7 megapixel selfie camera I
prefer the warmer tones from the iPhone
but the wider angle on the oneplus lets
you fit more into the shot and the
oneplus doesn't flip your selfie like
the iPhone does so it's basically a
mirror image but for video it's the
opposite the oneplus gets a bit too
close for comfort and the contrast makes
it seem harsh while the iPhones image is
a bit more flattering both phones
produced shop photos with great colors
even in less than ideal lighting
situations some shots I prefer the one
Plus others the iPhone but there was no
clear winner in this category at least
instills video in low-light looks much
cleaner on the iPhone but neither have
great audio and if I had to choose one
I'd go with the iPhone as the one PLAs
can distort when it gets loud
the iPhone 10 wins for video and zoom
but the other categories aren't as clear
we love the oneplus 4 it's true to life
colors and it's wide-angle portraits but
the iPhone makes shots look more vibrant
and you get more detail in those
portraits what is clear is that the
camera on the oneplus is able to compete
at the same level and sometimes even
outperform the iPhone despite the price
difference so which one did you guys
pick as the winner leave us a comment
and let us know what else you want to
see us compare next and if you liked the
video please give it a thumbs up
