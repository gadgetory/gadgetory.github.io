Queens germs we're pretty wretched yeah

a an agenda today we're not gonna do the
news for obvious reasons we're drunk um
but we have sort of weight 550,000 Mac
zombie viruses have spread top story
that's the top stories and Tom Tom
worked on the line up right away any
footage I couldn't help himself put in
one little news story you really he's
got the line up on his screen because

screen show there are no other viewers

botnet I know right that's what I
thought when I saw this true you know my
bed totally gave me the perfect I love a
botnet so there you go there's a big one
and it's max and that is all new yeah
flashback trojan 550,000 machines all
max Oh max love it i hope part of it
don't be getting so cocky you and also
me windows had the same vulnerability
but it's plugged windows his fixed it
yeah Apple likes to do their own job
updates your own timeline I can't
believe really wonder why what is
happening right all right what's the
drink before damn it I know it's a great
bunch of clashes up talking to them cuz
it turns out with Tom and I get together
we talk about tech news which I'm so
starting in the first place everyone's
like all I want to talk about the news I
don't want to drink what's that I am
saying i wrote a column that said that
apple's standard operating procedures
we're not going to work around security
because you can't just you know be all
controlling about the pv 30 is in the
chat room by the way baby 30
watch girl calm bb30 create a PB 30 is
the reason that you have a live video to
watch he created a hot zone website with
a chat interface yeah we're
bootstrapping it boo totally at watch
bol calm just so he can be like they
really need to live stream this well
honestly I mean we were just putting
cameras up like hey we're gonna have a
little spy cam up while we record our
audio podcast in PB 30s like that's not
good enough I'm putting this on a page
you have a show now we were like a good
idea it would take us like seven to ten
months to get a website built in your
dreams and then it took a year and half
like it does yeah exactly and then
seeing it live was born and became the
home of many many podcasts which are now
going away oh but other things are
happening other things are happening yes
we'll get to those area Molly's area
exactly not the Molly situation yeah not
me that about them not that Molly I was
just in Spain they were rioting in the
streets over austerity measures right
greece in a really controlled and
well-behaved fashion that's the spanish
for you they're really good at is
they're going to take a nap they've had
a lot of practice yeah yeah I know they
love that kind of thing everybody
actually the chat room is up to seven
hundred and six people but it's so
awesome because all of them we're gonna
hear from a lot of guys later in the
show we have all this feedback in the
emails and the voicemails and stuff but
like dr. Carla's in their genome Ortiz
in their bj and then behind making about
dues that's behind me I have the bar but
also like some souvenirs which we're
going to get to later but this one yes
that's pretty swastik oh my gosh this is
a classic you guys we got to show you
this this is courtesy of the boys in
Boston MO and Vijay probably our most
possibly our most important listeners
and wakes I think Moe landed our first
sponsor press earthlink earthling gads
that's top secret that would hahaha I
wish we had the earthling can hardly had
earthly guy isn't there a hotdog add for
the cost of one hot dog for the coffee
one hot dog is you're really dead panin
we should get Charlie in here
he's on a shoot i think that morning but
for the first anniversary of buzz out
loud moe and vijay created a drinking
game very appropriate today we have
behind a bar so for the first
anniversary anytime we said cnet these
are the required drinks any time we said
cnet which was often one sip dmca three
sips I would never went away no no that
one did not go away DRM one set up
Google Microsoft or Apple once a few
interesting yeah that was that was a 16
or my crush and it's under required cuz
we said it so much yeah exactly really
Veronica yeah interesting uh slippery
slope yes one said that you know because
the progression goes from drm too
slippery slope every time mm-hmm well
it's a slippery slope which is
interesting you can tell how old this is
because snakes on a plane was one thing
that yep uh plane without snakes on a
meant you had to finish your drink cuz
every time we simply driessen's thanks
at a place apparently yahoo was two sips
and this i'll take credit for this one
yeah no yeah no that's okay no that's
all the required now the optional drinks
are really dating us yeah this is
serious business who if Veronica dis is
an apple product you have to have a
whole drink cuz it almost never happens
almost every kind of like beat on
everything well I rip on Apple I've
gotten a lot of modern yeah it's too
late the past few years so yeah it may
not happen as much it doesn't happen
Spotify is not a real powerful die for
you unless for me I have been fair and
honest I love Android you've been fair
and balanced I love you had like three
sips of champagne he's just like Jason
and I love reef okay Molly read Molly
ranting is 260 bust town and thank you
it's so hard to say goodnight oh
Albert Jim I should do the live show if
you have a boy at eleven o'clock on
thursday you can check out on the spot
I'm saying it on the spot nice work
everything the asian glow is coming in
already the asian girls already have oh
no this is horrid eoz just because Rouge
bonito like it was Veronica well it's
james hillier james Iliad first then
Veronica then Jason then Benito then
Stephen it's Joyce had a lot of
producers yeah uh Molly ranting all to
sailors along Molly rants 20 seconds or
more you finish your drink Veronica's
tivo woes finish your drink I'm still
having tea vamos aren't we all yeah yeah
and we still all own tivo still because
well he's gonna say yes I love you RT
it's a love-hate their tivo tivo yay if
Veronica said it was a stupid drink can
we drink to his his pun drank is there a
pun on the area Tom honey oh I'm getting
there I'm funnier actually it turns out
that a Tom pun is three sips so go ahead
and woman OH mm-hmm how's it gonna be a
problem mmm doggone oh man that's just a
meeting that dumb luckily we have a lot
more booze and actually there's three
bottles of courtesy of mark Larkin yeah
I said I said on internally showing it
was actually Dom so that's cool not the
change you'll get corrected early and
often I'm sure well actually if Veronica
says brains you finish your drink if tom
says don't open attachments that's half
a drink the well executed Tom style
segue by tom is three drink three sips
but a well-executed Tom style segue not
by Thomas foursomes oh no they thought
of everything huh well the Tom style
plan as we mentioned three sips of Tom
style pond not by tom is forceps mm-hmm
and one host missing is three sips aah
little did they know right on every
minute yet you were drinking a lot this
is a year there you're drinking every
day
yesterday that was a this has been in my
office ever since it arrived oh and
here's Donald oh speaking of what
happens when one host is missing here's
Donald Bell everyone perfect what is the
seventh one missing yay dibell taken
behind Jason right now but pops get a
lot slower I know this the chair works
you're eating not me though I'm
perfectly fine so for the new people do
you think there are people who don't
know how does this show any first time
you will talk about yes I'm very origin
say oh there's burst in the chat room if
you're afraid give the origin so don't
like your first over the origins time
where it all began let's start with our
creation myth shall we you will Cooley
by the way for those of you who are
asking i think is in new york at the new
york auto show so i don't know if he's
gonna make it in but maybe he can call
i'll send him an email okay um while tom
tells our creation myth you with the
creation myth no not really what the
meteor fell to see you today and we ate
our children and then um yeah well the
the origins were disparate but there
were a couple of people actually more
than I don't remember all of them but I
know for sure that myself and james kim
were both talking about podcasting as it
had just started to get you know some
mindshare people out they were actually
doing it and aware of it source code was
a all that sort of thing so we had a
meeting I remember and whatever that
conference room is with the big round
table and if it's down on the fourth
floor and it's like a big round table
that took up almost the entire room
Thunder Thunder Thunder yeah thunder and
and it was I think was Larkin Molly
myself James candy Meyers I can't move
there were other people in there but we
were talking about starting new stuff
and of course buzz report I think was
already buzzer part hazard underwear on
its yeah was already decided though and
so Larkin was like well I want to do an
audio version of buzz report as a
podcast but I think Molly talking alone
is probably you know not interesting
when you foil and he thought he thought
that Molly and I had good conversations
and that that might be a good idea for
the show is to say we just do what you
guys do once a week for five or ten
minutes you just each of you come with
story and you know just have your
conversations and that'll be the show
cuz Tom had just started I had just come
back to seen it actually cuz I left for
a little while and was book editing over
at o'reilly books are long you attended
the whole thing I beg Cena to take me
back and Tom had then recently been
hired as my boss and we were like going
to lunch all the time and have any sort
of fun lunch conversate pretty much what
we do on the show is exactly what was
happening right in rehab and Mark was
like I want you to do that thing you do
at lunch and for audio and then we got
in here and it was totally awkward weird
we were terrible we did how many we did
two or three shows that were never put
out and our mask my my hard drive that I
had them on crashed and they were not on
the server when I looked for the
thousandth episode so I don't know if
anyone has the maybe candy Meyers does
but I I couldn't even find episode one
that where March they're doing plenty of
the March 30th one like there's plenty
of summaries of it I have it we talked
about Comdex you have it yeah we I do
know that we talked about Comdex I had
just gotten back from Japan and talked
all about like it's a it's online if you
go the bol Wiccan it was I thought could
still get to it I think cuz I played it
yes let's see let me look on it and ride
alone in a corner of a room and one of
them I was like man I've heard this
thing so off i could say word for word
toy Japanese toilets see hold on i'm
gonna try to find it cuz i really do
believe you said that right oh he's from
Boston just said he found a link to the
image of the drinking game for those who
uh oh sweet oh it is there to download
awesome I'm such a loser one of the best
things in the entire world by the way is
the buzz out loud wiki totally
fan-created yes really the best thing
about this show like the only reason
russof that this show ever happened it
was town most impressive most impressive
all right i'm gonna put this in the chat
room for you Steve creddie yeah where
your segway still but i'm not in your
first episode your segways we're still
money worth day no i don't think i had
any segways I remember the first episode
we recorded that was never put out the
feedback was Tom talks too much he needs
to let Molly talk more what reality is
that it
oh no only a long time ago good friends
like oh I don't think that happen daily
bud I'm timer I've grown a lot of the
real it is yeah here's the first hey I'm
back it up first episode hi I'm Molly
Wood author of the buzz report and the
daily buzz and I'm Tom Merritt peanuts
out there the real deal you give us
about 10 minutes every week or so we're
going to give you our take on what's
happening in tech news this week ok what
we gonna talk about this week well I'm
gonna start with Comdex actually and
then I want to give a little time to
toilets coming out of Japan really
unusual but they got some good memory
mala oh yeah that's all you have grown a
lot I guess it was out here so much more
there I print out yeah obviously they
sound honestly to me they sounded really
excited to do the show all right all
right well what do you want oh who knows
let's talk it was FM radio was a
different time no you were there we were
young and terrified James Hilliard was
sitting there staring at it he really he
really killed the children out of the
show he hated it he would read a
newspaper he literally recorder he just
absolutely hated it he batters he's
admitted it is like I didn't think this
was gonna go right yeah we're not
bashing him in absentia he is fully
touch the thousands episodes the reason
why he's here today guys there wasn't a
whole lot to producing the show back
then though right there wasn't like an
intro music communal it was like
pressure cuore di your levels are set
all right i'm gonna read this new I
just won't rattle it loud loud enough to
cope so true oh my god hilarious all
right let's see let's see how we sound
right around and putting this in the
chat room for you Steven let's see how
we sound right around episode 200 what
kind of progress we've made by then I
think I'm pretty good episode 200 listed
by the way as a notable episode custom
out of Ember why was it because people
uh Apple was letting people boot XP on
their intel-based Macs oh yeah that was
fun boot camp yeah the rise of boot camp
how long was on was i stoled high school
you weren't even born yet episode that
was Wednesday oh my gosh it's an
anniversary episode april fifth two
thousand six why wow you put it in that
was our first ever april fifth act soon
I've missed it okay ready here comes
numerologists you can put it in the dock
right oh do you want me to put in the
docks even yeah yeah that's probably
wiser the tower was like what's going on
here hold on hold on I'm almost at the
very top you should also play line 27 in
the dock at some point oh yes so we're
totally building the show it's awesome
we're building a ship now what are your
pretty drunk this podcast brought to you
by earthlink anniversary show and then
we'll go on to some of the other it's
Wednesday March if it's 2006 I'm
Hollywood and i'm veronica belmont

the new cell phones although it didn't
sound like there were gonna be a ton of
awesome new announcement actually I've
heard from a few different people
actually Molly welcome come on now
alright scrub ahead okay I'm sure we
started having fun scrub a hug well done
on what you're thinking because I was
like ginormous I mean the news com story
like when up first thing this morning
and already has 175 comments like people
have so much to say about it I was very
surprised when I went to my to my feets
this morning it's surprising news yeah
it was what's going on yeah I have to
admit I was like wait what or if you're
not see that coming okay let's do a
little personal planner surprised if
you're really lazy and you want to be
pretty surprised by that I was shocked
watch my voice inflection always makes
you something work said right I was
shocked when that thing happened I'm
assuming that that is the bootcamp
announcement but either way I'm sure
yeah it's so fun the notable episodes
I'm sure are very notable but let's be
honest there was only one that stands
alone is the most epic episode of all
time in fact Tom suggested that we don't
even bother with doing this show the
weeds have Steven
when introduced episode 1000 and then we
just step out and drink this is only one
in the room was it on it so we gotta
work him in so he can do the like
commentary color commentary and I was
pretty amazing alright let's look at
let's look at a little bit of that where
is that is that on the docket yeah it's
in the dock ok youtube there maybe you
guys have that grand entrance where you
walked through the wing ways of cnet
that's just the episode title from wait
wait I think that's just like hold on I
gotcha I gotcha I gotcha hold on put it
next to the last one you just put in so
what was the first the first video is
when you guys did snakes on the plane is
that right yeah I think it's our first
video says I Wittering on yeah I have
that right there that was our first
Thursday august seventeenth 2006 oh dear
I'm Hollywood I'm so Monica Belmont
welcome to buzz out loud units podcast
may determine like snakes on a plane in
addition modeling we are actually at the
theater as you can see we're here to be
interviewing people about snakes on a
plane and of course seeing the movie
that became the internet phenomenon I'll
look the mama beardozer you talk first
people here say it's not a big lawyer
happening it's not sneaking outside so
so does make it down a large line forms
we will be interviewing people in mind
asking them basically how they heard
about the movie whether it was like on
the internet is it good is it bad or is
this a better meme than a movie does
anybody actually really want to see this
isn't that on purpose this is just a fun
concept to play with we're gonna find
out and then of course we're gonna go to
the movie which may or may not cause
Veronica to crawl under her seat and cry
we'll let you know in our doctor movie
review yeah I'm actually a little bit
worried but I have two people to grab on
to so I think I'll be all right that's
right so stick with us we'll be here all
night all right let's go find some
people come on as I remember oh that
really wasn't better that was like the
worst experience ever like there was I
mean it wasn't really but there was like
remember we thought that it was just
gonna be this big huge amazing awesome
nerd premiere it was so this
there were some people there eventually
but online is this this where you became
familiar with the difference between the
real world and the internet world it was
there was like a rude awakening it's not
we were shocked also it's okay already
how was the movie I never actually saw
it I know it's great my favorite part is
when the snake what are the new people
like making out in the bathroom and thus
they just jumped at him bit that chicken
let you know what it was like whoa I
remember that scene was horrified a
scary said that tell me you're like okay
this is yeah crazy I'm glad I had these
mother I'm pretty sure the the edited
for TV versions better than the actual
movie though you think so audience mad
monkey fight and snakes on this monday
to friday plane was awesome so awesome
oh my god that oh my god uh yes nice
monkey boys that was quite the outing
and it up by the way it's okay chat room
you can say whatever you want about the
hair because i know we all we all would
I know it's better now nice are proud of
our hair in that video Tommy look pretty
good there running my own hair Burke
said I looked fat that was like that wow
I did who said that let's see what they
look like I look yeah I know daddy's
well I look 19 why yeah I like nine
times your size in that video because
the weird camera angle yeah yeah that's
not no shocker I don't do side bangs
looks like a hop in there you look
adorable you do look like a hobbit
though this is why I always go out and
change with Charlie cooler than me you
put Molly time unbeknownst a lot of
people Molly Tama Jason earth really
toasted peanut calm in the building
that's true that also happened to be
seen at T so it's not on earth yeah yeah
pretty much yeah i mean its own
everybody looks like a hobbit that was a
fun night though that was one of our
first like one sheet show and we didn't
do a lot of those know i know we should
have done more but we did the show every
freaking day for that point so it's kind
of hard to do anything else turns up
except for like the five other videos
that we did every week yeah right
we always wanted this we always wanted
this to be the full time job like that
was we always knew that that was the
only way to make it the show that it
could be but that's just not how the
world works everyone podcasting is hard
work I'm casting is hard work and fun
work that also a really hard job coming
up with episode titles jarrah hell I
know Carol I was just saying me it
wasn't very hard chennai or do it yeah I
core I as I core is and AJ an Asian oh
yeah yeah yeah yeah I think I core
probably has the the the record whole
can record for most king of time title
episodes generated but there's
apparently like a whole selection of
YouTube videos that are based on
thousand episode episode title how cool
yeah there's a mission impossible in
anima government can we look at this
yeah no no
he caught the dual fabrication his
favorite picture won't take a min
oh yeah I told ya these were title
sequences that people worth a thousand
for the thousand episode not title
suggestions I want to watch more of them
I know well we have more yeah there's a
MacGyver 12 hey you wanna see the mayor
let's do it oh you guys are so good yeah
I remember I've seen this one is for by
Kelvin
huh
listen
oh my god
haha thanks a lot frozen keep up
Wow over that time I kinda show for the
studio with that weird triangle uh yeah
I remember that actually stumbled across
some of the ustream videos coming from
our individual computers and it was even
awkward watching those like it was such
an awkward situation it's strange how
much this room kind of shapes the type
of conversation and the the feel of the
show we moved it into there and you know
you had the same components but it's
just different just felt very different
being in that studio yeah why was that
less weird yeah lessons I did a show I
didn't dig it I don't know what was
wrong with the acoustics or something it
just something that's dead well yeah you
were disembodied you weren't facing each
other directly because that weird
triangle shape and then you also had you
know people like all right you know we
need to follow you with the camera shots
and all you know this other stuff around
where's when we came in here especially
at the beginning uh it was like so braga
run on the board to people talk go easy
right no thinking that was like bringing
camera there's no thinking Tom to work
what's not an ad around being in this
room that is talking about what you end
up talking about their it ended up being
a show that is produced but different
than the way it's produced now because
it's produced now but it's produced
around that kind of haphazard freeform
kind of go with the flow way and that in
that room you almost felt like it had to
be produced like you know some of the
other shows that were very scripted and
stuff you know yeah this is like safe
space feel like we always we get in here
and you just feel like you can say
whatever you want listening and yeah and
you're used to be in here and we're used
to being here look I have this cool
video if you guys give me a studio tour
of this room it's always short usually I
usually see the chat room it's great
it's like pre sure I'd show you the
studio's Trojan be there's me there's a
whole bunch of stuff that I never touch
Jeanne with an o le / le ya know doesn't
ever touch here's my webcam from
downtown not anymore yeah so this is a
bunch of gear that is preset it's all
mic preamps stuff that make the mic
sound oh so delicious and we have such
all watch over all set properly yeah
oh that's right I got a lot of lag I
think this is where the
over-the-shoulder kind of camera angle
ended up getting figured out for when we
went to video right here out the window
looking on and goose ooh that's kind of
a a nifty camera angle yeah Eureka I can
feel I guess it was my leg has you still
over my leg the leg the leg legendary
well and any if you wanted to actually
watch our video you had to be a true fan
because you had to know that you had the
three video players up any mute two of
them and you only let the audio through
on one of them and you knew the newbies
because they'd come in they'd be like an
audio is echoing all over the place
what's wrong with this you to the video
players here okay yeah a cow a cow man
going to video was rough we also have
fun journey to it was a fun journey
actually I remember I remember the first
time actually I got an email about not
wearing enough makeup on the video yeah
like you don't make yourself up I still
remember it yeah there it is Tom like
nine times what don't make yourself up
like you used to because we were doing
those individual cameras and as we
mentioned earlier PV 30 put them
together a page bb30 was like well do
folks want to like talk to each other
while they're watching them because all
the ustream chat rooms are separate and
i found the forum link where he proposes
the idea uh last night it had actually
just bubbled up to the top of the bol
forums oh really yeah cuz they're like
missing in do you have that one even
Adam galaxy thirties a link that he just
put in there it's a more complete watch
bol with all the players where is that
in video here I got it I'll throw
everything that's Matt that's awesome
we're gonna put them on whatever place
dia one at the top did we do a video
when I was still here do you see it was
that before that februari 2708 wow PB 30
thanks for posting that in that's the
most complete version of it I've seen
because even the the one on archive.org
is is yet missing all the graphics right
oh that's amazing dude PV 30 we're
pretty much nothing without you buddy
yep see ya every 27 28 he's
a sub know I've set up a page where you
can view all three cams and chats on one
page after my thinking and feedback from
some users I've added a unified chat
option that uses a standard IRC room and
I'm looking for feedback for those who
watched chat during the live show would
you prefer a single chat over using two
or three chats what type of chat do you
prefer IRC meebo others that's red with
that basically that seen it fans is born
that's it yeah exactly and then they're
like they there's a whole list of the
features that they eventually want and
then over time I mean it took a long
time write like a year and a half I
think for us to fully steel and
implement that idea mm-hmm is our
showroom today say hi arm today hi room
and everyone's like maybe 30 genius I
know I do need to send you haven't aged
one bit really since like 1998 yes yes
so I'm yahoolive was the first site that
we used that's right it was yahoo like
that that cuz we tried it on sword and
laser and it does not work it did not
work there was no storage of video at
that point right they weren't storing at
the motor facilitating live that's too
bad hmm be awesome to see that first one
mm-hmm we also had short-lived meetups
we had this all like me the initiative
how we were gonna have meetups it was
gonna be the thing and would but even
meetups are hard and then it sort of
started out like Mark was like oh yeah
we're going to fund that we can we got
money for meet ups like okay we don't
have as much money as we thought but we
had a couple and so then Tom found I
assume was you Tom the flicker sets the
flickr slideshow of bol photos yeah
South by Southwest even even like last
couple years out by Southwest a contest
we did the photo show yeah sure that's a
no yeah they're here they're all here
look at that ok Sean look Jason I know
hey ladies i'm putting that on my web
come to me i'm not hearing anything this
guy's saying right now has appeared
that's a good idea which one was that
where is that look at South by Southwest
like three years ago right so that was a
freighter that was like after I took my
little bit my little break and I'm not
gonna lie
so mad that Tom Munro and Natalie went
to uh it's hard to say Tom and without
saying Veronica at the end that Natalie
went to South by Southwest I was like
what I've never done that before was my
own fault by the way the 2nd US Circuit
Court of Appeals just reversed the
judgment in favor of youtube so Viacom
can carry on their case you're kidding
me dmca drink well I need more I'm
already pretty messed up guys to judge
panel said now YouTube might have had
actual knowledge brandy Herman Tom bring
it back like a FYI guys by the way let's
talk about why we're really here the
news the important news we have possibly
caused out loud alright everybody else
whiskey bourbon or brandy why'd you put
more slide show up if you want our oh my
god put more slide show our slideshow
bourbon if cooley were here we'd have
the good bourbon but he's in New York
bro rude he's the only one who can buy
it I could have rest of us are underage
my kid is sick he didn't take it with
him you gotta lose well I didn't do it
either no his office is locked i was
like damn ohs haha oh oh Steven a little
pick-me-up Lynn says hello to everyone
by the way yeah that's right do it yeah
tongs tongs taking a break though we're
gonna have some water heavy again hi
roll your chair out of here well my
mouth will be smelly foods it's an
antiseptic it's two o'clock in the
afternoon when Lindsay came in with the
cake Lindsay our boss by the way she was
like oh no it's okay I don't think
either way you're pouring it really
smells like booze anymore it always did
we there's something about it you can
open one beer in here
the whole room smells very small not
very well there's no air no yes there's
no ventilation no air we repainted
finally like whatever you're in Africa
looks nice I like the blue yeah yeah I
like you all right what else happened so
we've had let's do like I'm not mad
drunk I swear let's do a caboose quiet a
couple more super old school links here
and then we'll get to like some viewer
favorite moments talk about the
evolution the new hosts all that stuff
um but this is amazing in addition to
the bol photos Tom found I can't believe
we found this I can't believe it still
there oh gee the original buzz out loud
page still exists somewhere on the cnet
servers with the god awful picture and
the green and the yellow wow the whole
thing and it's it and whoever coated it
did a good job with the feed because
it's still Curren episode 23 okay yeah
that is great look I know it's like it's
a good this jar is ok it doesn't even
look like you Wow I know it what do I
decide you look like Tatum Channing
Tatum O'Neal demonio that's right
Channing Tatum tat Tatum O'Neal's when I
met Channing Tatum is that anonymous
muscle person that turns you on now
subscribe now really doesn't look like
Utah there's something about now I know
Italy shadow I don't know it's the
weirdest photo ever send us buzz it is
though you're totally right it's pretty
close no it goes to 1292 so it's not
total it's not all the way up to date
wow that's amazing Wow the YouTube group
did you remember our chai KU channel yes
do you remember our frapper mad rapper
man yes you that's how i found that page
i was searching for flapper disease
there was like some cached version out
there and it that was one of the search
results because it's embedded in that
page still even though there's no
frapper she was never not shut up
remember this
that was our early social network was
like Joey laughs so we pitched at the
end of every show I made perfect sense a
geographically based in social network
they do a dog category you're here demel
is an audience was we're like can't talk
right now rappers not even a thing maybe
more definitely not everything was very
well because cross colours were very hot
during that time remember cross colours
colours green yellow Oh cross colours i
get was hit way back in the day man but
God frapper and we would be nothing
without the audience really like when
you look at this it's all this is all
audience generated stuff from the
wikipedia entry to the the eventual wiki
you guys have been to the wiki it's just
it's unbelievable it's just like all of
the episodes pretty much with a with a
summary like a history of notable events
complaining about the you kind of sound
like a public radio announcer and if you
call in now we'll send you a great tote
bag you gotta visit the week have you
callin now I'll promise to send you
something that I never said how many
people didn't get stickers a lot my god
I gotta roll I got five thousand I a
sticker roll you wouldn't believe it's
just this huge thing my kid take
something over everything but I actually
I brought presents for everyone ah
everyone gets at least a page you are
old these are the old ones you've had
that many just hiding in your office
whole time I've been saving them I don't
know like I would have been like we
should give those rehydrate the pre
pipe red ball these were from uh and the
engineers your life yes I think the PI
plus years yeah yeah so everybody
wondering where you go well we'll try to
send out some stickers to like our
hardest core fans right what do you do
MLS what are the OG bust ballers feel
about the pipe do you like the piper you
dislike the pipe oh I I always liked the
pipe I missed the pipe I actually
thought the pipe list logo didn't look
that bad but you look that bad but the
pipe one has a lot more character too
yeah Veronica geelong my denim you know
i get i get actually really annoyed when
I see the pipe written in text about
cnet that always drives me crazy oh yeah
whenever perform at it yeah I'm like no
it's just you don't need to put the pipe
in the purpose for the logo I like right
you like pipe I like carpet I hated it
when they still available I love later
okay good I know it's only like you guys
haven't seen a condom tell me I have I
just forgot about that one I just Rolly
remembered lamp because the rest was too
traumatic um I put another link in the
very top of the doc just now Stephens
working harder than he's ever had to
work today as producer and then there's
this one right here what do you pause
this but we're drunk and exciting but
you guys remember spectacle Oh practical
fest how did that start oh it was
because III was getting smaller that's
right and we said talked about the
spectacle of it yeah I'm more spent that
nerd tacular is what spectacle fest it
kind of is should have turned it that
way yeah spectacle fest oh we were so
funny uh there is a we thought we were
so we thought you're so funny there's a
whole there's a flicker discussion and
why there's no pictures of that that
lady Veronica what's from march two
thousand six why exactly are there no
pictures of Veronica the podcast lady
doing the podcast or any pictures
whatsoever except that one that is on
the frapper flicker and cnet itself
three pictures does anyone else care
about this but me and then Veronica
answers well no I'm not camera shy but
before the podcast I wasn't doing
anything to warrant a picture on the
website I just do production but we are
going to make a video podcast soon sit
tight I base and we did Dave Moyer uh
Dave Moira's still he still comments on
stuff and yeah he's still around you
guys was about our porch a trip is like
you guys we're having to go to meetings
because hollyhock I will keep it moving
a little bit ah Veronica had a
squeaky-clean wonderful image up until
oh no done done done
as Tom Tom called it the pre-show that
shall be not shall not be named gonna
have to skip ahead to find the handle
balsa do I guess studio 60 s ratings are
tanking this is like Alicia really yeah
yeah totally and also Tracy Morgan I got
you on recording saying that hotel
Eileen knows she knows Joan Jett
Chrissie Hynde and cafes could you be in
a punk rock I don't think Joan Jett's
interested dude no I know but you know
this is my little list yeah yeah it
doesn't matter gotcha Jake Gyllenhaal
yeah hmm pretty I think maybe also he is
not interested that's the sense i get
from the blog that's all it could be
true that none of those there's no okay
I hope you're insinuating that he's he's
gay and that I'm not stupid and ugly
damn I obviously only option they say he
may be gay he's not well he wasn't
premier he wasn't that gay magazine you
could turn him I don't know yes I could
they I'm just saying but we sort of you
oh that was awesome so good it's so sad
lately our conversations are entirely on
you right now I know what what about
nano balls I didn't get all of nano
balls unfortunately anything wrong with
nano all right it's Wednesday oh hello
it is lost premiere day oh yes it is pop
yes it's awesome I think that we just
bleep ever keep going that was a
terrible bleep is up to do with a baby I

one little al-imam we got oh there's
more we r HD DVR I started saying that

warcraft episode oh my god is that man 2
yeah and yeah I am America's next top
model tonight is a total TV cluster and
you know what about that yeah this is uh
emailed me is like or comment about it
is the law but they can't give you the
channels yes so what I was like that's
not what I was thinking about I was
bitching about the fact that in the room
in the bat masking that was where she
said yeah totally wow that was like a
three f bomb episode yeah well it wasn't
an episode that was the demo so
technically we have died Natalie got
published I mean Tong and I have done
some things in pre-show oh awesome thing
that was said something I was sure I was
fired I was sure that I were always sure
you're saying the show lost mmhmm yeah
it did love how long was that out in the
baby before I was like half an hour yeah
and I that's enough time for a mind yeah
well we got an email from a dad who was
like I listen to the show with my kids
and I can't believe that you like this
kind of language whatever why have you
changed so much and blah and I was like
what happened what happened what
happened what did i do what did i do and
then i went back and listened and I just
everything went black in my mind like I
was like boom wombley all the blood rush
to my head my rants Tom's office and I
was like something happened I did I did
something I would be fired I was like
well first let's fix it yeah yeah I
think I had already fixed it you're like
okay I've already tested and then but I
made us go talk to Bonnie again cuz you
were so I was crying so much I was like
really on the ball I was sure I was like
yeah yeah buddy was like we don't have
it and then mark was like that's not
gonna happen again right now sick no no
it's not gonna happen again except by me
that having like nine times I think I
said it on the actual show oh you see
you in here the memory I said after him
you said f to me yeah were you baited me
I he told me we're like I think it was a
computer love thing it was a computer
laughing something the chauvinistic or
until you were like give me a sample
something totally showing istic like get
me a sandwich sudo get me a sandwich how
you can say pseudo pseudo get me a
pseudo sandwich pseudo be uh uh pretty
soon we're going to come into the future
but we asked you guys for some of your
favorite moments and there's two
especially and then we're gonna get to
your video voicemails which are epic but
Justin from San Diego sent in this is
truly awesome one of my favorite my
all-time favorite buzz moments was Tom
and Veronica's dramatic reading of the
bunnies made out of cheese quantum
stories years ago it's at the very end
of this episode so probably like a
conclusion fired up and we're gonna
listen to the entire if you want to get
a hold of us go to our webpage it's
really easy bol dot see any tea got de
lam that's the all the ways you can play
all the ways you can call yeah it's
right it's enough that it's yeah so keep
going I'm gonna you're right dance
monkey Stephen dance this is a dramatic
reenactment of the bunnies made of
cheese posting from Chad or zills
uncertain principal's blog the dog is
standing at the window wagging her tail
excitedly I look outside in the backyard
is empty what are you looking at bunnies
made of cheese there are no bunnies out
there and there are certainly not
anybody's made of cheese backyard is
empty but particles are created out of
empty space all the time right have you
been reading my quantum physics books
again it's boring here when you're not
home anyway answer the question well yes
in a sense they're called virtual
particles and the zero-point energy of
the vacuum can occasionally manifest as
particle antiparticle pairs see bunnies
made of cheese you're wagging your tail
I'm not sure how that helps you the
virtual particles that are created from
a vacuum fluctuation have to annihilate
in a very short time in order to satisfy
the energy time uncertainty relationship
so like a virtual electron-positron pair
last something like 10 to the negative
20 seconds before it disappears they're
not real particles but they can become
real right I mean what about the Hawking
radiation you're smart for a dog well
yeah in a sense the idea is that a
virtual pair created near the event
horizon of a black hole can have one of
its members sucked into the black hole
which point the other particle zips
often become any yeah we get energy to
accompany somewhere I needed a nap yeah
bunnies made of cheese what look virtual
particles are created all the time right
that was the part I was waiting for
honey yes cheese and talk cheesecake
mouth to replace some voicemail yeah we
should but first I think we should play
these damn looters the whole day you say
cuz Dan looters is the guy who like luda
POTUS a new music and I had your musical
work right so he sent an email and he
said I wanted to send this farewell
video and then two songs from past shows
one of which includes you tongue and is
awesome so let's let's do all those and
then we'll get to the video voicemail
first this is bol bye bye it was crude
and looters here just want to take a
moment say thank you for all the years
of tech fun and laughs oh and not to
mention rants love the show best wishes
to your future and we'll see you very
soon bye bye love leaders love looter
I've never seen what he looked like I
have either no she honest he's got that
slick hair action going on like no he is
the nicest guy actually got to meet him
who look like you'd the round a year ago
and he's just but he's as good as his
music oh he is really like he's he is
like the driving force behind the the
catchy tunes on a lot of podcasts on the
net these days he's awesome so then he
did these two songs for us which you
probably remember the first was the
Molly rant blues
oh yeah I keilana me
apple-iphone copy on my pants man i need
a Molly ranchi we go
I love the ending it out and punch you
right in the face I mean really for
crying out loud how hard is this it's
not that hard it's not hard oh my god</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
