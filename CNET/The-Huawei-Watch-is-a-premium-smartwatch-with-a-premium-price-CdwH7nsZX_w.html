design standpoint it's one of if not the
nicest Android wear watches that we have
seen to date it features a stainless
steel body that feels premium in hand
and looks even better when worn on the
wrist
the 42 millimeter display is protected
by sapphire crystal which is a first for
Android wear and it should make it a lot
harder to scratch the watch includes a
heart rate monitor and also a sixth axis
motion sensor for tracking steps
distance and calories burned but aside
from the design it really doesn't do
anything special sure it includes Wi-Fi
but there's no GPS cellular capabilities
or NFC from mobile payments while we did
include more than 40 customizable watch
faces but for the most part this is like
every other Android wear device it can
display personalized Google now cards on
your wrist and show things like text
messages emails and calls from your
smartphone to charge the watch you
connect it to a special magnetic dock
it's not as convenient as say the Moto
360 is a wireless charging but it gets
the job done the battery is set to last
up to two days which is about the same
as other Android wear watches and the
Apple watch but it's much shorter than
other smartwatches like the pebble time
the Huawei watch also isn't cheap you
can choose from a silver black or even a
rose gold plated model with either a
leather strap a link bracelet or a mesh
band that reminded me a lot of the Apple
watch prices start at $349 for the
silver model with a leather strap and go
all the way up to $800 for the rose gold
model with a gold link band for more
information including a full rundown on
the specs prices and features check out
my article over at cnet.com you can also
reach out to me on Twitter with any
questions or comments I'm dan Graziano
for Cena and that was a first look at
the Huawei watch
