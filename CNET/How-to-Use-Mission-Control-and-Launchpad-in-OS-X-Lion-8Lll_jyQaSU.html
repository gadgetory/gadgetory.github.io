you'll notice that a lot of things have
changed some snow leopard Mission
Control and launch pad are new and they
both use a bunch of new gestures I'm
Sharon Vaknin and today I'll show you
how to navigate these new features and
get to know the new trackpad to get
started you can open Mission Control by
going to your desktop and swiping up
with three fingers this does two things
it scatters all your open windows so
that you can easily select one and
you'll see your dashboard desktop full
screen apps and desktop spaces across
the top mouse over the top right corner
and you'll see a plus sign clicking this
adds a new desktop space which you can
use as an extra desktop so for example
you can have a desktop for your
documents a desktop for your games and a
desktop for your web browsing you can
switch between these desktops and full
screen apps by going back to Mission
Control or by swiping right and left
with three fingers from any screen if
you want to get rid of a desktop just
reopen Mission Control hover over the
space you want to close and click the X
there are a few tweaks for Mission
Control in your settings go to System
Preferences than Mission Control one
setting you might want to change is
automatically rearranged spaces based on
most recent use if you uncheck it the
desktops and full screen apps will be
arranged in the order they were opened
Launchpad is another new feature that
gives you a tiled view of all your apps
for easy launching pull in with three
fingers and your thumb to open it up if
you have an iDevice the setup will look
really familiar to open an app you only
have to click once you can also organize
your apps into folders to create one
just click and drag one app over another
your map will automatically choose a
name for the folder but you can change
it by clicking on it and entering your
own from here you can add more apps by
dragging them in and remove apps by
opening the folder and dragging the
icons out to exit launchpad push three
fingers and your thumb you can do the
same gesture whenever you want to get a
clean view of your desktop just pull
back in to bring you
windows back Launchpad and Mission
Control will take some getting used to
but once you've mastered the gestures
you might find that they actually make
your computer a lot easier to navigate
there are about a dozen more new
gestures in lion that you can learn by
going to system preferences then
trackpad just hover over one of the
gestures and you'll get a handy video of
how it works some of the gestures like
Mission Control can be changed and all
of the gestures can be disabled if you
don't feel comfortable pinching and
pulling at your computer just yet if you
have any questions feel free to ask them
