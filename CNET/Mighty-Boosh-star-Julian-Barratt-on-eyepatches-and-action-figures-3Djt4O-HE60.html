you have to be twice as good an actor
how do I look like you need some help
too late I walk alone did you bring much
of yourselves down to Richard duncroft
the idiosyncratic actor the actor whose
past his prime and sort of slightly lost
so yes in that way but I hope you
balding and yeah I was a real stress to
him to get there um I yes I did I got a
lot on our all we're all it come &amp;amp; fab
decisions away from being Richard conk
rotten yeah not too far away and it was
a fun character to play because he's a
he he lives in a lot of denial about the
modern world and his love blind spots
hmm lots of blind spots or just one big
glass of a nice book with with an
eyepatch yeah so he's on half of his
blind spot you can't even see I'm
prepared actual place yeah you can't
hide the truth from mine talk only took
us about two hours to write it but it
took ten years to get the finances
together that's not true is it
we were quite bad at pitching it so yes
sort of tape you think girl he was a
joke on mine talk that guy with a bionic
eye 25 years later he's on a picture
machine they can't run the olive had so
you get thrown out actually after the
island man bit so what the things about
the film was always the kind of dill the
memorabilia like the action figure in
the board games the annuals of stuff
what was like being immortalized in
plastic um yes it was interesting I mean
I I didn't keep any of those dolls that
I was tempted but I know there's a bad
curse that if you take some tiny
effigies of yourself in the film use
that truly enough and you don't know you
can you can yeah you can wake up in the
night and it can be sitting on your
bedside table looking at you but it's
bigger actually figure so something you
were in Road one yes to live there made
a kind of digital representation of your
face today well they did that they sort
of have all these cameras on it they
take information required to make an
action figure of blue five already so
that is somewhere on a disk somewhere so
you have two different expressions and
they so they have did you do all four
I did was only three isn't it right and
but I'm Eiling sad and useful though
because we can use information if like
we only do a sequel and maybe you died
or something then it can be build you
and I can hear still do it we can
rebuild him
well holiday might be it could not go we
could be a detective with his hologram
mate but it would it was a holiday like
it would it would have no soul so what's
what's next for for Richard on Croft the
doctor who's using recruiting over who
yeah
yes and yes Doctor Who it's of course
not interesting you know via campaign
for Richard throne Croft you play Doctor
Who absolutely
and I gotta do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
