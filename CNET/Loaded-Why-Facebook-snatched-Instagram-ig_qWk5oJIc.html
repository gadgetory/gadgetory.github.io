Carey on cnet com and it's time to get
loaded Facebook has forked over 1
billion dollars to buy Instagram a
social network for photography and it's
left many in the tech community asking
just how did that happen instagram has
no revenue has been around for less than
two years with about a dozen employees
so how does a photo app get valued that
highly the LA Dodgers cost two billion
dollars is Instagram half the cost of a
baseball franchise well some analysts
say that the deal is made because
Facebook sees Instagram as a threat and
spent a cool billion to keep the threat
under control Instagram is a pretty big
network there are more than 35 million
registered users uploading more than 5
million photos a day in total more than
a billion photos have been uploaded so
when you look at those numbers it's
clear Instagram is stealing away photo
sharing traffic that could have gone to
Facebook but Facebook isn't killing the
service Instagram will remain a separate
network and app for now but despite
those promises Instagram users have
cried out online upset about the
purchase many say they use Instagram to
get away from Facebook and if this means
Facebook has the rights of their photos
they will unsubscribe from the service
Instagram grew popular for its color
filters that made cell phone photos look
aged in retro users were then able to
share those photos to the Instagram
network or other social networks
Instagram was named Apple's iPhone app
of the year in 2011 bestbuy CEO has
resigned and will step down from the
Board of Directors in a press release
best buy said there were no
disagreements between CEO Brian done and
the retailer and that it was a mutual
agreement done started that best buy
back in 1985 as a store associate and
was named CEO in 2009 director Mike
McCann has been named the interim CEO
bus by recently announced it was closing
50 stores laying off 400 workers and
focusing on smaller boutiques to sell
mobile phones the top 4 mobile carriers
are partnering with the Federal
Communications Commission to create a
Justice League for stopping cell phone
theft the New York Times reports that
carriers will create a joint database of
lost stolen cell phones that will make
it easy to track the device and cut off
voice and data service the FCC says that
currently it's easy
for a thief to steal a phone and sell it
on the black market next month New York
City will start replacing public pay
phones with internet connected
touchscreen tablets the tablets will be
free to use for point up info on news
traffic and nearby businesses and will
of course make money with advertisements
eventually the tablets will have skype
and be Wi-Fi hotspots app developers
have a new way to make money in amazon's
android app store now programmers can
add in-app purchases and amazon would
take thirty percent of the revenues from
the transactions just the same as
apple's app store those are your
headlines for today I'm Bridget Carey
