phone than you know what to do with but
I'm willing to bet you spend most of
your time on just a handful of them I'm
Donnell bell and this top 5 i'm counting
down the five apps that android owners
use most results come from avg study of
over a million devices worldwide through
the summer of 2014 starting off at
number five facebook that's right the
king of social media is at the bottom of
this list so take that Zuckerberg what's
worse is that the Facebook app comes in
at number 14 AVG's top performance
draining android apps so your non-stop
facebook addiction is killing your
social skills and your phone ID number
for farm heroes saga no surprise to find
the game on here but what is the deal
with farm games how is it that we drop
hundreds of dollars on a supercomputer
that lives in our pocket just to pretend
that we're cultivating a little virtual
farm humans are so weird at number 3
youtube now this I understand you're
probably watching this video right now
on YouTube and I don't blame you it's
the only app that should be legally
classified as an antidepressant just try
watching tiny hamsters eating tiny
burritos without feeling more hopeful
about the world coming in at number 2
heroin I mean candy crush saga I still
don't understand how grown people play
this game but I'm clearly in the
minority here and bear this in mind this
avg data is worldwide I'm sorry humanity
but until we solve world hunger I'm
giving you a timeout you're better than
this all right and finally the number
one app that is hijacked our attention
all around the world we chat this free
international cross-platform messaging
app redeems my hope for Humanity because
whether you're using it to talk to
Grandma halfway around the world or hook
up with some Rando you met at the bar it
warms my heart to know we are still
spending most of our time communicating
with each other instead of just hunching
over and crushing candy and tending our
digital farms so there you go those are
the five apps the Android users spent
the most time on during
the summer of 2014 according to avg now
for tips on saving your android battery
life to get some more time with these
apps check out our post over at Cena how
to and for more top 5s from me top five
