the studio donna bell say what's up
what's up all that amor on this week's
train what's up guys are watching crave
and everything that you find here all
the weird quirky cool things in check
you can find at a blog at crave dot cnet
com now i'm here with mp3 editor
extraordinaire lunabelle that's right be
here good to be here yeah absolutely you
know the drill you come here bring some
cool things what do you got for a side
right I brought you one of the more
unattractive it's still very cool
gadgets that we've reviewed this is the
sound cast outcast outdoor speaker
system it's really powerful gets really
loud it's wireless you can it works both
off of a battery and also there's a
wireless ipod dock that can transmit
your music to this thing outside you
just gotta have to cover it up so that
it doesn't look like you've got like an
oxygen tank but it sounds great now we
do have a connected so you want to like
break us off a little oh absolutely okay
let's see what song it actually chooses
from your ipod i goin old school come on
DB what else you got I've got this this
is kind of again this is old school it
is a spy camera built into a book so
weird book it's like it's like a Bambi
book mm-hmm and that I think the only
reason I'm craving is cuz it looks so
bizarre like you wouldn't actually want
to keep it on your bookshelf because it
would look so out of place and the
camera built inside of it is like it's
an analog cameras not digital so it uses
like 110 millimeter families of the
weird film format hmm the only reason I
really want it is to actually go and use
it outdoors that's just like a camera so
is there some some reason why you would
even want a spy camera book it's 35
bucks and it's cooler than a disposable
camera it's cool it's 35 bucks yeah um
another thing that was on a crate blog
is this stuff called sticky goo see this
yeah and it's basically this um it kind
of looks like silly putty but you know
you can roll it on your keyboard yeah on
your cell phone is supposed to you know
I guess has disinfectants build a dress
to kill germs antibacterial yeah i think
all i need that for us because i always
eat like bagels at my desk and all the
seeds get stuck in my keyboard discuss

of digital TV screens build into the
armpits of your shirt genius right
