Tim Smith gives the senior director
microsoft developer evangelism effort
we're looking at one of the many demos
of sites that have been scripted
specifically for IE 9 what do we think
so this is Jitterbugs which is a game
that was built by one of our design
apartments called synergy and what they
built is they wants to really see how
far can you push the gates good with
just native HTML 5 so this game from top
to toe is just pure HTML it's SVG and
canvas for graphics it swath base to
typography so it's downloading custom
font and rendering sunscreen there's
nothing that's delivered through a bug
in here is such a purely native HTML
code and it's just a beautiful
experience I love what they've done with
it the concert line the game is you can
I have to select by lassoing a bunch of
it bugs if you can lassie enough bugs as
the band starts to play so take some
skill to get the buns in the right
places but if you can sue them you see
the music starts to play and I'm just
kind of like to grab the same colored
ones and no other that's right that's
right you can't you can't get two
different kinds of colors and yeah it's
a game of skill and I guess I'm too old
and too middle-aged to be able to play
it well but there we go when you get
them all rights you get the kind of
cacophony of bug that's just flying
downstream and I think it's just a
really good kind of real-world example
you know for right click here you just
see the snow kind of plug in context
menu here this is just just the real way
of running in a kind of a native kind of
experience that's takes advantage of the
hardware acceleration inside xpro 9
great thanks Tim no worries</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
