and to order the same boring Brut each
time you hit up happy hour if you're
guilty of this it's time to change that
I'm here at the speakeasy Tap Room in
San Francisco enjoying a local brew and
ready to pop a cap off a few of the best
apps for beer lovers whether it's st.
Patty's Day or you're just enjoying a
beer after work untappd is your go-to
app this location-based social app lets
you follow what friends are drinking
find local brews and check into whatever
you're sipping on it's not the only app
of its kind but it is a cleanest and has
a strongest community of beer lovers
check out what's nearby from the home
screen or check into a beer by searching
for it like this Big Daddy IPA I'm
drinking once you check in you'll add
your location impressions a rating and
even a photo if you want pretty soon
you'll end up with the log of beers
you've had and Apple even suggests some
new beers to try
that's great for when you're bar-hopping
but what about those times when you're
stuck choosing from a fridge full of
beer that's where beer buddy comes in
available for iPhone this app integrates
with rate beer calm to give you full
flavor profiles and ratings for the
bottled stuff so just grab a beer scan
the barcode and voila there's a reading
and everything I need to know about this
beer beyond that you can even add your
own ratings and start building a log of
your favorite brews beer buddy is $3.99
but for beer lovers this app will
quickly pay for itself oh and by the way
this isn't available for Android but
there is an official reap your app that
does the same thing
much like wine drinkers beer drinkers
seem to like talking about beer as much
as they like drinking it they say things
like hoppy dry caramel flavored and
beyond that appearance aroma and even
mouthfeel all play a part in the way
they talk and write about beer to get a
better idea of how popular beer types
and brews are described and to sound
like a pro yourself check out the BJCP
styles up for iPhone and the BJCP droid
app for Android both of these apps do
the same thing there quick reference
guides for whenever you want to look up
a style description every style has a
full profile with aroma flavor and so on
and even beers in that category it's a
nifty app good for amateurs and
connoisseurs and at $0 you can't beat
that phrase
with these three apps you should find
yourself trying new beers and inspiring
friends to do the same just don't forget
to rate them to help other people out
and as always drink responsibly people
which is exactly what I'm about to do
