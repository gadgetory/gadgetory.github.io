is a review of the Blendtec designer
series wild side blender so what is the
wild side of this blender it's right
here basically this pitcher has a fifth
side to it this tiny little side that
has the wild side writing on it and it
claims to be able to blend things better
than its competitors due to the vortex
it creates the first thing that stands
out about this blender is its price it
costs four hundred and fifty four
dollars which is crazy for a blender but
it isn't really just a blender it can be
a meat grinder a grain mill it can make
ice cream it can make bread it can do so
many different things so if you're the
kind of person who cooks a lot and is
really hands-on and might use all of
those things it might actually be a
value purchase if not you're gonna have
a very very expensive paperweight
sitting in your kitchen as far as
performance goes it is incredible in
every performance test it really blew us
away which is what you'd expect for a
454 dollar blender the one problem I had
with performance though was that it
doesn't do small serving sizes very well
this is really kind of an
industrial-strength blender it's
designed for large quantities and lots
of food I'm Megan Fullerton for Cina and
this has been a review of the Blendtec
designer series wild side blender thanks
for watching
