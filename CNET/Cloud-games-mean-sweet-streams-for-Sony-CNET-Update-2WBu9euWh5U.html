how but we want it now I'm Richard Carey
and this is your cnet update the future
PlayStation experience could involve
streaming your video games Sony bought
the cloud based game provider Gaikai for
380 million dollars in shares Gaikai
lets you stream graphics heavy games
with just an internet connection no
downloading no discs it's already been
working with Samsung and LG to bring
games like mass effect 3 on a smart TV
so not only could play station had a way
for you to stream games to a future ps4
or Vita but maybe this could expand the
PlayStation footprint outside of the
traditional console any
internet-connected device like a
smartphone or tablet could be a way to
play these games Facebook may add a new
way to express your opinion on a post we
already have the like button but a want
button is in the works a developer found
code for a want button in Facebook's
software development kit it doesn't work
yet but if activated it would put more
of a purchasing spin on Facebook most
likely as a way for facebook to make
more money with advertisers and we'll
all start sounding a little more like
veruca salt in other developing news we
have our eyes on Twitter which just cut
off LinkedIn you can no longer have
tweets automatically post on a linkedin
profile and twitter may start cutting
off other sites too it has stricter
rules now for how developers can
incorporate tweets into services
analysts are seeing this as Twitter
trying to gain more control so it can
better monetize tweets Firefox is coming
out with its own smartphone operating
system it's called simply Firefox OS but
these phones will target the lower cost
segment of the smartphone market the
first phones with Firefox with Brazil
next year the headphone maker Beats
Electronics has acquired the music
streaming service mog this means the 15
million songs that mog owns for
streaming could be integrated into beats
products Apple's old paint sync and
storage service called mobileme has
closed and Apple warned everyone that
this day was coming but if you use the
service you still have a limited time to
get back your data and move it over to
Apple's iCloud service a new social
media site for news called waywire is
spoke
I'm getting Millennials involved in
public affairs it's sort of like a
mash-up between Twitter and YouTube the
site will have users post video
responses to news stories and it uses a
badge and reward system to let you
become part of the group at the size of
what gets highlighted on the site it
also will produce three short newscasts
a day waywire was co-founded by newark
new jersey Mayor Cory Booker and
received funding from big names in tech
like Google's Eric Schmidt linkedin CEO
Jeff whiner and even Oprah that's your
tech news update for today for more on
the stories in today's show visit
