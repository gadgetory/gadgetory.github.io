convenience to your home things like
unlocking the door hands-free or letting
people into your home if they just need
to walk your dog or deliver a package
another thing they can do is trigger
scenes so when you unlock your door at
the end of the day it can also change
your lights and your thermostat to
welcome you home smart locks come in two
main varieties the first is Bluetooth
and Bluetooth works just like it does
with your phone it connects to the lock
and it works in a short range so maybe
50 or 100 feet but beyond that you're
really not gonna have any access you can
extend it with a Wi-Fi module but that's
often an added accessory and an added
cost the second kind of smart lock is
z-wave or ZigBee now that's gonna
require a hub that's also connected to
your router but once that set up you can
control your lock with voice assistance
and connect it to other smart home
devices you'll also be able to lock and
unlock your door remotely so there are a
couple different ways that you can put a
smart lock on your door
the first is retrofit and models like
August or quick set comfort are good
examples of that you don't have to
replace your existing deadbolt or change
your keys you can just attach it to the
back of the door there's also completely
keyless models like the quick-set
obsidian that are just a touchscreen
deadbolt and then there are some kind of
in the middle where you have a
touchscreen keypad and a key so you've
got a lot of options for the most part
smart locks are as secure as a regular
deadbolt the deadbolt Hardware is grated
the same and it has pretty much the same
physical ability as long as you're
keeping your Wi-Fi passwords secure and
updating your software like you should
there really shouldn't be any major
issues deciding if you really need a
smart lock comes down mostly just to
preference if you like the idea of
having remote access being able to check
if you've locked your door and letting
people in when you're not home smart
locks are a good way to do that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
