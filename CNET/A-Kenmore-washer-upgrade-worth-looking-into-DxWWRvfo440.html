a bit of a bad rap they don't usually
perform quite as well as their
front-load counterparts and they use a
lot more water but this Kenmore model
for 1,100 bucks actually did incredibly
well in our test it's actually the
second most impressive washer results
we've gotten to date and that's for all
of the machines both top and front load
so this is an excellent result it was
also pretty decent in terms of water
consumption at use 17.7 gallons which is
more on average than the front load
models but it did better than most of
the top load models we've tested so far
it also has a massive 5.3 cubic foot
capacity which is the largest top load
capacity we've seen so far the one thing
I don't like about it is its display it
looks really nice I love the design but
it's actually too responsive basically
you just need to use a really light
touch for these buttons which may seem
counterintuitive if you're used to using
actual tangible buttons for a device
like this overall though I think this is
an awesome machine I would highly
recommend it especially if you're
looking for a top-load unit that's large
enough to fit laundry for the whole
family</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
