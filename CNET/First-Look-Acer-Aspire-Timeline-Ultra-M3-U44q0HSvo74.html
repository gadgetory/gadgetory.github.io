well I'm Scott Stein and I'm still
wondering myself because this is an
ultrabook
although it's a lot larger than any
altra book that you've probably ever
seen before that's because all true but
this is is the Acer Aspire timeline
ultra m3 and that mouthful means is a
15-inch laptop that is deemed an
ultrabook by Intel and by Acer but also
has a DVD drive so how exactly is that
an ultrabook again it's about the low
performance low voltage processor which
in here is a core i7 that you tend to
see on those fast but battery conserving
laptops that we would call ultrabooks
and it is thin and this comes in it
under an inch thin
that's 0.7 nine inches then 4.4 pounds
but it looks like a thin laptop and
that's the kind of debate that you're
gonna have if you're looking for this
type of computer that walks the line in
between and the performance on this is
good it uses a 256 gigabyte SSD in this
configuration four gigs of ram and that
nvidia geforce GT 640 m processor is
part of a next generation of Nvidia
graphics this is a first laptop that
we've seen that uses those graphics and
it did hold its own as far as being
suitably fast for games but this isn't
really enthusiast level for playing
hardcore games but it'll get by and find
a laptop this thin that's saying
something you've got about six hours of
battery life on this which is very good
even for any ultrabook so that's great
too
but the looks of it are pretty generic I
mean this really just feels like a lot
of other thin laptops that we've seen
and wait a second I remember seeing thin
laptops that had dedicated graphics a
couple of years ago and they were also
Acer timelines so what's going on well
ultrabook is kind of a type of branding
isn't it and that's the thing that's a
little weird about the Ultrabook
movement now as we start to see things
like the HP Envy 14 spectre and we see
the samsung series 915 inch you're gonna
see a lot of these laptops that are
trotting around the name Ultrabook and
are gonna feel a lot like thin laptops
we've seen before so bottom line we
don't really know
the final price set of this laptop so
it's hard to make an evaluation as to
whether it's a good value now if it
comes in well over a thousand dollars
then this probably is gonna seem like
not such a great deal now if it comes in
it's something that's very competitive
around a thousand dollars and if it
performs that well and it has that good
of battery life it's something you might
want to consider
I'm Scott Steiner they look at the Acer
Aspire time line ultra and three</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
