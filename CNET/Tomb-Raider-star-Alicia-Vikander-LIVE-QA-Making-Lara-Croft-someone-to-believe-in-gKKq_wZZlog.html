editor-in-chief of CNET news thanks very
much for joining us today here at San
Francisco
CNET headquarters and also to the people
watching online this is part of our Q&amp;amp;A
series at CNET today I am thrilled to
have a special guest Alicia vikander who
many of you know from some of her more
notable film roles including as an AI
robot in ex machina as a cybersecurity
guru in Jason Bourne and next month she
will be part of the reboot of a very
famous video game character that we all
know lara croft in the new movie Tomb
Raider
so please welcome Alicia vikander thank
you alright thank you so much for being
here in your patience as we get a bunch
of having me everyone is a super fan of
comic books and geek culture and sci-fi
but we're gonna start by showing a scene
from Tomb Raider so if you could roll
that so everyone can see it that would
be great I thought it's on that again
I'm going mad sorry your father's gone
at some point we have to face up to who
we are who were meant to be I think I
know where my dad went that's right in
the middle of the devil sea it would be
an adventure adventure what are you
doing here ara
seven years I've been on a silent your
father they put me here now I see the
likeness intelligence so recklessness
what do you know about my father Laurie
there was more to my life than
boardrooms and business deals there's an
organization called Trinity genocide dad
Jim you had a bigger holiday got a knack
for the unexpected
you must stop the flower promised me
ladies first
over the tomb
it's your finger that's pulling this
trigger you messed with the wrong family
I was a little bit of like you've got
the whole trailer all right well I got
to see the movie yesterday and I'm gonna
try to make this as spoiler free as
possible but it looks like you had a lot
of fun playing Warcraft yes but I've
heard you tell stories about your first
meeting with her when you're about ten
can you share that yeah I yeah I
remember I did I did not have a
Playstation in my house very sad and
jealous of other people so I went to my
friend's house and I remember it was the
first time I had seen a video game with
a female protagonist and I was just so
curious and blown away and after
convincing those older boys in the
family to play I got the chance to and
mostly spend my time to be honest and
the manner practicing because I I came
by with some of these Wolf's in an early
sequence in the game then just freaked
me out that was my introduction to video
games in general actually I must say and
yeah I continued to play quite a lot of
adventure games mostly computer games
and point and click games and stuff like
that but yeah
when you returned and you saw this what
did you want to be at that time when you
grabbed oh my god I I wanted to be
anything from a florist to a dancer and
an actress and yeah I actually thought I
was going to be that I wanted to be a
singer or a dancer it was not until it
was actually a clip that was found on me
a Swedish television not long ago that I
you know I don't have any memory of this
myself but apparently in this interview
at 7 years old I said that I wanted to
be an actress and I actually had no clue
I wanted to do that already at that
young age is it true that you're a big
fan of 80s movies like The Mummy Indiana
Jones and one of my favorites fifth
element yes yes Bruce Willis was my
first crush
I was like yeah leaven ya know so yeah I
love that kind of films you know an
adventure film the Indiana Jones I I was
a big fan of The Mummy series in my
early teens as well so to get into that
series right yes yes exactly a good
mommy see I haven't seen the new one
actually but I I would I mean when when
they asked me to be part of an adventure
like this I mean it was just a thrill I
like I said I seat myself to those kind
of computer games when I was a kid and I
was also I read a lot of books when I
was a child and I had like seven volumes
of like ramesses books I loved Egyptian
mythology and historical dramas and so
and and that is you know very much
related to these kind of worlds I want
to ask you about Laura Croft but just a
side question do you still play video
games I know that you're married to
Michael Fassbender so I wonder if game
night at your house uh since Creed and
Tomb Raider going on is that true
I wish at the time because that is kind
of what I realize I think cuz I did I
went back and played the rebooted games
now before making this film and I was
really excited I remember I was like I
bought the the games and I was at home
and I sat I was like now I finally had
time and I guess it's also because I
haven't played in a long time and
suddenly I looked down and like eight
hours had passed and I'm like I was
freaking out I'll say I don't have you
know to do there's more today but I
guess I had more time when I was a kid
but I really yeah I mean that shows also
what a what a world it is I kind of
forgot about time and I really love it
yeah well let's talk about your approach
to this reboot of Tomb Raider every one
hour a lot of people have seen the prior
film with Angelina Jolie
there was a reboot of the game in 2013
and a new origin story and again having
seen the film you're taking this
character on truly an origin story
starting it in a place that I wasn't you
know sure that that's where you were
gonna start so talk about the journey
that you took Laura yeah because I think
you know that's one of the things of
making I think trying to adapt maybe a
video game or any other stories the fact
that you want to give people what you
know honor the character and and the
world that they so well love but we also
want to surprise them and give them
something new and I was some came on
board quite early on and knew they was
going to be inspired by the 2013
rebooted games and that it was gonna be
an origin story and then when I chatted
with roar the director and the producers
I we kind of realized that there's
there's you know a truly a a grounded
story to be told and it's set in a
reality closer to ours she has all the
common trades that she's so well known
to have but she's also not afraid of
showing her vulnerability and she's
human and this is very much the story of
how becoming the action hero that we so
well know her to be and I love that it
was grounded in trying to find maybe a
physicality that she's a very physical
person a girl and that so it would be
plausible for her to go on this first
adventure because she doesn't have any
experience in the beginning of the film
so hopefully we get to be with her and
then root for her while she's going step
by step to become this this action hero
and and actually you start out as a very
smart but normal girl living in lost
like most young people are including I
mean that there was something that I
liked that I wanted to kind of cherish
the fact that she kind of has people
around her who once her dad has been now
it has disappeared for seven years and
she hasn't really been able to properly
mourn him due to not knowing what
happened they want her to kind of take
over from him and and and move back into
the manor but she just feels like she
she needs to find her own footing in the
world and feels the pressure of
of knowing what to do or what to become
but she's a headstrong girl and she's
clever so when she's thrown out on this
adventure she not only gets to learn
more about her past and who she maybe is
but she also finds courage to embrace
who who she is
she's fairly kick-ass as you would
expect and there are a lot of very
physical moments some of which match the
game beautifully leaps in the air
etcetera you did a lot of your own
stunts didn't you yeah I I really I
tried to do as many of them as I could
and then you have an incredible I mean
team I I just did they're watching some
of these women's stunt girls that we had
who of course kind of made sure that we
can run all those stunts over and over
again but I always did my first try and
they helped me and yeah I it was
important for me to to truly really try
and get up to physical levels so I would
be able to do it and I I used to be a
dancer when I was younger so I think
there's always been this curiosity and
just urge of knowing what it was like to
make these kind of films and to do these
kind of stunts well you're definitely
there's a scene with the bicycle that is
you're following that action and I was
probably where I got my most wounds oh
my god it's tricky
we met some like core it was actually me
who had found I found this video YouTube
clip of bicycle couriers in London I
kind of brought this up in the beginning
because I moved to London and I try to
bike and it's dangerous I mean you can
die and that's when I you know it was
said to them you know we should they
should definitely be an action sequence
about this and yeah but it's bit scary
to say Laura Croft is a cultural icon is
an understatement she has been as of
June 2016 the character on the cover of
over a thousand magazines surpassing any
supermodel and so she's been praised as
this catalyst that has gotten people to
rethink video game heroine
she's been praised as a role model for
women but at the same time she's been
criticized for being sexualized version
of what this action-adventure you know
warrior should be and I know that you
like to focus on the positive aspect so
when you went into the role what was
your agenda what did you want to make
sure that any young girl seeing this
film would things well what I think you
know is interesting is yes she's she's
really become an icon she's been a
character that has been with us now for
22 years and what I find interesting is
that all the kind of the kind of what I
want to see is the essence of Laura has
kind of stayed the same but I think it's
a wonderful thing just looking at
Crystal Dynamics who created this reboot
again 2013 they knew that this is a
character that has kind of changed the
rules and in society so I think they
were they did right of trying to just
bring her into our time and it's
interesting that you know the the view
the the view of a woman or sexuality and
I think it's interesting because if you
would go out now on the street today and
ask what men and women find attractive
it's just a very different answer that
you would get today then you got 20
years ago and and I'm that makes me
happy and I know that I wanted to be
part of making a girl be someone that a
2018 audience would be able to relate to
well I also loved that you're running
and jumping and doing all these stunts
and clothes that women would actually
wear yeah well sometimes I if she ever
goes back I think she should at least
have a long-sleeved sweater I prayed for
that quite a few times
there's a lot of talk in the video game
industry about how women are portrayed
in video games and Lara Croft stands
above she is one of the more notable
exceptions to sort of the cliche roles
that some people bring and lots of
people have called them out and there
are there's a whole group of people that
will criticize women for
to sizing videogames saying that there
being two pcs so what would you say to
that group of men mostly not all but
mostly who don't think that there needs
to be any change in the way women are
portrayed in video games first of all I
think we need to portray women and I
think that's the the lack and that comes
I guess in video game as much as in film
I think we're all storytellers and we're
all artists and and and and our kind of
what we need to do is make sure that all
stories are kind of able to be told and
I think I think there's a change I mean
just over the last few few months I feel
that it's kind of a creative boom of
stories of of women coming together and
about female stories that start to
bubble up to the surface I yeah I I
really think that those people who say
that it's equal or that it's not a know
that it's an already not female
characters out there I don't think
they've opened up their eyes enough
sadly you're one of the people behind
times up with Reese Witherspoon Natalie
Portman a lot of other folks and you've
said that you've seen a lot of positive
change like I said I actually think that
I've made more female friends in this
industry over the past four months and I
of course myself I'm part of that
behavior but I've also kind of grown up
in a social structure and a society
where I kind of thought growing up that
well there is only place for one girl
and then you end up in a position as a
woman where you think you're gonna have
to push your way through and and and be
competitive and and that's not really
emotionally what you have wanted you
just thought that that was the case and
you kind of just sadly enough put your
safe myself in that line and accepted
that and over the last few months I've
I've been on phone calls with women
talking that I've kind of people that
I've looked up to that kind of inspired
me to wanting to do what I do
I've been in the same room but sadly
because of my working situation I never
ended up being a situation when I
actually worked with him and suddenly
now I meet them in rooms and they're my
friends and that is you know a huge
change is such a small amount of time
I'm trying to make this again a spoiler
free as possible Lara Croft is known in
part for two guns on her hips and
watching the movie yesterday I noticed
that you use a variety of weapons a bow
and arrow as we can see a knife I think
there's an icepick there might have even
been a rock as a weapon but there are no
gun never fires gun so why is that what
was the thinking there well I have you
know first of all I'm just happy to know
that she doesn't use any guns I love
that it also shows a much more
personality I think it shows that she is
clever and that she's innovative and
she's a survivor she just you know she
doesn't go out to kill she goes out
there to create a change or or or you
know to to fight for a better course are
you good with the bow and arrow now I'm
better it was pretty hard we had one of
my a stunt coordinator our main
coordinator he is he was on Vikings for
like seven seasons or something and I
always like I remember this day when I
was pretty like happy I'd like aim at
the bullseye got it and then he kind of
you know just like he's able to run and
shoot from like a two meter 200 meters
distance it's like insane and then I was
like no no I can do this on a horse too
so yeah but I was I was taught by the
best
at least Mattel just a few days ago
announced a new Barbie it's Tomb Raider
Barbie it's 30 bucks you'd they're
taking pre-orders now I just saw it just
now at Crystal Dynamics that I visited
for the first time I have to hold it up
for the camera for one second but what
is it like to be an action figure you're
a Barbie like is that weird or what it's
so strange yeah if I mean both of the
things if someone would have told me
that I would you know play Lara Croft
one day or be a bomb looks I would just
rolled my eyes thank you yeah she's a
I've heard apparently that the you know
the old Bob is kind of fall over because
they're not really the right persons I
guess I have to try oh great
um do you keep anything from your movies
some of the people here were curious
about like do you take souvenirs from
some of the so I mean the the sad
reality is that I actually live out of a
suitcase and have done in three and a
half years I'm just about to move in a
house I've been a nomad so it's been
like a beam bees and hotels so I'm to
try I it's the one thing that freaks me
out you would see me have a panic attack
trying to pack my bags one more time
because I've done it so many times so
adding things is not what I prefer but I
asked them to send to my storage so I do
have the Tomb Raider clapper that's a
little souvenir okay I want to switch to
ex machina Alex Garland was just here
two week oh I spoke to him this morning
he says hi I'm sure have you seen the
film by the way it's amazing it opens
tomorrow Nile agen but he was talking
about the role that you played the robot
Ava and AI and that it's you know a
story of truly exploring the boundaries
between robot and human what that is and
when you read that script for the first
time what was going through your mind
it's maybe the best script I've read in
my career when I see the film now I'm
still wanted over the fact that we
didn't change like one line he's truly
one of the most intelligent people that
I know and he you know managed to kind
of bring up a subject that was kind of
so much kind of just about to kind of be
in the air but it felt like it was just
before anyone really talked about AI we
shot this
film what is it five years ago now
something before for the subject
interested me then of course getting the
chance to play a character it's very
brilliantly in the script he kind of
doesn't have any description about her
you kind of it's the only description is
about the brain that is kind of moving
around and that is like the most
beautifully thing you've seen the
machinery but it was like a blank page
trying to figure out how she moved what
she was like and yeah it was it was a
feast to take on that part what do you
think about AI to use an AI assistant
Alexa or Siri do you talk to them
III guess I'm controlled by them
constantly
I carry my phone with me everywhere
sometimes I feel I'm quite good at
taking breaks or I try to go out to
dinner and not bring my phone but I mean
yeah it's it's the way we live it's part
of our world at the moment but I tried I
need personally a bit of breaks I'm not
I'm not on any social media yeah you're
moving into a house is it gonna be a
smart house no it's gonna be a little
cabin out in the woods I just written an
interview that said that you're reading
a book sapiens that both Barack Obama
and Mark Zuckerberg have recommended
that everyone read home adieu yeah have
you finished it I know this record I
mean what is lovely is that I think I
think the beauty of discussing science
versus religion and how they are you
know part of the same discussion that
never really collide
I am I think I I've always been so
interested in history and science and
never really consider myself being
religious and that's something I took
away from me reading that book now that
I look at my
I face a whole lot differently it talks
about basically the evolution of culture
so if you don't have anything on your
reading list for this summer add it it's
a read you trained as a ballet dancer as
you mentioned and there's one of my
favorite scenes is from the Man From
UNCLE when you come out and you're
dancing to cry to me by Solomon Burke
yeah that was not in the script that was
just me having fun and so who did you
pick the music
did you just know you don't know what
music we're gonna add on in
post-production I don't even know what I
put on actually I think it was it's also
what when you make films to kind of have
a song and you kind of get a bit
inspired and then sadly enough I mean
you should see films when they when they
show the behind the scenes because just
before takes they need to turn it off so
every time now when you see a film where
it's a rave at disco a good dance but
you see just like turn off the music and
then you'll know that was what it was
like shooting it everyone's like silent
disco yeah that's how it is even an ex
Mac and I they had to do that without
music alright I'm just being mindful of
time here somebody tell me okay we're a
tech site what's your favorite gadgets
Google Maps I live I live by it I travel
I love the fact that you can first of
all I'm a big foodie so I kind of always
come to a new place and I look up and I
put it in I have like I actually use it
a lot I have like all my lists and like
need to go to two stars one star and
then I also love the fact you can
actually get lost that's a nice thing
when you come to New City normally you
cannot before was afraid that you were
not gonna know where you are and then
you can kind of leave it and then you
can just wander and then you know that
you won't be able to get to find your
way back to the hotel hopefully what
piece of tech do you wish had never been
invented
well bombs
I guess all right I'll take that one
that's a good one what tech would you
like to have invented for yourself
it's gonna sell too much about me no we
we want to hear that right yeah I would
love to I mean I've heard about like
drone copters and things like that me
yeah I would like to fly yeah I would
like to maybe have just a little
backpacking a jet pack and go like a
little backpack and be able to fly and
fly off yeah there is there is one
already
no yeah we've been cheated out of drede
pack jet packs and flying hover boards
and the like most people say time
machine some things that can get you
distances or take you back to erase a
mistake
so that is unusual um okay so in the
next couple of weeks
Tomb Raider is going to come out lots of
people are going to be talking about
again this new reboot of Lara Croft and
where that's going to go she starts out
as I say as pretty much a regular girl
and you're taking our on a journey the
end we get a hint of how much even more
of a badass you're going to become
because really the two guns it's a
pretty a moment of fierceness what would
you like to see you know girls will
dress up as you for Halloween and carry
their Barbies I guess if their moms will
buy that what what's the best review of
this movie and do you know I you know I
grew up in Sweden in Europe I have a mom
as an actress and I was kind of
introduced to kind of very heavy-handed
European art house cinema but I also
since I was like 5 ran to the cinema
because I loved to just leave the world
behind and go and enjoy myself dream
throw myself out on an adventure and a
ride and if people have that coming out
from seeing this film then I'm thrilled
all right we're gonna leave it here
thank you so much for joining us please
thank thank you so much for coming thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
