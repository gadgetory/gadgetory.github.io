everything is awesome I'm Bridget Carey
and this is your cnet update here at toy
fair we get to see how technology is
changing playtime and to start things
off how about some remote control robots
with swords these are the bachelor Borg
warriors it's the next evolution of the
bat-rope Borg series and you hold your
remote control katana with a simple
swing they fight and the point is to
knock your opponent off the set is made
by Thome and you can choose up to four
warriors for battle for seventy dollars
you can get two of these robots with the
arena and it'll come out in June there
are smart watches now for kids this is
the vtech kidizoom SmartWatch this is a
very basic kind of smart watch it
doesn't talk to your phone with Wi-Fi or
Bluetooth it's just a standalone
wristwatch that has a camera included so
you can take still photos or video but
it also has a few other fun features
there's a voice recorder a stopwatch
there are some games included in here
there are just two basic buttons to
control everything and will be coming
out in the fall for fifty dollars and
the age range is about three to nine
years old uncle gadget
Tamagotchi is back this time they're
called Tamagotchi friends and they're a
little bigger than when you remember
them from the 90s when the digital pet
was a big hit that's because when they
touch their backs they can talk to each
other and go on play dates and send
texts in the US and Canada you'll find
them in the fall for twenty dollars
apiece dolls are even getting a little
more smartphone savvy here Dora the
Explorer has a new line called Dora and
friends and she not only comes with a
cell phone but her Matt friend is now a
map half that comes on a smartphone that
you can play with so what's a toy fair
without nerf this time technology has
changed up the battlefield a bit this is
the nerve tech strike storm shield and
what it does is it attaches to your nerf
elite guns tactical rail and when you
slide it on in itself it's
battery-powered and it's keeping track
of the darts you're shooting and when
you hit your opponent's other shield
it's keeping track of score these are
special smart darts that use RFID
technology to keep track of points the
pack comes with ten smart darts and a
shield for twenty-five dollars and that
will be out in August we'll have to wait
to the end of the year to see which of
these tech toys ends up being a real hit
