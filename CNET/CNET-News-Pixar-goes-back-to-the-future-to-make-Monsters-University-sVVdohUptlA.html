campus slithers flies and dances to life
7 a 10-story supervisor kelsey man
helped lay the groundwork for the new
Pixar movie a lot of ways you know we
are kind of creating a blueprint the way
we do that we're basically the first
ones to draw the movie or visualize the
film for the first time excited to live
with you and laugh of you the prequel
Chronicles Mike and sulley's college
years but also introduces a slew of new
monsters we can never really put my
consoli and a life-threatening situation
for the entire film because you would
know like well they make it they're
going to be fine so the way that you can
help that and make the film still
engaging for the audience is to create
other characters to that you don't know
the outcome to mam says the creative
process was never limited by technology
people are brilliant here so if we need
a character to do something crazy we've
never done before they're like don't
worry if that's what's right for the
movie we will figure out a way to make
it happen its technical Wizards like
Sanjay Bakshi who make it happen we're
using a proprietary animation software
called presto on this film it had really
improved to accommodate the number of
characters that we have in all of the
shots that's a departure from monsters
inc which rarely had more than a few
detailed characters in each scene common
Crouch monsters University features
about a hundred key characters and over
400 background characters the scenes
were so complex the studio doubled the
amount of computing power used in
previous films in this film we have a
bunch of furry characters and they have
to wear clothing so that is even more
complicated individual characters have
also evolved James P Sullivan in the 12
years since the original monsters inc
was released digital animation has
improved by leaps and bounds and hairs
in the first film Sully had 1,000,000
hairs in monsters University he has more
than 5 million
come on first one it was all basically
the same length and now like the hair on
his face has a lot of a lot different
texture than the hair on his body the
technical team also took advantage of
technology called global illumination to
generate lighting effects previously we
would have to set up those secondary
light sources by hand so the wall we
would place a light source there and get
the color of it right and the intensity
of it right so it kind of felt like it
was being bounced and now the computer
does that work the technical
achievements creating more engaging
visual experience but man hopes it's the
story that resonates partly I'm most
proud of is that this film has has
something to say and has a message they
may be monsters but their story is one
hundred percent human in emeryville
