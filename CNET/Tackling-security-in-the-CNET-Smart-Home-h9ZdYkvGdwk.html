devices here at the scene at smart
Holiday and it's great to have a place
to put them but that creates its own set
of problems problems we're going to deal
with today
having a place to put all of our smart
gadgets is great but now we have to
worry about someone breaking in and
stealing them so of course we're gonna
install a security system in this house
but like all things in the scene that
smart home our decision isn't an easy
one here's their biggest problem the
house itself
sorry let me explain we have six
exterior doors and at least twice as
many windows not to mention a three-car
garage and that doesn't even include the
walkout basement if this were a small
apartment with one main door to watch
we've probably dropped down a single
security camera like this Piper Envy
pointed at the door and call it a day
but with the house this size we need
something a little more robust after a
lot of consideration we decided to test
out to DIY systems simply safe and smart
things smart things because we already
have the hub installed at the CNET smart
home and simply safe because it won our
Editors Choice Award two years ago we
were looking for a system that offered a
variety of sensors not just a single
camera we wanted reliable and simple
performance and the ability to integrate
third-party devices notifications and
alerts are also a must and we also
wanted an intuitive app after an entire
week of installing and testing these two
systems neither one of them really met
our requests let's look at how they
stacked up
this is not a promising result but as
you can see smartthings has more of our
wants than simply say even though
smartthings isn't perfect namely that
terrible app it has more potential to
deliver the features we want it does a
better job of fitting in with our plans
for this house not just as a security
system but also as a way to connect the
entire house and make it truly market
you don't have to do it yourself though
there are professional options out there
and of course we'll be testing them out
but you'll have to check back to see
that thanks for watching we'll see you
next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
