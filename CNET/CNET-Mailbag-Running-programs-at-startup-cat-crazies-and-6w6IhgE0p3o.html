to the cnet mailbag the show where we
take your feedback about the stuff we do
here at cnet and we have an exciting
announcement to make after hundreds of
emails including a poem from a guy named
Dan that he sent in about ten times we
have finally realized hey you liked our
show and you wanted every week and I
want to do the show every week and I
don't know why these forces have kept us
apart for so long but dang it we're
doing mailbag every week but with all
good news comes a little bad news the
bad news is that in order to do mailbag
every week which you have been clamoring
for we have to kill today in tech
history although honestly not that many
of you have been clamoring for that so I
know there will be some of you who are
disappointed but try to remember at
least you get mail bag and I'll be doing
more insider secrets and quick tips so
keep an eye out for those as well okay
so yay for that let's do some mail Tim
al wrote in to say I just wanted to
point out that when talking about cool
the search engine and the July
thirty-first buzz report you said it has
over 120 million pages indexed when I
think cool deserves the credit for over
120 billion pages I'm not harping on you
about this mistake because I know you
just read it off a script so please
don't be mad at me oh yeah no I'm not
mad but yeah it's me you're harping on I
write all my own scripts and sometimes
all my own scripts have typos in them
lame thanks for noticing though little
bucko wrote in and said i was watching
the latest insider secret tether your
cell phone to your laptop and i was
wondering who is markless Thea is he the
new guy had seen it just wondering and
you know what how rude we should have
introduced mark he was our intern in New
York and he's made a couple cameos on
buzz report and loaded but he is now our
new associate producer and occasional
loaded interviewer and host of some
insider secrets he's great and we're
really happy to have him so keep your
eyes peeled for mark konstantinos had a
question this week I was wondering if
there is any way to make a program run
on startup I recently disabled my
pointing device application eight points
for my laptop's trackpad
and now i have to relaunch it every time
i start my system in order to be able to
scroll so if there is a way please let
me know oh yes there is a way and it's
not very hard in fact I am going to
shoot a scene at quick tip on that and
we'll put it up on scene at TV this week
watch for it coming soon see I have more
time already Brian was not the only
person to read in about this next
subject so I was watching hulu the other
day when i came across the visa ad with
brian cooley I was like whoa Brian
Cooley does ads now not only was i
amazed about that but the number of cats
he has and why he's always wondering
what they're doing when he's away he
isn't some like crazy cat lady is he
there's a kind of camera called a
network camera connects directly to the
internet or your home network my wife
and I wanted to know what are the cats
do all day when were away we realized
after we install them there do anything
they just sleep um yeah he kind of is
there's a lot of things you don't know
about Brian Cooley and finally let's see
what's up today in hair male Brandon
wrote with all these crazy teams these
days and their new hairstyles loitering
on my lawn and whatnot it is refreshing
to wake up and see Tom's responsible
hair on bol the density the color the
vibrancy is truly a work of art who is
Tom's hairstylist obviously not the same
as that hip new Bryant on character what
shampoo does he use does he make his own
probably do you know what he calls his
shampoo if he doesn't have a name I
would suggest responsible Tom shampoo he
could make some big money if he teamed
up with Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson or bestbuy
tell Tom I love his hair today
and Tim wrote in to say as I was
watching the july twenty ninth edition
of planet seen it i thought wow Cara's
hair looks great someone should tell her
somali if you could tell car that her
hair looks great I would appreciate it
it really complements her facial
features nicely ah Tim and Brandon I
will let them know I like their hair to
their hairs anyway that's it for this
week everyone I'll see you back here
next week keep that feedback coming and
tell your friends to watch we still need
them mailbag at cnet com or send me a
postcard to 35 second street san
francisco california 94 105 see you next
