an iOS device is that you can't expand
its storage you can use cloud services
like iCloud or even Dropbox but those
require an internet connection and
without one they're useless today I'll
show you an alternative way to add more
storage to your iPhone iPad or iPod
Touch these devices here are media hubs
and when you have one set up it connects
to your iOS device with a direct
wireless connection letting you stream
anything you have stored on the device
so if you're on a long flight you can
fit a number of movies and maybe even
your entire music collection on this
device and access it on your iPhone even
when you don't have an internet
connection when you're shopping around
for a media hub you'll notice that a lot
of them seem to pretty much do the same
thing but keep an eye out for a few
quirks
for example the ravpower file hub and
the i/o gear media share require an SD
card that you purchased separately but
the good news is that they tend to be a
little cheaper they're also compatible
with USB flash drives and they'll power
your iDevice while you stream your media
the other type of device you'll see is
one with onboard storage like the
Patriot Aero
which comes with one terabyte and
finally most of these guys can stream
media to more than one device at the
same time no matter which media have you
decide to go with setting them up pretty
much works the same way for the ravpower
insert the SD card then connect it to
your PC and fill it with any media you
want to take with you for a long trip
I'll add a few movies and my music
collection at this point I'll turn on
the file hub by long pressing the power
button the wireless icon lights up and
now I'll head back to the phone and
connect to my file hub through the Wi-Fi
settings menu now I'll launch the
companion app and right under the device
pane I should see all those files I just
transferred to play media I'll just
double tap and it'll start streaming
pretty quickly too
with the ravpower i can even transfer
photos and videos from my iphone to the
SD card which can be useful if you're on
a trip and need to free up some space on
your phone hopefully one day in future
iterations of the iPhone Apple will let
us expand storage using an SD card on
the device but until then it's not about
solution if you have any questions or
tips of your own hit me up on Twitter
and check out C Netcom slash how to for
more tips like this for CNET I'm Sharon
