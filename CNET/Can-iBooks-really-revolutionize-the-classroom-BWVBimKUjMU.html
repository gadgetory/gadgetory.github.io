the apple byte it's all the good the bad
and everything inside the world of apple
now we're back from Las Vegas I've taken
a shower from that dirty dirty place and
now my skin is smooth as butter now
Apple dropped a whole bunch of news at
the recent education event in New York
and let's start with the iBooks update
it's now called I books too and it will
support digital textbooks from three
major textbook publishers that use
interactive slideshows videos and 3d
images for a more engaging textbook
experience there's currently only eight
books available that start at 1499 and
they're targeting the K through 12
market it's a nice push for the digital
classroom but reinventing the education
system is going to take a lot more than
just a 15 buck interactive book with an
iPad that has a current entry-level
price of four hundred and ninety-nine
dollars now teachers will need to be
trained differently to shape their
curriculum around this new digital
format and guess what not everyone is
going to have an iPad unless Apple
starts giving them away and you can bet
they won't now you can beat the hell out
of a textbook but you can't beat up an
iPad and this could also create even a
greater digital divide for iPad haves
and have-nots now my take I really like
the idea my parents and sister are all
educators but this is just a small step
in the right direction and the digital
classroom in public education is still
years and years away what if you want to
create your own books Apple is making
the iBooks Author app free for all mac
OS 10 line users and only lion users how
convenient but think of it as keynote
and pages fuse together for book
creation it will include apple design
templates text charts and shapes the
ability to add multi-touch functionality
and you can add your own javascript and
HTML widgets and the ability most
importantly to upload your book directly
to the iBookstore for purchases by
complete strangers now it's bringing
book publishing to the consumer Apple's
way and finally i can bring the brian
Tong autobiography to the masses that's
right eat your heart out Walter Isaacson
you should have taken my call now in the
last piece of education use iTunes U
gets its own free app giving students
and non-students access to course
material including video content and
documentation and notes you'll still
have to purchase the actual textbooks
for most the class
but itunes u becomes a go-to hub for
college professors and students and
allows them to post messages send out
assignments and more for example i'm
learning about volcanoes right now whoa
Thanks itunes you all right let's take a
quick break with a how to tip for using
your iphone as a keyboard and mouse hey
guys Sharon Vaknin here to show you how
a free app turns your iphone into a
keyboard and mouse that you can use to
control your computer from a distance
the use for this might not be obvious
but with this setup you can connect your
computer to your TV and leisurely
navigate from the couch or even use your
iPhone or any iOS device as a PowerPoint
remote to get started head to logic calm
/ touch mouse on your Mac or PC select
your OS from the drop-down hit download
software and complete the installation
now open the new app and grab your
iPhone first make sure you're currently
on the same Wi-Fi network as your
computer that's how your iPhone will
communicate with your computer now from
the App Store download touch mouse when
you launch it select your computer from
the list on the screen and you can start
controlling your computer right away to
use the mouse drag one finger around on
the virtual trackpad select tap once or
select Center to scroll drive two
fingers up and down the trackpad and to
prompt the keyboard tap this icon here
there is also a bunch of settings to
play with so tap the Settings button and
adjust the app to your liking for
instance you might want to adjust the
scrolling speed or change the clicking
sounds whenever you're done with the app
or want to switch computers just have
this disconnect button here and you
didn't hear this from me but quickly
installing the touch mouse server on a
friends computer opens doors to a lot of
fun pranking thanks for that Sharon and
that prank has already come in pretty
handy alright let's talk apple patents
because we're not going to talk about
then you make believe iPad rumors that
drop every week including one from a co2
car that says they'll be announcing a
new iPad in February that's way too soon
and if they do I will shave off my
armpit hair and mail it in a baggie for
the person who wants it
I know you're out there now there are
plenty of you who want apple to release
the perfect dream TV and patently Apple
reports the big a has been granted a
patent relating to a method of
organizing episodic content such as TV
shows on in Apple TV media menu items
could correspond to television shows
that have either been recorded from a
broadcast or purchased from a content
provider it could be nothing or it could
mean DVR capabilities yep in the next
Apple TV the patent also mentions an
Apple TV working with a cable network it
was filed in 2006 and Steve Jobs is
listed as one of its inventors another
patent that has not been granted yet
involves taking Syria to another level
and hopes to give users the ability to
purchase items from online stores using
only their voice is being referred to as
the intelligent automated assistant and
Syria in its current form cannot make
purchases yet the finally also suggests
it could be used in Apple's iTunes and
App Store's but Siri could also be
integrated with online retailers to
purchase through a retailer like Best
Buy and then pick up their goods at a
local store now the Apple and Android
battle continues but a new survey by
Nielsen finds that the Cupertino kids
are finally closing the gap Nielsen
found over the last three months that
customers who purchased a smartphone in
the past three months well 44.5 percent
of them bought iPhones compared to the
46.9 who purchase an android phone now
that's significant because in an October
study just over twenty-five percent of
people said they went with the iPhone
while 61.6 percent went with Android and
if you listen to Apple co-founder Steve
Wozniak in an interview with Daily Beast
comparing I phones with android phones
the wasps said my primary phone is the
iphone I love the beauty of it but I
wish it did all the things my android
does I really do and you know what he's
absolutely right I also like the woz
because I got a chance to dance with
them a few years ago and there we go in
the I swing gets a little it's all in
the hips okay check us out see if you do
this head go like this oh my gosh of
course
Oh dancing with the walk and he's a
really super nice teddy bear kind of guy
all right guys last story and sad news
that realistic scary-looking Steve Jobs
doll we told you about it looks like the
Creator is shelving the project after
intense legal pressure from apple and
Steve Jobs his family probably a good
idea so the fully poseable doll you've
all been waiting for is no longer
reality and I'm sorry all right that's
going to do it for this week's show
email us at the apple byte at cnet com
we'll get to emails when we can and we
keep our favorites I'm Brian Tom thanks
for watching I will catch you guys next
time for another bite of the Apple oh I
didn't see you there perfect 60</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
