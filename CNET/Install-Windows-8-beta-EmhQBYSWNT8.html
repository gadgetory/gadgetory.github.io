available for download and I'll show you
how to install it
hi I'm Seth Rosenblatt and installing
the Windows 8 consumer preview as it is
officially known is really quite easy
there are some requirements though most
Windows 7 computers ought to be able to
handle Windows 8 however you want to
make sure you have a 1 gigahertz or
faster processor 1 gig of ram for a
32-bit computer or 2 gigs for a 64-bit
computer a 16 gig hard drive for 32-bit
or 20 gig hard drive for 64-bit a
graphics card that supports Microsoft
DirectX 9 or higher and there are also
some extras that won't work without
certain specifics the touch features
require obviously a monitor or tablet
touchscreen accessing the Windows Store
requires an internet connection but also
a screen resolution of at least 1024 by
768 and to snap apps which lets you
split the screen between two apps you'll
need a resolution of at least 1366 by
768 God all that there'll be a quiz
later to get started go to preview
windows comm now from there there are
two paths that you can take the first is
very easy click get it now enter your
email address and country and begin
downloading the Installer it will
automatically detect the appropriate
version for your system from there you
can either overwrite your current
operating system or set up a partition
using a tool like eases partition master
before installing it the second path is
definitely more advanced because you're
going to put the Windows 8 beta on a
disk or a thumb drive like this from the
same windows site click the ISO link
here and fill in your information choose
the appropriate version for your system
either 32-bit or 64-bit you've also got
some localization options for Chinese
French German and Japanese sorry though
no love for baskets because download the
prop
for ISO for your system if you're on XP
you'll have to use a separate program to
convert the ISO to and installer most
DVD burners include this for Vista and
Windows 7 users you can use the windows
7 USB DVD download tool from the
Microsoft Store download the program run
it and point it towards the windows 8
ISO source file that you just downloaded
then choose USB device or DVD as
appropriate insert the USB key or DVD
and begin copying and there you go
windows 8 in I mean on a flash a flash
drive love it or hate it you know you
want to see Windows 8 for yourself for
CNET I'm Seth Rosenblatt
