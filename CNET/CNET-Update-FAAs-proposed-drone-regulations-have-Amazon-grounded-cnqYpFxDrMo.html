have arrived but don't expect a delivery
drone to bring you a fresh pizza anytime
soon I'm Dan Graziano filling in for
Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update amazon previously revealed that
it was developing a fleet of unmanned
aircrafts that could deliver packages
right to your doorstep these plants have
essentially been grounded thanks to a
new set of rules proposed by the FAA the
agency's proposal states that unmanned
commercial aircrafts must only operate
in daylight and weigh less than 55
pounds these aircrafts would also be
required to stay below 500 feet and go
no faster than 100 miles per hour under
the proposed laws commercial drone
operators will have to be at least 17
years old and pass a knowledge test in
order to obtain an faa drone operator
license now the big problem for Amazon
is that operatives must maintain a
visual line of sight with the drone and
are never allowed to fly over people who
aren't directly involved with the flight
the company has said that is committed
to making its primary service a reality
but there are still major hurdles that
must overcome in other news sony has
announced that a developer edition of
it's smart I glass will be available
soon the glasses are similar to Google
glass they have a transparent screen in
the lenses that show you emails and
notifications floating right in front of
your very eyes it all sounds very cool
but the glasses still aren't ready for
your average Joe they are rather bulky
in the battery only lasts around two and
a half hours oh did I mention that they
will also cost a whopping eight hundred
and forty dollars in related news
Apple's first SmartWatch is expected to
arrive in the next few months and it
could be the best selling SmartWatch so
far the wall street journal reported
that apple has x suppliers in asia to
produce up to six million units the
latest rumors claim we will be seeing
the SmartWatch around April but it may
not be as health focused as we once
thought sources have told the journal
that Apple had to remove certain
features for tracking things like blood
pressure heart activity and stress
levels some features were said to be too
complex and others would have required
to company seek FDA approval but the
Apple watch isn't going to be the only
luxury SmartWatch on the market LG has
announced a new watch with a circular
display and
all metals body and a leather strap the
LG watch urbane as it's called will also
be powered by Android wear which allows
it to show things like calls emails
texts and other notifications from your
smartphone right on your wrist pricing
in the release date wasn't announced but
don't be surprised if it debuts around
the same time as the Apple watch that's
your tech news update and there's always
more over at cnet com from our studios
