for very different types of games and
even though every games dev team knows
the ins and outs of each one eSports
players always make it interesting I
think they always surprise us they are
always doing things at a level of play
that is so far beyond what any of us are
capable of you who's going to deal all
the damage for clock nine

cheering for a game that just came out

even bigger fan base with even more
intense fans so exciting and amazing be
able to watch that especially in person
and see your favorite person I'm still
trying to get Lipes autograph favorite
players and teams are a staple in
eSports community just like traditional
sports Blizzard is well aware of that
fact and when it's developers work on
games with potential eSports components
they definitely like to keep players and
spectators in mind those values that we
kind of instilled to make the play
experience better for the player
hopefully will be valuable for someone
who's watching the game and speaking of
valuable those winners aren't just
walking away with pride the prize pool
across all four championship series at
blizzcon 2015 was 1.25 million dollars
we are in the wrong business and need to
get better at video games it's obvious
that eSports is huge even if you've
never seen a match yeah the whole
convention is built on passion
passionate fans passionate creators and
eSports themselves I think just builds
