impressed with the best here inside
Sony's booth behind me is the largest
floor mat screen that you will find
anywhere on the show floor this is
called colitas it stands for a crystal
LED integrated system it's made of made
up of 144 small panels this stretches 32
feet by 9 feet there crystal LEDs and
then also has a resolution of 8k by 2k
you can kind of assemble them like a
Lego set and make it any size you want
but if you want to see the most
impressive wall here at the show it's
here in Sony's booth now let's kind of
take you around and show you some of the
other cool screens they have going on
here we're gonna go this way because CES
is always about the TVs right it it
makes it just the most visually
impactful stuff so let's go this way you
can really see everything all the
commotion all the people that are going
on around me now right over here these
two displays this is Sony's bravia Z
line it's their LCD base screen the cool
thing about this is they're showcasing
Gran Turismo in 4k for the first time
anywhere on this show floor but they're
really featuring right gaming and the
possibilities of it the image quality
and just how great these screens look
but there's one that's really gonna be
the top one here in the show floor and
it's right behind me you can't see it up
close but again you got to see this
whole display of everything happening
these are Sony's bravia Sony's bravia
OLED line now this is really their first
oled large screen format large format
screen and what also makes it cool is on
the back here if you can take a look at
that panel it has two transducers on the
back they bright vibrate the surface of
the screen is an actual acoustic service
that creates that sound all in this one
package design really unique but there
you have it some of the great stuff here
at Sony's booth at CES</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
