starting a little bit late today on the
359 podcast episode 279 IM b VG and in
the house today we've got roger tang and
alfred hang and we are talking about
stuff birds netflix and the phone
beau'iful thing right yeah we're take a
little bit longer to get her act
together today because it's wednesday
right dude - seriously no stop stop
alright so we're good time with the
Galaxy Note 8 the reviews came out
yesterday literally as we were starting
our podcast yesterday so we need a
chance to address it but we'll talk
about today we'll also talk about
t-mobile's new offer basically if you're
a t-mobile one customer you you'll get
some free Netflix
coming so there's that and lastly we
want pulled plug for CB Shanklin latest
road trip story about birding and the
tech behind birding stops flashing your
gang signs man bird it's a bird gig side
I know what the bird egg sign is I need
to flash that careful sorry the sign
flashed the sign I'm fine yeah alright
sorry for the ridiculousness this is you
know after our normal time so we're a
little loopy as usual we've up the lunch
lols that's right I usually eat around
this time I just been working yeah I'm
doing it I'm doing the podcast now
alright so as always if you have any
questions about any of these topics
except for the burning one since we're
not really experts that's you're talking
about the gang's leave over the comment
section bruh heaven will get the best we
will try to address them in 3 minutes
and 59 seconds alright hang out we'll
get this podcast recorded comeback meet
you in the chat in 3 minutes and 59
seconds from 3 to welcome to the 359 I'm
Roger Chang I'm Alfred Inge so the
Galaxy Note 8 reviews are out and
unsurprisingly they're all pretty
positive you know the most feature
packed phone the best Android phone
that's out there but there are some
caveats one it's really expensive there
are a lot of features and there's some
questions about whether or not you need
all those features for the price
and also the coming months we'll have
the pixel two coming out so we can't
really say if this is like the best
Android phone for the year
at least until Google comes out with
their phone yeah I don't think it's
worth it for the price but our audience
already knows how cheap and broke I am
well it's not heard a dollar so even if
you are you know making a decent living
that is an expensive phone right that
the perspective might change when Apple
comes out with a thousand dollar iPhone
next we are raising the bar on you know
what my sheep now yes but I mean the
thing is like a lot of the hardware you
know under the hood for it outside of
the camera is really the same as the
Galaxy s8 which is you know a few
hundred dollars cheaper I think that's
really the best point there is this
phone is not it's marginally different
than the Galaxy s8 and even to gauzy
that's a plus which is a which has a
display that's point one inches smaller
yeah so it's really basically the same
thing except for the stylus the dual cam
yeah if you really want to shell out an
extra you know but to $300 for that or
you can draw on your screen I mean sure
go ahead
your money it's not mine so well
remember it's actually the discounts
probably cheaper at this point because
you didn't get a GS eight and a galaxy s
eight plus at ellora and a discount
right now you can imagine more discounts
are gonna come to be coming weeks once
the note 8 really gets a chance to be on
the market and so the price disparity is
gonna be fairly wide yeah speaking of
discounts and deals so what's going on
with t-mobile and Netflix so t-mobile is
they announced today that basically if
you're a cheap mobile one a family
planning customer you will get netflix
for free so I mean what's the deal there
though like how much does it cost to
have a family plan to begin with that's
the thing you know it still costs what
was 60 70 dollars a month plus no
different extra lines and you need to
have at least two t-mobile Wan accounts
to be eligible for this and you get the
standard Netflix plan which is a $10
about the plan I will say this oh it is
it is a much better offer than you know
when Sprint goes around saying we're
gonna give everybody a free title
account who cares you know I think they
made a smart move by going with you know
Netflix on this yeah I mean going with
basically the largest subscription
streaming services I
with like all the all the content we all
watch is sort of is a good way I wonder
if if after a TN t--'s merger with you
know Time Warner that you know they
would be able to get like HBO go for
free on that yeah I mean they already
offer that now basically if you have but
the problem with ATT is if you have to
subscribe to the most expensive
unlimited data plan to get HBO for free
and this isn't their most expensive
unlimited oh this is for everyone who's
got t-mobile one yeah so this is
basically their baseline plan or their
main plan alright lastly we want to give
a plug after seeing Shanklin who wrote a
fairly epic story on bird-watching the
art of birding and how technology mobile
apps camera gear online services making
it easier for you to become a birder
he's actually he followed sort of the
highest profile birders in the field
know her Stricker was one of them and a
really fascinating story
I'm not a big birdie fan but I think you
know reading the story I'd be kind of
it's just a thousand dollar camera for
motivation there are some free apps
there's a couple absolutely a couple of
bucks yeah I mean I would probably use
those instead
yes so for those stories and more
chickens I don't see that I brought a
shame I'm offering thanks for saying
alright that snuck up on me quick there
yeah the birds the timer wasn't running
either side that was about four minutes
yeah sure close enough internal clock is
usually accurate about these things our
journal clock is about 30 to 45 seconds
late every time pretty consistently like
alright so anyways we're back from
recording the podcast please submit any
questions and comments about the Samsung
Galaxy S a no Nate no date sorry all
right there and the chats already
lighting up with what an idiot I am and
bird watching is kind of an interesting
one I'm kind of curious to see if
there's anyone out there who is
interested in that hobby I know when I
was younger I was just kind of generally
and this is speaking way over my pay
grade here that was Jinta into zoology I
thought animals were fantastic I loved
going to zoos I read books by Audubon I
kind of want to read more on this story
by Stephen to be honest I was really
into hawks and like
goons like bird of prey I thought they
were really just cuz they're badass yeah
I thought they were really cool when I
was a kid
still fishing right there alright go
ahead and expand a little bit more on
what Jessica had in her review a couple
of things that actually kind of
surprising because one of the features
that I really was looking forward to
using extensively was this portrait mode
they're their version of portrait mode
which is life focused the idea that you
can do that no and so she found it to be
a little finicky didn't work well all
the time but to be fair the portrait
mode on your iPhone seven doesn't work
well all the time either you have to
have like sort of ideal sunlight
conditions for it to really work but it
didn't work as well as I would like one
of the other knowing aspects that came
back from the estate the fingerprint
sensor which is still it's actually even
worse now because it's still by the
camera because the phone is longer
you've got to really reach up there with
your finger that sounds that look really
bad sorry sorry about the baby you
really got a stricter figure to hit the
unlock button your fingers stop dude
stop I apologize so you know a couple of
annoying bits but that said like it runs
on the same superfast processors the s8
it does have the stylus it's got that
cool note-taking ability which you know
most people aren't going to use but yeah
it's kind of nice to have remember when
they announced the node 8 and they
talked about how great their photos
would look in low-light and their demo
photos actually did look kind of
stunning yes and then we were on this
very podcast saying we'll see what like
yeah did you see her low-light photos
they were not good yeah but you know to
be fair though nobody has a good luck
hammer I was gonna say the exact same
thing like everyone always claims that
they've made the big big breakthrough on
low like photos and and then normal
people get their hands on it and it's
not it's like yeah it looks great if you
have like a professional photographer
take that phone and like mess with the
settings and like the lighting and
everything yeah sure that photos gonna
be great but yeah your me use it it's
not gonna I just I just like to call
that out every time just because they
always present it as everyone and then
we every time we get our hands on it's
like no it's not are you talking about
so anybody that was looking forward to
taking photos in the dark with the no
date sorry no what you doing
take it flush on the jar Pokemon go man
okay this a clubbing as a thing alright
people close I mean you're the right age
right let's jump into the chat Fran al
from meth Amman Massachusetts ed hey
Roger what are your thoughts on the note
eight are you going to upgrade I am you
know what I was considering it because I
kind of like the stylist in the fact
that I can jot on it on the lockscreen
which is I think it actually has some
text recognition which would be kind of
like basically a report I know that yeah
I feel like reporters would like to
thank that but I don't think you're
gonna do that
Jessica does it though she writes she
actually actively uses it she just not
record when she's talking if you do the
thing oh really yeah like there Bixby or
something I don't know there's no record
button you can like turn it off screen
maybe maybe she just jot notes down I
don't know you got that Jessica I prefer
personally I like the idea I want to see
what the pixel to looks like before I
make any kind of decision you know I
thought about this with the essay too
cuz I like the essay and especially
size-wise using like s6 edge right I'm
using the s6 edge which is terrible so
I've kind of swapped it out for a loner
pixel which I love and so I'm kind of
hoping that the pixel two is big
upgrades that would make my decision
process a little bit easier although I
have to say like the and know right and
also has a headphone jack
fo Jack is clutch which yeah if you look
at it maybe the pixel Tuesday you try to
shove my lighting port by lightening
headphone into my eye pixels keep me
posted on that pixel to I'm in the
market yeah
alright Michael Brown or buddy Michael
Brown oh my god thank phone makers in
this case Samsung care for stealing
consumers from competitors or as
everyone just kind of set in their
demographics I would say Samsung is
probably keen on stealing from other
Android makers and yes they would
ideally like to steal from iPhone
customers or iPhone users but do you
think that's actually part of the
strategy or are they just kind of
fingers crossed
I mean they strategize around doing it I
just don't know if they're actually
successful at that yeah I feel like if
they wanted to steal from you know other
their competitors like specifically
between Android and Apple they make
their features a lot more similar today
I think they I think everyone kind of
knows at this point like it's really
tough to get someone to switch operating
systems especially if they've been added
for a couple years so I mean I think for
them it's looking more at you know
Xiaomi and looking at low budget guys
looking at LG LG but looking at various
other Android makers and looking at
Google and pixel customers yeah I think
if anything Google and you know Xiaomi
and Huawei they're the ones that are
trying to build something to steal away
from Samsung yes absolutely I was trying
to steal away from Brett the other folks
I mean they're looking at market share
but because there's there by far the
most dominant player now I think that's
you're right they're they're less
mindful of that they're more like we
want to make sure we make my healthy
stones as well if anything Samsung is
trying to steal people away like based
off of their software like they have
their own like TouchWiz thing going on
there yeah but that's never really been
successful like the sales point of like
come you know come join the Samsung
family you you get to use TouchWiz I
mean I never big spear ight now well
yeah but it's not really working so well
yeah no no no one is by that phone for
big speed let's just say that trying
they are trying I don't think they're
succeeding though they're succeeding
more than their brand and the quality of
the build of their phones let's talk a
little more about phones and loyalty you
said you've got the s6 edge right yeah
Matthew - are the - and the Chad Lord
says I know I'm in the minority but I
don't like large phones I picked on my
Galaxy s4 for the first time in months
and I forgot how nicely fit in my hand
I'm with you - I'm running a loaner LG
v10 right now and it's too big no I just
I still use the 5s I'm probably gonna
upgrade to an S II and that's like the
furthest I'm going because I'm like it
has everything I need and it still gets
some of the later security on the head
of dual camera I don't tell you it's
awesome I don't I don't take photos
especially if people I mean I just
mostly take flows my kid yeah and for
that it's got so many portraits over
your kid
you have so many portrait it's a little
tell you tell me when the dual camera
thing is on the front because I feel
like that's when these portrait photo
these fake bouquet stuff is gonna be a
lot more like prevalent but yeah yeah
that's true you can have your single
camera selfies well the whole deal with
selfies is don't you want to like see
where you are the background it's all
blurred out you know people just want to
see themselves that's that's just if you
want to do the background that's when
you get a selfie stick they bother to
ask other people to take photos I saw
that I'm always disappoint because the
flows are turned back on Matthews note
though I wish everything were just
smaller just make everything tinier tiny
phones
ergonomics a little bit Zoolander yeah
yeah I we've kind of like it's this
weird that's it's an interesting point
cuz everything else the technology is
like shrinking but our phone so yeah
that's no sense yeah there's actually a
question for me in the chat whoa this is
unreal
ooh Chris Wesley says what about you BVG
are you up for an upgrade or you're
waiting for something great I am up for
an upgrade and I'm just kind of biding
my time right now you're looking at
switch I had an iPhone 6 which I drowned
earlier this year don't ask how yeah and
then I was borrowing an HTC One yeah
also drowned which I bent bent bent it
oh it's a metal phone so I guess I could
Bend easier yeah and then now I'm like I
said a run in the LG v10 it's a nice
phone but it is uncomfortably large for
my personal compression that V live from
LG is kind of analogous to the samsung
note lines so they're always gonna be a
little bit bigger
yeah right now if I was to throw money
down and buy something I'm looking at an
s7 and s7 active oh for sure so you
can't break it their life and durability
is right now that seems to be what I
need to go for yeah but I mean but as
far as functionality goes I'm fairly
comfortable in both iOS and Android I've
been pleasantly surprised by all of the
above yeah the whole size thing was the
biggest reason why I switched from
Android back to to Apple for iOS really
yeah it was basically I was looking for
a new Android phone outside but I had
had an Android phone like loyally for
like oh there aren't that many and then
it's all I hey here's all these giant
yeah all right well the worst part about
it for Android filmmakers is like they
they've gone into mindset like bigger
means better so all the small phones
they make if they do make some small
phones they're all like a step back in
terms of speed and capabilities so yeah
it's either like get an awesome big
phone or a crappy little phone yeah so
I'm just gonna get the small iPhone
worked out for me you go let's go back
into the chat Michael Brown what will
you need out of the pixel to to keep you
away from Samsung Galaxy Note 8 oh don't
say headphone jack that's it that's the
biggest thing
well headphone jack would be nice dual
camera lens dual camera lens waterproof
yeah all the wireless charging you know
all the the kind of typical bells and
whistles I just want like I know the
pixel original pixel camera was was
better was rated better than the iPhone
camera and so I'm hoping that they can
kind of keep that up that their their
camera technology continues to be sort
of best in the industry that's the case
I mean that's a big selling point for me
and then just the fact that it's a clean
version of Android is yeah it's a bonus
also I'm not sure what price point
they're gonna go with on this one that
that's the one thing that's been eluding
me as far as all these like leaks and
rumors goes well I don't think they're
gonna go with like a thousand dollar
price that's the thing but I mean the I
mean with Google's like flagship phones
for a while up until the pixel you know
we're gonna keep this affordable like
300 yeah yeah and they change they flip
this one pixel cam yeah we're gonna make
this a real expensive and the remember
to be working with HTC HTC tends to make
fairly high end phone so yeah I'm saying
if it's at least if it has all those
features that we talked about yeah wish
list and if it is at least like 200 or
300 dollars less than the note eight I
think it will yeah yeah my guess is the
small the large will be 615 750 or round
that around last year's pricing level
I'll simply make like a small version
that'd be incredible
ooh a pixel mini yeah mini pixel you
know what the favorite is don't they
just I don't know they don't maybe
they'll sell well they'd be customers
just because people want giant screens
to watch to like binge watch stuff on
their phone yeah and they kind of look
at this point they equate smaller with
cheaper like they don't expect they
don't want to pay the same price
for a smile I have no problem with
smaller and cheaper that's no no no
that's okay
cheaper construction like yeah yeah okay
I got it
let's take a hot second and talk about
birds birdy Michael Brown imagine they
are coupled with bird watching mmm I'd
like to see you flesh that idea out
exactly how you picture that kind of
plan out because that's a curious
thought imagine a scenario where like
you pull up a bird that you're like you
think you're looking at you like oh I
think I'm looking at this it'd be like a
sparrow in whatever I don't know a bird
it'd be like a real-life pokedex
yeah like you you pull up your phone and
like in real life this birds flying
around and then you can sort of compare
to the one you're seeing with your
actual eyes and you can sort of see if
there's similar or not if you've got the
right bird that would be a good kind of
reference a way to reference whether or
not you're looking at the know wasn't
Google working on something like that at
least with identifying business as attic
yeah but that means that the the concept
and the technology could possibly be
there yeah developer by any chance the
imagination but it'd be interesting to
see if that was possible and they didn't
as really as a species cataloging as I
was reading the story though a lot of
those like old school birders were like
well that's the day of birding dies
basically like yeah if you when the
human aspect gets taken but you don't
yeah well you basically don't need to
know anything about birding you just
point your cameras like oh it's this
thing yeah that's when bird-watching
dies because that's like that's what the
sports all about and let's support
that's what the activity is all about
right yeah going out there identifying
or no like they have up or stargazing
and that's not like stargazing is dead
no like pointed up and like see what
constellation no but that was Matthews
follow-up was what about AR astrology
yeah they have that already it does
exist I've never tried it
I'd be kind of interested to see if you
could actually bring that into the home
three mobile device where it would be
more like an interactive in-house
planetarium type thing yeah because I
love going to the planetarium but it's
pricey
oh yeah it gets pricey grass tyson
degrasse tyson bring that price
but I do love it and it'd be kind of
cool if you could rig that up to a
projector put it on your ceiling right
and go stargazing in your house cuz I
mean for those of us that live in the
city you can't see the stars as well
yeah that's just a thought yeah I went
on a camping trip I was really excited
to do some stargazing and then my sight
was underneath a bunch of trees no I
said like it right here I have to where
I'm staying that was already set up I
was it back on a are though yeah we
talked about how birding if the if the
mobile device identification was brought
into that and it would essentially kind
of kill the sport that's not necessarily
true either I mean this might be a
slightly offensive analogy to people but
I mean hunting still exists and no one
needs to hunt for their own food anymore
it's an activity right right like there
are a number of things like outdoors
about the catharsis about the enjoyment
but the idea of birding is the idea of
going out there looking at these birds
and using I guess old-school methods to
identify what these birds are whether
it's looking at them looking up in a
book trying to listen to the call for
your book wasn't it the same thing as
like looking it up on your phone I guess
but it's so what it dies because it's
faster to find out something well no
because you're not trying to find out
anymore you basically point you're what
he's saying is you point your phone at
it and it'll tell you immediately it's
this thing and you're not judging the
favorite is with a book I mean there's
that beauty of birding or just being
able to see birds like in there like
natural habitat being no no no no a lot
of it is finding specific hard to find
bird it's like Pokemon it's finding and
look and try night somebody bomb on you
can find it immediately though they
don't have to pull out books to like
know what Pokemon it is okay fine
not the right analogy but I'm just
saying that that's it's it's not
necessarily just like looking at random
birds like going after him finding
specific birds in the wild yeah Who am I
to disagree with expert birders on what
shows their reports oh that's right
before we go any further a correction on
my part Matthew doctor pointed I stood a
stralla G instead of astronomy and I
yeah hey or astrology or astrology like
this guy's a storm is gonna fly at you
so tramping over you Freudian slip have
a bad day today sir sorry about that I'm
an idiot
one more question before we let it go
Jackie asks I'm confused as birding the
same thing as no riddle run ah no
there's a or Naruto run - it's great but
Oh God they poof the little ninjas
behind no you're joking but like I feel
like that's a thing that could be a very
realistic way to do it I'm gonna make it
now make million that could be your yeah
you know like I've out see that I've
retired so on Saturday I got a link to
another event it was a scream like Goku
in front of Washington Square Park oh my
gosh is and I was like no one's gonna go
to us and then I gotta I saw a video of
a bunch of people just like screaming
little babies a bunch though it was like
more than the Naruto I actually went to
this instead which what has a larger
base definitely Dragonball Z but birding
probably has larger than both of them
yeah yeah there are a lot more birds
apparently it's a growing a girl calling
a sport this is a sport it's a hobby
it's a hobby it's a growing hobby
yeah isn't like a majority of people on
our staff now like into birding I think
because I think yeah I think a bunch
wasn't either read the story or just
talk to Shanklin I have become birders
at least folks on SF people in New York
number I look at pigeons all the time
the city yeah we just we just have
pigeons we actually have a lot of
Falcons in the city really yeah and like
I've seen it cool I've seen red-tailed
Hawks in New York City actually has the
largest population swallows and like has
like a really large not larges
I don't know where the largest this
might be New York I don't know but an
urban area of peregrine falcons which is
like the fastest animal on the planet
because and yeah because they eat
pigeons they like dive-bomb and in like
religions in like eat them you watched
like you've seen it was great I haven't
seen it in person but you've watched
YouTube clips yeah also on planet earth
- like that's part of their oh cool okay
okay nice any other questions about
birding note or t-mobile Netflix no no
not this time around but we should
clarify make sure to look at the actual
t-mobile Netflix article that we'll post
in the show description yeah it is
important it's not
like all no holds bar you get Netflix
you get yeah yeah yeah there are a bunch
of caveats to it there you know
including the quality of Netflix you get
why yes you get the standard you plan
which is HD get the the premium yes
which I mean to there to be fair like
they're you know big they intend for
this to be mobile although you can watch
it on anything and you know they've
really been kind of lowering the the
quality of the streams going to their
phones they argued like a 4k stream
doesn't make a difference in your phone
like you're not gonna know yes your 4k
yeah cuz no phones at 4k screen and if
you do want if you do pay for a premium
plan already it'll basically take $10
off of that plan so you pay two bucks
and we're not trying to be overly
critical there are there you should read
the story there are definitely some
details you want to know about the plan
it starts September 12th yep and yeah if
you're a if you're on a t-mobile one
family plan that's important table one
plan not one of the other discount plans
with legacy plan like that Mon Thank You
eligible yep alright anyways I think
that's about the right place for ya for
