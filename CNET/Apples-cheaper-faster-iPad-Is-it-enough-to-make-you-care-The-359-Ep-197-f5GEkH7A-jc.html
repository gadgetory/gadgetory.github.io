episode 197 of the 359 slash do it a
very different podcast parent very
sensual I was going to go there but sure
I'm tired
I was ready to get excited and then just
drop down from there well maybe you got
an excited it differently well no I got
excited about the fact that Roman reigns
can't wrestle is in our chat yes let's
get that reference what are we talking
about don't my Tapley
all Apple all days yes I'm sorry can we
talk about the phone I drowned last
night uh yes you can get a new iPhone 7
in red no thanks ok and it won't drown
either it's waterproof yeah it'll
survive man go survive your rage and
it's red like your rage that is the most
appropriate argument ever alright so
yeah Apple had a bunch of news today
they actually kind of quietly release
everything via press release this
morning but we've got new iPad new color
for iPhone 7 7 plus a new video editing
app and more storage for the iPhone se
so we're gonna break this all down for
you shortly and just as always if you
have any questions on any of these
products on the Apple Samsung whatever
we'll take any questions at this point
give it a brian-brian will pick out the
best and we will answer them in 3
minutes and 59 seconds from exactly 3 2
welcome to the 359 when we talk about
the top tech news of the day only other
crap you want to throw in I'm Roger Jane
I'm Alfred hang well Apple had a busy
morning the company announced via press
release a new iPad a special edition
read iPhone more storage for the iPhone
se and a new video editing app called
clips so let's all let's break it down
Alfred what's new with the iPad well for
one they are dropping the air named the
air is no more it's just iPad the air is
gone sucked out but it's also dropping
in price it's 300 $29 now for it's 32
770 dollars cheaper yep and it's also
got a new chip on it's running on the a9
it used to run on any a 8 X right it
runs on basically runs on the same chip
than an iPhone 6 and 6s have now right
and they boasted the display would be
brighter mm-hmm they don't really give
us details on when a retina it's a new
Retina display ok also the iPad Mini 4
survives the iPad Mini 2 is no more but
before is still around and it's
basically improved its storage so I was
only confused by that because the Mini 4
is 399 right yes so it's more expensive
than new iPad yep does that make any
sense to you no I think they're trying
to basically promote you know the 9.7
yeah yeah everybody buy this it's
interesting that you know they've done
this before back in the third generation
iPad they reverted back they went from
iPad iPad 2 and then back to iPads and
they're just gonna go we're just calling
iPad now and that's it I mean to be fair
there were so many iPads around like
what iPad am I on at this point is this
I mean look we're a period where a
tablet tablet mark has definitely been
shrinking Apple just seeing quarter
after quarter of sales declines do you
think this is this will do anything to
prop up sales yeah I think price is a
big point you know apples the iPad is
the best-selling tablet out there right
now but you know it's not selling as
much as it could be right and the thing
is is that I think price is a good point
on that on that end and then also if
they're making it faster if they're
making it cheaper I think it'll entice
people but I still think tablets will
always have the same problem where
people aren't buying you know tablets
every year like right that might be a
smarter decision as to why they're
making them cheaper now though right
moving on the new color of the iPhone 7
and iPhones
Plus is red special special edition it's
for the charity it's for the red program
which works to fight HIV and AIDS in
Africa ya Apple has long supported the
red charity program it's the first time
that an iPhone gets the full red
treatment are either of you guys looking
to buy this thing come on it's red it
stands out no I mean if I were in the
market for a new phone I'd consider it
but I always put cases on my phones
anyway so color doesn't really matter I
got a clear case on my phone you can
clearly see that it's a black phone
which is like every other phone out
there yeah which I'm perfectly fine with
I don't want my phone to stand out right
so I mean look this is a I mean you
could say this is very an incremental
update to the iPhone it does give them a
little bit of an excuse to kind of waive
their iPhone flag out there a week
before Samsung's set to release its
Galaxy s8 phone so have to wonder if the
timing of this is coincidental I don't
really see it I mean it makes sense for
them to kind of have want the their
headlines out there you know it's a kind
of you know hey we're making you know
these updates also but I think if they
really wanted to take away the spotlight
they would have announced more you know
software and hardware updates as opposed
to right you know we've got a new color
if anything the SI news is what's
exciting me a lot more all right we'll
see yeah that's the iPhone se gets
doubled capacities 32 gigs and 128 gigs
for the same price as 349 so most
affordable iPhone out there and then
lastly there's Clips a new video editing
tool that seems to be a mash-up between
snapchat and Instagram but without the
social network our own Scott sign kind
of calls it iMovie jr. making it easier
for you I'm excited to see if people use
it I mean think about like the editing
tools that you had on vine and the
amazing content that yeah and frankly
iMovie was way too complicated to use I
never used it yeah exactly
all right for more of these stories
sugars haven't seen it I'm Roger Cheng
I'm alfred hang financial swing
right away in the chat we got Joey's he
says one step forward one step back
increase the power but the disappearance
of some features is a saddening affair
no longer anti-reflective display coding
and no longer laminated do you think
that's gonna be a big crusher for the
new iPad or headline of the price I'll
agree that it might be a step back I
don't think it's like a giant leap back
but yeah I mean look the bottom line
it's faster and it does have a better
display again on a caveat that if people
are willing to buy tablets I'm not even
sure that's the case anymore
I mean a lot of people at this point
they own tablets and they're pretty
happy with the ones they have so I don't
know the interesting thing though is
that it's the cheapest now that they
killed off the iPad Mini 2 because that
started at 269 right but now it's like
okay well we're getting rid of that one
so now that your cheapest option is at
three hundred and twenty-nine dollars
instead
true which is kind of frustrating why
you get rid of our cheapest option and
then call this one the cheapest thing
available well I'm the apples done that
they've done that with a Mac line - yeah
this is definitely a way for them to
kind of squeeze some extra profits out I
know they do it I just think it's
frustrating yeah yeah totally uh Roger
your self-proclaimed early adopter are
you gonna get the red no no I still have
an original iPod the red Dino the Nano
yeah yeah I got that was a nice looking
iPod it still works yeah as opposed to
my phone I'm just I don't know like a
lot of people like to put emphasis on
their phone colors and just like how out
sleek their phone looks and things like
that and the aesthetic of it and for me
like it's in my pocket all the time I
don't know everything look in the world
that we live in everyone seemingly
owning an iPhone or a samsung phone
everyone wants to be a little bit
different I mean they don't want to be
super different like with a completely
different phone they want an iPhone but
they also want to have it stand out this
is definitely a way to appeal to folks
who are a little more if you know
they're a little bit more fashion
conscious a little bit more focused on
trying to stand out from the
that's that's what I guess I've never
considered a phone a fashion accessory
totally is for a lot of people to say
this the same way that I look at you
know it's part of your identity you'll
get like gucci wallet or like louis
vuitton underwear where i'm like no one
is going to see it maybe one person or
people who do I know without me I'm not
even wearing any underwear right now so
yeah that's name brand dykes on bikes
I'm joking by the way yeah sure it's all
the way Vuitton Yahoo's asking how is
the red color going to fight against HIV
I think they're basically selling the
excess unsold iphone7 because it's time
for the new iPhone 8 that's a little
cynical how funding like fundraising
work right I mean that's the one thing
you can't criticize because charity is
charity the proceeds from this phone 107
proceeds and again it's not the revenue
assuming the profits go to this charity
which basically doles out grants to
programs in Africa that are designed to
fight HIV and AIDS this is these are not
X that these aren't like old iPhone 7s
that they repainted to go through this
process they'd actually have to create a
new process to apply like this red paint
onto it so it's not like Tim Cook is
just sitting in boxes of iPhone 7 their
own Souls like yeah this will do it
here's a good idea you talk about how
you know the fashion accessory aspect of
it what if they made product red ear
pods so that people do see them yeah
yeah I wonder if red will start
venturing into other elements of red
Apple already has a ton of red products
in terms of accessories you know cases
Beats headphones or a red addition these
are like super red right I say their
default color that's true yeah but babe
there is a red additional in it yeah but
so I could totally see it moving to air
pods because it's sort of natural leap
in terms of getting including more red
products in the mix
hang on I had I had one and I lost it Oh
Raja he's calling out I mean do we know
how much the percentage of the profit
that goes to the charity because he says
he wants Apple to give 100% or else it's
just bait well they
say the press release 107 of the
proceeds I think that's the profits
obviously after the the cost of
manufacturing right but they say it's a
hundred percent nice and I think it's a
number but they've actually it's pretty
significant they've contributed 130
million dollars
well you can't hate on them for that you
gotta at least appreciate that
Alfred you are an avid snapchatter have
you are you looking forward to
experimenting that's my aunt ellipse but
the thing is is that I'd like to see if
it picks up in popularity because
there's a lot of video editing apps out
there already a sure thing is that you
know not everyone uses them if this is
going to be one of those Apple default
apps that you know you can't remove from
your device I can see a lot of people
using it well the thing is if you've got
your if you pull up your your camera
roll your in your video and there's
already kind of like a default link to
and I'd use yeah clips to edit stuff
yeah cuz right now it's the the default
is to go to I mean yeah and I know one
does I've always been annoyed by the
inability to edit like functionally on
your iPhone too when I'm using my Galaxy
S seven I edit clips on that all the
time and it's not even you know like
adding effects or anything it just seems
like a very simple thing that like I
would prefer to use act like rotating
the video also if it was shot like
vertically and I just want it to be you
know horizontal for Twitter or on
Instagram
and that's primarily what the video
editing tool is gonna be for you know
write more for your Facebook and
Instagram videos and so there's my
messages to your friends
noteworthy that they're going with the
square squares yeah because it's better
for Instagram right exactly
it'll be interesting to see how much
customization you can do on it where
snapchats like really cool where you
know you can draw on it you can add your
own stickers and things like that you
can adjust like you're sure these things
that I'm really interested in is this
Auto transcription service oh that would
make like so much captioning yeah just
basically will read what you're saying
or hear just
caption for you yeah which is huge on
face and the most interesting thing to
me on this though is the the ability to
add a soundtrack to your videos because
so whenever I snapchat by the YouTube
licensing yeah yeah but by the way so
that that feature was available on
multiple different phones blackberry HTC
have had these video editing was built
into their phones which basically auto
generates yeah yeah with music it
happens for years yeah counterpoint
though no no no those phones did not
like take high enough quality videos for
me to want to use that that's arguable
like at that point those were high
quality video at the point what do you
use it was a flagship those reflection
phones with pretty powerful cameras at
that point those videos were fairly high
quality I'm so concerned examples camera
though well know relative to apples
compared because they came out with the
study years - right you can't really
compare to an iPhone cell well yeah I'm
on that point though there's like a
bunch of apps that let you do that -
that's right oh it's not the point being
it's not Apple being particularly now
you know I'm just it's one of those more
of those like finally moments as opposed
to like wow right right exactly yeah
but on snapchat anytime I wanted a song
in the background I'd have to like go to
SoundCloud or like Spotify loaded up and
then yeah so I'm I'm interested in it
yeah no I
it's available it's not available right
away by the way it's been April right
but we are checking it out I could use a
video editing tool right absolutely
producing all our videos now at using
this we will be quit playing with
another iPhone Bryan props to Alex in
the chat quote no I hate all of these
Nokia 3310 in red is the best there you
go except it won't work in the u.s. yeah
he's not in the line it's true if you're
Europe you're you're you're golden also
indestructible so maybe that's what he's
not really destructible but it's pretty
damn close
I'll see about that let's see what
skills is going on in the chat today
true oh do you think they're gonna
maintain any of the other features from
the iPhone 7 and this iPhone red
waterproof so on so forth yeah yeah it's
it's completely it's just a phone 7
button red so all the features that you
enjoy with the 7 now with 7 plus just
getting ready
so I'm actually I'm hoping they can't
everything on the camera shoot I'm
hoping the next version will have a red
version maybe even a blue like I want
different colors I don't want just I
don't know yeah a little bit Rhodes
golden and I'm very exciting in the
colors yeah black silver regime they're
like muted tones except for the red one
which I guess is kind of like part of
the strategy like this is the one that
sticks out also it's for charity
yes yeah so you'll feel good well you
but and also boast to everyone else like
hey look I donated
that's right I'm fighting AIDS what are
you doing with your phone alright that's
probably a good place to wrap it up for
the day let's plug one more time if
