have something extreme and show you
today the r1 000 g router from amp
wireless now that's a lot of zero but
that is not what extreme about this
router but first I take a look at how
normal it is this is a standard router
with square shave and it's made of
plastic that is kind of flimsy if you
squeeze it and make some noise but don't
you get home though on the bottom here
the router has four rubber feet for it
to stay flat on any surface but it's
also come with two holes for you to
mount on the wall and it comes with a
base a small base now the bait is very
small and the routers very light so it's
hard for the whole packet to stay on the
surface in a vertical position without
toppling pretty easily on the back here
at the router come with for land port
and 11 port all of them are gigabit
after buff the router come with two
cable plug into it one port and the lamp
or to make it easy for people to set up
also go back to the bottom here unify
the label that show all the information
you will need on how to get up and
running so what is so special about this
router here come the two extra large
antenna these are detachable but they
have to attach the router to make it
work you can just screw them in like
this ok screw the mean slowly 110 so
these two antenna plus the power inside
the router offer extreme range in fact I
couldn't figure out how long the range
was in my testing because my office is
on a cig floor and I could get only as
far as through and 50 feet from the
router before having to jump out the
building which I didn't do and the
rattle top that distance so basically
this router offers the longest reign
I've ever seen in fact is so long that
this is the only router ever seen that
come with a feature that allows you to
reduce is power in case all that reigns
is too much to bear for you now as a
wireless router this is a single band
router that works only on a 2.4
gigahertz band and in my testing it
for a decent Wi-Fi performance not too
fast not too slow but definitely more
than good enough for sharing the
internet for the process around one
hundred fifty dollars the router would
be cut expensive without the range but
with the range is a great investment for
anybody who want to cover a large amount
of space you should also check out the
full review etsy.com if you want to
fight down more about how the router
performs and other features once again
my name is down low and this has been
the first look as the are 10,000 g
wireless router from my</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
