what that means nothing of any real
significance it's time for the 359
podcast however I'm BVG and today we
have Roger Chang and Alfred Eng and we
are here to instill fear in every Monday
is something big happening besides being
episode 299 of the 350 that's not huge
tomorrow's huge but no we're talking
about crack we're gonna be time the
crack my favorite yeah no no not that
kind of Silicon Valley's got a real
problem that's true we'll be talking
about the latest Wi-Fi vulnerability
Alfred our security expert will will
break it all down for you we're also
about 5g if we have enough time I don't
know we're gonna spent a lot of time on
crack you can stop by the bed bath
beyond just forever so everyone knows
this is crack with a k' with the care
it's not the drugs all capitalized so
it's different yeah so anyways as always
if you have any questions I'm sure you
will leave them in the comment section
but I will pick out the best and we will
get to them in three minutes and 59
seconds from 3:00 to welcome to the 359
I'm Rutter Chang I'm Alfred Eng so we're
talking about crack no not the drug it's
short for ki reinstallation attack and
chances are your Wi-Fi hotspot is
vulnerable Alfred you wanna break this
down for us yeah so the research was
released earlier this morning it's a
wpa2 flaw it's a you know type of
security for Wi-Fi this comes when you
through a 4 Way handshake system that
this Wi-Fi system uses in the third step
usually it sends the password over and
it does this handshake there were like
four different authentic authentic
haters and it comes back to your device
in this one it can continuously inject
like a false password or you know just
essentially getting rid of the
encryption port on the third step the
third part of the handshake okay and
then at that point it allows any
attacker to basically look at your
network traffic hijack your connections
and inject content onto basically your
Wi-Fi stream so they can put like a link
that you didn't click on into your into
your browser or anything like that it
should be important to note that this
they need to be nearby for this to
happen but you know can
the range of you know any Wi-Fi
connection you can be like down the
block and still still attack somebody
using this crack vulnerability a lot of
the advice that I have been seeing so
far is even though can decrypt traffic
from your network to your device it
can't decrypt you know stuff on secure
website so if you're going on HTTPS
websites yeah which is the majority of
internet your connections could still be
secure but the point is they can still
inject content into your stream anyway
so I mean look just idea that someone
can kind of sneak in there through your
your Wi-Fi connection is not great I
mean are we basically screwed cause a
lot of people a lot of these hotspots
all use wpa2 so what is the fix for this
or is there yeah wpa2 is very common you
know like you said there's a lot of
devices that do use it a lot of security
researchers have already said don't stop
using wpa2 you know what else I've heard
is really popular lately ethernet cables
maybe look let's face it a lot of our
devices are wireless mobile that's not
really practical it barring the Ethernet
solution is there something we can do
make sure the devices are patched up or
what yeah what's so fix a lot of
companies have already issued patches
for this after the announcement so
companies have known about this for
about three months or so but they were
working on a fixed towards it before was
made publicly public knowledge hmm
so you know patch your systems as soon
as possible the issue is though for a
lot of IOT devices they don't get
patches frequently they don't get that
many updates so if you have like a smart
doorbell that you know you don't want to
get patched or anything maybe consider
getting like a normal doorbell and said
it's a lot of like smartphone op objects
that are particularly vulnerable to this
all right next up we wanted to talk a
little bit about 5g Steven Shanklin has
a nice feature on 5g it seemed like it's
coming sooner than we thought it was
projected initially as 2020 when we
talked to folks who say that really the
first half of 2019 you might actually
start to see 5g phones and that's kind
of surprised when most people thought
that 5g would show up in your home and
sort of fixed broadband connection or
with Internet of Things type devices but
phones might actually get so that the
key
the phone is if you're in a crowded area
you know like a baseball game or
whatever usually your connection sucks
with 5g you've got a whole bunch of
capacity so your your unlimited data
plan will still go super fast
even if you're in that crowded room the
other benefit of this would be you would
not be affected by this crack outbreak
nice segways LTE has actually had you
know really good security we have time
that it's been out nobody's really been
able to hijack like an LTE network like
that so in that sense of it you know
that's another thing you can do if you
have the luxury of being on LTE all the
time just don't use your Wi-Fi on your
mobile devices or run it off of LTE if
you can afford to but with Phi G they
would definitely make it much easier yep
alright for more these stories and more
check us out on CNN promoter Jang I'm
Alpha ding thanks for listening I have
got a lot of work to do in the chat we
have for a while we have really wanted
and it's awesome thanks everybody for
your great comments I'm gonna try to
filter through these so that we can
actually address some of the questions
cuz everybody's really is going back to
crack I just like saying that yeah
especially when it comes to smart home
devices IOT devices we talked a little
bit of this before the podcast began
like does this mean that I should
be trusting more I guess name-brand
smart home makers or or is everyone yeah
I mean you have to have more of a
liability to update it has their name
brand you know there's a difference
between oh like going on Amazon as an
update versus like there's a you know
the scrutiny behind you know no-name
whatever I don't want her right right
right some no-name Amazon like okay all
of five people are affected by this but
if Ness doesn't update then it's okay
this is an entire ecosystem of IOT
devices there are you know gonna be
mismanaged on this so it does sort of
reinforce the idea that when you're
buying smart home stuff you do have to
buy your the shop smartly you have to be
a little bit more choosy about what
kinds of equipment who you're buying
from I mean the other issue the bigger
issue that I'm looking at is you know
Wi-Fi enabled like ATMs and cash
registers and everything like that
because that a lot of you
vulnerabilities you know when it comes
to something like a store like I don't
know
Whole Foods or Pizza Hut or Target all
of which were breached because of bad
you know security on their end on their
hardware that's like I think where the
biggest issue is you know when these
like major companies like these breaches
happen and you go there and you buy your
quinoa or something and next thing you
know you're like credit-card information
is stolen because of a vulnerability
like this because that terminal is also
using wpa2 yeah right got it that's I
mean that's what that's how most of
these breaches happen got it
so there you go like that's I think
that's the bigger concern with this one
is as you're saying like it's not just
your home it's not just your own
personal products or devices it is
that's the thing like think about how
many places use wpa2 I was taking the
train into work today and you know on
the MTA they have like the Wi-Fi I'm not
using that are you kidding yeah so yeah
usually when issues like this happen you
know it you you should take a like
obviously take a look at your own
devices first but then you know kind of
look around you I like little gate look
at your local Starbucks of the Wi-Fi
that they use right and any cafe that
you go to the airport it's things like
you have to be considering like are they
updating so what about your home Wi-Fi
like I've got I've got a Verizon FiOS
modem believe he use wpa2 like what what
do I do with the switch there yeah you
can switch it yeah the bulk of the
questions in the chat is yeah what
specific devices are vulnerable
I think it's anything that any wpa2 yeah
so if you have as our just said if you
have a router or something that runs on
the PDA wpa2 switch it yeah change it
around that's like it looks like a
pretty simple fix and you know stay away
from websites that don't have HTTPS
which you should always do anyway mine
at the C net fortunately is a HTTPS as I
as I'm like what like three months ago
like nice plug yeah so what you're
saying is potentially anything there's
really nothing that's kind of white
listed on this it could be a router it
could be Phillips hue yeah I'm just
going through the list of some of the
contributions from the chat right now
my mat dacher says does crack affect all
wpa2 including enterprise installations
that use 802 dot 1x authentication I'll
have to look in into that I mean like
this broker I'm like 5 a.m. this morning
right you're still a lot of details
emerging from this and does this
actually could kind of affect a mobile
hotspot on a phone asks Donna yeah I
mean if it says it's running on wpa2
encryption yeah potentially yeah
so the general consensus is am I screwed
it's like yeah it's not quick bit over
not trying to be inflammatory like this
is legit terribly the idea behind the
whole like issue like so there's you
know monitoring your content and if
you're on a website that doesn't have
HTTP you know you could enter your
password in and then they'd be able to
just snatch that out of like the Wi-Fi
right but there's also yeah the issue of
like injecting content so let's say you
go to google.com but you're on like a
network like this they can kind of send
you a website that looks like it's
Google and then ask you to like log in
and then get your password that there's
like a lot of issues that come with this
okay Rob asks how do I know if my router
uses wpa2 and how do I switch you can go
into your router settings for that I
mean I believe it's different for every
router for money well your router should
have an IP address listed somewhere in
the manual printed on the bottom you
should find it easier like if you have
like like I have my finest bottom the
information is printed on sticker on the
modem it's so then when I set your Wi-Fi
password you can also set the type of
encryption that you want it to have
change it from wpa2 most likely would
help fix that what and what is the
alternative like what's the one there's
like tlk PS and there's always like
other stuff I like it's not coming to me
right now but right there there's a lot
of options okay
Michael Brown is asking how can you tell
if your Wi-Fi has been breached
I mean it's hard to tell there there's
no like warning sign out there or
anything like that that's the issue of
like Wi-Fi breaches is that they're very
you know hidden because your Wi-Fi
doesn't know the difference like it just
thinks that someone else has connected
to it so I mean the best operating
procedure then is just
assume you've already been hacked and
just change everything I mean the most
like like to me I don't think you know
the average person is gonna be targeted
by this but either way you just want to
keep yourself safe you you know the
don't think that like people aren't
gonna be after you right I guess you
know most of the times attackers look
for something that's like the easiest
thing to hit and if you have a
vulnerability like this yeah and I think
that do you put the subway acts like if
you see free public Wi-Fi you should
probably stay off of it yeah yeah yeah
basically stay away from any like kind
of like watering hole attacks so a lot
of times attackers look for places where
a lot of people will be in connect to
the Wi-Fi yeah how I don't know is it
alligators or lions how to attack people
at water animals at water alligators
yeah sure yeah yeah weird analogy it's
called the watering hole attack
let's keep coming up on that analogies I
was gonna call it the Goldilocks
syndrome like you say no one is safe
they think oh they're not gonna could be
after me I just if the door is open
yeah that's basically it and you know I
think it's really important to pay
attention in these kind of breaches or
not breaches but just like announcements
of these vulnerabilities and patches
making sure that your products are the
latest because when you're a large
business and you don't patch that's what
happened to Equifax and that's why I
have the country's social security
number it was one guys fault the corner
just subdued yeah poor schlub yeah so
for in Equifax this case they had it was
the Apache server like flaw that was
announced in March and they didn't patch
it and I think that's used it I think
that's what makes this scary is that
there are gonna be plenty of Equifax is
in this situation that we plan to come
back to ignore this is way easier to
break into them than the issue of
Equifax so that's what you know
obviously every person out there should
should you know patch their own systems
but but we also have to hope that
everyone else yes yeah yeah is like even
if you do everything right you could
still be breach because some like super
market that you go to update their self
true full disclosure I mean I've use
wpa2 at home for as long as I can
remember and I didn't know buy this
until I came into work this morning's
was like
crap alright no one no one really knew
that it's time broke this right but I
mean if I had actually checked the
headlines before I walked up the door
this morning would have a different
story but I mean I don't even know if
the time I had what I'm going to switch
to but it's a cat suddenly we're
suddenly all have to be Wi-Fi security a
spurts well this is all information
we're gonna have a ton of coverage FAQ
is explainers how to's on how to make
your networks a little bit more secure
how to defend yourself so definitely
check that check it all out seen it
Alfred you may be getting some calls for
me tonight oh boy frantic calls I'm just
gonna be on stream like the whole day
because like Skype the whole thing and
just like my panic attacks as I'm home
calling Alfred tears my timer is on wpa2
also no all right I think that's as far
as we can get right now like we said
it's still kind of early it is a lot as
the stuff is still breaking we're gonna
have plenty more to talk about the next
few days the problem is the updated yeah
but thanks for tuning in and Roger you
want to send us out yeah as always if
you liked anything you saw or heard here
check us out on CNET our podcast is also
available on iTunes
TuneIn stitcher SoundCloud Feedburner
and Google Play Music we'll see you all
tomorrow see you tomorrow thanks
