an air intake kit in your car the first
one is to optimize air flow that is to
make sure the engine is never starved
for the air it needs to combine with
fuel the second reason is to get a
cooler temperature on that air let's
start with the optimized air flow you
need to make sure that breathing is free
because there is so little time for a
cylinder to be filled between 0.02 and
point oh six seconds depending on the
engine's rpm anything impeding that air
flow means it doesn't completely fill
the cylinder with air and gas and that
is reduced volumetric efficiency when it
comes to cooling the air that is
important too because if you're a call
from high school science class cooler
air is denser air denser air has more
oxygen molecules in a cubic inch more
oxygen combines better with the fuel to
get more power out of every time you
fill and fire the cylinders this is what
air intake kits are alright of course
I'd love to install an air intake kit or
just about anything on an f40 but I
don't think it needs the help
however our photographers also has an O
6 Tahoe with the big v8 it could use the
help
let's do it bring it in here we go don't
lose a mirror you got it or you just got
it ok looks good sell so this won't hurt
a bit
okay we'll start by removing the factory
air intake system which you can see is a
whole lot of plastic dreck okay first
thing in the airflow is this air box
right here this is where the air filter
lives I'm going to disconnect the mass
air flow sensor and then if I lift this
off and pull off the lid here this is
your traditional air filter which is the
sort of pleated paper thing you can't
see through that right I mean you're
gonna see a big difference when I put
the new one in this is rather dense and
air gets through here rather slowly and
down here is the bottom when that thing
sits and I want you to see this these
are the intake nozzles on the old air
box and notice what they breathe through
a couple of holes punched in the sheet
metal here on the inside fender well it
gets air from basically down the right
side of the fender it's a little bit
occluded because the air has got a
tortured 90-degree path to make up a
narrow channel here so that's gonna
improve our air flow right there by
getting rid of this turn this corner
okay now I pull off the electronic
connector for what's called the mass
airflow sensor it's this guy right here
let me try and remove that because this
part we're gonna keep a mass airflow
sensor you can just see right through
there it's got a screen to bring down
turbulence on the front and on the back
it's got electronic vanes that can
measure the volume of air that is
rushing across this thing it's the first
piece of electronics that tell the
engine how much air is on its way to the
throttle body which is where the real
intake begins we're gonna put this back
in now the last big piece we got to get
rid of is this big kind of ductwork this
plastic plenum I've loosened it up from
the throttle body right there you can
look in there and see the big butterfly
valve which is the beginning of the
fuel-air mixture chain we're not going
to screw with that that's serious stuff
but this is a large very convoluted
thing that has all kinds of warming and
cooling chambers in it which we're going
to get rid of and this may change some
of the cold-weather behavior of the
vehicle
okay it's what we've done now is we've
removed this big kind of occluded air
box with that pleated filter and we've
built up this heat shield this is going
to be our new replacement for the air
box and I've mounted the mass airflow
sensor on it this thing just sits down
on some studs here notice how much more
of a flee breathing apparatus it is than
what came out and now from the heat
shield and mass airflow sensor we're
gonna put on this little coupling it's
getting us to the other key part of this
a great big pipe big diameter very
gentle curve and not a bunch of chambers
off of it where turbulence can build up
and impede the flow into the throttle
body
so all in this will take you about an
hour it's not a difficult job it's one
that requires that you fit and pre fit
things to make sure that the clearances
are all good and important to points
keep all your old parts just in case and
secondly don't leave anything inside
this apparatus not a washer not a nut
nothing because after the filter there's
no other gatekeeper that keeps things
from being sucked into the engine the
fastest way to a $10,000 bad weekend is
to suck a nut or a washer into your head
now parts like this always have these
hot rod stickers that come with them
I don't stick them on my car instead I
use them as a contact gauge take a piece
of it put it upside down here with the
sticky side up then pull your hood down
if you want to check clearance if it
doesn't stick to the top of the hood you
know you've got at least a little bit of
an airspace there and you're not rubbing
on the underlayment in the heat sheet
okay now the last part which is putting
in the only service element and the
coolest-looking part now may be that
pipe is and that is the air filter
notice how different that is from what
came out completely different shape this
guy you can't see through this guy's a
little hard to tell but if you look
inside here far more breathable this is
an oil impregnated material so it's not
as thick because the oil helps to draw a
dirt out you service this thing once in
a blue moon you
wash it in real it probably almost never
put this guy in and see how this thing
runs okay our filter is snugged up so
let's see what we've accomplished we've
nailed all of our goals by getting a
much more cool and unobstructed airflow
cooler here because we have a metal heat
shield a little more air around it it's
not so obstructed because it's not
coming out of this tortured little turn
here in the fender well graceful large
diameter pipe so overall we should have
a cooler easier flowing intake to get to
the throttle body and into the
mechanicals of the engine let's see if
it drives or sounds any different so on
the freeway you get why this is
different
Wow what are you hearing yeah yeah yeah
definitely different yeah yeah that's it
even that big comb filter we put in
there there's not just air going into it
but there's also noise going back
through
so engine noise there was only tramps
it's Gaza they're very different
here we are 3000 rpm so we get a chance
open up a little bit see if you feel any
more power any more torque it says right
here this gets guaranteed to increase
horsepower
we this is what I think is the placebo
effect people put these things and they
go we have feels faster that's all right
there a little more torque maybe you can
also my puzzles better gas mileage not
want to get my PG babies you're
monitoring your gas mileage here I guess
what a carcass sizes always anything is
he going anything else yeah
thank you very much booty hotel sounds
good pleasures mine you got my usual
3030 guarantee here we have 30 yards
were 30 minutes actually passed both so
you're out of horn yeah now here's why
self oh didn't find his Tahoe is night
and day different after putting in the
intake kit these are dyno results from a
vehicle like his with a kit like that
here's horsepower gone up from 249 to
257 that's not nice day here's the
torque difference 245 to 253 foot-pounds
again a little over 8 foot pounds or so
but notice on both of these the
improvement is on the high end of the
RPM range where factory intake systems
tend to make the engine run out of air
that's very common this helps address
that this is really good for high rpm
run oh by the way self so grab me in the
hallway there today and said he's
actually feeling the power and torque
improvement since we put that air kid on
more and more as he drives the vehicle
so that's good news as is the fact that
no parts have fallen off yes
