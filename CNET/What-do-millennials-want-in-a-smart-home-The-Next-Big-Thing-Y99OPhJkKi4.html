first real smart home generation what's
that going to look like if your
imagination is running to a 3d printer
on the kitchen counter and a drone
flying around the outside of the house
and a humanoid robot bringing martinis
let's come down to earth the top smart
home devices already owned by
Millennials are a connected TV a game
console and a streaming media device
sort of like everyone else those also
topped the list of smart home devices
Millennials are interested in getting
around to buying alongside thermostats
cameras and security gear connected
speakers and lights vacuums and door
locks all Kanna tied bottom of the list
connected personal care devices
I guess that's bad news for that
artificial intelligence toothbrush I saw
at CES but Millennials begin to look a
little more unique in their unanimity in
wanting all their smart home gear to
work together no questions and to work
with they're connected wearable if they
have one the AARP generation not so much
they're more focused on smart home as a
remote control technology when they're
not home and privacy that has its price
70% of Millennials are okay sharing
their data in a smart home environment
if they get back good recommendations
about news media or fitness choices
bottom line by the end of 2017 across
all demographics
even the most popular forms of smart
home tech will be in fewer than 15% of
US homes but by 2020 that reaches almost
30% and starts to feel more expected now
