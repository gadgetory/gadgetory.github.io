appliances and this is the manual write
us H 67 Pro so while this $400 robot
floor cleaner has a lot of features I
kind of wish they had stuck to the
basics because they get bogged down in
options and kind of skipped out on
performance first of all it's designed
to vacuum it has a mop mode and it also
has a hybrid mode which can vacuum and
mop simultaneously in addition to that
it has an intensive mode which is kind
of like a spot cleaning mode it cleans
in a three by three foot space it also
has a shadow cleaning mode that's kind
of unique for robot floor cleaners it
goes into spaces that are shadowed it
goes under your bed under your table
under your couch anywhere that has extra
dust bunnies and cleans so looking at
this thing it's basic if not a little
bit boring but when you actually look at
the display it's kind of confusing
not only is it confusing it also doesn't
really work that well I press the Big M
button for mode and sometimes it goes to
the mode sometimes it doesn't it was hit
or miss and inconsistency that you
really really don't want to see when
you're trying to simplify your floor
cleaning also on navigation it has no
idea when it's finished a cleaning cycle
it will run and run until the battery is
low and then it will go back to the dock
and half the time it doesn't even get to
the dock easily it can take 10 20
minutes just to find the dock we did
speak with a manual representative who
said that it will clean as long as it
senses debris or until the battery runs
low but we really didn't experience that
we only noticed that the battery would
run low and it would try to head to the
dock
unfortunately these design and usability
flaws also transferred to poor
performance more than anything we
noticed inconsistency in the testing the
only time it was consistent was on the
rice test it picked up most of the rice
it did skip the corners but everything
else was clean on the pet hair test
I got error message after error message
asked me to check the brush over and
over and over again after 10 seconds 30
seconds 45 seconds of testing basically
defeating the purpose of having a
hands-off automated floor cleaner tons
of pet hair would get stuck around the
axle of the brush and jam it up and on
the sand test
I got regular messages to check the
wheels I checked the wheels I took the
wheels apart I cleaned the wheels
even after that I still got the error
message so that test was also pretty bad
the mob test was another story we tested
on hardwood vinyl and ceramic tile
floors and it would alternate between
cleaning the floors and stalling right
after leaving the dock and not cleaning
anything at all
unfortunately this robot vacuum is just
too inconsistent to trust it to clean
your floor's regularly you might as well
just do it yourself it would be way more
efficient and much less expensive
