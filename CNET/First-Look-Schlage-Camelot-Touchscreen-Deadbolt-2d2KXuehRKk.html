today we're looking at the shell Age
Camelot touchscreen deadbolt and this is
a deadbolt that retails for 431 dollars
but don't worry you're not going to pay
anything close to that
it goes on Amazon and some stores like
Home Depot for as low as 160 - just
looking at the lock it's a pretty nice
looking unit it's got this kind of
old-fashioned look there's also the
Schlage century touchscreen deadbolt and
that's the exact same price has all the
exact same features just looks a little
more modern if you wanted to lock it
all you have to do is press this laid
button here and automatically lock you
can also of course use a key or turn the
bolt on the inside just like a standard
lock but you want it to unlock it you
could also use a code and we have a very
creative code of one-two-three-four
totally feat proof right but that will
unlock it automatically and you can
program up to thirty different codes the
deadbolt also has a built-in alarm you
can customize in terms of sensitivity
and what sets it off you can have an
alarm that only goes off with the doors
being broken down or an alarm that goes
off of someone's trying to pick the lock
or even just a very soft to beep alarm
that'll go off whenever the door is open
and closed so you can keep track of
people coming in and out and testing it
out we found out that all the codes and
the alarms worked very well and the best
part is you can program it all directly
on the touch screen it's all very simple
to do you can do it right here that's
great another huge selling point for the
shell Age Camelot touchscreen deadbolt
and the sentry deadbolt too is that
they're compatible with the nexia home
intelligence home automation system and
that's a great system that we also
reviewed check it out but what it does
is it hooks your deadbolt into your home
network and allows you to control it
remotely and that's a great thing you
can use your phone you can use the
computer their website their app
whatever you want to unlock the deadbolt
to program codes to do all sorts of
things and there's some added
functionality as well if you use nexia
you can also program temporary codes you
can make a code that will only work on
Sundays or only work for 15 minutes on
one day and then over it won't ever work
again and that's a nice thing if you
have like a pet sitter or someone
checking in on your house while you're
away on vacation you can give them that
option and know that they're not going
to be able to keep that code and come
back later now if you make a unique code
for everybody who might want to use the
door you can track all of that on the
website you can see a timeline of when
people came and went and maybe that's a
little invasive of privacy but it's good
information for the paranoid homeowner
without next year it's a normal lock but
it still has great touchpad
functionality it's programmable it has
the alarm and it's a grade one certified
lock it's a very high quality look if
you want to upgrade your lock and you
want something secure and kind of cool I
think this is a great option so if that
sounds like you give the slave camel out
touchscreen deadbolt a chance for seeing
that I'm Rui Chris thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
