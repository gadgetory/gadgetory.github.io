advanced iPhone to date but it's also
its most expensive so if you just have
to have it but you're not quite sure how
to afford it here are three things you
can do most phone carriers offer payment
plans that allow you to pay off your
device over a period of time you can
then swap out for the latest and
greatest after twelve months or as long
as 50% of the device has been paid off
programs like t-mobile's jump on demand
give you three free upgrades a year or
if you'd rather not be tied down to a
specific carrier you can always try
Apple's own upgrade program apple's
program works a lot like the wireless
carriers the difference is you get an
unlocked phone to use with any carrier
in the US and you get a year's worth of
application surance
that would then for you up to shop for a
better deal on a carrier and save even
more money if you're looking for a
single line of service Sprint's free
year of unlimited is tough to beat
you'll still have to pay fees and taxes
and not all phones work on it but it's
free
virgin also has a similar deal but for a
dollar a year same goes for family plans
Sprint and cricket are the current
cheapest and before you toss out that
old phone make sure it's helping you pay
for the new one just because it's old to
you doesn't mean someone else won't be
ready to snatch it right up Craigslist
or Ebay may give you the best price
because you're dealing directly with the
buyer but you have to arrange delivery
and payment if you want someone else to
do the dirty work for you Best Buy
Amazon and Apple are just a few places
that will buy them from you but you'll
get gift cards instead of cash echo ATMs
give you cash but may not give you top
dollar and if all else fails you can
always give up that Starbucks addiction
for nine months or forego the gym for a
year</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
