welcome to the apple pie for all the
good at-bat inside the world of Apple
we've got a bunch of stories after the
big a's head chef recently spoke at the
d11 conference to do not that guy we're
talking about Apple CEO Tim Cook and he
addressed the current state of Apple now
we all know activity and excitement
around Apple has recently slowed down
that's the perception and the show me
something tech world and sometimes
perception can be reality so how did
cook respond to the question if Apple
has lost its edge the same culture and
largely the same people that brought you
the iphone that brought you the ipad
mini that brought the ipod and some that
even brought the mac are still there the
culture is all still there many of the
people are there and yeah i think we
have several more several more game
changers in US whoo because i thought
they were really running out of ideas
not really but one of those products is
yes the Apple TV and cook had this to
say about it it's not an experience that
that I think very many people love it's
not an experience that you would say has
been brought up to date for this decade
it's still an experience it's too much
like it was ten years ago in many cases
20 years ago I don't I don't want to go
any further on this because I don't want
to give anybody else any ideas they have
it but don't already have cook wouldn't
even hint if it was ready to come out
this year now Tim also said he doesn't
see the mainstream appeal with Google
glass and added that the wrist is
interesting in the wearable tech space
but gave no hints that Apple had
anything coming anytime soon also WWDC
is just a couple weeks away and cook
went on the record to say Apple will be
rolling out the future of iOS and OS 10
and we're super excited about it
he also talked about the role Johnny
eyes has played with the new iOS Johnny
had contributed significantly to the
look and feel of Apple over many many
years and could do that for our software
as well I think it's absolutely
incredible and what about that Apple TV
again it continues to be an area of
great interest to us Tim come on throw
me a bone man you're still giving us
nada now when asked about if Apple ever
plans on having multiple iphone models
Cook said that Apple may one day release
a second model alongside the flagship
iPhone they haven't done it yet but that
doesn't mean they won't all right to the
rumor mills and the latest iPhone
rumblings since Timmy won't talk about
it maco to car reports that the rumored
low-cost iPhone will ship with new
colors but depending on the source the
colors range from white navy gold orange
and grey would seem like a really muted
and Joel color set from Apple but could
also include pink green blue and yellow
orange which is not to be confused with
the individual colors of yellow or
orange Oh important they also report
that the iphone 5s will be largely the
same but it will support a dual LED
flash this time around and the
microphone on the back side will have a
rear circular shaped hole I'm just
telling you what the report says now
it's also rumored to come in standard
black and white but gold and green are
now two new possible color options so
pretty much any iPhone that comes out
could be any color that exists hey Brian
Burgundy's my favorite color um thanks
Elsa alright an iPad news report from
citi research says their supply chain
checks indicate that they not only
expect a lower-cost iPhone but a sub two
hundred fifty dollar ipad mini they say
there's an emphasis on more inexpensive
devices with competition from other
products like the 199 Nexus 7 duh now at
249 for an ipad mini just don't expect
it to be a retina version at that price
and a story that you might care about
the big a has agreed to pay 53 million
dollars as resolution for a class action
lawsuit over the sensitivity of their
liquid damage sensors in iPods and
iPhones apples policy was to deny
repairs to a broken device if the
indicator had been triggered even if it
could be triggered during normal use
without dropping it in water so some of
you could be eligible for a payout up to
three hundred dollars if your warranty
claims were denied for an iphone before
december 31st 2009 or an ipod before jun
2010 and before we go just a heads up
for those of you who still wanted to get
your hands on those cool al13 aluminum
frames from last week our buddies at
think buy em are offering twenty percent
off if you use the code Apple by 10 is
good until June the first so I really
dig these frames and the word check it
out alright that's gonna do it for this
week's show send me your emails to the
apple byte at cnet com I'll get to as
many as I can I'm Brian Tom thanks for
