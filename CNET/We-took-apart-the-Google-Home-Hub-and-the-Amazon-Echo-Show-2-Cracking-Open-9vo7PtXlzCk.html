at CES 2019 I'm Jason Heiner and as Phil
tetlock Detweiler with tech Republic and
has become a tradition for us to close
CNET's live coverage by cracking open
popular tech products and today we're
gonna cut open the Google home hub and
the Amazon echo show too so bill let's
get it started right tell us about what
we're gonna do with the Google home hub
yeah you know so these were two of the
most popular smart home gadgets of the
year in fact we just gave away one of
the echo shows here live right I seen
that stage a few moments ago and so we
always think it's a lot of fun to take
these apart to see the tech that's
actually inside them to make them run
and to find out you know if they do
break how can we repair them and how can
we fix them and make them last a little
longer eliminate a little a waste so
it's a lot of fun for us too and if
people are interested in seeing more of
these they can go to
CNET's youtube channel and Reyn the
whole cracking open channel full of
videos of us cracking open all kinds of
stuff that's right so let's get started
this is the Google home hub now I have
you know precooked this a little bit
right so it's just like a cooking show
yes it's not that exciting for everyone
up here to watch me take a heat gun and
to heat the adhesive on the edge of the
echo show to and melt the adhesive in
there so I precooked it a little bit it
also helps me not have to break the
screen it does happen sometimes when we
damage these when we're cracking them
open we try not to so I'm gonna go ahead
and we're gonna try and pry the screen
off now all right with the echo or with
the Google Home Hub here the way you get
into this device like a lot of these new
tablets and phones is you have to go
through the front and the front panels
are held on with some really sticky
adhesive in most cases Aaron song and
it's designed to prevent dust water
other substances from getting inside the
device it's also designed to provide a
little bit security to hold the parts
together but we're gonna slowly work our
way around this
well you tell people what tool you're
using here bill yes so when we first
started doing this we used everything
from kitchen knives and razor blades now
we've gotten a little more sophisticated
and we've got special screwdrivers we've
got these little metal picks and tools
here we actually have these old-school
sort of plastic spudger x' these are new
but anyone in the old telecom is known
for its what they used to use to put
wires into old telecom boxes so you can
see that we have the screen detached
from the front of the Google home hub
and that was pretty easy it's usually
not that easy in real life we can see
the adhesive see gets really sticky
there yeah you can also see now if I
were to just pull this off and I would I
believe break the screen so I don't want
to do that now these have Gorilla Glass
on them or they have really strong glass
but still you put enough pressure on
them and you bend them enough and they
will break so we have a cable right here
that we're going to need to detach these
are foldable or flexible foldable cables
here and I haven't cracked this open
before so this is kind of all new for me
while we're doing it um we're gonna try
to do this without breaking it looks
like there's a catch here now sometimes
I can use a tool other times the best
tool I have is my fingernail yeah so we
popped loose the latch and now we can
separate the screen here from the home
hub and it's you know this is designed
if you break it if you crack it you can
easily remove this and put this back on
you know it not for the average user per
se but it can be done with that now we
have one of my favorite parts of the
cracking open and that's to see how many
screws are inside this thing yeah I like
mechanical connections I like physical
connections but screws can sometimes be
a little bit of a pain and there are
quite a few screws in here and I'm gonna
go ahead and remove those luckily I have
a variety of screwdrivers that we can we
just have to figure out which one fits
this one's a little small dents they're
not just normal Phillips head or flat
their own drivers now your regular screw
so why don't you talk a little bit about
that about how do people get these
screwdrivers like the ones that you're
that you have where Turner's around this
the better shot
there how can they you know get the
right tools the right equipment to be
able to do this at home
right so it mostly the Internet I mean
sometimes you can find tools at your
local hardware store
these are Torx screw drivers so they're
not really that difficult to find but
they are small like these are T zeros T
ones T double zeros and sometimes those
can be a little hard to find at your
local big box hardware retailers so you
usually have to find those online but
they're not thanks to the Internet
they're not hard to find like you can
get them on Amazon or I'm gonna write
Amazon you can get it from specialty
dealers I actually have a kit from some
of our friends over and I fix it they
actually came on stage last year and
helped me repair an iPhone yes so there
are a lot of companies out there as the
DIY repair market has grown they've been
able to it's created a market for these
type of tools anyway one thing I do want
to mention you know when I do this I'm
often not wearing sort of the safety
gear that I would recommend people wear
when they do it I'm doing a backstage if
I was doing this really I wanted my own
devices I'd wear a wrist strap that
would give me some ESD protection I
would wear a safety glasses perhaps we'd
make sure that we were grounded so we
wouldn't have any sparking things like
that here it's not too bad I'm not
worried about it I just don't want it if
there's the biggest security concern or
safety concern is usually cutting
yourself that's happened once or twice
or you know poking yourself damaged
something like that or damaging the
component all right so let's see we've
got all the screws off of this piece of
plastic here I think let me see if I can
again I haven't done this before so it's
kind of I'm learning as I go as you go I
mean one of the good lessons bill you've
done a lot of these we've been cracking
things open since Xbox and iPod in 2006
were some of the first things that we
cracked open as well as the first iPhone
in 2007 so to crack these things open
one of the biggest people biggest
mistakes people make is they rush it
they don't have enough page
if it won't come don't force it right
that's right so I like to say you have
the hands of a surgeon and a patients of
a saint because it takes that really you
know you have to be really kind of
nimble with your hands you have to kind
of pull it a little bit here pull it a
little bit there and see where calling
that's right exactly it's it does take a
lot of patience you you want to make
sure that you're not rushing it
especially if it's your device if it's a
thousand-dollar phone an 800 'allah
phone if it's a 200 ollar phone you
don't want to make the problem worse and
I always recommend people they ask me
how difficult is it to do at home should
I do this at home and I say well it
depends on your level of technical
expertise if you're kind of a DIY or if
you feel like it's something that you
can tackle then by all means go for you
we should have the right to do that and
I encourage people to do it if not just
take it to the manufacturer send it back
spend the money and have it repaired
there all right so we've been able to
separate what appears to be the main
circuit board inside the and some of the
heat sinks here perhap likely inside the
hub home or the Google home hub here and
then we can also get our first look at
the speed it's inside the home hub and
so it looked we're gonna go ahead I'm
gonna see if I can take off the circuit
board because it's really kind of cool
this is one of the reasons I really
enjoy taking these apart because you
know a lot of the times the
manufacturers don't tell you I'll turn
this around so we get a better shot with
the camera a lot of the times the
manufacturers don't really tell you the
circuits there inside the devices
sometimes they do if they want to if
they really want to sort of talk about
how good they are but a lot of times
they don't and so I like to see they're
working yes I like to see what vendors
are working with I like to see how much
RAM devices have how much storage they
have how much because sometimes they'll
just say oh it has two speakers so it
has Wi-Fi connectivity and that's it and
I kind of want to know well how much RAM
does this thing really have how much
storage does it really have
that's a good point so that's a good
reason to do this sometimes you want to
do what we're doing here for repair and
sometimes you want to do it just to
learn that's right a lot of the times
when we crack these things open it's one
get open for the people that don't want
to crack it open people to crack it open
first before somebody else wants to
crack it open themselves and try it so
they can learn from our from from us
getting inside the device and then
sometimes it's just to learn more about
these devices themselves and like you
said it could have a pretty big impact
on a small company when you open this up
and you feel I realize like there make
this new startup or small our company
chip maker is making a chip for the
Google home hub right a lot of times you
will go and look up using part numbers
and things that are on some of these
chips to figure out you know who
manufactures this this part or that part
or this component definitely and you
know one of the things that's really
interesting is as technology has been
miniaturized and componentized
manufacturers were able to put chips and
they're able to put sensors into devices
in a much more interesting way and in a
much smaller space and so it's really
interesting to see what's inside these
devices well one of my favorite cracking
open word was the pair of the snap
glasses and so they were really cool to
see the kind of chips that were in there
and it was basically the same chips that
are used for law enforcement body
cameras which makes sense right in
essence it's just a body camera but it's
on your face alright so we can separate
the main system board here from this
little piece of plastic looks like
there's some contacts for the board here
probably a why us one of the wireless
antennas up here you know the Google
Home Hub does not have a camera on it
right so it has a pair of a far-field
what they call microphones that are
inside of it and then it also has an
ambient light sensor and we can see the
circuit board for the ambient light
sensor right on the back of this piece
of plastic here that holds the screen
onto the onto the base so we're gonna
put that aside
and now we're gonna see if oh good now
this is really interesting on circuit
boards a lot of times they have these
are almost always they have these metal
shields these are designed to protect
the circuits from electromagnetic
interference and so we can pop those off
usually sometimes they're soldered to
the board and what
could electromagnetic interference cause
it's just caused the device to
malfunction it could cause the device
itself if it emits any type of RF signal
it can cause other devices nearby to
malfunction and so you don't you know
all all devices like this are required
you know through government regulations
to be to meet certain standards and so
this is one way that they do that since
yielding basically to reduce that yep
and so luckily this is we can pop it off
here try not to bend your it's pretty
thick where you're being so you're not
forcing it you're finding just where
it's going to give yeah we're trying
here it's I could be a little bit more
rough but I don't want to there we go
okay so as we remove one of the shields
we'll see if this one will come off this
one might actually be soldered on so
that's the difference between this main
one right here and then these smaller
shields those are actually soldered to
the board so I'm not going to remove
those because I'm afraid it would damage
well I know it will damage okay the
circuit board itself and I do like to
put these back in working order when I'm
finished with them and I want to make
sure I don't do this to destroy the
devices people are like oh you're
cracking open a thousand-dollar phone
yes I am but I'm trying to put it back
together in a working order I'm trying
to learn from I'm not trying to destroy
it so we don't I don't cut these off I'm
not going to desolder them there are
companies that do that but I'm not I'm
also going to remove this this is a
little bit of conductive material that
helps with heat the transfer heat away
from the processor the main sock
whatever this has in here to the EMF EMF
a shield
EMI shield and then to the heatsink out
here underneath that we can see a bunch
of chips right so you can see the main
processor the main sock here which is
doing all the work you see a couple of
nano chips over here which are likely
RAM chips looking at these Isis back
you see the numbers I think if I can
make those out those are 128 megabit ram
chips so that's mega bit and not
megabyte right so it's you divide
everything by eight so I think yeah I
can't get those off but I believe
they're another two underneath there so
for a total of four of them and then you
can see I believe this is a I'm not sure
I can't really see usually that's the
thing that we use a macro lens for on
these yeah I think the wireless chip is
actually under here that would make a
lot of sense and then that's kind of all
there is on these things it's amazing
how many components that they can that
manufacturers can cram into such a small
space I really find that you know
fascinating and cool and this is the
brains that helps make the speakers
smart now you and I have talked about
this before it's not really this that
provides the intelligence for the
speaker it's the cloud running much more
powerful chips in data centers thousands
of miles away often right and so here we
have the speaker and this and the
plastic shell let's see I think the
bottom of this could come off here and
we do this like you said Jason we take
these things apart on scene it's a
YouTube channel you can go there and we
also you can see photo layouts of our
cracking opens in the CNET magazine now
the latest issue which is on a display
here at CES 2019 in the booth has me
with the latest ring video doorbell yes
remember that one well alright so we're
gonna take the bottom of this off even
more yeah circuit boards here this is
one of the board's that has the audio or
that's power I'm sorry the power jack
right there and you can also see my USB
a USB connector now that's not something
that is user accessible yeah but in the
factory it would have been used
your load software do testing things
like that before they put the before
they put the base on theirs if you were
to plug into that and plug it into like
a Linux machine or something like that
you have you would probably need a an
administrator password of some kind
likely to to actually access that but
and and there are you know again people
who are trying to learn about devices
that will do stuff like that and and
learn in the same way they'll try to
learn from the software the way that
we're also learning from the hardware
yeah let's see if we get these screws
out of here there we go and we can get
this other little board out ah really
cool that board is uh-huh again we can
the cable that was fed through this hole
and connected to the circuit board this
off ah there we go so we have the i/o
board here they put output board as we
would say in the power power board and
then we have the speaker right here so
see if we can get into the speaker I
think we still have a little bit of time
and we can separate the white case and
sometimes things go easily right this
was easy
pretty easy as far as cracking opens go
remember the s9 oh yeah that was not
easy when we did the back of this we
cracked that one right yeah literally
crash literally crash I'd open it I'd
like to say no I can I can count on two
hands in the number of times in the past
you know now 14 years that we've been
doing this where you broke a device to
the point that it was unusable and you
know of the hundreds of devices we've
cracked open now most of them you've
gotten back together in working order
now occasionally you'll get it back
together and then it's like something
won't work and then you'll crack it take
it apart again
don't you hate figure out what it it and
then he'll just hate it when you like
put something back together and you left
out a screw or when you break out the
furniture from and it's like I had this
screw left over and yeah I put my
dresser together or the bookshelf
together and I have a screw left oh
you'll get a device done and you'll hand
it to me and I'll go up I'll come back
and I'll be like the
no sound like oh I figured when I put
that ribbon cable back in I was afraid
that wasn't all the way flush or
something
so you'll crack it back open plug it in
but the point is you know you've made a
habit of getting these back together and
that and then our team our our team of
editors and journalists they'll test the
device that's right and learn from it
learn from the the actual behavior of
the device to share tips and and
tutorials and and reviews in some cases
with audience and and we really wanted
we're gonna do a lot more of that in the
future one of the things that we're
working on right now I don't know if it
will come to fruition there was a
certain manufacturer here here at CES
point on teen that shows off some really
cool televisions one of the ones it
rolls up into a really small box and so
I think we're gonna definitely try to
put a call out to them see if they'll
give us one of them so as part of the
test maybe they'll let us crack it open
I promise I'll send it back very cool
well I think that's it for the Google
home hub that's about it right now I
mean there's not much left you can see
that we have the speaker assembly right
here yeah and you know we still have the
little piece of plastic but you know
this is the point where we would
probably stop yeah um you there might be
there might be some screws that are down
in there that we could take apart if we
kind of had a little bit more time to
spend on it I'm not sure ah you can
actually take these speakers apart but
we also have another device that we want
to tackle crack oh right here this point
we can probably so we'll call this one
done for now move on to the it's
competitor that's right it's biggest
competitor in the market because a lot
of these you know we're devices that
were only speakers and now with both of
these devices they've added screens and
that's the big thing of course I've been
holding on to this screen it's still
pretty impressive how how thin they've
gotten these things to be so now that
we've got the solid way and we're gonna
bring in the echo show - Oh clean up
clean up a little bit okay you bring
that one uh you bring that one over and
we'll
we'll see what we can learn and compare
these two now this is the second
generation of the echo show and we just
gave one away earlier about a half an
hour ago like I said and I've never
crack this one open either either so
it'll be really cool for me to do that
it might also be a little challenging we
might break something and it'll be
interesting to see how it compares to
last year's model now last year's model
had the two speakers mount it at the
bottom clearly that doesn't appear to be
the case with this one because the
screen is pretty much edge to edge here
there's a black bezel around it but the
glass is edge to edge so what we're
gonna do is we're going to see what we
can find out about how we take this
thing apart now when I took this out of
the box earlier I notice that there are
these two little tabs right here yeah
I'm not actually sure what they're for
maybe it's a latch it to something to
add an accessory I don't know I didn't
have a chance they work like screwy and
tournament see what yeah we're gonna
turn them and see what happens so we
turn this we're gonna turn it looks like
it turns the other way and then you'll
notice that this one has a much much
larger screen than the echo show does
they pop off then the Google home hub
all right those come off and it appears
that this rubber base so I suspect let's
see what it's hiding underneath we're
gonna go ahead pull this off and lay
this down this will make a little easier
again you
Villas bills being pretty gentle with
these arm with this so it's just not
forcing it just flowers over here so
that was easy here now unfortunately it
doesn't look like there's any screws
there's no way for me to get into this
so I'm not actually I think that there's
a little trick to this and so I was
messing with it a little bit I haven't
cracked this open but what's messing
with a little earlier and so this is
kind of cool I think compared to the
first generation one this one is going
to be a little easier and so I think if
we start here along the edge that's a
better place to go
that's that's a good point you know you
start along wherever the sort of edges
are things
see will something just pop open well uh
oh just like we got a lot of screw we
have a lot of scroll fasteners like I
said screws clips that are adhesive
based because you can pretty easily
remove them and then reattach them but I
don't know this seems like a little bit
that's overkill here gonna um better
limber up your wrist this one and I
don't have an electric screwdriver so
while we talk I'm gonna be unscrewing
screws alright now what we can't see
right off the bat that is really cool
though we can see a design change and
that's one of the things that we really
like to look at ya generation to
generation so unlike the first echo show
which had the speaker's mounted up here
and here this has the mounted in the
back of the unit mounted to the sides we
have these two speakers here and then we
have this passive driver here actually
which this is going to help reverberate
and help the sound sort of move through
the chamber and come out so we're gonna
alright let's let's see what kind of
screws looks like we have a mix of large
Phillips screws yeah stay in that
Phillips screw so that's good and it may
be some Torx screws back in there and
that's kind of again it's condoms I can
make myself useful okay yeah sure okay
we can we could go at this from two
angles here try this
alright this will fit and we need to do
that one I think this one will fit down
into it Willie
alright try to get those tires out of
there oh yeah oh you're giving me that
you're giving me the good job here so
I'm gonna mark screws alright so that's
on one there just one this is a pretty
popular product you know the first one
people have been asking it for for this
for them to put a strange there let's
see what happens when we just remove
these oh okay
we might try these here too alright I
got I got one of those Torx screws out
at great your trust is well-founded yeah
now you know one of the big differences
from this device besides the larger
screen and the Google Home Hub the
camera this one has a camera in it
versus the home hub yeah yeah which is a
good thing or a bad thing
again yeah depending on who you are
depending on it what you want to do with
the device depending on where you're
going to use the device me I'm still a
little bit wonky about having the device
sing on my kitchen counter grab this
from you with the camera sitting in it
accidentally give it back it so you have
kids you're definitely more like you and
I do you're definitely a little more
sensitive to some privacy conscious
privacy issues and so and that's the
thing to remember with a lot of these
smart devices right is that that data
isn't just being collected on the device
you know depending on the Terms of
Service it's being collected and shared
with the manufacturer of the device
possibly with third parties depending on
their Terms of Service and so you do
have to make a conscious decision about
whether or not you want to share that
device and you know you're basing your
trust on the transparency on the
reputation of the manufacturer about
what they're going to do with the data
and what you think the manufacturers
whoever buys the manufacturers might
might do with that data you know they
may be a great company but they may not
be around forever
so just keep that into consideration and
so you know there was a long time that I
resisted having an Amazon echo in my
house yeah because I didn't necessarily
want a speaker recording me all the time
I have three of them in my house now I
[Laughter]
you know and so that is a lot of you
know you do break that kind of
resistance to it I mean I don't break is
the right word it's just the value prop
was pretty good for me
and so I decided to go ahead and give it
a shot and I really like it now and I
find myself I say this every year when I
come to the show it's when I come into
my hotel room and I check in I want to
wake up in the morning ask it what the
weather is and I can't do that and I'm
frustrated all right you're staying at
one there is one no hotel here that's in
the process of putting Amazon echo and
all of its rooms no reason we're able to
pop this little piece of plastic off
here and see our first bit of circuitry
down inside the inside the Amazon echo
show to hear again more screws in here
this is probably going to be one of
those 20 screw devices and and they are
this is why you do have to have patience
when you do this these are the speaker
I'm assuming these are the speaker wire
speaker connectors
that I'm detaching here that they're
showing on the camera
they wore you down to get the echo show
but I don't think they're gonna warrior
you down with all these screws to not be
able to get in this machine no no no
we'll take it apart like said whatever
we don't get done today we will actually
feature on CNET will actually probably
I'm gonna do this for one of the future
episodes or issues of the magazine yeah
and a future episode of cracking open so
whatever we don't do we'll do the whole
thing later you can find it and if you
go and watch one of our videos on the
YouTube channel you can also leave us
some feedback in some of the comments
and tell us something that you'd like us
to crack open because we're always
looking for new stuff to crack open we
regularly crack open new stuff as well
as sometimes even retro stuff so if
there's retro stuff that you know you'd
love to crack open we've prepped open an
Atari 2600 we've cracked open an
original IBM ps/2 we've got a cracked
open couple kinds of Commodore Amiga and
even some of new retro stuff like the
classic NES right that's right NES
classic that was really fun because we
were able to see that basically inside
this little box that Nintendo was
selling as the NES classic was an
emulator board there's a really cool
emulator board appear to be running a
Linux distro in there running all the
roms for the game that's really neat you
can see that one on our youtube channel
as well that one's up there so again go
to any of the videos on our youtube
channel and tell us what you would like
us to crack open and we will definitely
consider it
and she actually put it on the list yeah
send us a DA send me a DM on Twitter or
you can yep they were easily defined
you'll find Bill on Twitter at at Bill
Detweiler you can find me at Jason
Heiner you can find CNET of course at C
net at Tech Republic as well so any of
those you can we lost this drew that's
alright we'll get that later that
happens too sometimes yeah I can't tell
you how many times I've spent you know
how many hours over the years I've spent
walking around trying to find screws
alright so the first way is out we've
one of the looks like a USB connector
here and we've got the power connector
here we've got this is likely the power
board that drives the speaker since it
was connected to them
we haven't seen the guts that run the
actual inside so we're gonna lose we're
gonna keep looking here and looks like
we've got a lot of screws here I'm gonna
go ahead and take these off and see if
we can't get this black plastic here all
right while you this is the big reveal
if we can get this thing because this
thing is a lot bigger it is much larger
so we'll see how much bigger the actual
circuit boards are when we get in there
and you know and the funny thing is I
suspect they're not much about the same
that's what's really interesting you
don't need that much more attack that
much more space to do the kind of sense
to do the kind of sensing to do the kind
of computations on on these devices that
you once did it's pretty you know you
can condense those chips down to a
pretty spot pretty small space it's
important you know one thing that's
important to know that you mentioned
earlier bill is that you get a remember
the companies behind these Amazon and
Google are two of the biggest most
important most advanced cloud companies
in the world
they're doing a lot of compute a lot of
processing in the cloud and of course a
lot of the intelligence for these
devices actually comes from the cloud so
they don't have a lot of capability when
they are disconnected no from the
internet interesting you find something
no good I found that that was
interesting in the fact that we're gonna
take these speakers out yeah I'm still
trying to figure out a way to get this
to separate from there yeah I wonder if
it might be through the screen we're
gonna I'm gonna take my every screw in
the back and see we still might have to
guess I still might have to go back
through the screen and that may be the
last thing we do here today see if we
can get it might take us our whole time
might take us the whole time there but
we're gonna go ahead and take the screws
off of the speaker here okay that's the
one thing that I like to do first I like
to remove the screws first like to look
for any type of snaps before I really
start to mess with adhesive in the
screen unless I know I have to
because you just increase the danger of
cracking the screen and the problem with
that is that it's hard to find
replacement parts a lot of times yeah
especially a couple years ago used to be
really hard before companies like Apple
started making it easier to take your
phones into an Apple store to actually
be repaired now you can do that you used
to not be able to do that and you can
see the speaker is kind of flopping
around inside I'll turn around show you
the shot with the camera maybe you see
the speaker's kind of flopping around in
there right in yes that's probably not a
good sign for the fact that these screws
probably don't hold the plastic here on
to the front they're just holding the
speaker's in place but we're gonna keep
going and see what we can I'm gonna
remove these screws here and then we're
gonna see what we can do we might be
coming through the yeah we might be I
don't know you're the cool sorry go
ahead no no no no go ahead I was gonna
say one of the cool things you know
CNET's mission has always been to help
demystify technologies and at first that
was involved computers you know and then
eventually it was TVs as TVs got more
advanced and smart phones and now it's
it's more so devices like these the
smart speakers which are powered by a
lot of AI and complicated algorithms and
things on the back end but helping users
understand what this technology is about
you know what they can learn so that
they can put it to better use in their
lives you know those are the kinds of
questions that scene that's always been
about answering and and today there's
just always a new technology that is
worth demystifying and this is one of
the these speakers these smart speakers
are one of the biggest most important
ones today and one of the interesting
thing is this battle between Amazon
Alexa and Google home is really the
biggest battleground of CES 2019 so it's
it's pretty fitting that we that we end
with this in our last segment here on
the CNET stage because this really has
been one of the biggest stories maybe
one of the biggest subtext of this show
is this this growing battleground
these two ecosystems which are trying to
approach this this problem in similar
ways alright so you've got all those
we've got those there's two more here
and then I think we can lift this whole
thing out okay and that sometimes happen
sometimes happens I didn't see them they
were here okay and there's like four
more screws so actually I could have
left all those screws in there but
that's all right I think it's more
riveting than seeing me remove screws
from these devices you wrestle with
these things for an hour where you're
like I know that this comes loose I can
see that it jiggles a little and there's
just a screw somewhere or some kind of
catch that I'm missing there we go so we
can remove this hand there it is and
there it is
so this is the speaker assembly here
good job and the speakers are clearly
stuck inside this and there's again what
do we have a lot more scripts um one two
three four five six we're not doing well
you are gonna do those we're gonna try
to get in and we're gonna try to look at
the circuit boards now that's the cool
part you can see on the camera over my
head but massive it looks like heatsink
here so and then tied to the circuit
boards underneath oh yeah we'll see what
happens and let me give you might try
that see so so what either one of those
works sometimes these are of different
size Torx screws I think but that one
might be too small for that and you
might try that one right there see you
that one this one I think this one's
actually a little bit okay
actually that one's a little too big
this one's just right the Goldilocks
screwdriver right wrists and fingers
I'll let you hold it there so we're
gonna remove this heat shield and that's
interesting so you can see the heat sort
of the way it dissipates the heat sink
here and then you can see the heat sink
here and that's something that's kind of
you you know a difference that's
interesting to look at at least we find
it interesting I forgot there's one more
part of this that this job I said you
have the patience of a saint in the
hands of a surgeon but you also kind of
have to be a hand model
to this so st. surgeon hand model all
three wrapped
to one early the clean fingernails right
that's usually what I try to do a big
part of it all right so we've got all
the screws here off of the Google or the
echo show too and we're gonna pull this
off all right so now we do have a much
larger circuit we do wrong and we find
that all you know that we learned things
about these devices all the time when we
take them apart just like that we have
ideas about what might be inside but we
don't know for sure until you take them
apart why we do it and obviously with
the camera inside this and some of the
other components it Marbley needs a few
more yeah processors chips on the board
so we're gonna go ahead and disconnect
all these little cables because with
this device you can do you can actually
videoconference with people like
something similar to like a FaceTime
call right with this device but not with
that's right the Google home hub so
Google home hub interesting liz has
focused a little more on privacy whereas
this devices focus a little more on
additional functionality also remember
that one of the big reasons that people
wanted one of these devices that they
said they wanted it was to play youtube
videos and on the first version of the
echo show you could play YouTube videos
for a while but then because of the you
know ecosystem Wars Google stopped them
from doing it stopped their ability to
do it so now you can watch YouTube
videos on this but through this device
you have to do it through the web
browser reminds you of the old VHS beta
right yeah
or those ecosystem Wars are never good
for consumers almost never right they're
usually their usual hostile to consumers
we saw some good developments in that
regard here surprising developments at
CES of Samsung working with Apple right
iTunes is going to be on the Samsung TV
so you figure if those two companies can
work together after there are many legal
battles you know maybe maybe there's
hope maybe there's home cats
maybe there's hope for us all exactly or
maybe there's at least hope that you
might be able to play youtube videos on
your on your echo show someday
so we've got the circuit board out a
much larger circle let's continue let's
compare that so a lot larger circuit
board here the echo show to hear their
second version of that code show and
then to Google home hub let's pop off
but you see a similarity to the same
arranged sort of thermal paste here it's
thermal pads not thermal paste yeah more
you see the same shielding on the boards
we're gonna go ahead and see if we can't
pop some of these off it does look like
they can be removed a pop one or two
it's an S a pop one or two as an example
so you're pretty much down to the end of
this one - you got both of them
accomplished in one segment live on the
stage there we go take these little
shields off we can see some of the chips
and I'm kind of interesting to see this
because that I haven't seen like said I
haven't seen inside here I don't and I
haven't seen anyone else do this yet
obviously I don't have time on stage to
look up all the chips that are inside of
it but this is pretty interesting l that
off and so yeah we see there are some
markings on there again like you said
what we'll do is we'll take our own when
in our in our office in our studio back
in Louisville Kentucky you'll take the
macro can't lens on a camera and you'll
take a little dose up of that and then
you'll be able to really look and see
some of the markings letters numbers run
the chip and that's how you figure out
and that's where they make what's inside
it that's how we figure out who's
putting the components in it what the
specs are the real specs are sometimes
beyond what the manufacturers put up
there so yes stay tuned for that if you
want to find out what's actually in here
we'll put this up on the site at a later
date after CES and yeah you can find and
you can see more of them on the YouTube
channel as well very good bill Detweiler
well done another one another successful
cracking open all right that's all the
time that we have and that's the end of
our life programming for CES 2019 we
hope you had as much fun watching as we
did covering the show this year even
though we're signing off here you can
catch all of the videos and all of the
reviews of the show of CES 2019 online
just head over to see not calm they
watching by everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
