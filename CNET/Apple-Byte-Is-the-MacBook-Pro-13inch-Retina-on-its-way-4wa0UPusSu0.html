welcome to the apple pie for all the
good and bad inside the world of Apple
everybody this week it's a short show
but it's better than no show it's not
like one of you guys is gonna be able to
do my job anyways but going on vacation
and I'm gonna be lying on a beach with
oil all over my body and I do this for
you because who've you got a let's hit
you with some news everybody and praise
the Lord we are not starting off with
iPhone news in macbook pro 13-inch
retina news a second benchmark for the
product labeled MacBook Pro 10 to has
surfaced and suggests the model will
debut with eight gigs of RAM just like
it's bigger 15-inch brothers now the
profile of the machine from the latest
geekbench scores include a 2.9 gigahertz
intel core i7 processor and eight gigs
of ram running an unreleased build of OS
10 mountain lion 10.8 point one and yes
if you guys are starving like i am for a
tidbit of imac and mac pro news internal
configuration files found in mount line
appear to make references to unreleased
versions of the imac and mac pro in the
context of both machines having us be
booting options now could possibly
indicate that the next gen desktops
could lack a built-in optical drives but
it seems more likely for the imax and
not the mac pro if you ask me now the
imac is identified as IM 13 oh and the
mac pro is MP 60 we also saw a geekbench
score for a new imac model back ma but
we're still waiting on its official
debut you guys you also can't escape
iphone use but at least i didn't lead
the show with it new screenshots of
parts for the dock connector for the
cable side have appeared on french
website nowhere else FR and indicate 8
pins but the metal frame counts as a
grounding pin and that could be the
reason for the discrepancy in reporting
and images of the purported next gen
iphones battery have made it online
revealing a thinner
higher capacity battery with a new
higher voltage of 3.8 volts and a
capacity of 1440 milliamp hours which
are both improvements from the iphone 4s
okay enough the news stories in yeah we
know we might miss a big one or two this
week because I'm gone but we wanted to
dedicate this segment of the show to you
the Apple biters by reading our emails
all right let's start off with Hannah
Ella or liens and she asks what gadgets
do you use that aren't made by apple
well Miss Hannah I have a PS Vita for my
gaming a new cleaner for my e ink reader
because I don't read books on my iPad I
love love my bose noise canceling
headsets i have a canon sd1000 for
pictures and one other battery powered
device that i cannot talk about in front
of children Mike all right Roberto says
I'm writing you from the biggest city in
the world Mexico City hey amor is it
time to get an Apple TV or do you think
it's going to have a chain soon please
let me know Roberto are you that same
guy from that lady gaga song where
people are dancing their underwear well
it doesn't matter but if you're talking
about the little black box from Apple
it's a good time to buy but if you're
waiting for the potential Apple TV TV I
still think it's going to be at least
next year alright i love this sweet pic
from caleb mal i'm a sucker for pictures
that's my twitter pic also follow akash
where are you from my mother shawna ass
can you tell me when all of apple's
products are coming out so i can save up

this year we know that mid-september
October it's pretty much prime for the
new iphone ipod touch and ipod nano I'm
still not sold that will see an ipad
mini then or a revamped ipad and i still
think we'll see a new imac and macbook
pro 13-inch retina laptop before the end
of this year maybe late October but

new apple TV will be pushed to next year
