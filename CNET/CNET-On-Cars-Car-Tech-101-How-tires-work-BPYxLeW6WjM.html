subject alone and put us all to sleep
but instead I want to touch on four high
points about tires that I think you can
keep on your mind as you go shopping for
them first thing to know is the big
concept which is your tire isn't this
big blob of rubber there's a lot of
engineering going in here a structure
that is built to operate a certain way
not just hold air
and unlike just about any other part of
your car this one changes shape rather
dramatically when it's working that's an
amazing thing to keep in mind as well
now the first concept is the contact
patch or the footprint that's where this
tread here sits and meets the asphalt
and it varies in width and length if you
will kind of this way depending on the
tire design pressure and your cars
weight what happens at the contact patch
is amazing that footprint allows three
major things to happen first of all for
power to be applied to the road as the
wheel is turning one way in relation to
the car and for braking to happen as the
wheel is being resisted kind of in the
opposite rotating direction in relation
to the car and then you've got the other
two axes which is kind of out and in
clatter aliyah cross the tire that's how
cornering happens and you get that nice
grip and all of those dynamics typically
will happen all at once or within a
second of each other and the tires got
to be able to deal with all of them well
the next thing that we all notice very
much and you should be aware of is the
profile of the tire its height with
relation to its width now we love our
low profile tires they look great on
almost any kind of car it's got a big
trend the last few decades to get this
sidewall lower in relation to the width
of this tread but what does that is the
frame inside the tire they're called the
belts they're made of either Kali ester
or steel and they don't just bring that
profile down when you do
you change the nature of how the tire
operates in two kinds of loads one is
radial load the load that comes if you
will kind of vertically down on the
tread the stiffer this is that may
change the ride comfort you get more
drumming in the car you get less of a
soft compliant ride and this low-profile
tire also has a very different behavior
for lateral loads which is sort of the
side to side load think of it as a
cornering load for the most part this
low-profile sidewall is stiffer the
tires gonna kind of scooch less left to
right as you go in and out of a corner
that's great for performance but that
can also harshing up your ride because
there's less give in this overall design
it's a trade-off between that sharp
performance and that comfortable
compliant ride and then of course
there's the tread itself that actual
intricate pattern that we all know and
see on the face of the tire this isn't
just here as a random pattern or to look
cool big a deal tire to be honest
there's no tread if you're driving in
perfect conditions on a dry piece of
pavement on a summer day like this slick
right here it puts the maximum amount of
rubber on a dry clean smooth piece of
pavement but that's not the real world
so our tires on passenger cars you have
tread we drive on roads that have gravel
that has snow that have rain so your
tread is designed to deal with all those
to work its way around gravel and find
the traction between the actual rocks to
get down in snow and find some grip in
that material or on a rainy day to take
the water in the middle of the tread as
you race down the street and evacuate it
out the side otherwise you end up flying
on the surface of the rain that's called
hydroplaning and that's no fun
and two other factors about tread design
the way that it grips and then releases
the road is a key part of how well this
thing does in corners is it going to
create oversteer or understeer all tires
have some slip as they turn but the
nature of that allows the car makers
that dial in the cornering behavior they
want in their overall vehicle and
finally tread has a lot to do with
quietness of a tire the way these lugs
grip and release at the road creates
more or less and varying kinds of sound
that's where all the road noise you hear
from tires comes from and that's a big
deal on luxury cars in a different way
than on sports cars the last thing I
want to bring your attention is rolling
resistance what it takes for this tire
to roll down the road varies
dramatically by its design the really
grippy wide sticky tire is going to be
great at cornering accelerating and
braking but perhaps require more energy
just keep the car moving at a set speed
let alone to accelerate it and that's
not a good guy in an era when automakers
are looking everywhere to save even a
few drops of gas per mile now used to be
that low rolling resistance tires which
you'll find on many very high efficiency
cars were awful they were like having a
three-day-old bagelman on each wheel now
they tend to be pretty decent
performance tires not extreme but
acceptable they're much better at having
a quiet ride pretty good performance and
actually looking good as well oh by the
way if you want to know what all this
stuff on the side of the tire means it
calls out much of the technology within
it and we did a separate piece on this a
little while ago about how to read your
sidewall so it's important for the tires
you've got but especially for the ones
you're considering buying I'll put a
link into our episode 64 show notes take
