now the world's most played and most
watched game through online streaming
services two teams of five players
battle it out in an arena with the
ultimate goal of destroying the opposing
teams base while defending their own
like a basketball team each player
performs different but equally important
roles players choose from over 100
champions each with their own unique
abilities strengths and weaknesses what
makes it so fun to watch is how the
combinations of player skill character
abilities teamwork and timing make every
match play out differently individual
brilliance as well as excellent teamwork
are all on show in matches lasting 40 to
60 minutes we spoke to one of the
full-time professional league of legends
commentators known as shout casters
about what it takes to become an elite
player of lead well I think that most of
it comes down to your ability to
strategize on the fly knowing in
microseconds what the best decision to
make is decision making is everything in
League of Legends is where you're going
to move it's where you want your
champion to be at X seconds from now in
order to avoid this particular ability
there are players that I don't even
understand how they do the things that
they do the timings that they have on
their abilities the way that they hold
certain moves so they're going to be
utilized later on in a teamfight because
they just know that this enemy team is
going to be grouping up later and they
can get the maximum amount out of their
ability so how does someone go from
being a fan of a video game to becoming
a professional commentator I played it
avidly I had so many games I was much
too scared to go into ranked because you
know that's intimidating as there's a
ranking system I might want to put
myself there i just wasn't all that good
so i had a whole lot of passion i needed
to direct it somewhere I had to put it
in yet wherever I possibly could so I've
found shower casting was actually with a
partner of mine at the time she was
thinking I'd really like to get into
some sort of char casting role found
someone that was doing it sort of very
very low key it was part of something on
the internet we would is commentating
some silly little games of a Wednesday
night but I sort of thought wow it
sounds like a really cool idea I hopped
on board both of us were doing it for a
little while and I just fell in love
with it I couldn't see any better
to do in the world than shark I was
working in IT at the time and I'd sort
of secretly be there writing guides and
trying to work out everything learning
champion names and then overnight I'd
come home and commentate legalisms the
company behind league of legends riot
games has been investing heavily in
developing the players and the growing
community around the world seeing the
game professionalize its commentary team
even in its smallest markets like
Australia is a prime example with such
polish around its events and its
broadcasting for a wildly passionate fan
base of millions League of Legends shows
that eSports are definitely here to stay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
