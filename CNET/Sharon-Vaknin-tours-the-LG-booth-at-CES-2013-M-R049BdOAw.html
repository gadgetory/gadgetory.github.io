super super super crowded right now so
we're going to try to muscle our way
through and the first thing I want to
show you guys is LG's new TVs as you
probably know by now they announced a
new 4k TV and a new OLED TV that's right
OLED is no longer a myth you can
actually buy these things um so what
we're looking at is the 55-inch oled TV
and it uses wrgb technology so behind
every pixel is a light that can show
white red green and blue and the reason
that black you're looking at is so black
is because it's actually not a color
it's just the light turning off so
that's why you have such rich colors on
those out bolos okay let's go and take a
look at the 4k TV I'm telling you it's
insanely crowded in here oh my gosh we
have a camera we're imported okay okay
so over here real quick let's try to get
around okay over here is the ultra HDTV
also known as 4k hopefully this year the
industry will figure out which one they
want to use it's absolutely gorgeous you
can buy this guy for a modest $20,000
but as you can see it's super sharp
because it's about it's about four times
sharper than current full HD so you have
something like 8 million pixels packed
into that screen and it shows but of
course the challenge with 4k as we all
know is that there isn't much 4k content
so LG i believe is having a a
partnership with disney to bring some
some 4k movies this is bananas okay guys
but I know that before I know that
before I by 4k TV oh my gosh I'm so
sorry I'm gonna want some 4k content and
until I get that 4k content got twenty
thousand dollars of staying in my pocket
okay now I'd like to welcome you to my
dream home okay LG has been so kind as
to set that up for me and where we're
going to start is LG's smart
refrigerator so all of their smart
appliances this year are NFC enabled so
when you get it when you arrive home
with your new smart refrigerator all you
do is tap your phone to the NFC tag and
you will automatically be synced up with
it and it'll be added to your LG smart
appliance app where you control the rest
of your appliances because it's not just
a smart fridge I can keep track of all
of your groceries and give you recipes
based on what you bought there is also
an oven that talks to the refrigerator
so the fridge says hey you have chicken
and Parmesan cheese why not make chicken
parmesan so you send that recipe to the
oven and the oven begins to preheat at
the right temperature for that chicken
parm okay here you can see there's the
Wi-Fi signal and a whole load of
settings that I can't even begin to
learn right now it's out of control but
this is the future this is my future
dream home okay so washer/dryer also
smart you can start a cycle remotely you
can tell the washing machine what types
of garments you're washing and it'll
pick the perfect cycle another great
thing that I love though is okay what
you're probably thinking now is Sharon
there are all of these electronics in my
washing machine my refrigerator now how
do i maintain it so LG is one step ahead
of you and what they did is
every so often you can just tap your
phone onto that NFC tag and it will give
you a diagnostic report that the LG
technicians will automatically receive
and they'll be able to fix your
malfunction much faster so there is a
benefit to adding more tech into the
washing machine now what we're looking
at is of course something you're
probably already familiar with it's like
a Roomba but LG calls it a home but it's
got a camera on it so you can spy on
your home while you're away it also
somehow touts that it can feed your dog
I have not yet tested that so we'll look
into that later but it's your standard
robotic vacuum it maps the room it and
you can set it up to start cleaning
while you're not at home ok guys that's
LG but right now we're going to take a
quick break and then we'll show you some
highlights from the Qualcomm press
