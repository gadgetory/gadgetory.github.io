make your own I'm Bridget Carey this is
your cnet update the world of emoji is
expanding these cartoon icons on our
smartphone keyboards have conquered our
digital communication giving us a way to
express our feelings and add personality
to text but if you've ever felt like
there wasn't an emoji that could express
the feeling you're really going for
perhaps you need to try the random ojen
ater it's a website that mixes up
different parts of emojis to create
complex Franken emoji like this one that
says I'm unhappy with what I'm smelling
or perhaps it says something's in my eye
and then there's this one that says I
love it but I'm also feeling empty
inside and this guy is a whole new level
of sad but so shocked he can't look away
and oh gosh I don't know but I know
there could have been days I would have
used it the site was created by a 17
year old that got the idea after playing
around with the pokemon fusion generator
but there really will be more normal
emoji coming in fact the family of icons
expands all the time there's an
organization responsible for maintaining
the standards for text communication and
software they're called the Unicode
consortium they set recommendations on
which icon should be added based on
different factors like if it's highly
requested or if it fills the gap the
group has approved several new emoji for
the next update including a taco and a
unicorn no word on when that's actually
coming to your phone but now they're
voting on the next wave and some icons
proposed include a sneezing face or a
green salad and a stuffed flatbread
sandwich and maybe someday we'll get a
spoon instead of waiting for an official
update you can always download an app to
send your own emojis as photos the Star
Wars app now has 52 emoji of all the
characters you like there's c-3po Chewie
yoda jedi ghost yoda nine different
Anakin's and a melted Darth Vader helmet
you just copy the icon then paste it in
your message as a pitcher it also lets
you copy and send animated gifts it's on
iOS now and coming soon to Android but
should we worry that we're becoming a
little too obsessed with emoji
McDonald's and France has created an
advertisement with humans walking around
eating burgers and shakes with big fat
yellow emoji heads all with the emoji
expressions you know as if we're all
mindless yellow blobs going through life
taking selfies and ordering chicken
nuggets well let me tell you we are more
complex than a few pixels we are not oh
jeez guys really funny yeah you have to
pull you back now you can't leave me
like this and I'm at a time all right
well that's it for your tech news update
from our studios in New York I'm Bridget
