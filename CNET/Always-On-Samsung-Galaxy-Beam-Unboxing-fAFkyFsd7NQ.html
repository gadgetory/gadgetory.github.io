Galaxy Beam it's not even out yet we'll
get to the beam part in a minute but we
taped it up just so we could have a
proper unboxing may I remind you once
again that knives always work better
than scissors for opening boxes baby
paper here we go
galaxy beam light up and share let's
have a look inside our box here one
thing you will note right off the bat is
the bumblebee motif with the yellow all
around the edges this phone's also
pretty big and heavy there are some good
reasons for that but you should sort of
be prepared for at least the thickness
and the bulk all right let's run through
some specs the Galaxy Beam has a one
gigahertz dual-core processor and eight
gigs of built-in storage it has a four
inch Super AMOLED display a 5 megapixel
camera with a flash and a 1.3 megapixel
front-facing camera it ships with I am
sorry to say Android Gingerbread it does
have a bigger battery to thousand
milliamp Stu help with that projection
although it's not as good as the RAZR
MAXX which has a 3300 milliamp battery
it also has a micro SD card slot which
is expandable up to 32 gigs now right
about now you're probably thinking why
would I buy that phone I mean it doesn't
even ship with Ice Cream Sandwich and
let's be honest those specs are kind of
middling plus the Samsung Galaxy s3 is
out okay well here's the hook on this
one it's got a built-in pico projector
get it beam it's a projector the
projector bulb puts out a brightness of
15 lumens
it creates an NHD image with a
resolution of 640 by 360 and the image
can be up to 50 inches it has various
apps to control projection and playback
and something called ambiance mode which
lets you play any song or still image
for a specific duration you can use this
little phone to beam videos or
slideshows or pictures onto a wall up to
6
beat away I'm surprisingly excited about
this or at least I was until I watched
samsung's collection of heartwarming
videos showing you all the possibilities
I'm not as pretty as those people but I
totally did this with kid pictures well
kind of whatever jerk so my videos not
as heartwarming as Samsung's videos
which by the way we're not very
heartwarming at all like you're not
really pulling off the Apple FaceTime
thing and the music is annoying and all
I can think about is how all those kids
are too young to have kids and I just I
don't know that's not working but the
beaming might be surprisingly cool
although Samsung has not given us a US
release date for this phone right now
you can order an unlocked version for
about $600 and then route it to get a
decent version of Android on it but I
think at that price you got to ask
yourself if the beaming is really worth
it head on over to cnet.com and reject
the adult courts full review to find out
because she's way less snarky than I am</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
