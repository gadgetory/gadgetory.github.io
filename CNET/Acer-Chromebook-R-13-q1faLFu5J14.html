laptop for people with simple needs it
has a sleek aluminum lid that looks as
nice as a MacBook but it costs
considerably less starting at $400 it's
expensive compared to other cheap $200
Chromebooks yet the Acer is a great deal
in comparison to any macbook it's a
two-in-one meaning it can also be used
as a tablet it has a built in 360-degree
hinge that allows it screen to tilt all
the way back or you can prop it up like
a tent for watching video it's a bit too
heavy to hold like you would a tablet
but it works ok if it's on a flat
surface its heaviness may be due to its
big battery in her tests it lasted 13
hours which makes it one of the longest
lasting Chromebooks we've ever tested it
also has plenty of ports for your
connection needs like USB type-c HDMI
full USB and a micro SD card slot like
all Chromebooks the Acer Chromebook runs
chrome operating system a simple OS
based around online use and Google's
apps and it performs really well I had
no performance or lag issues during my
time with it the only time it's
performance slowdown was when I had over
10 tabs open and was loading multiple
video streams at the time of the review
the Acer Chromebook didn't have access
to Android apps via the Google Play
Store but it's a feature that's expected
sometime during 2017 Chromebooks are
minimal alternative to Mac and Windows
laptops and for the price the Acer
Chromebook R 13 with this versatile
design and long battery life is one of
the better options out there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
