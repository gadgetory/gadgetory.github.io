and today we have here the extra-tough
Kyocera dira Pro from US Cellular
now if this looks familiar to you that's
because Sprint's Durra xt and this phone
are nearly identical handsets the only
difference is that while Sprint has its
Direct Connect feature which is what
this push-to-talk button was for this
key on the US Cellular version can be
programmed to launch other applications
like the calendar Bluetooth or web
browser other than that however
everything is still the same as you can
see it's a rugged device that's dust
shock and waterproof it has a tough
rubber exterior and it could be
submerged and up to a meter of water for
30 minutes in addition to an external
display it features a two inch QVGA
display and it has a 3.2 megapixel rear
facing camera with LED flash
it's powered by a 1.36 ampere-hour
battery which gives you a reported
talktime of about eight hours and it has
a micro SD card slot that holds up to 32
gigs on the right edge here you'll find
a 2.5 millimeter headset jack and if you
want to use your regular headphones with
this device it does come with a 2.5 to
3.5 millimeter adapter cable if you're
interested the handset is currently
going for about 180 dollars without a
contract but if you do sign a two-year
carry agreement that price drops to
about 150 again I'm Lynn and this has
been US Cellular's Kyocera dura pro
