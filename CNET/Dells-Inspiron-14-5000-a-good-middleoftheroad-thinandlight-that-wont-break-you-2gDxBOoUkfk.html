Inspiron line the low-end 3000 high-end
7000 and smack in the middle is this the
Inspiron 5000 I'm Josh Goldman with Cena
and the 5000 series comes in three sizes
14 15 and 17 inch and this is the 14
it's just less than an inch thick and
weighs less than 5 pounds so not ultra
portable but still manageable for travel
the 14 inch touchscreen has a 1366 by
768 resolution and while it as good off
angle viewing it doesn't get terribly
bright and there's some distortion when
you tap on the panel which just makes it
look and feel cheap the same goes for
the flex in the keyboard deck but the
keys are backlit and the touchpad is
decent too though you'll probably want
to jack up the palm check especially if
you've got gestures turned on ports and
connections are good and it has newer
802 11 AC Wireless you can pick up the
14 5000 with an Intel Core i3 i5 or i7
processor the i3 version comes with 4
gigs of memory and a 500 gig hard drive
while the i5 and i7 versions have double
the amounts of memory and storage but
they're otherwise the same those are
your only configuration options at the
moment but the hard drive memory and
battery are easy to access I tested the
i5 version and it's performance is best
suited for everyday stuff like web
surfing streaming movies and music and
light photo editing and some casual
gaming probably the best part is it's
seven hour battery life you can read the
full review on CENTCOM but if you're
looking for an inexpensive notebook for
school or home that's still portable
this is worth a look
I'm Josh Goldman and that's the Dell
Inspiron 14 5000</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
