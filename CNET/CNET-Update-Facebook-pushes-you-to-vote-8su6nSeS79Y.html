I'm Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update it's good to be back in the
studio as many of you know our new york
office was without power for the past
week because of Hurricane sandy thanks
for all your support and thanks to the
San Francisco cnet team for helping us
get to show out in the meantime Apple
has reported that it sold three million
iPads in the first weekend the new
models went on sale and that's across 34
countries it's double the amount of
ipads sold from the launch in March but
this time Apple is counting two products
sold it's a combo of the new
fourth-generation ipad model and the
minis Tuesday is election day in the US
and Facebook doesn't want you to forget
millions of facebook users that are of
voting age will see a message on Tuesday
reminding them to vote studies show that
Facebook does affect how people vote
many are persuaded by peers rather than
by their civic duty and many say they
are more active in political issues
because of what they read on social
media and you can arrive to your polling
place in style using the uber app the
car service app is offering a free ride
in a black car on Tuesday for anyone who
has not used the uber app before the
trip must begin or end at a national
polling location and is valid during
your city's voting hours if you're
looking for an entry-level tablet deal
Barnes &amp;amp; Noble dropped the price of last
year's nook tablet to 160 dollars for
the eight gig model and 180 dollars for
16 gigs the nut color dropped to one
hundred forty dollars but that new nook
HD tablet is still two hundred dollars
twitter is working on a way to let you
put photo filters on pictures posted
with the twitter app this is according
to a report from the New York Times
these filters would be similar to what
Instagram offers in its app also over
the past few days tens of thousands of
Instagram users were duped by spam
accounts posing as major airlines all
promising the same deal a free flight to
the first 10,000 or 20,000 followers and
you have to mention the account of
course people didn't stop to think about
how it was too good to be true to give
away twenty thousand tickets or that
there was no way to contact the winner
nor was there a list of rules it took a
while for Instagram
disables some of these accounts as of
Monday afternoon the fake account for
Southwest Airlines was still up and
running promising bogus free flights
airlines have been trying to counteract
the spam by tweeting that these are fake
accounts spam on Instagram is on the
rise and you have to watch out for this
junk that's your tech news update for

today's stories on the blog sina com /
