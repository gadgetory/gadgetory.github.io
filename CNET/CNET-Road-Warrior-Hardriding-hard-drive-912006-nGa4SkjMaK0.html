cnet.com and welcome to road warrior
where we take a look at the hottest
gadgets for life on the go coming up
super easy GPS navigation on all-terrain
hard drive and the nokia n79 first
though the Plantronics discovers 655 it
can recharge off a double-a battery in
your shirt pocket take a look for
additional charging options you can
attach this to an AC adapter or there's
this little carrying case right here
that has a triple-a battery in it so you
can actually charge your hits at with a
triple-a battery which is really useful
on the road
sentronics 655 hits that's not only
comfortable but it also comes with an
array of accessories in the package
itself among the many accessories are
extra gelled earbuds for different sized
ears I'm a plus size myself are you
afraid of GPS navigation devices I know
they sound complicated they're not
Bonnie Shaw has just the thing for you
the TomTom ONE really simple portable
navigation device for your car and it's
great for first-time buyers or anyone
who just wants a basic navigation system
as you can see it's really nice and
sleek very light so you can move it from
car to car and there aren't too many
buttons around the top so you won't get
confused just power button here has this
nice simple windshield mount that you
can stick to your car
the only negative is Bonnie found a
listing for a restaurant that wasn't in
business anymore and was she hungry that
night next up Lucy's rugged all-terrain
hard drive why the fancy name and it's
called a rugged hard drive because it's
supposed to be able to withstand some
bumps and bruises it does have this
exterior rubber bumper that keeps it
from getting dinged on the edges if you
drop it and in fact Lucy rates it to be
able to be dropped from about 35 inches
height oh we dropped it and it still
worked afterwards just remember it's not
meant to be dropped while it's running
finally another in the much-vaunted
nokia n series Bonnie's back with the
Nokia n 73 will be fine
pretty nice design it's nice and sleek I
do have a little bit of a complaint with
a keypad it's pretty small and there's
some extra space that could have been
used for a bigger keys also
I've noticed it's a little slow when
you're using different applications but
not too bad has Bluetooth but no Wi-Fi
and it also has a speakerphone and it's
another one of those phones that looks
like a camera from one side a 3.2
megapixel camera in this case I think we
should start calling these cameras with
phones pasted on the back that's it for
this edition of Road Warrior I'm Tom
Merritt check back next time for more
gadgets to keep you armed and dangerous'
