an inexpensive tablet the Asus memo pad
7 LTE is exactly that
I'm Xiomara Blanca prasena let's take a
closer look
sitting at 7 inches the small tablet is
a nice compact size for carrying around
it's a little heavy weighing a little
more than half a pound and the
construction feels a bit plasticky it's
still comfortable to hold though the
smooth matte finish on the back is
comfortable against your fingertips and
its rounded edges help it conform to
your curved palms and fingers the volume
rocker and power button are located on
the right edge the microUSB port is on
the top the sim and microSD card slots
are on the left side and the headphone
jack can be found on the bottom
feature-wise it's a bit simple it runs a
mostly pure version of Android 4.4
KitKat providing little pre-loaded
software including Google's and Asus
suite of apps the memo pad 7 houses the
quad-core Intel Atom processor 1
gigabyte of RAM and 16 gigabytes of
internal storage that's expandable up to
64 gigabytes via the aforementioned
microsd card slot when using a tablet if
limited to basic activities performance
is smooth I easily transition from
checking my email to surfing the web or
streaming video without any issues
anything more labor-intensive like
running large games and apps with other
apps in the background causes a lag in
performance understandable considering
its basic specs the seven-inch Asus
tablet sports a 1280 by 800 pixel
resolution with wide viewing angles the
range of colors is a bit flat and it's
not very bright but HD content is sharp
enough to provide a satisfying
experience on the front it has a 2
megapixel camera good enough for
videoconferencing and the rear 5
megapixel camera is surprisingly alright
photo there rather sharp with lifelike
color and there's an extensive amount of
burst shot settings it won't replace
your DSLR or iphone camera before a
cheap tablet it's not half bad currently
going for 170 $4.99 AT&amp;amp;T offers the
option of installment plans or a
two-year contract so far I've been
satisfied with the consistent speeding
coverage of AT&amp;amp;T network but I'm still
trying it up stay tuned for the full
review i'm Xiomara blanco christina and
this
I'm gonna first look at the asus memo
pad 7 LTE</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
