games hang out there so this is arguing
some idiot a car which specialized just
on building html5 games and if actually
landed on you know JavaScript libraries
for html5 games this is a very simple
game we need the number of ships here 12
so let's see 9300 from then you kill it
been practicing this weekend's Padre
Dougie's six it's missing them all right
so so this is just a simple 2-d game and
this game is preloaded in the device so
the game is actually working offline you
know not to be kind of get to run the
game we've also done something
interesting there's lots of fixed email
 website with games on the website
so algorithm it's just you know place a
link here but this goes to our popular
game website on fleek there you go so
he's loading now so he's loading is
doing salsa this is how fast a website
so you get these are the game our
journey oh so you have to take the
Achilles and go to tower there you go as
you can see me invites in this weekend
figure this alright so these are you pal
you know more sophisticated alcuni Kings
available and you can see me working
offline on the phone so you can use them
anytime unit if you're not connected and
you can use them you know just bring in
their their game from there from the
website so is taking the content of the
book i'm basically display sitting here
on the device so so if we take the book
and with a very simple JavaScript
application you can actually happen you
either that will allow you to do the
week books directly from here in a
completely open wait okay so so let's
see so this is what we wanted to show
you wanted to show you first I'd
everything all that you expect on a
phone
you're working here and it's old
JavaScript that their performance is
really good and whatever that the able
system is already there because
everything you've seen are things that
it saves another field in html5 that
runs pretty much other folks in this
device now what we expect is that this
will become much more interesting
because the extension is indexed in 05
with a lot of developers to do even more
cool things that were they doing today
once this reference implementation it's
a standardized so thanks a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
