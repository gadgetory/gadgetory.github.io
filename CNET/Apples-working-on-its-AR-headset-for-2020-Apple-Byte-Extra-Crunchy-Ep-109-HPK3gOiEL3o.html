little video technical difficulty so if

nothing else we are here to tell you
that we are doing this podcast
completely naked totally nude I mean I

the zoom part alright guys and gals
thanks so much for listening in it is
episode 109 you know you can all be a
part of our show all you have to do is
just call us at
all right let's get to the show really
the breaking news the top story of the
day which should have happened to me at
least a week ago the iOS bug where you
type it's kind of like the eye bug where
you type in the letter I character when
it stood alone for a lot of people not
everyone it would end up Auto correcting
- like a character with the space and
then this question mark in a box almost
like a Mario box it was either the
letter a sometimes it was a hashtag sign
sometimes it was an exclamation point it
didn't happen to me right away but it
did happen just starting two days ago
but finally Apple has released a fix
publicly with iOS eleven point one point
one it's an update that you can get
right now and according to what Apple
claims uh I haven't put it on my phone
yet cuz it just literally just dropped
about like half an hour ago this update
will fix that I bug issue I mean
everyone was going crazy about did you
ever see a beach dude I saw it on
Twitter and I thought it was the
funniest thing because there's all these
people walking around with their one
thousand dollar iPhone 10 and they can't
use the letter I you know it was just
ridiculous and then a friend of mine he
like he found this Photoshop image you
know it's like the iPhone X say hello to
the futures like that oh yeah but then
it has like a little a and the question
mark in the box exact I know exactly
what I'm mother's hilarious hilarious
dude and I can't believe that's
happening and it's 2017 it's I think the
thing is that yeah they know was did
anyone actually catch this like this is
it affected hundreds I think it really
affected hundreds of thousands of phones
I mean a lot of it wasn't like a very
isolate everyone can see it people are
doing it and the weird thing is about it
is that like I said mine didn't kick in
until just like a day ago and I'm like
oh my gosh it is just killing me the
other there are ways to fix it but
really the easiest way now is just
download the iOS 11 point 1.1 update we
were gonna tell you the ways to kind of
go about it into your keyboards and then
go into text replacement and then do
something like that but you don't need
to now just get the software update and
hopefully it doesn't screw anything else
up I saw this really funny post from
someone
because I guess Apple released like a
blog post or like a how-to how to fix
that right yes exactly and and I see all
these like people on Twitter or wherever
it was and they're just like I didn't
break it Apple why are you telling me to
fix it you fix it I didn't bring it come
on damn real talk right there real talk
right there yeah so Apple did finally
fix it but again it I feel like it's
been over a week since it dropped maybe
I'm not familiar with how time works but
it's it's been way too long so fine I'm
not gonna dump on them anymore but it
kind of speaks to me this is just a bug
but this is a this is a significant bug
that you just wouldn't expect them to do
and I'm sorry I know people hate this
but imma go I'm gonna rewind back in
time and just be like this is what I'm
gonna say it this wouldn't have happened
under Steve Jobs is watch no and if it
did the people responsible would have
been put to task or put in the corner
and then they would have addressed it
they would have addressed it immediately
it would not have taken a week
I just think ultimately sounds messed up
but people aren't afraid of Tim Cook
inside apples walls I'm sure they're
having more fun and I'm okay with that
like again we're the consumer that reaps
the benefits of all the hard work and
when someone listens and says you don't
even know how to program and do that
crap guess what you're right I don't
it's not my job you know so this stuff
is not easy but again this is something
like we literally have never seen a bug
like this ever in the history of Apple
it is hilarious too because yeah I'm
still seeing it like an tweet you know
it's just it's everywhere and like it'll
be like some very famous like you know
journalists or something tweeting
something important and then you see
those little characters in there you're
like what the hell man yeah it's it's
just crazy so get a face but I you know
I talked to some of my buddies I'm like
literally Steve Jobs was feared and
sometimes as a leader being having fear
in the hearts of your employees can
actually work to the company's advantage
oh yeah not not in everyday fear but
just that Oh
a certain level of standard that we are
expected to meet and if we don't we're
gonna get in a lot of trouble or maybe
even lose our jobs like that that's this
is Apple baby this is Apple in 2017 oh
that bug was just that was just
embarrassing yeah
the I I mean it's called the iPhone and
you can't anyways so that's that hey
good good luck it's all resolved let's
let's keep on rollin - really great
scoops and stories from our buddy Marc
German who was a guest on the show and
from who works for Bloomberg the first
story leading off Apple is working on a
2018 iPad redesign with facial
recognition this would be a new model
that similar to the iPhone would
eliminate the home button the other
caveat around this is you remove the
home button you're able to bring the
glass closer to the edges now
specifically for an iPad I actually
don't want a bezel this iPad because you
need to be able to touch the edges and
not mess with the screen or they could
maybe deactivate the edge or make it so
that the ED the super side edges aren't
but there's something about having just
a little bit of bezel on the iPad that
that I would like I mean if you were
using that beach wouldn't you say the
same yeah for sure I mean you have
fingerprints all over your screen if you
know it's yeah there's a lot of reasons
you can also eat it sometimes you just
drop it you might ding an edge or
something you know I'm bad for the sorry
soul that drops their iPad on them that
would just be horrible yeah
the thing about this iPad some new
details that have emerged from it so
obviously the idea is to bring facial
recognition iPhone tens face ID to the
table but this tablet is also unlikely
to include an OLED screen that you know
we know that the iPhone 10 is an OLED
screen there first you know or find
their second OLED screen in a product
but they have more vivid colors sharper
clarity the thing about this is that it
would also drive up costs for the iPad a
whole lot more they're looking at at
least one new iPad model with a screen
size similar to the
10.5 inch iPad pro we've already talked
about face ID we've already talked about
them removing the home button this is
all stuff that you could pretty much
expect the thing about also is if they
did go with an OLED screen it would
raise the cost but another thing is that
their supply chain they're available
partners in manufacturing that can just
can't even supply OLED panels that large
so we know Samsung is the sole supplier
for their panels for the iPhone right
now they would also be the only display
maker that Apple is partnered with right
now that would have the capacity to
produce new OLED screens for the iPads
so there's technical and financial
constraints that will make this unlikely
the other suppliers at Apple's partners
with if you talk about companies like LG
Electronics Japan they display
incorporated in sharp corporation even
smaller China based firms that they have
on their roster they're unlikely to have
the ability to even supply tablet-sized
OLED screens to Apple next year these
are partners that they're trying to get
them ramped up just for the iPhone yeah
it feels like they're painting
themselves into the corner a little bit
here like you know they only have one
supplier available and then also this
trend of all their products going up in
price that's that's not good
I don't like I don't like hearing that
it's gonna be more expensive you know
well there was a real there's an
interesting time where you know Apple
was seen as being a company that had
really a little exorbitant premium
prices and people were getting turned
off by that like they were kind of
catering to the almost to the elitists
on purpose then they started actually
arguably under Tim Cook's reign right
before SJ was left the company they
started bringing down some of the
general cost of their products and
you're like oh wow that's a lot more in
line with what's out there is still more
expensive than other products yeah but
you look at something like the iPhone 10
you know it's not really the first
thousand dollar phone you could look at
the note 8 as being that first $1000
phone yes it does more it is a different
product so but maybe in people's minds
Apple is set this ceiling of okay we're
gonna make a $1000 phone that when Apple
does certain things because of the power
that they have to the general consumer
perceived differently so that I just I
don't think quite honestly I used the
iPad Pro every day I loved it
I wouldn't want an iPad pro twelve point
nine inch with an OLED screen if it cost
me three hundred to four hundred dollars
more I mean unless unless they make it
so it's more like a like a laptop kind
of kind of situation right well that
that I again that'll be the day I think
we're finally seeing the iPad do more
and I love what they've done with it
because it feels like a unique product
but it still can't do it nearly what the
surface pro does yeah right it's a
better it's an absolutely better product
it's one of my favorite Apple products
and I know that it is more limited but
you can actually it has unique features
that make it feel like its own thing and
I think that's kind of important that a
product doesn't feel like every other
product that's out on the market yeah I
just feel like if they're gonna make a
new one you know maybe work on improving
it I I understand they're gonna improve
the screen that's gonna make it more
expensive but I don't know I feel like
maybe try to bring the cost down because
iPads and tablets in general or just you
know they've been slowly you know their
sales have been slowing over the past
few years so why why make another fancy
iPad with a better screen and make it
more expensive you know I feel like
that's kind of the wrong direction I
don't know all right no one you know to
your point it's interesting about the
iPad look demand has lower global tablet
sales according to the report have
declined seventeen percent of the past
three years
Apple couldn't really avoid that right
they were being dragged I think that's
something like 13 or 14 straight
declines in iPad sales but now with kind
of this new iPad pro line the Cooper you
know Apple reported last week in their
earnings that iPad revenue rose 14% in
their fourth fiscal quarter with an 11%
increase in the number of units sold
we'll see how that trends over time but
you know I've been a big proponent and
it's kind of good when I get excited
about a product and I actually really
say like you know what I enjoy this
product it's nice to see that other
people are responding to because the
iPad is a product that I do not want to
go away like I want to keep that thing
out there as long as
because as someone who travels it is
perfect for me yeah I mean I do use I
will use our app out a lot too when we
travel so so we'll see what happens with
the iPad but again rumor 2018 redesign
facial recognition slim borders no OLED
screen also the Apple pencil which we've
talked about before is expected and not
only be a new kind of improved Apple
pencil better accuracy and new software
features that will work in partnership
with this new iPad so we'll see how that
all shakes out another story from
Bloomberg that they dropped here we go
get ready for it before you know it it's
gonna be here
Apple is ramping up work on an augmented
reality headset to succeed the iPhone
now the report from Bloomberg and Mark
government again says Apple hopes to
have the technology in place to build
their new augmented reality headset
sometime in 2019 and could ship a
product as early as 2020 they want to
get this Apple eyeglass they're not
gonna call it AI glasses but you know
what I'm they want they're over the
whole I name right so the current write
what they're doing here right is we we
know that they've been working on this
they've been hiring boatloads of staff
people in augmented reality expertise
eye scanning eye tracking so so many
different layers here they have a our
kit that was rolled out on iPhones other
people like Google reacted and was like
oh we better release our a our platform
Eric it is showing off some of its
potential I don't think we're really
seeing until we start seeing maybe some
specific apps catered specifically to
the iPhone 10 which does have the most
capable front-facing camera that we've
seen so far we'll get to an emojis in a
little bit but according to the report
Apple's device their their own AR
headset will have its own display which
means it will not use an iPhone as the
display to slide in there's going to be
its own standalone product it will run
on a new processor chip specifically for
this and it will also have its own
operating system according to people
familiar with the product this is in the
Bloomberg report the development time is
pretty aggressive they said it could
still change so we'll see how this how
this goes again Apple is not the first
to market almost all the time they'd
like to see how the market evolves and
changes then they'd like to put out
their offering sometimes it's good
sometimes it takes a while to get to get
good the Apple watch is a great example
to me yeah I bought the first Apple
watch knowing it wasn't the greatest
thing I wanted to review it I wanted to
have it and have my own experiences with
it but now the Apple watch in its third
iteration with the new watch OS four
with the new internals that make it
speedier and quite honestly the LTE for
someone like me who works out and wants
to have access to everything but not be
fully connected with a phone
the Apple watch series 3lt is legit like
I love it that's good and I need it I
didn't love my Apple watch before after
two generations but now I'm turning
around man you've definitely turned
around on the Apple watch
since the Lima show block when the
products good right like when it's so I
think that that's a good sign that it
may be fine it takes them a little
longer to get there we I want them to
come out with dope stuff I wish they
came out with the Amazon echo quite
honestly they should have done I mean
these kind of did was Syria I mean they
were the first to have like or you know
a personal assistant we were talking to
I guess but it's not not doing what the
echos doing hey getting back to the the
AR headset when they say it's gonna
succeed the iPhone what does that mean
it's gonna be like like a accessory to
the iPhone or it's that sounds to me
like well the title yeah the title is a
little tricky but I think what they're
just trying to say is their next
breakthrough product right that will
succeed like we had iPhone we had iPad
what is the next big Apple product I
think people should listen to our show
even as far back as two three years ago
where I've always said look I'm not
trying to be mr. future predictor but if
there was any product that could be the
next breakthrough product for Apple it
would be a pair of glasses oh yeah yeah
like I said that you can I don't even
know what episode it wasn't last week
guys yeah
I think we were even talking about there
was like some eyeglass demo that that we
were showing out there's like a little
video you know there's you know your
stuff out there but in reality thing
they have all the pieces in place and
they can make it look stylish enough
they made the Apple watch look stylish
whether or not you like the fact that it
has a round face or not so the new
operating system Ochs go ahead yeah I
was I was just gonna echo you and say it
definitely has to be stylish because the
the the VR headsets that we're seeing
now and like the Google glass they just
looked ridiculous and people just laugh
at them you know when they see them kind
of so if if Apple could do something
that's augmented reality glasses but
make them look like a cool pair of
sunglasses or something you know then
then they win you know what I mean like
if it's like a pair of ray-bans or
something then they win that holes
they'll win that whole scene you know
yeah the big issue according the report
that Apple is having is creating their
own headset with a built-in display that
can also stream 3d video without
draining its battery it's obviously a
lot of components here working together
that makes it complicated I don't wish
this on anyone figure that out now a
couple quotes just to see where Apple's
brain is that cook in our interview with
the independent recently said anything
you would see on the market anytime soon
would not be something any of us would
be satisfied with so he's kind of
talking about the overall market like
look Apple knows what they want to do
but they're not it's not there yet chief
design officer Johnny I've told a tech
panel last month that there are certain
ideas that we have and we are waiting
for the technology to catch up with the
idea so it comes down to right some of
this is battery optimization how do you
actually do that and sizes of batteries
and their capabilities to be able to
support this I mean we've seen
unfortunately because these devices are
so much more demanding like our phones
it's not like we've seen revolutionary
breakthroughs in battery life but the
fact is that these devices do so much we
take for granted the fact that how much
battery life we actually get from them
you know yeah here's another thing I
just kind of ago to kind of pile on with
this Apple isn't going to wait around
for enough
chip to kind of be a part of this
they're going to create their own ship
we've seen Appl be very successful
working creating their own six you know
their own silicon they have their own
you know a 11 chip series that they've
worked on to kind of customize they have
specific chips in the new iPhone that
aid whether it's the photo optimization
and the kind of machine learning that's
happening on the iPhone 10 they have
they're making specific custom chips for
that as well so they're working on their
own system on a package component for
this new AR headset and they're also
working on a new operating system that
they're calling our OS for reality
operating system oh wow that's grow our
OS you ready for that
ready for that you're ready for our OS
all right let's just take a little
breather and get to an awesome word from

continue to roll through the show
continue on all right I don't know about
you did you see an emoji karaoke
over the past week Beach I do yes what
did you think I thought it was fantastic
I helped seen it in espanol they did
like a little Spanish karaoke together
yeah it's like a sing-along a group sing
along and it's pretty awesome man yeah
it's you know I mean I'm the first to
always say I hate it on an emojis I mean
I thought they were cute but it's like
Oh like look let's be real don't don't
tout this as a feature for the iPhone 10
although it is hinting at how capable
the cameras are I get it it's a fun way
I mean there was even like a TV
commercial I was watching last night
from t-mobile and it featured an emojis
like yeah it was just featuring a dude
talking on his aunt emojis like text
messaging back and forth with a friend
and I'm like oh my gosh it's happening
but an emoji karaoke like took the world
by storm even I'm not here to talk about
my own and emoji tweet but write it
right now I'm watching it can I play it
well what's the what's the yeah I mean
you you yeah you can try and play oh you
you you got many likes on this one how
many likes it out you know social media
internet it's about timing like how many
how many likes is on that thing now 3945
[Laughter]
it's just me as the Fox music box so an
emoji karaoke check it out look it's not
too hard to do all you you kind of have
to have to you have to have your phone
and you have to have another audio
source whether it's another phone or a
speaker something playing this music put
your phone right next to it and you get
like a 10 second clip to do that there's
people that are going crazy advanced
where they're now screen recording so
that they can get longer than a 10
second clip they're doing the screen
capture on your phone singing through a
whole song and then syncing it later on
I'm guessing that's what Espanyol did
right they all we're capturing their
screen exactly yeah exactly and then
someone edited it together it's like I'm
just you know this trend is gonna be
this trend will live for a while but
it's already kind of lost it's already
like kind of dipped right it's like it's
hot it's one thing it's gonna you're
gonna try it once and be like oh that
was cute and then you play and never do
it again yeah it's like it's so sad how
how fast trends and new cycles move now
like I feel like it's all kind of almost
old yeah but it will be you to everyone
who gets a new iPhone they're gonna be
like I'll dude I'm gonna totally do that
the first time I get it yeah I wouldn't
blame you but the tracking is really
awesome like the face tracking is
totally awesome all right let me let me
play you a Spaniels just for a second
oh my god wow that they trying to sound
annoying no they that's I think that's
how oh sorry okay I apologize maybe
they're you know they're probably all
they're all I haven't put them together
smiling and laughing sir someone sounded
like they were literally they had just
sucked helium out of a balloon I don't
know if I I don't want to be offensive
but
I'm just saying that's how I feel all
right let's check it out the iPhone has
been obviously making the rounds in the
internet world this is really cool we
know about DxO mark who is kind of
established themselves as one of the
leaders that is that comes out and says
look this is these are the best cameras
for phones marques Brownlee mkbhd did a
really amazing explainer about how DxO
mark actually works I would just say
look into that yourself there's too much
to talk about and give them props for
putting that out there but the iPhone 10
was rated the highest smartphone camera
specifically for photos in a smartphone
ever right now it had a rating of 101
they're scale is not based out of 100 so
the iPhone tends photography received a
score of 101 it's video received a score
of 89 with an overall score of 97 which
leads the leaves the pixel to is still
the number one phone based on a camera
they had an overall score of 98 compared
to the iPhone tens 97 their photo
performance was a 99 compared to the
iPhones 101 and their video score was a
96 compared to the iPhones 89 that that
was kind of where the iPhone dropped off
a little bit these scores are weighted
it's not like it's out of a hundred
there's different aspects that they
measure with photography like exposure
color balance texture and then they
prioritize those and then they kind of
weight it based on which ones and their
minds are are the most important so
either way you're getting one of the
best cameras smartphone cameras on the
market today which it which is which is
a good thing I mean you should be it's
pretty amazing
have you seen some of the photos at
least that I mean just photos that
cameras on phones are taking these days
in general is just bonkers yeah Lexi
posted like a bunch of photos they took
with the iPhone 10 on Instagram and I
was and it looks
they looked incredible I was like I was
really shocked at how good they looked
like you know their DSLR quality pretty
much yeah it's pretty wild so check this
out there's a funny article though that
came out later because people that have
iPhone tens
are kind of freaking out about how clear
the selfie camera and the cameras in
general look like and it's funny that
they say that because I didn't think
about it I'm not like a person who takes
a bunch of selfies but me and my lady
were we were taking photos and I'm like
there's way too much detail on my face
but I didn't I didn't realize that
people were talking about I was like I
don't that looks gross right I did like
that it was winter I saw that trending
and people are like I look so ugly in
the new iPhone 10 camera because it's so
good you can see every pore every zip
everything on your face iPad it's like
it's funny we're getting a point where
there's too much detail i I'm curious
really what you all think about that
have been able to get an iPhone 10 just
your experiences with the cameras cuz
dang it's like you know selfies looking
a little too good now shoot showing our
flaws what's up
we need touch-up apps no filters more
filters dude it's crazy
another thing display mate who has kind
of been the de-facto one of the sources
for raiding the you know how good screen
is on a phone they have just tested out
the iPhone 10 and they call it according
to display mate the most innovative and
high-performance smartphone display that
they have ever tested of course with an
A+ rating they also congratulated
Samsung display for developing and
manufacturing the outstanding OLED
display Hardware on the iPhone 10 the
thing is that also I a Polly Parker ship
with this screen so that's why I write
when I talk about they're working on
their own ships for optimizations with
the screens like Apple has kind of a
role to play as well check this out the
iPhone 10 matched or set new smartphone
display records in the following
categories highest absolute color
accuracy highest full screen brightness
for OLED smartphones highest full screen
contrast rating in ambient light and a
highest contrast ratio it also had the
lowest screen reflectance and smallest
brightness variation with a viewing
angle so this is basically the best
screen that you can get in a smartphone
and it's like the funny thing is you you
can get all these ratings that's great
I think sometimes you can see
differences in screens when you have
them side-by-side but when all you're
looking at as a as a phone I think
there's the psychology where people just
want to know that when they pay X amount
that this is the best screen ever and
it's like they're all amazing screens
you know sure they have their issues to
a certain degree but I will I will agree
this screen is really really really nice
it does look beautiful
definitely but it's funny that they they
they you know they congratulate Samsung
they're like congratulations Samsung I'm
the best thing I mean in the iPhone
they've got a they've got to give them
some props now we all yeah it's I mean
it's it's really nice so the other thing
about this is we know for people that
care about technology in general the
pixel 2xl got a lot of criticism because
it started showing effects of whether it
was image retention or burn in just even
like a week into it they've released
software updates for it we'll see how
that helps or not over the long term but
Apple you know you know kind of a
preemptive strike just to make sure they
were because they saw all the bad press
at the pixel 2xl god I mean it it really
hurt the initial impressions I talked to
people yeah and without any follow-ups
or like oh yeah the pixel to excel
screen is not that great and I'm like I
I have a pixel too as well it's still a
great screen but you know sure when you
tilt it side to side it changes colors
so does the iPhone 10 but not as much
it's it's a lot bluer but again when you
look at these things head-on they look
fine it they really look fine we haven't
seen any burnin with the iPhone yet or
image persistence so Apple released the
official statement and this is kind of
what they said to address it in regards
specifically to the OLED screen this is
from a document they released an
announcement they made it says if you
look at an OLED display off angle you
might notice slight shifts in color and
hue this is a characteristic of OLED and
his normal behavior with extended
long-term use OLED displays can also
show slight visual changes this is also
expected
and can include image persistence or
burnin where the display shows a faint
remnant of an image even after a new
image appears on the screen this can
occur in more extreme cases such as when
the same contract high contrast images
continuously displayed for prolonged
periods of time so we've engineered the
super Retina display to be the best in
the industry in reducing the effects of
OLED burnin and so we'll see how we'll
see how that plays out over time but I
just found it interesting that you
didn't really hear people complain about
more mostly because we haven't actually
seen burnin on the iPhone 10 yet but
Apple is like okay let's just put this
out there just to let people know
because everything that they said is
really what Google said it's just that
Google screen showed some image
retention and burnin after a week yeah I
mean I even saw with my own eyes and
it's it's pretty shocking it's like that
that's a big deal that's a big problem
yeah it's it is it is so we haven't seen
on the iPhone yet but people are just
concerned
basically yeah and I mean you spent all
this money for these things you better
be so we'll see how what happens long
term but right now I mean look everyone
is saying the iPhone is the best screen
Apple has put this out about
preventative measures that they're
taking and we have not seen any burnin
in it so it it is good as gold to me
right now and then finally we can't
really show it but all I'm gonna say is
go online search Samsung growing up and
watch the video that they put out it's
like a commercial where they just
literally went in on Apple they went
savage and basically calls out Apple for
how Samsung was the first with a lot of
kind of trends and innovations and
smartphones from a larger screen
waterproofing wireless charging keeping
the headphone jack but they finished it
up with this hilarious part where they
had people in line waiting for the
iPhone 10 and they gave a dude a haircut
with the iPhone in the end of iPhone 10
line that looks like the knotch
oh really a telephone I'm watching it
right now it's it's brilliant it's like
a very it's a saga it's a very long one
I got to see it sir good thing though
crazy
that's funny so I was just like it's
pretty beast is pretty B so let's get to
the voicemail shall we let's do it thank
you guys all for calling we got a lot of
good voicemails this week and we're
gonna start off with this one he's
asking about the Qualcomm versus Intel
chip explain the difference between the
Intel modem and a qualcomm modem the
iPhone came I know why kind of scaled
down not the advantage of the 5g network
or maybe neither one can take advantage
of the fire to network and I think all
calls and half the phones and Intel in
the other piece thank you
all right my man so check this out just
this is kind of we don't know everything
but this is what we know so far much
like the iPhone 7 there are two versions
of antennas ins LTE modem sorry
inside the phones now there's two
specifically in the iPhone 10
there's the iPhone 10 with the part
number or model number a 1/8 65 it uses
Qualcomm's Snapdragon x16 LTE modem I
could read the whole model number but
you don't want me to bore you with that
there's also the iPhone 10 with model
number a 1 901 which uses the Intel
modem now which one is better
historically and it is true that the
Qualcomm modem is a superior modem most
people prefer it because it actually
covers more cellular bands and the
performance of Qualcomm chip has been
better than Intel's in the 7 it was
actually tested in comparison the
Qualcomm chip
was a better chip than the Intel modem
sorry the Qualcomm modem was a better
modem than the Intel modem now why why
are there even two well one of the
issues is supply and what it comes down
to is the Intel chip supports GSM
bandwidth
but the Qualcomm chip also supports CDMA
networks so Qualcomm supports GSM and
CDMA networks which means look you're
gonna have to put a Qualcomm chip in
those phones but if you have stuff like
t-mobile AT&amp;amp;T here in the u.s. you can
use an Intel modem because it supports
just GSM we know that and this is
Qualcomm and Apple are going back and
forth in their their lawsuits being
filed back and forth at each other
Qualcomm is accusing Apple basically
making them look bad and throttling the
speeds of their Qualcomm modem from the
iPhone 7 so that it was in parity with
the Intel modem so they basically slowed
it down so that the performance would be
generally about the same they're also
the only chip maker like making modems
with the next-generation gigabit LTE
network but you're not gonna see that in
an iPhone 10 model because Apple disable
the feature as well it's it's not going
to be supported so even though 5g what
the marketing term is gonna be 5g LTE is
not officially here yet this is expected
to roll out sometime I think late next
year but Android phones will be able to
support that faster network speed I'm
not exactly sure who in the US is going
to roll out with it first it might be
t-mobile we'll see but that also makes
you feel like okay so how do I get a
phone with the faster modem if you
really care about it I mean I
experienced specifically a worse signal
in San Francisco once I got the iPhone 7
and I know it's specifically attributed
to the fact that it was an Intel modem
that I was in my phone I wasn't making
it up first two weeks I'm like this is
decidedly different and it was I think
once you're used to it you don't think
about it but when you know it you know
it so the only way really to get an
iPhone 10 with a Qualcomm chip is either
through Verizon or Sprint and you want
to get the unlocked SIM version there
are ways that you can kind of even go
around it where it is a pain in the butt
but you could buy an iPhone 10 at
Verizon you could kind of sign up for
their introductory like their 3 it's
like a 3 gig data plan then cancel it
but once you cancel that
plan you could then pop in you know a
chip from another company to use that
phone
kind of like an unlocked SIM free
version so there's ways to go around it
but ultimately the only phone that has
the quality Verizon or Sprint phones and
its story that can't be told in a minute
right I just went into a deep but that
is what's happening that's also because
of how Apple is treated the Qualcomm
modem and throttling and whatnot they're
they're also in court against each other
so that's crazy I know it's funny
because they you know they they buy the
chip and then they're upset because
they're not using the chip properly so
and also because of all this beef you
know there's been rumblings that Apple
is gonna move exclusively to Intel modem
chips for future products and just say
screw you Qualcomm because they're
having there's so much beef between them
right now
Wow Wow it's a game Game of Thrones out
there man that's right alright here's
the next call hi guys Jimmy Guerrero
calling about the whole home button
issue and about getting used to it I had
to send a similar issue with gigantic
scene as 7 to 8 actually I got pretty
used to it
I actually prefer not having the button
now and it's nice how when you press on
the bottom of the screen it does vibrate
and Google also I also like what Google
did by adding the smart lock so if it's
connected to Bluetooth if I'm at home
from a certain places I don't even have
to worry about unlocking the phone it
does it automatically so I just wanted
to put my two cents and and yeah you
should be a an apple guy now I'm an
Android guy but you know I love
technology so I still keep up so guys
keep up the good work Brian Tom you're
the shit woah woah woah language link I
have never said a bad word on this show
cool well that's very helpful help very
helpful information it's good
perspective I like it
ok there's another one here we go order
B Qing Tong this is medicinal manchild
California wanted to float a little hat
by you so Apple came out and said that
they did not lower the accuracy or
detail of the face ID camera production
but I was wondering if you thought
possibly they cut down on the radius
which is why people are having problems
unlocking their phone on a flat table
surface you know what you think shot up
Wow well I think it's a fun conspiracy
theory that we'll never get the answer
to you know so they could know them now
he's thinking they cut down the radius
of where the camera can see is that what
that what are you saying
yeah yeah you know there were rumors
that they throttled down like its
accuracy but no one knows exactly in
order to make to have them pass kind of
Apple stringent requirements that's an
order for some of those parts to be
pushed through so that they could then
make more phones I don't know will will
we will never know I think it's a fun
conspiracy theory but you know face ID
people are I think most people are
pleasantly surprised with face ID but
it's still not as fast as touch ID and
it still errors more than touch ID ever
did and it won't ever be as fast as
touch ID yet I still do like it I think
it's great but it's it's not as fast as
any phone before it's oh okay and that
kind of harkens back to that story that
Apple was like making it easier they
were what were they were scaling it back
the face ID yeah they're just turning
down the accuracy just to make it so
yeah and you know who knows if it really
has an actual effect on the final
product we will never know we'll never
know next call hey Brian this is Shahab
from Murrieta California last week you
were talking about the gesture controls
for the iPhone 10 and how you guys
didn't like it how do you have to swipe
down for the control panel and things
like that do you think that it would
have been wise of Apple to let the
customer choose what they want to do
with this gestures like where you could
go into the settings and have a swipe up
be something and
right down be something else for each
different phone I would like to know
your opinion thank you but I think you
are very optimistic but there remember
Apple is one of the most controlling
companies we've ever seen in consumer
electronics and so you know you can
actually add like a home button virtual
home button to the iPhone 10 using the
accessibility options but for Apple to
let us decide what gestures do what I
expect us to never ever see that day
it's just not in their DNA they've never
been that way to be like oh yeah you can
swipe up and do this instead I I just
don't see it other than you know
accessibility will at you can you can
add different functions but assigning it
for the general consumer for you and me
to do all the time
I just don't see it it's just not in
their DNA it's just I mean they're none
of the most lockdown company when it
comes to consumer electronics they're
gonna tell you what gestures to use and
you're gonna learn they've all told us
gestures we have no choice so yeah okay
here's the last call and it's a real
quick one here we go I have a question
Apple has so much money in the bank why
don't they just by Comcast outright and
put the u.s. out of its misery yes yes
please I paid too much for Comcast you
don't pay the same or more if Apple
takes over I'm just messing around I
mean I don't I don't know know that but
you know you might possibly yeah yeah
well that's it Brian that's all we got
man all right bro thanks for doing the
show thanks for anyone hanging again
remember to call us to be a part of the
show
or you know week by the time you listen
this be safe all right peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
