things that you'll notice first about
the brands smallest most compact
crossover is that it wears the elfin s
corporate spindle grille better than any
other SUV in the lineup that's because
it was designed from the ground up with
this design language in mind let's hop
behind the wheel of this 2015 NX 200t
and check the title
most of the Lexus in excess competitors
have been in this compact luxury SUV
market for years so Lexus is a little
late to the game but we're glad to see
it's here this is a pretty good first
entry for Alexis now part of the reason
why I've always thought Lexus is design
was kind of weird is that they've been
slapping these really aggressive front
ends on what's generally a round and
kind of frumpy looking at UV but that's
not the case here this entire vehicle is
drawn tight around some very strong
lines that flow all the way from the
front to the rear where we've got these
very strong creases that flow out of
these very futuristic LED taillights now
the NX is all new on the outside but on
the inside it's keeping a lot of what
we'd like from Lexus and tech
particularly this sort of black leather
and silver color scheme
pretty much everything you're going to
need to interact is right here on the
steering wheel and right here on the
center console the everything's right
over here where I can reach it not
necessarily where the passenger can up
top we continued the trend of pushing
the main LCD further up the dashboard
and more into the drivers line of sight
it doesn't retract but it's pretty good
and very visible even in direct sunlight
we've got Lexus's in form infotainment
system with optional navigation it's
pretty much the system that we've seen
on every Lexus vehicle for the last
let's say three or four years not a lot
of surprises here but we do have apps
for Facebook Pandora and whatnot now the
way that you're going to interact with
this screen is where things start
getting a little bit weird we've got
this Lexus remote touch trackpad you'll
move a cursor on the screen around and
you'll basically push the whole thing in
like a button when you want to make a
selection the weird thing about it is it
still has haptic feedback so as you roll
over buttons you'll feel a small
vibration in your fingertip now it's
taking me a little bit of getting used
to but passengers who are not
necessarily familiar with car interfaces
but are very familiar with the laptops
they have at home have taken to this
trackpad like a fish to water
just above the trackpad we've got our
drive mode selection that allows you to
go from sport mode which is going to
make the vehicle a little bit more
dynamic with the powertrain and
transmission programs to an eco mode
that's going to program
everything to be a little bit more
fuel-efficient including the throttle
response and then you'll push it in the
middle for the normal default mode and
just next to it we've got the shifter
for the six-speed Automatic transmission
that's the only gearbox option on the
202 now under the hood will find Lexus
first ever turbocharged engine this is a
2-liter single turbo that uses an
intercooler and a combination of
gasoline direct injection and port
injection it kind of seamlessly
transfers between the two systems 235
horsepower and 258 pound-feet of torque
now the EPA hasn't gotten his hands on
this yet but Lexus estimates that you're
going to get about 24 miles per gallon
combined which is bang-on what I've got
during my testing that breaks down to 21
miles per gallon in the city and 28 on
the highway now one of the other things
you'll notice is that the engine sits
sidesaddle here and that's because the
NX and its native default form is a
front wheel drive vehicle but ours have
been equipped with the all-wheel drive
system so that's going to give you a
little bit better traction and actually
shave 2/10 of a second off your 0-60
time knock you down to seven seconds
alright that's a pretty good amount of
power there's a little bit of lag from
the turbo but not a lot in fact if
there's any hesitation it's going to be
from the six-speed automatic
transmission deciding that it's time to
do the fast thing you can get around
that by switching into the manual mode
but there are no paddle shifters which
would help there's also that sport mode
that we talked about earlier it's
vehicle print a lot smaller in person
and from the driver's seat it feels a
lot smaller a lot more nimble and a lot
easier to park and that's important the
fuel economy is okay at about 24 but if
you're looking for better fuel economy
than that then you're probably going to
want to hang around for our NX 300h
hybrid review coming up soon
