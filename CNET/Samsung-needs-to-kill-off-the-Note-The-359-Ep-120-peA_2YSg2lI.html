time for episode 1 20 of the 359 podcast
with Roger Cheng and Alfred in good
morning guys what are we talking about
today morning happy monday good moring
we've got a lot to talk about again
samsung just the drama continues its
it's an explosive story sorry sorry we
have the puns out of the way now I've
been going out with a bang there we go
yeah we'll talk about Samsung the saga
maybe close to an end the notes the note
brand might actually be or the note 7
might actually dent they say that
they're there temporarily adjusting it
the production schedule I don't really
know what that means but yeah well the
time I've at we're gonna be talking
about the memes from last night's
presidential debate did you watch it I
did ken Bohn is a hero and bone is the
man yeah and then lastly we'll give a
little bit preview of apple vs samsung
they're actually heading to supreme
court tomorrow like the full on hearing
what the justices and everything so this
is a this is a big milestone in this
case not necessarily the end of their
battle but it's definitely a huge
turning point so whenever you're ready
Oh as usual if you have any questions
please leave them in the comments
section Brian will pick out the best and
we will try and answer them all right
whenever you ready let's get this
podcast started and in three two welcome
to the 339 when we talk about the top
tech news of the day you know the crap
we want to throw in I'm Roger Tsien I'm
Alfred hang the samsung galaxy note 7
saga maybe close to an end the company
said it was temporarily adjusting the
production schedule of the note 7 we're
not sure how temporary that actually
means this fall's decision by AT&amp;amp;T
mobile to stop offering the phone
entirely however what do you think this
is it this is the end there's no coming
back from this there's absolutely no way
they're getting back from this you know
you may be the first time after they did
the recall that was a little chance I
had suddenly way yeah and then it
happens again with the recall yep is
there's no coming back from this is it I
mean is it just sort of a joke that
they're calling it me is it why are they
calling it a temporary adjustment to the
production schedule why not just put it
out of its misery I think it's to save
some face for their company here I'm
right
case you know there's a note 8 coming
out at some point well that's that
brings up the bigger point that I want
to talk about is like should the note
brand even continue to exist I think the
name is so bad that they should
absolutely drop it this is like the
Vista of Samsung yeah it's kind of
tainted right like it's I mean do they
go with a note that me know XO they just
change get the note that you should just
drop the note name I mean the the
hardware I mean battery aside right
features on its own is good enough that
they can kind of just make it a
different phone but don't call it the
note I think they should call the galaxy
slate that's just me I think they name
it whatever they want I just don't not
the note ya know that's a good point i
don't i don't think stamps is gonna do
that these invested years years into
that bad brand but yeah they'd see the
kind of all just fizzle out it's all
objects it's all blown up yep there's
that there's that pun again and if you
didn't watch it yesterday don't worry
about it but it is the most tweeted
about debate in all of all time now
Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump facing
off plenty of memes coming out of it yep
I don't know if there were any standout
moment see you from that debate uh I
mean the mean that's to have to me was
the ken Bohn meme right that the guy
seems to be a national hero for just
looking kinda like a jolly version like
a jolly Santa Claus kind of it was very
peculiar considering that his question
wasn't really all that funny it was
about you know green energy and you know
policies regarding that and then
everyone just jumped onto this guy he
had it they had red cardigan on any
mustache I think that's everyone loved
him for that and there's been parody
Twitter accounts parody facebook
accounts he's been tweeted by at least
130 thousand times like this one guy
that's right I'm gonna be there what
about you you you kept track of those
news what was some of the more
interesting my favorite one is still if
you look at the it's either the
Webster's dictionary yeah it's Webster's
dictionary I believe where they tweet it
out an article no they tweeted out that
a bunch of people were looking up what
lepo meant right but not not Aleppo not
a lot you battled city in Syria lepo
they looked up what is a
lepo because I guess they didn't they're
kind of like Gary Johnson where they
also don't know what I love that my
friends is why I have I fear for America
alright lastly we want to talk a little
bit about apple vs samsung the legal
battle heads to the Supreme Court the
highest court in the nation tomorrow to
get a little bit more of a clear sense
of the value of design patents I know
that's that's kind of boring to you but
this is this is sort of like the biggest
milestone in this battle that's been
going on for four plus years I'm I'm
wondering what's gonna happen if this
case actually ties what if it's 44 yeah
yeah yeah thanks to Senate thanks to
Congress we don't have that that nice
justice to break the tie but I don't
know that it could just mean that I
don't actually know what happens to tie
it goes back down to the courts okay has
ruled in favor of Apple for okay so then
there you go then that more more
advantageous dapple all right more about
these stories check us out on cnet I'm
Roger Cheng I'm out for dang thanks for
listening I'll turn my microphone on
first but the ala delve into the
comments here in a second I actually
missed the debate as I had to drive
across the strait State last night and
by the time I got back and turned on the
debate and had a chrome casting to my TV
I was promptly asleep ah yeah so fill me
in what were some like expand on the
highlights please well it just wanted to
point out that like you know they did
mention this was the most tweeted debate
of all time but at the same time you
know there's only been what about two
other presidential elections since
Twitter existed and then it didn't
really have that much momentum as a
political platform from the beginning so
I mean I'm willing to make the bet that
you know the third presidential debate
that's coming up is going to be this is
going to set another record yeah as far
as that goes but um it was a town
hall-style debates they they generally
just went back and forth the trump tried
hitting clin a lot on her emails mm-hmm
also hit on the the moderators at the
same for you know yeah that sort i tuned
in late so that like when I traumatic he
was starting to the bug I think
uh I was bugging Anderson Cooper about
why he wasn't asking more about the
emails even though they had just asked
about those five seconds earlier yeah
and then you know that it started off
with that you know recording of Trump
that like was all over the headlines on
over the weekend the locker room talk
yes and they yeah he pivoted from that
basically you know I'm sorry about what
I said but I'm gonna knock the hell out
of Isis it was very weird pivot it
actually became a hashtag yes loud never
talk locker room talk in five words I
believe yeah and then also today a lot
of athletes are speaking out on
Twitter's a bit basically saying like
don't put this on us we're in locker
rooms all the time exactly don't uh uh
yeah we're some of the other beams that
mean the fly the flight was very
interesting um not interesting but just
funny for the fact that it was it was um
flying around the debate i don't have
you noticed you had to kind of watch
closely for it going right i have
noticed but there was one point where it
landed on Hillary Clinton's face as she
was talking like on her forehead and it
was like she didn't even notice the fly
was there she's just that composed right
yeah um I was waiting for some concern
three down I was waiting for the
conspiracy theories to come out though
as the like why this fly was landing on
on her face um I haven't seen any yet
but you know I'm excited to find out
what they are I'll tell you what it's no
birdie sanders yeah oh yeah i was
thinking that you know Bernie had his
bird Hiller as our fall and Trump has a
Blowfish I'll leave it that yeah what so
what many questions now we got some
people who are on both sides of the
fence of the Samsung issue of course
nice polarizing title by the way Roger
now thank you anyone out there in the
chat watching right now actually using
the Samsung if you experience any
problems any questions any concerns one
and by the way if you are using it stop
turn it in like replace it with another
phone don't get another node seventh
they're not going to listen to if they
haven't listened this far they're not
listening
I know somebody was brought up like why
didn't they just keep the removable
battery wouldn't this have been an
easier fix uh yeah I guess it was also
the way that the batteries are being
charged yes well it was also the way it
was packed into the phone you know to
get the kind of design a kind of shape
that they wanted so yeah you could say
replaceable battery but that would
fundamentally I changed the way the
whole phone with a look I also back
pedal to it possibly I also think the
replaceable batteries might have
contributed to the problem more I mean
think about how many like off-brand
batteries there are out there that like
most people get on amazon or ebay or
anything that's all you go into a store
can buy a replaceable although although
you can make the point that those those
off prime replaceable batteries might
actually be more consistent than the
battery the second idea I I back when I
had a galaxy with a replaceable battery
i bought like off ramp battery land they
did not work well no it was awful and
then I just what they didn't blow up on
you they didn't so this is this was the
point to those guys this is in an age
where the galaxy did not have a big bang
yeah yeah no issues no issues according
to some users in the chat and we're
going to go ahead and file that pun lee
responds to Roger please no no
professional bed upon user got my puns
out of the way I'm good I'm a double pun
or galaxy oh that's all right um yeah no
it's just I mean I do think that they'd
probably be better off just shedding the
note name it's become kind of a
laughingstock in the industry there's no
way they're coming back from this with
the note I like it there's never enough
to do it the next phone would have to
have some extremely killer feature that
would make people not care at all about
right yeah it's in the same way we're or
they could actually they could just I
mean the really the only real
differentiating fact for the note is the
stylist they just shove the stylus into
the galaxy s 8 you know and just that's
it that's our big phone for the year
it's in the same way that you know the
Internet Explorer has become such a bad
Rio name for Microsoft that you despite
the multiple ad campaigns and things
that they've done to fix internet
explorer it's still just well they just
gave up and create a new browser they
made edge yeah but even
then you know people are having a hard
time adapting edge before the same
reasons it just makes me think of that
joke from arrested development where
they're like oh they stopped making the
Ford Bronco to shed that whole high
speed chase get away yeah thought I
thought oh what's this called the escape
Justin in the chat needs some advice he
says he's not having any specific
problems but how can you return if you
got it from a retailer like Best Buy
they told us last time there was a
recall not to turn it in as the
government can't force you to
necessarily so what is your advice to
him as someone who wat from a retailer
like Best Buy that's really a question I
would say if what it depends on what
carrier if you have a you know the phone
runs on 18t of verizon maybe go back
that's maybe go back to the carrier and
ask them for a replacement you know was
also doing kind of replacements yeah I
don't know if it's I don't know if the
carriers are offering replacements were
phones that they didn't necessarily cell
that's my doing only hooked there so I
don't really know but I would say start
with the carrier first to snow there the
ultimately responsible it's surprising
that Best Buy isnt honoring any kind of
replacement program though I mean have
you tried there yet Justin just go right
to the counter at best buy and see what
they say I mean maybe they're even more
in the loop since they would have been
in touch with the manufacturers yeah we
would necessarily because at this point
I mean it is the this US government has
actually outlawed selling yep
distributing these phones so there's
kind of responsibility for some these
retailers to get the dangerous ones out
people's hands I think you'd have a case
for a refund from Best Buy yeah if
nothing else at least a refund yeah it's
really it's unfortunate kind of glaring
stain on the samsung brand they were
doing they were really riding a high for
a while the galaxy s7 s7 edge did really
well exceeded expectations and and they
were coming in their swagger back and
this shows up you know they I survey I
was at Aoife need their launch their
gear s3 the news was just starting to
kind of pop up but they were all sitting
pretty they're all looking really
confident looking uh you know just sort
of feeling really good about themselves
and then like towards the end that show
the end of that week that's when the
knees started coming out
just sort of hits them beta-tester says
having a heat issue when charging the
tablet using the tablet in the plug at
the end the the port also get they'll
just get hot really hot yeah yeah sage
act on that now sir matt or madam not
sure who you are or other uh hashtag
killed the galaxy note 7 mom every go
yeah it's Samsung's kind of Without
Really confirming it has sort of killed
it right I mean I go back to that the
language they use a temporary adjustment
I sounds really weird like we've
temporarily adjusted the production of
the phone who's going to buy this phone
now like most of the carriers don't even
offer won't offer this phone so no no I
mean for all the trouble that it's been
giving users I don't think this phone is
good enough to you know warrant that
yeah I if anyone's keeping their hands
on their phones I mean I'm interested to
know why but ditch the stylus install a
fire extinguisher whoo there we go
there's a feature they could use let's
get the 7 goes straight to the eight I
mean can they really move forward like a
man but what you're saying is like this
brand is dead yeah I like I would be
this this specific this yeah just not
Samsung this is your phone no Samsung
will be around but yeah like it would
make sense just start fresh with a new
just a new brand this point like it's I
know they spent many many years building
the note brand up they spent lots of
money you know I saw ever like I think
it's the note 3 or no for that Kanye
West performed for like a launcher than
the u.s. like they were really thrown a
lot of resources behind it oh yeah that
was that South by Southwest with jay-z
no no no this one I was remembering is
it was actually the old post office here
oh okay in city but I don't like it
might be best just sort of like cut your
losses and start fresh yeah yeah sure I
don't um sorry still filtering a lot a
lot of chatter a lot a lot of viewers
thanks everybody for gas today there's
really a lot of the feedback net it's
just hard to get through all of it at
once and I'm only one man and barely
that although it feels like you do the
job with like 15 people sometimes yeah
it bad luck for samsung go back the best
buy you think best buy is going to be
held accountable for any par
this is for selling these no I can't
know what I'm confused about is what
happened during the recall I mean if you
like call it all back and then you ship
out another one I mean I kind of seems
like you want to make that make sure
that you get it right the second time
yeah I don't know what happened but also
like if if they come out with the second
replacement device are you really gonna
go through the trouble of getting a
second we're quick wake up especially
now that like they're the credibility is
kind of shot right like are you gonna go
through the trouble were you just gonna
you know cut your loss and just get out
of the phone yeah are they issuing
another recall for the second bag no
they haven't no there has been no recall
its they I think they made the mistake
the first time around of sort of issuing
a recall themselves without working with
the government agencies and I think
they're that's what they're doing now
but if they do I think it'll come from
like the CPSC or you know one of the the
state government agencies yeah yeah kind
of astonishing to watch and even if
there is a percentage of these phones
that have not exploded like a large and
it's it's not the majority no it's these
are like right now I think we've seen
five or six incidents where these phones
have caught fire but that's that's a
need for wrist that's enough of a risk
and that's the replacement devices
that's to be clear like these are the
devices that they said were safe yeah
yeah and the double down on that man
cursed yeah yeah what a shame what a
shame because it did really like again
and we've said this before that phone
look great on paper oh yeah yeah specs
wise is great and plenty of people in
the chat are saying like it's still
excellent for them it's no yeah the
design was great I mean it back in a
huge screen and a much smaller body than
the iphone 7 46 6s plus you know specs
were great the camera looked looked like
it was pretty awesome so lots of ought
to like about that phone except for the
fact that it explodes do you think that
this will cause any other people over
general quality control in Samsung's
other lines I hope so i imagine that
they're they're looking at the
internally top to bottom like to see how
they screwed this up how they fix this
how they make sure they don't make this
kind of mistake or any of their products
whether it's just phones the tablets
washing machines TV there was a washing
machine issue too right
was I mean is not related to battery
issues but yes there was there was an
issue that caused but that's in quality
control yes in general I mean I'm hoping
that this kind of pushes broader quality
control across the industry that we
don't have incidences with any of these
brands well it's apple or LG or actually
see like everyone just sort of fall a
stricter code in terms of now that we
have multiple Apple events a year
everyone else is throwing events are
just pushing these things out the door
and the criticism is like you're not
innovating anything it's a new color or
this right and it's like it this hardly
warrants a big event we're all bored
stale mating waiting for something
actually revolutionary to happen maybe
we should all slow down well it is so
that the pace of innovation has
definitely slowed but the pace of
product rollouts is not right it's what
everyone has to stick to a schedule and
you either end up with Samsung with an
exploding phone or we end up with an
apple where the decks phones kind of
boring but at least it doesn't blow up
yeah so you know did you trade off right
there like a slightly less exciting
phone or a phone that looks awesome I
can overheat your pocket I think we
should just go back and to take a big
step back maybe create like the I
carrier pigeon something interesting
leave enough for transporting messages
for transmissions I'm tired of this i
don't need pictures oh my god i could
never go back to just even snail mail
waiting for a response would kill me
yeah all right sit out that building all
right I'm gonna wait about five days
before I get a response here and we got
five whole days I don't want it'll be
like okay lots of villains for a call
through the spots will be like LOL ok
what I've waited all that time for this
ok yeah yeah all right that's probably a
good place to kill first yeah if you
like either you saw here check us out on
cnet our podcasts also available on

course on cnet com see y'all tomorrow
