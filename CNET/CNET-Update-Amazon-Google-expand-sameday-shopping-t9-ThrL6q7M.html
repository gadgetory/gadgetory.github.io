new headache I'm Bridget Carey and this
is your CNET update amazon expanded its
same-day delivery service to six more
major metro areas challenging the
convenience of actually going to the
store if you live in an area with the
same-day service you can order items on
Amazon by noon and get it to your door
by 9:00 p.m. that night prime
subscribers pay six dollars for same-day
delivery for non-members the option
costs $10 with an extra one dollar
charge for every additional item getting
something right away is the one thing
that gave bookstores the edge over
Amazon but if you don't mind paying more
to save yourself a trip now you can get
all sorts of things right away books
diapers gadgets even power tools when
kids are in a last-minute rush to get
books for school amazon won't be the
only option for a same-day delivery now
Google's shopping express service
includes books from Barnes &amp;amp; Noble
Google service is not as widespread as
Amazon it's only for Manhattan West LA
and the San Francisco Bay Area but it
does offer many types of goods from
major retailers and the delivery costs
less than Amazon since Google is trying
to get people to try it out there's no
delivery fee for now but it could cost
five dollars in the future which is
still less than what Amazon charges eBay
is also in the battle to be your
same-day provider with the ebay now
service eBay also works with multiple
retailers including Barnes &amp;amp; Noble and
Target and it promises delivery in about
two hours the fee is $5 but you have to
spend at least $25 in goods when the
delivery is only five bucks it actually
pays off to use these services for large
items like televisions this isn't just a
trend for tech companies Walmart and
Target are both testing same-day
delivery for their merchandise and
groceries and Target also offers
same-day pickup in some stores Amazon is
expected to expand its grocery delivery
service this year switching topics
there's an update in an app that's loved
by online shoppers Pinterest has taken
next step in its social media evolution
it just became a chatting app you can
now send direct messages with friends to
have a conversation about pins if you're
not already familiar with how Pinterest
works you pin links and photos that
catch your interest and you can lump
them into categories like inspiration
for planning a project and other people
follow what you share now that you could
just have a private conversation about
an idea like what to make for dinner
this gives people more incentive to use
the site that your tech news update but
you can check out more details on these
stories at cnet.com and to stay updated
