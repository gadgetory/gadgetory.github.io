standing next to the Dirt Devil -
upright vacuum this is $119 vacuum which
makes it pretty budget-friendly but I
would caution you from getting too
excited about that right off the bat
because unfortunately it doesn't really
work as well as I would like for it to
and I'm finding the more vacuums I test
that to some extent at least you get
what you pay for at least in the sub
$200 category there are better vacuums
that will only set you back about $50
more and when you're looking at an
appliance that will easily be in your
house for nearly a decade
if averages are correct spending that
extra fifty dollars is in a terrible
investment if however you do have your
heart set on a Dirt Devil and you like
this model there are some nice features
performance aside that you may
appreciate such as the wand which has a
handle that's integrated into it that
then nests inside the vacuum itself the
one also has an extension so that you
can use it without bending over with
this dirt vacuum and sweeping pad that
kind of works like a Swiffer
there's the vacuum portion on the front
that'll pick up debris and then the
microfiber pad that's totally washable
in the machine follows along after and
picks up anything that it leaves behind
this did work really well and I
appreciated that unfortunately it's not
really enough of a performance boost to
make this vacuum worth it especially
when you could look at a model like the
179 dollar Bissell Powerglide deluxe Pat
vacuum which outperformed this one
significantly so if you are looking in
that sub 200 category and I definitely
understand that being a budgetary
concern there are better models like
that Bissell or the Eureka a s110 for a
that would be a better use of your money
for seeing that I'm Katy Pilkington
