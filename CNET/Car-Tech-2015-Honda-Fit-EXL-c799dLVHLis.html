third generation a little less homely
and judging by the cabin tech a little
less lowly let's drive this third gen
2015 top-line the XL with nav and check
the tech in a nutshell I would describe
the styling of this third generation fit
as no longer looking like the cheapest
possible way to build a car it's got all
kinds of nuance and sculpting and better
integration of things like trim pieces
with body metal very different look
although I kind of preferred the
previous generations just slightly
cleaner little sportier look that's just
my opinion one thing I noticed right
away when you open the door here on the
previous fits there was always this ugly
unfinished weld they got rid of that it
kind of tells you about the overall
mission of the redesign now even if the
fit no longer looks like the cheapest
way to build a car it still is about the
cheapest way to build a car I pushed
this one hard and could barely get over
22 grand about 21:8 for the top model
the e X L trim with navigation that
comes with a CVT transmission about all
I could add CNET styles or remote start
for 400 bucks and we're just over 22
let's see what you get hitting inside
tells you everything you've got to know
about the new fit its dramatically new
there's a whole lot of nice new finish
is this kind of liquid metal bezel trim
different types of services many of
which are hard and some are soft which
gives you some texture new head unit
going on here kind of the new trend
which is this all glass surface all
touch and notice the buttons on the left
the virtual buttons change depending on
your mode what I'm not crazy about is
you've got nothing but click volume
controls either here or on the wheel
gimme a knob any day this just takes too
many taps or swipes or things that are
just not easy your main home choices
you've seen before just about everything
is in here audio sources are quite
expansive you're not really missing
anything there's even an HDMI port down
here to play audio and video if you're
parked and of course we have two USB
ports for charging or for media
integration thumb drives smartphones
iPod optical discs still carry
is on in this vehicle and for apps you
basically have to media apps aha and
Pandora there's not much of an apps
platform beyond that bluetooth calling
and bluetooth streaming are now standard
on a fit it was missing that before as
standard equipment which was making it
feel pretty old and that button on the
end of the turn signal as well as doing
a right turn signal will activate the
far right camera in the mirror housing
look down the side of the car give you
some distance indications beginning with
a red one that shows the butt of the car
and also show you what it's basically
about a four foot column of space down
the side of the vehicle now in Honda
says you can get a bike in this thing
easily they're not kidding look how
simple the big second row load-in
converts you just pick up the base of
the seat lock down its little leg and
it's there the other one goes up the
same way and you can just slide a bike
run in same thing goes for the back it's
just about the easiest lay flat load
floor you can convert to of any car
we've had in under the hood US market
fits we'll get a one and a half liter
direct injection sidesaddle inline for
driving front wheels only of course 130
horsepower 114 mere pound-feet of torque
it's not a lot but the car doesn't weigh
much it's a little over 2,600 pounds we
don't get in anything that weighs 2,600
pounds around here 0 to 60 is also
leisurely 8.8 seconds but it pays off in
the mpg 30 to 38 for this high trim EXL
with of course the one choice only CVT
if you get a low trim fit you can get a
six-speed manual but you take a hit of
several mpg in the city and one on the
hike
and the first thing I noticed in this
car is no matter what and around $20,000
you don't ever get a really smooth
engine note it's the only really
dissonant thing in this nicely finished
fit it just makes a grinding sound the
power as you can imagine is not
overwhelming as you can tell from the
numbers but it's well balanced across
the pedal range and across the rev range
you've got a sport mode you've got
paddles on the wheel there's not really
a sport mode in this car it just holds
shift points a little higher one way or
the other but the ride quality is quite
good you might be surprised at something
this small and inexpensive rides this
compliantly I would kill for some home
run buttons on this head unit I just get
tired of thinking through menus to do
simple things things it should be one
button press on less ambitious head
units aren't out two button presses oh
by the way this car has good crash
ratings it's an IIHS Top Safety Pick
which in its class of mini cars there's
only one other the Chevy spark this is a
big improvement from the last fit that
you may have heard had some crappy crash
ratings especially in this new test that
they call the up a small overlap frontal
impact test and that one the fit did not
do well in before this is a whole new
platform in this car according to the
IIHS quite safe
