company's sensory before but it's been
in the voice-recognition business for
over a decade in fact if you have a
Samsung S series phone you might have
even used sensories technology to take
pictures with voice commands
now sensory is bringing two big
innovations to voice' systems first its
porting alexa on to smartphones the way
that you'll access alexa is through its
second innovation which is bringing
always listening hardware to bluetooth
headphones now sensory isn't a consumer
facing company so you won't see its name
on the devices that you're buying and
say six or seven months but there are
probably going to be headphones coming
out in the next couple of months using
this hardware so the always listening
functions that you've always struggled
with on phones like hey Siri or okay
Google which isn't truly hands-free
because you kind of have to hold the
phone up in front of your mouth now
actually could be hands-free because of
this technology now it's hard to tell
exactly how the products will look they
use this Hardware integration but
sensory says it really shouldn't affect
the price or the battery life that much
but for now I'm just excited to see
Alexa finally be available on the go and
to see other voice assistance finally
actually be hands-free</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
