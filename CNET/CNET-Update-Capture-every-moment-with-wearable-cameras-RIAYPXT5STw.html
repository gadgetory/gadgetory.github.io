your life no really I mean every minute
I'm Bridget Carey and this is your CNET
update thanks to our smart phones our
culture is obsessed with documenting and
sharing everything we do we track our
location we track our steps and fitness
but do you ever wish you could track
more well if you want to make sure that
you document every single aspect of your
existence sony has the answer
it's life log now this app pairs with
the sony smartband bracelet to track
activities but it also tracks the movies
you watch the music you listen to even
how long you're on Facebook and Twitter
but that's not all how about wearing a
camera on a necklace Sony's concept life
log camera would hang around your neck
capturing moments throughout the day and
syncing with the app and if you touch
the front of the camera it bookmarks a
moment so you can remember it on your
timeline now the camera doesn't have a
release date yet but the life log app
and smart BAM arrive next month the ban
is expected to cost about 130 dollars
but Sony is not the first to have a
wearable camera that documents your life
there's also the narrative clip it's a
small weather protected camera shaped
like a square that you clip on your
collar and it shoots two photos every
minute it stores about four thousand
photos for two days until you recharge
it and then you upload the photos to
your computer it's two hundred and
eighty dollars and it comes with one
year of online storage and if you want
to track man's best friend then check
out the whistle it's a coin shaped
wireless tracker that attaches to a
dog's collar it tracks movements and
location and it sends that data to the
owners app now you can see if your dog
is getting enough exercise or when
they're sleeping
it's like Fitbit for pets some
veterinarians actually have been using
whistle for studying chronic pain and
dogs and how active they are so there's
more to it than just being obsessive
about tracking everything it works with
Android and iOS and it costs one hundred
and thirty dollars you'll be able to buy
this at Petsmart sometimes these
wearable trackers can have creative
applications for example
what if the Fitbit bracelet that you
wear which can measure sleep could send
a message to your Netflix account that
you fell asleep on the couch and that it
pauses the video that you're watching
while some savvy engineers at Netflix
built a program to do just this and the
user can go back and continue watching
from where the tracker noticed you fell
asleep this feature isn't available now
it was only done as a fun team building
contest within Netflix but it shows you
what's possible from these fitness
bracelets beyond counting your steps
