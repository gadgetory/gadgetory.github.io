report the show about the tech news that
everyone is talking about this week the
shocking news that the ipad 2 is a hit
ie9 turns out to be kind of a hit and
who's willing to let you pay for stuff
with your cell phone but first it's the
gadget of the week the gadget of the
week is the robin to your batman the
Gilligan to your skipper the t-mobile
sidekick 4G just a few weeks after
announcing that the sidekick was dead
and kind of making us all 11 with a
burning hot fire they announced this
sidekick 4G which is even better than
the original sidekick because it's 4g
samsung makes the hardware and it's
running android with a 1 gigahertz
processor inside plus in true sidekick
style it has these group texting
features built in tons of media options
even the ability to rent and buy movies
right on the phone so yes you kind of
got played by the whole oh it's dead and
you want it but now it's back marketing
ploy but really do you care and now for
the news first the good news for Apple
anyway analysts say the ipad 2 sold a
million units in one day it's a monster
hit seventy percent of the sales were
two brand new tablet buyers so score
Apple now for the bad news for you the
ipad 2 is now sold out all over the
united states the shipping delay is now
four to five weeks and that's not even
just for the white versions if you're
planning on getting one of these as a
christmas gift for someone now's the
time to order it hopefully it will be
there in time fingers crossed speaking
of delays though analysts are also
looking at how the crisis in Japan could
affect tech supply chains for things
like flash memory touch screens and
mobile device chips short answer all of
them will probably be affected flash
memory prices will go up and ipad2
supplies in particular might be even
more delayed but I think Apple spoke for
us all in a way this week when it
delayed the rollout of ipad 2 to japan
and said hey let's just focus on getting
that place up and running again okay
we'll buy the tvs and the stuff later in
other news that isn't so devastating in
sad microsoft released internet explorer
9 this week and dude
apparently it's like really good I know
who do in some speed tests it's been
performing faster than chrome or opera
it looks a lot like chrome it's all
stripped down and nice its standards
compliant so it will load webpages and
like Firefox for it includes a Do Not
Track feature that's supposed to prevent
third party cookies from following your
surfing history across the web not bad
Microsoft no I know I'm not going to use
it either but my mom will and now for
some tech headlines from the week
Lumbergh reports that Google will test
near field communication mobile payment
systems in New York and San Francisco
you know like the wave and pay with your
phone thing Google will try it out on
the nexus 2 which is one of the few with
an NFC chip built-in that should make it
a lot easier for the biggest geeks in
those two cities to get the damn red
ball already get the hell out I love it
but while google is embracing a way to
pay for stuff without using that dirty
old money Apple made it clear that it
will not embrace NFC technology and its
new iPhones because of a lack of a clear
standard across the industry yeah I bet
Apple really rejected this because in
order for it to work you have to waive
the phone the right way that never gets
old sorry to tell you soon fans or fan
but Microsoft won't be releasing any new
zune models do you think that thing
would have been more popular considering
you could share songs wirelessly from
device to device with a feature called
squirting oh no wait you can totally see
why it never got popular and finally
let's have a look at what's clogging the
tubes it's simon pegg and nick frost
Star Wars reenactment because Star Wars
is always funny Simon Pegg is always
funny and let's be honest british humor
always funny how did we get into this
mess we seem to be made to suffer it's
our lot in life look believe me what
nobody people is that we gonna do you
gonna do it blah blah blah so he does in
it now he makes a quizlet you like it
communicates via a system of beeps and
whistles he doesn't say bleep blap gonna
this good please d to boot once again
yes thinly veiled marketing stunt for
the upcoming movie Paul once again do
you care I don't I laughed and that's
the buzz report for this week everyone
