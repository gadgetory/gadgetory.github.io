cnet.com and welcome to road warrior
where we take a look at the hottest
gadgets for life on the go coming up a
Bluetooth headset you can't lose all
your apps in your pocket and a hydrogen
car that burns gas first off though the
Nokia 6133 is giving new meaning to the
word flip phone
Kent German shows you what I mean here
on the side he guess there's a small
button press it and the phone opens it's
a little bit gimmicky we're not sure how
I'd stand up to repeated tests over a
couple years
and it actually does cause the phone to
open sometimes when you drop it on the
floor yeah overall Kent says the 6133 is
well-designed packed with features and
performs well ever lose your Bluetooth
headset the new Kardos Scala 700 can do
a cool trick for people like you a
particularly unique feature of the Cardo
Scala 700 is the hit set locator feature
what you do is you make a call for your
cell phone and then you toggle the
volume buttons of your cell phone up and
down and then the headset will buzz so
that way you can know where your headset
is when you making a phone call now if
they can only do that for my keys
looking to travel light I've got some
tips on portable applications from my
latest insider secret portableapps.com
and portable freeware comm are two
websites that provide special software
built to run specifically off external
storage you download the application and
install it on the USB Drive then you can
use that app on any computer if you want
to keep your bookmarks up to date though
you'll want to use the browser that's in
here all the time otherwise you have to
update your bookmarks manually and that
can be a pain you can get more tips on
portable apps in the full version of
that insider secret at Cena tv.com and
finally a little taste of cars to come
from the LA Auto Show the BMW hydrogen 7
for instance tastes like water
BMW exhaust nothing like it it's a
bottle of water but literally it is sort
of the exhaust coming out of this
hydrogen 7 series an amazing car being
shown here at the LA Auto Show by BMW
now it's not quite concept that's not
quite production I'll explain that in a
minute here's the idea it's a v12 engine
that runs on gasoline and hydrogen
burning it now not converting it to
electricity in a fuel cell like you've
heard so much about so it's a very
different approach on the hydrogen idea
by not quite concept not quite
production Brian means they'll only make
50 of these and parse them out to vips
that's it for this edition of Road
Warrior I'm Tom Merritt check back next
time for more gadgets to keep you on and
dangerously productive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
