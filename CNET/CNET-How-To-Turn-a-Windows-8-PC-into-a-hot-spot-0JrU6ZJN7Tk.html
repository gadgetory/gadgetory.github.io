noticed that Microsoft took away a
really useful networking feature in the
last OS you can easily create ad-hoc
networks that would let you turn your PC
into a Wi-Fi hotspot assuming it was
already connected to the internet
somehow well you can still do this in
Windows 8 but it has to be done with a
third party app once it's set up you'll
be able to share your internet
connection with another device so if you
paid for internet access at a cafe or
you're at work and want to share your
PCs internet with your phone or tablet
you can do that head over to virtual
router plus comm and download the latest
release this app is ad free open source
and it's super lightweight once it's
downloaded launch this virtual router
plus file at this point setup is super
easy just choose a name for your network
like sharing back and enter a password
with at least 8 characters choose the
connection you want to share in my case
it's Ethernet to hit start and you
should be good to go alright now we can
test the connection so I'll head to my
tablet and here is sharing back in my
Wi-Fi settings so I'll select it enter
the password and now I can surf the web
on my tablet using my laptop as a
hotspot sometimes the network you
created here won't show up on your other
devices so if that happens just stop the
connection on your computer and start it
up again and remember that your computer
needs to stay awake and running to keep
the network alive so tweak your power
settings if you need to for the written
guide with even more tips and details
visit how to cnet.com and tweet me with
any questions or tips you want to share
