podcast I'm Veronica Belmont I'm arielle
newness and this is a show where we talk
about the wildest weirdest stuff that we
find on the crave blog and crave cnet
com so I've been gone for a week I was
at a South by Southwest in Austin Texas
how was it it was fun I'm kind of tired
of kind of losing my voice yeah but one
cool thing is that you know there's
always like lasers going on shows and
that kind of thing there's this jewelry
that i saw on crave from giongco designs
and they're called Aurora jewelry and
you wear them on your skin like in a
necklace or on a brooch it makes like
tattoo designs all over your body it
looks like it could be kind of trippy
seeing someone in the club with all
kinds of light I think that's kind of
the point oh yeah I guess I and the
jewelry will also react differently
depending on if there's another piece of
jewelry near it so if you have like a
bracelet with it and you get near your
throat it'll change the whole pattern of
the jewelry no that's kind of cool so
yeah very kind of Ravus we tend to talk
about a lot of that kind of yeah it
seems like it but speaking of parties I
saw on the crave blog that there is a
record player that actually it's a
ten-thousand-dollar record player but I
call me old-school I love vinyl I still
listen to a lot of vinyl and it actually
uses laser technology so it doesn't
actually touch the record so instead of
a needle that warps your that wears out
your record uses a laser never actually
it's kind of like a CD player about the
final yeah so is the insulates are
actually reading the grooves on the
final there's actually Riza cynwyd
through lasers and so but why is it ten
thousand dollars I don't know a CD
players with ten thousand dollars maybe
it'll go down or Mabel vinyl will just
disappear someday well one thing that is
totally worth the money is I know I
don't know do you have a wing and in
tinder we have we talked about this
before I don't have a wii cuz i can
never get ahold of one but i always play
at a friend's house yeah well if you do
happen to find one you can now get it in
clue nice there's a company that will
crew massage your nintendo wii for only
like 38 bucks Wow I mean how cool is
that
taking it to a whole new level yeah I
have to have a chrome we you have to
throw away when I finally get my hands
on a week I'm gonna have it chromed all
right why want my diet that's different
I think about yes just nice but speaking
of chrome this next thing I found on the
crave blood it also comes in chrome it's
a beer dispenser why would you need a
chrome beer dispenser I don't know what
the heck is a beer dispenser it's a
decision it's exactly what it was call
it's a dispenser dispenses beer kind of
like a water cooler but it's beer is it
like a tap like you have to hook it up
to a keg no just kind of like sits on
top dispenses beer and it comes on
chrome so you can see yourself while you
drink so you can see yourself why the
last thing I want to see myself when I'm
drinking but how exactly is that a
gadget oh well it has lights it lights
up oh my god this is totally techie yeah
well that sounds perfect for my house
because when I plan on getting my next
gadget it's going to be the world's
largest LCD screen Wow I'll be 105
inches 105 inches but does it come in
chrome you know I don't think so but
that's ok cuz every year at CES I tell
us oh we've got the largest chief even
the largest TV it's always like 100 3
inches or 108 inches and then two months
later 205 that's like the size of this
wall that's like the size of a city
block I don't see why anyone would need
that unless they own their own theater
bet you know that could be one possible
use for it the home theater I guess me
but you have to have pretty big walls
yeah alright well we'll have to plan for
the future I need a raise for TV anyway
so that's it for today if you want to
send in stuff to crave you can do so at
krave at cnet com or check out the blog
craved on cnet com we'll see you next
