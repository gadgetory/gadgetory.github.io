limousine and a quick quiz on mobile
video q starts now
what's going on I'm rich demuro with
Cena TV on my very last q it's a dark
day in New York City no seriously take a
look outside it's like 11 o'clock in the
morning let's get you started with your
must click moment the unaired pilot of
the q hey there i'm rich demuro in new
york city and here's what's in the queue
google goes trick-or-treating and picks
up a sweet sight the original idea was
for a fast-paced tech news update since
then the show's evolved a bit stretching
from 90 seconds to about 3 minutes the
original graphics designed by me were
tweaked several times to conform to cnet
standards before we scrap them for the
latest set thanks Randall but all along
the point of the show was never lost
stuff you needed to know to sound smart
around the water cooler and for some
reason I look like a 12 year old when I
started at cnet New York canadia moving
through the Q wii sports cleaning up at
this year's British Academy video games
awards the bundle title taking home top
honors in six categories including
casual gameplay multiplayer innovation
and sports other winners including xbox
360 title crackdown for action and
adventure Bioshock for best game and ps2
s god of war 24 story and technical
achievement the audience for mobile
video is growing fast in the US thanks
to fancy new phones with speedy data
connections and video players which
brings us to your quick quiz what's the
most popular cell phone TV on demand
content is it entertainment news music
videos movie trailers or sports news if
you said music videos that's right
although the audience is still full of
early adopters it's young males who are
watching the most content on their
cellies still the most popular
application on a cell phone is text
messaging the easy one to use all this
according to M metrics just in case you
needed more people staring at you while
you hop on your segway ferrari teaming
up with the two-wheeled wonder to create
their own fire engine red segway
autoblog says the partnership sparked
because ferrari workers were using
segways to get around their factories
next thing you know a swank scooter was
born featuring leather handle bars in
that pricey logo but don't expect
ferrari s performance this segue tops
out at the standard 13 miles
per hour it also costs two grand more
than the standard segue but that won't
work if you have kids but this will a
Prius limo combining the eco-friendly
ride of a Prius with a space of a
minivan the stretch pics posted at Prius
chat calm the owner says he modified his
little sipper to accommodate his six
kids and even with the extra junk in the
trunk this tree loving tranny still gets
50 miles to the gallon and in case you
haven't heard this is indeed the end of
the road for me in cnet TV I gotta say
I've absolutely loved bringing you all
kinds of tech news during my time here
the good news is I'm not disappearing
from the tech scene you'll still be able
to find me and my stories on the web
I'll just be heading to Los Angeles to
become a tech reporter for a TV station
there and I'm going to post all my
stories on facebook so go and keep in
touch let's be friends I'm rich Demuro
