things with my phone generally I use a
wallet but if you do feel like doing
that they're already a bunch of mobile
wallet systems out there but Lupe has
come up with a way to do it using any
credit card reader sounds kind of like
crazy hacker magic right well it's
enabled with a magnetic loop that
duplicates what a credit card does when
it slides through a credit card reader
and Lupe does it's two different
products the loop pay Bob and the charge
case and actually get both in the system
if you buy a charge case right now which
they're selling for ninety-nine dollars
the charge case works with the iphone 5s
and five and the fob works with both
Android and iOS and what does it do well
this has a magnetic loop inside that
allows you to press a button here and
beam a transaction when it's pressed
against a credit card reader or you use
a loop wallet app on your iPhone this is
where the scanning happens it actually
has a square type credit card reader
inside you scan your cards and plug it
into your phone to transfer the
information when scanned into the app or
you can actually detach this and use it
as its own little payment center here
it's got its own button it charges up
via micro USB and will store a default
card so you could use this hand it to a
waiter or pay for it around town how
does it work well tried it a bunch of
places bodegas delis gas stations and it
works you have to hold it really close
up to the reader you can't hold it at a
distance and if you're paying in a place
where the cash registers behind the
counter you're gonna have to hand this
over to them and the app itself actually
has a number of secure failsafe measures
there is a pin you of tender every time
you launch the app the information is
stored encrypted on the app they say on
the hardware itself so it's not stored
anywhere else and you have to bond it to
your phone your phone number and also to
your particular loop device or charge
case if you swap those out or try using
other people's credit cards they won't
read so there's some security in that
and you can actually scan not just your
credit cards but your debit cards your
loyalty cards your whatever you have
that has a magnetic stripe now getting a
place to accept this well it'll work but
somebody might still want to look at
your ID or to look at your original
credit card and
our countries that use used chip
security or other types of methods for
more secure payments what will happen to
loot pay when those secure payment
measures happen who knows but right now
this really does work with magnetic card
readers wherever you may find them if
you went in on that it costs a hundred
dollars for the case and again you get
that fob included it's intriguing
technology although the case itself
feels a little bit thick and flimsy it
stores a battery charge on here that can
charge your iPhone with a little
lightning dongle but it's only sixty
percent of a full battery charge so it's
not really a mophie or other battery
case type competitor interesting stuff
for the future though payments without
payment systems I'm Scott Stein and
that's the loop a charge case and fob</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
