today we're gonna take a look at the
Dell XPS 8500 so this is a higher-end
mid tower for Dell this config comes in
at about $19.99 the highlight feature is
probably its Core i7 3770 CPU that's one
of Intel's new third generation Ivy
Bridge chips and it makes the system one
of the faster mainstream pcs out there
but overall it's kind of hard to
recommend so if you're familiar with
Dells desktop lineup this system should
look familiar they haven't really
tweaked the chassis in a couple years
it's got a nice clean look to it we like
the white and the black here in the
front looks pretty clean as well Dell is
actually illuminated a door on the front
of this system so now the USB ports are
just exposed on the front making them
easier to get to if not maybe messing
the aesthetic up a little bit we can
live with that behind this door here
you'll find a blu-ray drive and up here
you have your standard array of media
card slots so around at the back of the
system you see a nice assortment of
ports there's nothing too innovative
here but there's pretty much every
connection you'd need for modern
hardware so from the top you've got some
USB to jacks here there's a USB 3 that's
becoming more common now there is an
SPDIF digital audio output as well as
standard 7.1 analog out down here in the
graphics card you've got all kinds of
outputs there's DVI to display ports as
well as standard HDMI out so inside the
system it looks like kind of a typical
mess that we're used to from mainstream
PCs you can see the core i7 CPU here
here you've got an AMD Radeon 7870
graphics card it's pretty high-end
there's 16 gigs of ram that's becoming
more common in high-end systems also and
here Dells included a three terabyte
hard drive giving you all kinds of
storage now one of the more interesting
features of this system you actually
can't really see in here there's an
Intel SRT solid state hard drive buried
underneath the graphics card SRT also
provides faster access to commonly used
files so for games or other applications
that you use often it'll be able to load
them up and run them generally a lot
faster than they would otherwise despite
all those great features a problem with
this system is its bang for the buck as
usual the boutique vendors out there are
really pushing hard on performance the
system from origin for example we tested
cost about $1200 and I'll perform this
$19.99 Dell on pretty much every
benchmark that makes it hard to
recommend this system even though it's
relatively capable so overall this is a
well
built PC with some interesting features
but I can't really recommend it because
it doesn't offer enough value for its
price Farmer Brown this is the Dell XPS
