the apple pie for everything inside the
world of Apple but I'm gonna let you be
the judge if our top story deserves a
good Apple or a bad apple now check this
out Apple has posted an open casting
call for their first unscripted reality
series that will be called landed oviya
sorry buddy but I said apps not Apes
sorry man now this is Apple's first
original TV series co-produced with
production company propagate and
musician and tech entrepreneur will I am
who once said when he first tried the
Apple watch this is weird and then
launched his own poll SmartWatch a month
later now planet of the apps will be
more than a reality show developers will
receive mentorship from the world's best
experts in tech and entertainment
they'll also meet with venture
capitalists who will be investing up to
10 million dollars and apps featured in
the show will get prime placement in the
App Store how convenient see it's like
the voice for the tech world without all
the flashy lights and big stages and sex
appeal so really nothing like the voice
but with the right casting you know it
could be really compelling so what do
you think good Apple bad apple let us
know in the comments alright Pokemon go
you know is out of control and it's now
topped Twitter's daily users and people
are spending more time in the app than
on facebook that's huge it's currently
bringing in 1.6 million dollars of
revenue a day and the best thing it's
the first killer app that has opened the
eyes of mainstream audiences to
augmented reality apps now pokeball go
just received its first iOS update for
some bug fixes but the biggest thing it
resolves is the google account privacy
issues after the first version allowed
free reign to all your google data the
game is going to start having sponsored
locations and even legendary pictures is
moving quickly to land a deal for the
movie it's getting out of control plus
i'll only show you how to throw a
curveball if you ask nicely
alright it looks like Apple is working
to expand the dark mode feature for mac
OS dark mode was first introduced in
Yosemite and let you change the menu bar
and dock but developer Gil herm Rambo
has found a way to activate dark mode
for other system apps like Safari or
system preferences in mac OS i think you
mean Michaels so yeah and there he is
now despite rumors Apple hasn't
announced anything related to dark mode
for iOS 10 or Mac OS cereal yet alright
the latest report from market research
firm IDC shows that mac sales a slightly
declined year-over-year in the second
quarter dropping a 4.4 million max from
4.8 million a year ago Apple has also
fallen behind a sous and is now the
fifth largest pc vendor by shipments
worldwide now the biggest reason for the
current decline everyone is waiting for
the new macbook pros that still haven't
been updated in over a year and other
refresh Max and what about that Mac Pro
it's been over two and a half years so
everyone is holding out until then while
PC sales in general are still declining
now they might be a ranked fifth in the
PC sales but when it comes to the Apple
watch we're number one that's according
to JD Power and Associates after they
published their 2016 SmartWatch device
satisfaction report Apple ranked the
highest in customer satisfaction Samsung
came in at number two and Sony at number
three again this is for smartwatches
specifically and not fitness bands Apple
still has yet to reveal actual sales
numbers of the Apple watch even a year
later and these people haven't even
tried out watch os3 which finally makes
it a legit product now I keep telling
you it's changed my mind so you just
wait until the Mickey Mouse watch is on
your watch it's a game-changer all right
here's your obligatory iphone 7 rumor
and news we're starting to get some
really clear shots of the purported rear
case for both the 4.7 and 5.5 inch
iphone 7 rear casing nowhere else fr is
back at it again throwing us a curveball
with the dual lens camera for the larger
iPhone and what looks to be the three
smart connector dots on the lower booty
of the 5.5 inch phone we'll just have to
see if it actually makes it into the
fine
product and the annual iPhone
photography awards have recognized the
best images taken with an iphone as well
as the top iphone ographers for the last
nine years now thousands of pictures
from / 139 countries were submitted and
this year's winner was Chinese
photographer see you on you with an
image he called man and the eagle oh
look how cute that is nose to beak and
we said the 70 year old man is normally
rigid in solemn but things are
completely different when he's with his
beloved Eagle new told Time magazine
that the image was taken with an iphone
5s post processed on snaps need after a
VSCO filter was applied and before we go
our youtube comment of the week goes to
mohammed samir who says you're wearing
lipstick well Mohammed this is all
natural you just stop paying such close
attention to my lips and learn how to
spell alright that's gonna do it for
this week's show you can always email us
