with my good friends planting today I'm
going to teach you how to take care of
planty with a smart gardening system for
free that's right I can be told via
email when planting needs water or
fertilizer or misting and get sunlight
recommendations and temperature
recommendations for zero dollars the way
to do that is with kabocha cheese app a
couple of weeks ago I reviewed their
Wi-Fi sensor and said it didn't feel
worth it because the app can do just
about everything the sensor can do with
just a little bit more setup on your
part today I'm walking you through that
setup so to start the process you're
going to need to pull up the kabocha
application you're going to start by
identifying what type of plant you're
dealing with and then you're ready to
begin the process the first thing you're
going to want to do here is go to the
info screen on the info screen check
sunlight and temperature preferences
carefully for your specific plant now I
go back to the kabocha homepage pull up
this screen and you can see misting in
fertilizer recommendations just based on
your plant preferences and there within
a couple of minutes you have misting
fertilizer sunlight and temperature
ready to go the only thing that's
missing watering recommendations here's
how we do that you're going to start by
calibrating to calibrate you're going to
fully water the plant tell the system
you've ordered the plan then check back
daily because you want to update the
system once the soil has dried out after
a day passes time to check on plenty
again we can do that with the pencil
test place the pencil about an inch into
the dirt and planting soil is not dry
yet I'm going to tell the system that
and then I'll need to check on it
tomorrow so let me show you exactly how
this pencil test works and how you can
use it to tell when the soil is dry so
we're going to try the moisture test on
these three pots dry medium drenched and
we'll see how it works dry and you can
see all the dirt falls right off medium
and you have clumps sticking to it when
I put it into the drenched one you can
see the pencils wet it's got even little
pieces of mud sticking to it so there
you go a quick to second test to let you
know how much moisture your plant has
and they give you an indicator of when
you need to water again once the soil
around planting looks like that driest
soil did and it's just falling off the
pencil I'm going to tell the app that
the soil is dry the app is going to
remember the time frame that it took for
your plant to dry out and it will set a
watering schedule for you and send you
handy-dandy email reminders when it's
time to water next you now know how to
get kabocha zap to set a schedule for
you for moisture misting and fertilizer
as well as providing you sunlight and
temperature recommendations for free
