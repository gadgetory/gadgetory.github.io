underneath the skin it's anything but
Hyundai has apparently beaten all the
bigger competitors to the fuel cell race
in terms of reasonably large production
of a fuel cell vehicle in the market now
let's put a bunch of asterisks on this
they're going to launch this thing in
Southern California only lease only not
a ton of availability even within that
region it's a lease only as I mentioned
at three thousand dollars down in five
hundred bucks a month which may not
sound very interesting until you add in
this detail during that three year lease
your hydrogen is free doesn't matter how
much you driver how much you use it's a
free car to drive as long as you're just
paying for itself okay quick refresher
course on a hydrogen fuel cell cars work
they are electric cars so you've got an
electric motor being driven but then
you've got this whole apparatus right
here which has to create the electricity
out of compressed hydrogen it's not like
you just make a fuel cell you've got to
find a way to hold that high-pressure
hydrogen and then have all these
ancillary systems and this core fuel
cell technology is your secret sauce so
this is quite a coup for Hyundai to get
there apparently first in some volume
production now over here at honda
they're pitching this as their pending
fuel cell car Yeah right i'm not in this
form but what's going on under the hood
is interesting they say the fuel cell
now can live underneath the short
aerodynamic hood in the engine bay
typically fuel cells are kind of big and
got to be put somewhere else where they
intrude on passenger and cargo room so
the gate of the point where packaging is
no longer a hassle with hydrogen fuel
cell vehicles this guy is said to have a
300-plus range on it's smaller and also
higher energy output fuel cell and both
Hyundai and Honda are aiming at the same
thing to try and give you the electric
car cleanness the electric car umph from
great torque and ideally low cost of
ownership with the same short refueling
of a gasoline car these are among the
two to watch in a race that's heating up
very quick
