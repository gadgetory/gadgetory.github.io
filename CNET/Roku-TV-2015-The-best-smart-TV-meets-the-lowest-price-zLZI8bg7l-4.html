2015 version of Roku TV represented by
television is manufactured by TCL sharp
and insignia I review TVs from all three
brands for this video review a 40 inch
TCO a 43 inch sharp and a 55 inch
insignia they were also available in
other sizes from 32 to 55 inches and
while the sharp and insignia are
available exclusively at Best Buy the
TCL can be found in lots of places
including Amazon aside from a few design
differences and a coarse screen size
they're all really similar all the ones
I reviewed have this sort of splayed leg
design although TCL does make a Roku TV
series with a central pedestal stand too
if you're getting one with legs make
sure your tabletop is wide enough beyond
the stands they look basically the same
with thin bezels glossy black plastic
and a prominent Roku TV logo Roku makes
my favorite streaming sticks and boxes
and now it's built directly into these
TVs no box required Roku strengths
include more than 2,000 apps the best
search in the business constant updates
and a dead simple easily customizable
interface that doesn't prioritize one
content provider like Amazon Apple or
Google over any other in most ways it
blows other smart TV systems out of the
water sure it's missing a web browser
fancy motion remotes and voice control
and built-in camera but it has so many
more apps and is much simpler to use
Roku TV makes getting to the apps you
want more painless than ever even the
remote is simple with just a few buttons
and an easy to hold size I also love
this stuff you hook up to the TV like a
cable box or game console appears in a
tile on the home page just like any
other app the Roku TVs have plenty of
inputs - with three HDMI in addition to
analog video digital audio and a
headphone jack nobody's going to be
blown away by these TVs picture quality
but they're not terrible either black
levels and contrast were decent color
was accurate and video processing about
what I expect for this low price on the
other hand the similarly priced Vizio
e-series offers a better picture overall
that said if you want the simplest most
powerful streaming experience and don't
want to buy another box or stick or
juggle another remote these inexpensive
Roku TVs over at the hard
