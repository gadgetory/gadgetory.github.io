dual-exhaust let's do a quick lesson and
exhaust in the first place
they served really free functions the
first is evacuation or scavenging as
it's known in the trade that's the idea
of getting the burned charge that's the
air and fuel it's been combusted out of
the engine it's no good anymore and on
its way quickly and rapidly doing it
efficiently lets the engine generate
more power by breathing more freely
it also can improve mpg your second
major function and obviously a critical
one is emissions your catalytic
converters live on your exhaust system
in line with the pipes now back in the
day before cats you know exhaust systems
weren't really part of emissions so much
now they're a critical part of your
vehicle's compliance with the law and
the last function and the one that's the
most fun to be honest is towed whether
you want a really hush quiet car or one
that has shall we say a certain presence
as you arrive you get that done in the
acoustic design of the exhaust system
either by the factory engineers or by
the guy down at the muffler shop who's
bent a lot of pipes
I love muffler shops in an auto world
full of repairs that consist of
primarily computer dictated part swaps
what happens here is handmade and
verging on art nowhere more true than at
one of the best muffler shops in our San
Francisco area
Johnny Franklin's in San Rafael
California let's take a tour of the
exhaust components of in this case we
got an older car but it hasn't changed
too much now except no catalytic
converters exactly Don Johnson is a
third generation muffler man good choice
to explain how it all works so the first
piece coming off the engine is as the
exhaust manifold right off the cylinder
head itself four cylinders on each side
for the v8 when he's still under firing
at exhaust yep they've got their own
port exactly that exact then it's all
merges into a collector into the exhaust
pipe so now we're under the pipe for the
first point yes bolts up on each side of
one over here one over here yep and then
the front pipes come down does it cross
member here each pipe or otherwise known
as the equalizer pipe if that actually
breaks the pressure between the right
and left sides of the motor so this
could be an X also right can be an X
yeah that you would just kind of do that
yep cross over and now they've changed
sides basically exactly it's also
helping as you guys in the biz say
helping it scavenge absolutely because
each side is kind of helping draw the
other side's exhaust out exactly okay
it's going a venturi effect does this
rushes by it sucks some of the other
stuff with it yep these X or H pipes
also do wonders to give the system a
smoother more muscular sound without it
you'll get that classic lowrider sound
you'll get that right so like a machine
gun sound almost you know sixties Impala
yeah and now we just have some more pipe
until we get to the traditional duals
glass packs here they're a
straight-through design there's no
restriction so the tube actually goes
through the center it's a preparatory
there's not much there to calm it down
and then we'll travel up and over the
rear end and then we finish up with one
last muffler here the exhaust will come
in on both sides and the exhaust would
merge together again
and then out output saw out the
tailpipes on each side okay and then
tailpipes or basically keep the exhaust
up from pooling under the car yeah
without it you'll get fumes obviously
inside the car but also without
tailpipes and you'll pick up a lot of
harmonic
Jeron inside the car customers that have
us do no tailpipes we all kind of joke
around on how many weeks before they're
back back right yeah because of the the
drone is it just a boom you had the car
it's not a pretty sound no it's horrible
now a dual exhaust system is nothing
more than a system that is to exhaust
they're identical on both sides of the
car typically running off two sides of
the engine that usually is predicated on
the engine being a V configuration but
why a duel generally speaking like on an
older vintage car single exhaust to dual
exhaust you're gonna pick up probably
about 20 horsepower on a new modern-day
car you're only gonna pick up probably
about camp
still it's a notable difference yeah and
what about fuel efficiency does it help
get better gas mileage 375 your fuel
mileage is usually about 2 miles a
gallon better newer cars and trucks
really vary from nothing to a mile or
two yeah lots of cars have bogus duals
today they look like duals or even quads
at the rear but there may be only dual
from the catalysts on back or even only
at the tips for cosmetic reasons a true
dual is a parallel system from each of
the two cylinder banks all the way back
to the end if I see two or four tips on
a car today what do I read into that not
so much most of the newer cars you know
that come through the Calla converters
and then they'll split into two and the
rear of the car and it's a little bit
more of a fake dual
if it's a factory muffler system there's
not usually a lot of performance gain if
the aftermarket performance mufflers got
in bulk yes there is a game there and
bottom line is using a lower restriction
muffler versus a regular stock muffler
that's got a little bit more back
pressure to it so there are a lot of
ways to get a better performing exhaust
without this assume of making a dual
exhaust yes but a dual is kind of the
more ambitious level absolutely letting
an engine breathe
yeah absolutely I think the bottom line
is the consumer wants to see dual pipes
on the back of the car is it's adds a
little extra something something back
there it's a car jewelry but this looks
good does it looks great yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
