driving force and most of the cool
technologies we take for granted today
GPS NFC Virtual Assistants fingerprint
readers Bluetooth 4G and even the idea
of a touchscreen really first took off
in the world of smartphones but not
every new smartphone technology trend is
a winner I'm Donna Bell and in this top
five I'm counting down 5 of the dumbest
smartphone fads ranked by CNET senior
editor Jessica dull Court starting
things off at number 5
kick stands these made sense in theory
why not give your arms a rest and just
casually take in some Netflix but in
reality there's rarely a surface
conveniently perched in front of you
when you want to kill time and even then
either your headphones don't reach or
the speakers aren't loud enough for the
angle isn't right or you just have a
panic attack because you actually let go
of your smartphone for five minutes at
number 4 3d anything 3d cameras 3d
screens 3d video 3d games sane people
don't make their phone buying decision
based on which one can play avatar I'm
willing to bet they almost sold an Evo
3d to Anthony Weiner until you realize
that people still need to wear those
dorky glasses to see your pictures
because seriously if you can't tweet
your junk in 3d then what's the point I
also failed to see the point of number 3
dual screens the Samsung continuum the
Kyocera echo the lg double play
Samsung double-time around 2011
everybody was seeing double they were on
the right track people did want bigger
screens and better multitasking but
hinging to crappy screens together is
not the same thing worse you got double
the screen smudge it was like opening up
a smudge sandwich coming in at number 2
Facebook phones here is a site that is
loved by billions and yet when you build
a phone around it people run for the
hills first there was the HTC status
with this dedicated Facebook button then
the HTC Salsa and then figuring that the
third time's the charm
the HTC first now you'd think that they
would have
a couple people in the buying this phone
considering that they released the HTC
first around the same time as the HTC
One but no Facebook can't even trick
people into buying their phone alright
and now the number one worst smartphone
fad miniature phones and I mean the
really small ones not like the HTC One
mini which is actually bigger than the
iPhone as the entire cell phone industry
rushed to create phones of bigger and
bigger screens a few daring rebels
decided to think different
remember the Microsoft Kin one the one
that lasted eight weeks or the HP veer
one of the last gasps of webOS I don't
know if they were trying to market these
things to prison inmates or toddlers but
either way it didn't work so there you
go five smart phone trends that crashed
and burned but there is more for a bonus
flop head over to Jessica doll courts
full gallery and for more top buys from
me
