Oppo find X is the sexiest phone you've
ever seen just feast your eyes on those
curves that rich color that genuine all
screen display and the way the cameras
raised when you want to snap a shot
there is really nothing quite like it
but the fine 2x is more than just its
stellar looks it's a genuinely great
phone that puts those pop-up cameras to
good use taking excellent photos in
order for the screen to span nearly the
entire phone face Oppo put all three
cameras on a module that slides up when
you open up the camera they'll close on
their own when to exit the app you've
got dual 16 and 20 megapixel cameras on
the rear and a twenty five megapixel
selfie camera on the front
like the iPhone 10 this 3d front-facing
camera uses light to unlock the phone
with your face and make secure mobile
payments the cameras main sticking point
is that it can be awkward taking photos
in landscape mode with that camera
module popped out especially if you're
used to holding the phone by its edges
also an all screen face means that you
could accidentally press the display
when you don't mean to the find X isn't
waterproof and there's no wireless
charging but it does have a speedy
processor and Android inside alas most
of us will have to probably admire the
Oppo find X from afar it currently sells
only in Asia but if you do find it
through an online reseller check the
band's first to make sure that you can
still get 4G coverage with your carrier
you and I may not be able to buy the
fine Dax but I'm hoping its innovative
design will inspire other phone makers
to raise their game I candy in the phone
world doesn't get much better than this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
