to the buzz report the show about the
tech news that everyone is talking about
this week iphone 4s has a come back just
in time for blackberries collapse
Netflix can't make up its mind and watch
what happens when Bravo steals our jokes
first up it's a gadje of the week the
gadget of the week is the iphone 4s or
as I'm calling it the comeback kid see
last week I was calling it the iphone
not 5 and actually even the iphone for
psych the iphone 4s announcement was
greeted with pitchforks and torches
because it wasn't an iphone 5 nevermind
the fairly impressive guts a dual-core
processor much better battery life it's
a world phone now it has a better
wireless antenna for improved call
quality and faster data and an even more
amazing camera plus iOS 5 and all that
cool Siri voice assistant technology but
none of that seemed to matter because it
wasn't a redesigned Apple phone until
pre-order time apple said pre-orders top
21 million in just 24 hours shipments
are now delayed from every carrier and
Sprint's sold out of the low-end model
almost immediately iphone 4s appears to
be a hit which I mean what did you
expect it is a new iphone even if it
doesn't look like a new iphone that's
just what happens now it is of course
hard not to imagine that sales of the
iphone 4s were helped by the outpouring
of sadness and support in the wake of
Steve Jobs passing away last week in
fact on Twitter and elsewhere people
were calling the phone the iPhone 4s as
in for Steve even in death he is the
world's best salesman you'll be missed
Steve
now on to the news Oh research in motion
rim's blackberry server suffered a
multi-day outage this week and no one in
North or South America was getting any
email at all that's bad because pretty
much all the blackberry can do these
days is email it's extra bad since it's
happening just as the iphone 4s comes
out a bunch of new phones were announced
at ctia this week and the Samsung Galaxy
Nexus with Android Ice Cream Sandwich is
looming also activist investors are
trying to fire rims to CEOs or even
force a takeover rim is maybe trying to
sell and doesn't really want to be the
busted toaster at the garage sale and
also they would really like to convince
you to buy some blackberry 7 phones so
there's bad timing and then there's I
can't even believe this smoking crater
is happening right before my eyes timing
this is the last one oh hey you know
maybe blackberry could split up its
phone and email services and spin-off
the email services into like a company
called quick stir because I hear that
name is available again that's right
after the disastrous announcement that
Netflix would spin off its DVD rental
service into the new company called
quick stir Netflix CEO Reed Hastings is
taking a mulligan Netflix emailed its
customers to let them know it is not
splitting into two companies after all
and DVD rentals will still be part of
Netflix sorry for any confusion
unfortunately everyone so mad at Netflix
now that even this whole listening to
the customer news was greeted with fury
and mocking possibly because as far as
we know the crappy price hike in the
weak sauce streaming library are also
staying with Netflix I mean you can only
listen to your customers so much you
know in facebook news this week don't
panic it's not another redesign this is
actually good news facebook finally
launched its ipad app this week after a
no-show at f8 and apple's iphone 4s
launch of it best part about it the
photos actually work like they never
seem to on safari oh no no wait that's
not true
the best best part about the ipad app is
that there's no ticker go get it a
Google engineer this week accidentally
published in almost five thousand word
memo that was meant to be an internal
only note it says that Google+ is an
example of Google's quote complete
failure to understand platforms ouch he
says Google+ was a knee-jerk reaction
that Google is openly hostile to
platforms and that they just tried to
whip up a Facebook clone with no outside
developer support and their efforts are
doomed to fail also that poor Google
engineer accidentally posted the whole
thing publicly on Google+ because it's
like impossible to use and figure out
what's public and what's not it's just
all so true Google do not fire that guy
seriously and finally something new and
exciting a major network is casting for
a reality show about young professionals
in the Silicon Valley you know this
sounds really familiar can't quite put
my finger on it oh yes
the real rich white guys of Silicon
Valley every thursday at nine eight
central only by bravo watch what happens
yeah hey major network if that is your
real name when we did that we were
kidding and that's the buzz report for
this week everyone I'm mollywood and
thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
