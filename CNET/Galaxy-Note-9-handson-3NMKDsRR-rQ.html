Galaxy Note 9 this is Samsung's phone
for power users and it is distinguished
by the S Pen Stylus built-in now this
phone is going to differ a little bit
from the galaxy s 9 and last year's Note
8 but it does have some carry overs
mainly you're going to see new features
in the S Pen Stylus and also one or two
in the camera on the back the note 9
looks like a cross between last year's
Note 8 and this year's s9 it's got a big
6.4 inch screen with narrow bezels those
trademark curved sides and a glossy back
with the fingerprint reader just below
the camera thankfully it's not off to
the side this year a note isn't a note
without the s-pen and Samsung made the
note 9 stylus a whole lot more
interesting you can still use it to
navigate write and draw but it now comes
equipped with Bluetooth capabilities
that let you use the s-pen as a remote
control for example long press the
button to launch the camera app double
tap to switch to selfie mode and then
tap again to take the photo you can
customize the actions in the settings
and control up to seven devices this way
when you place the s-pen back into the
holster it will fully charge in under a
minute the note annoyance cameras are
almost exactly the same setup that you
get on the galaxy s 9 plus but there is
one difference the note 9 has new AI
software inside that will automatically
detect one of 20 scenes and optimize the
camera settings to try to make your
photo look its best camera AI is on by
default but you can turn it off in the
settings if you don't like it oh and if
you blink or somebody moves the note 9
will prompt you to retake your photos
there's an 8 megapixel front-facing
camera to an - 12 megapixel rear cameras
one with a dual aperture lens that will
switch apertures for better low-light
shots
the note 9 makes a play for longer
battery life with a huge 4000
milliampere hour battery you charge up
the phone through a USBC cable or a
wireless charger Samsung's brand new 15
watt accessory called the wireless
charging duo can charge two devices at
once inside the phone you're looking at
a top-of-the-line Snapdragon 845
processor and either 128 or 512
gigabytes of internal storage that is
huge and there's of course an external
storage slot as well good news for
everyone is that the Galaxy Note 9 keeps
the headphone jack and both the phone
and as pen are fully water resistant you
also get the same two external speakers
as the Galaxy S nine and the ability to
plug into any large screen with a
compatible hdmi adapter with high-end
specs and a few more tricks than last
year's note 8 the galaxy note 9 is on
track to draw in note 5 owners looking
for an upgrade and other power users
looking for a new phone with the most
tools if you like what you see with
samsung's galaxy note 9 you can
pre-order the device on August 10th and
it will arrive in stores on August 24th</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
