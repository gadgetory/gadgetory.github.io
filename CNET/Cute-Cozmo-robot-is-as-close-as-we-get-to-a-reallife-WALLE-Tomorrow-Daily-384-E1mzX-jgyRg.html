best geek talk-show in the known
universe
I'm Jeff ca√±ada flying solo today
because Ashley Escada
has the day off but fear not we still
have your daily dose of headlines if
you're like me when you saw the movie
wall-e
you wanted a little robot friend well
guess what
check out Cosmo unki announced Cosmo
this morning a small robot that they're
claiming is one of the quote most
sophisticated consumer robots available
today
unquote Cosmo has an emotion engine and
AI onboard allowing him to express
emotions through voice and expressions
and he can even recognize faces that he
sees often if you leave him alone he
even gets sad he'll work with iOS and
Android devices and he looks like he
could be as adorable as Anki claims
hopefully this isn't just a Tamagotchi
on steroids but if you want to get your
hands on Cosmo unki already has a
pre-order page up and orders ship this
October I want one of these little guys
but he is little if you see in the video
it's really tiny I was kind of hoping
you might be a little more I don't know
r2d2 sighs but I think it's still very
very cool Johns Hopkins University is
celebrating and very interesting
prototype this morning as well
when George LaVey lost his hands to a
meningitis infection he still wanted to
play games so he teamed up with two
other grad students and made gear or
game enhancing augmented reality it
looks like a simple pair of platform
sandals but each one has a trio of
sensors inside that can be mapped to
game controls allowing someone without
hands to play video games with up to 20
different specific actions the result is
good enough that 80% of a small survey
of around 50 viewers couldn't tell the
difference between which people used
gear and which didn't it recently won
the grand prize in the 2016 Intel
Cornell Cup and the team is already in
the process of patenting and potentially
licensing the concept this is fancy
fasik anything that allows more gamers
with varying levels of ability to play
games I'm in favor of and I just think
this is a spectacular achievement and
making more accessibility for more
people well if you want to comment on
our stories you can always use our
hashtag hate TD that's hey TD like
you're shouting at us and then on
Thursday when Ashley's back and we're
hitting sitting here chatting together
about the stories we will use your
comments and incorporate them into our
discussion I think it's safe to say
Ashley would want us to talk about a
little robot she's fascinated with
robots as am i so I think we're probably
gonna be talking about that one but you
can comment on either story but using
hey TD as the hashtag alright now it's
time for our phone tog refer of the day
today's phone geographer of the day is
Raphael who took this photo with an
iPhone 6s Raphael writes hi Ashley and
