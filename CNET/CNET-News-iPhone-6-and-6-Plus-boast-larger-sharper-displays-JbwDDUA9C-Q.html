advancement in the history of iPhone and
I couldn't be more excited and more
proud to show it to you now these are
the new iPhones the iPhone 6 and the
iPhone 6 plus they are without a doubt
the best iPhones we've ever done and I
hope you'll agree they're the best
phones you have ever seen to tell you
all about them I'd like to invite Phil
Schiller up to the stage their design is
like nothing ever before incredibly
unique from the glass front that curves
around the side to meet seamlessly with
the anodized aluminum back completely
with stainless steel Apple it is truly
the most beautiful phone you have ever
seen and from the start the team is
envisioned that the new iPhone 6 would
come with two display sizes but not any
display would do these are a new
generation Retina displays we call them
retina HD and they are by far the most
beautiful displays ever built into a
phone they are new in every way they're
incredibly bright their colors are
stunning they're accurate srgb accurate
and across from the top to the bottom
the team has worked hard to make them
the best we know how from their eye on
strength and glass all the way down to
new thinner back lights and yes they're
bigger they're a lot bigger here on the
left is an iPhone 5s in the center
iPhone 6 and on the right the iPhone 6
plus that you can see the difference and
if you don't know here's their sizes and
boy are they packed with pick
the new iPhone 6 I'm sure somebody
already done the math has over 1 million
pixels in the iPhone six-plus over 2
million pixels both thinner than any
phones we've ever made the text is
incredible - even sharper and more of it
you can see here in the messages app the
iPhone 6 displays more than before and
the 6 plus displays more in as extra
room there so we put your friends faces
right there front and center and when
you turn them in landscape we show more
as well so for example the messages app
now has a new horizontal to up display
your weather shows more of your day
stocks for those of you fall stocks you
get a great horizontal view now with two
up male has two up so you can see your
inbox and your messages and when you
bring up the keyboard in any of your
apps with the iPhone 6 plus the keyboard
takes advantage of the display area to
give you some more keys for example
dedicated keys for cut copy and paste
there's even a new horizontal home
screen view if you'd like to work this
way with your dock along the right-hand
side we've also added a brand new
gesture specifically for the iPhone 6
and 6 plus it's called reach ability
what's reach ability well if you double
touch not even precious double touch the
touch ID button this is what happens the
whole display slides down so you can
reach anything at the top without having
to take your hand off the bottom of the
display it's so convenient and intuitive
did we really like to use it and once
you tap something it slides right back
up again the team even took the
sleep/wake button from the top and moved
it to the right-hand side so that's easy
to press as well all one-handed so the
team has done a great job building
beautiful displays but a lot of pixels
making it a thinner iPhone that ever
before making it easier to use
one-handed
