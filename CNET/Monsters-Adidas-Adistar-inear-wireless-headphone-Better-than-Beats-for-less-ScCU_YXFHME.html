headphones and this is the wireless in
your sports model the hundred dollar
adidas Sport Addie star and it's a good
one this is a noise-isolating headphones
and that means you have to jam the tips
into your ears to get the best sound
what's good about this headphone is that
monster includes its sport clip wings
that lock the butt in place and help
create a secure tight seal you can run
with these headphones they are rated as
sweat proof though not waterproof but
just be aware that you won't be able to
hear traffic noise if you're playing
your music and moderate to high volumes
due to their noise isolating nature the
other noteworthy feature is the dual
battery design that boosts battery life
to as much as eight hours depending on
the volume level and I like how you
charge the battery through a micro USB
port in the inline remote rather than
the bud monster also makes the monster
clarity HD wireless for twenty dollars
less it's the same headphone but doesn't
come with the sport clip wings and ships
with a different carrying pouch but the
two headphones sound the same as long as
you can get a tight seal their sound
quality is quite decent though not
exceptionally good for Bluetooth audio
the headphones offer strong fairly tight
bass and reasonable clarity up to about
75% volume but distort a bit when you
push the volume to the top especially
with more complicated tracks that have a
lot of instruments playing at once but
they're definitely a step up from
cheaper Wireless sports headphones and
they're one of the few in your wireless
headphones that fit my ears well so
they're definitely worth checking out my
only reservation about them is that they
aren't completely waterproof I'm David
Carr noise thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
