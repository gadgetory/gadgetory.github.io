freebie three months no charge but now
those free trials are ending we asked
people if they've tried Apple music and
if they like it so have you tried up a
music I have not why haven't you tried
it out um I have actually never heard of
it have you signed up for Apple music um
no I don't think so have you guys signed
up for Apple music I have not I have not
either no you haven't not yet I know I
haven't not yet not yet do you plan to I
haven't decided why why are you still
thinking about it just cuz there's so
much free music out there I haven't
really figured out if i want to start
subscribing to anything yet have you
signed up for Apple music yeah I was for
like one month have you turned off the
auto renew so that you're not charged
yeah what programs do you maybe YouTube
you have our five everywhere and the
city so it's better have you tried Apple
music yeah I tried do you plan to pay no
I turn off that auto renew option when
did you turn it off as soon as I bought
it what was it about it that you decided
that you didn't want to pay for it
because there's already like free
streaming music so have you signed up
for Apple music yes I have do you plan
to pay for it once the free trials end
you know I'm not so sure anymore this
whole Apple music thing is very
frustrating how is it frustrated you
it's I don't know it's created a lot of
complexities I don't know if my music is
synced up between my phone my iPad my
computer is it in is it not in is it you
know in the cloud what Apple has done is
introduced a service that's basically a
Spotify but from apple but you haven't
tried out the apple rival to I have not
is that because why are you know about
it you're happy with Spotify it's just
like convenient it's hooked up to all my
devices why haven't you tried it I have
a Spotify subscription so I really no
need to do it because i use Spotify and
I've already built all my place
and share down we ended up speaking with
more than 20 iPhone owners most people
said they just weren't using Apple music
even with people who tried it nobody was
certain about paying and that is
probably music to Spotify cheers for
