student from MIT has developed obstacle
detection software that allows a drone
to autonomously fly at speeds of up to
30 miles per hour avoiding trees along
the way mit computer science and
artificial intelligence PhD student
andrew Berry built the drone out of
standard component parts adding
stereoscopic cameras to both the wings
so that the drone can scan its
surroundings in real-time up to 33 feet
in front of it he embedded an algorithm
into the software that allows the drone
to see its surroundings and turn to
avoid objects in its path autonomously
the software quickly extracts depth
information from the view of the cameras
at a rate of 120 frames per second at a
speed of 8.3 milliseconds per frame
Barry is working to improve his
algorithm to work at different depths
allowing a drone to fly safely through
more crowded settings nASA released a
video of the Sun this week that was
produced at NASA's Solar Dynamics
Observatory in studying 4k Ultra
high-definition video capturing these
close-up video images of the Sun is no
walk in the park however each minute of
footage takes the observatory media
specialists about 10 hours to produce
using a complicated process according to
the video NASA's Solar Dynamics
Observatory images the Sun every 12
seconds and ten wavelengths of invisible
ultraviolet light each wavelength is
assigned a unique color and every image
is eight times the resolution of HD
video
X Dubai and jet man Dubai took to the
skies again for another jetpack flying
adventure centered around in emirates
airlines airbus a380 superjumbo jet the
jetpack wearing Daredevils only have
about 10 minutes of fuel in those
personal jetpack devices but it was
enough time to get some amazing footage
of the jet packs flying alongside the
massive jumbo jet make sure to read the
article and watch the video in its
entirety embedded in the crave blog post
NASA's newest Mars spacecraft maven was
launched in 2013 to help figure out why
Mars lost its early atmosphere it
arrived at the planet and began orbiting
Mars in 2014 and since then has provided
NASA scientists with vast amounts of
data to help crack this long-standing
mystery well this morning NASA held a
live press conference to explain what it
believes caused Mars to be stripped of
its atmosphere to help illustrate what
researchers had discovered NASA lead
scientist Michael Meyer borrowed a song
lyric from Bob Dylan stating the answer
my friends is blowin in the wind NASA
scientists believe that Mars was
stripped of its atmosphere by solar
winds radiating from our own Sun which
over a long period of time eventually
blew away all of the ions in Mars
atmosphere it is believed that Mars was
once a lush water covered planet just
like Earth but because of its lack of a
magnetic field which repels solar winds
from the Sun on Earth Mars was
vulnerable and was basically being
constantly pressure washed by charged
ions blasting its surface from the Sun
this allowed the Mars atmosphere to
slowly escape and dissipate into space
leaving in a cold desert like lifeless
planet stay tuned to the krave blog for
more information on nasa's big
announcement
