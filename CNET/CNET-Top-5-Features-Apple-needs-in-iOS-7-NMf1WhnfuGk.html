right now I mean sure they're sitting on
a few billion dollars but when the most
anticipated product coming out of your
company is a wristwatch you might be in
trouble it's also an off year in terms
of iphone models who's excited for the
iPhone 5s that's what I thought no what
Apple really needs right now is a new
innovative version of iOS preferably one
that won't turn my old iphone into a
sluggish turd but what can Apple do in
iOS 7 to keep their customers from
looking at the competition I'm Donald
Bell and in this top 5 i'm counting down
these 5 features apple desperately needs
an iOS 7 starting off at number 5 better
multitasking this whole double tap and
swipe thing gets old real quick when
you're trying to get real work done with
the iPad at least you can do that four
finger swipe to switch between apps so
either give us that for the iPhone or
maybe something cooler like a palm swipe
or a big blue or maybe you rub it on
your belly I mean multitasking OS 10 is
insanely good just give us a taste of
that coming in at number four automatic
app updates how much time have I wasted
reading through the release notes of
some dumb app update bug fixes I get it
how about you just update it already can
you just set it up so the apps update
automatically over your home Wi-Fi when
you're charging at night or at least
give me the option of that the only time
I've ever thought twice about updating
my software is when you switched out
google maps for Apple maps which brings
us to number three better maps I think
we all know that Apple maps could still
use a little work or a lot in the
meantime how about you swallow your
pride and let user set what map program
they want to use by default also how
about an offline mode the times I need
maps most are either when I'm stuck out
in the boonies with 0 reception or
another country where data costs will
bankrupt me just put the map industry
out of business already
at number two multiple account login now
I know that Apple would prefer that i
buy iPads for everyone in my home but
until then it would be incredibly
convenient to share one iPad with
different user accounts one personal
account for me maybe a separate work
account and account to my wife once my
kid that's locked into a safe mode maybe
even a guest account it's something that
traditional computers have been doing
for years and it's great for keeping
information private and great for
keeping your kids games out of sight all
right before we get to the number one
feature Apple needs in iOS 7 I have to
take a minute to put in my own
relatively minor requests can we please
get rid of newsstand I can't delete this
thing I can't bury it in a folder why is
this app not an optional install like I
books it just sits there staring back at
us as a constant reminder sometimes
Apple has really bad ideas while you're
at it let's go through the rest of my
undeletable junk folder on my iPhone
calculator compass voice memos weather
passbook Game Center stocks they're all
fine apps but give me a choice to either
download them or delete them this is
annoying speaking of annoying here is
the number one feature that Apple needs
to fix an iOS 7 settings for a company
that loves touting that their products
just work why do I have to click three
places just to turn bluetooth on and off
or change the screen brightness you
really got to simplify this thing and
make the everyday stuff easier to get to
you know like Android so there you go
five changes that I think will be key
for Apple to include an iOS 7 in order
to stay competitive before we send me
that hate mail be sure to get fully
fired up by the 15 features ZDNet Zack
Whittaker is asking from iOS 7 I got a
number of these from his piece as well
as luke westaway wish list over on cnet
UK but if I won you over you can check
out more top fives like this or at top 5
cnet com Donald Bell thanks for watching
