flagship phone for the year 1 + decided
to launch another even better device
calls the 1 + 3 T the phone is different
in three major ways first it's got more
power and now has qual comes most recent
Snapdragon 820 1 processor and a faster
at 2.30 5 gigahertz clock speed though
it yielded slightly higher benchmark
scores I really didn't notice much of a
difference with day-to-day tasks like
launching the camera and switching
between apps the battery jumped from a 3
ampere hours to 3.4 am Pierrot battery
during our preliminary battery during
test for continuous video playback on
airplane mode the 3t lasted 16 hours and
45 minutes
a notable 2.5 hours longer than the 3
second you'll now get a 16 megapixel
front-facing camera instead of 8
megapixels it also performs better in
low light so your selfies will look just
as had better the rear camera has
remained pretty much unchanged as far as
photo quality is concerned oneplus said
it has improved its image stabilization
capabilities for video but to the naked
eye it's kind of difficult to discern
finally the 3t is loaded with a handful
of new software tweaks there are more
gesture controls like sliding your
fingers for a screen shot and you can
assign passwords to your apps for extra
protection the Shelf homepage screen
which gives you quick access to your
contacts and other widgets also got a
facelift oneplus said that the software
upgrades on the 3t will roll out to the
three as well so that's some bit of good
news for you three owners out there the
3t is slightly more expensive at four
hundred and thirty-nine dollars it comes
in a darker gray color and there's a new
128 gig memory option available which
costs one hundred and seventy nine
dollars if you already own the three
don't worry you're not missing out on
much aside from the battery boost and
maybe some better selfies rest assured
the 3t isn't some phenomenal upgrade as
for those who have yet to purchase any
phones the 3t has all the things we
already love about the three plus all
the goodies you just heard about we
strongly recommended that three when it
came out and we feel this
same way with a 3t</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
