look at Apple's big music recording
program that is logic pro 10.1 Logic Pro
10 last year was the kind of big step
phone that really remade and changes
this program a lot it's basically the
main competitor to something like Pro
Tools that a lot of professional
musicians and producers use with Logic
Pro 10 they're trying to bring in more
the GarageBand crowd that used Apple's
uh a more consumer level music
production software and kind of ease
them into using this much more powerful
much more professional suite you can do
a lot with it from recording real-life
audio to doing a lot of MIDI recording
and of course tons of editing and
effects and the thing I like most about
it is something that they added last
year and they continued with now which
is the ability to use your iPad as a
remote control surface time right into
this there's some interesting stuff
especially if you're interested in
electronic music they've taken the
drummer app which is built right into
this which is one of the most useful
things really in it and they've added a
whole bunch of new electronic drummers
so if I go down here I can see all these
little personalities and each one of
them has their own set of different
beats and styles and fills and sort of a
mentality about drumming and you can
pick any one of them and it'll start
playing a beat and then you can actually
control that in real time by moving this
little slider from simple to complex
from loud to saw and if you don't want
to use an electronic drummer you can use
the traditional rock drummer the
interesting thing here is if I go to
let's say a rock drummer alright and I
open him up as a character I see a drum
kit up here and if I click on the drum
kit obviously I can play all the sounds
on the drum kit one of the new things is
if I go to one of the electronic
drummers it's not a drum kit and at all
anymore it's a drum machine and I can do
the same thing here and it really
behaves like a drum machine there's a
new compressor that really closely
mimics a lot of classic hardware
compressors that people would normally
use in their signal chain and a lot of
the plugins have kind of this vintage
real-life equipment look and there's
smart quantize which now takes the notes
that you play in a MIDI region and you
can
the quantize the note would be to kind
of lock it in to the time signature of
the song this takes a lot more into
account and retains more of the human
feel rather than giving the robotic feel
which is what happens when you quantize
notes a lot of the time and I can put my
faders up on here or I can put my faders
here on the on the remote control pad
and the great thing about that is you
can get your mixing board up here and
grab more than one fader at once in real
time just with your fingers pull them
all down or pull them up like that and
you can actually if you don't have an
actual keyboard sitting here and you can
just play directly in the app like Logic
Pro 10 10.1 is a it's a $200 app
purchase and with that you also get
access to the remote app that you can
use on your iPad if you have last year's
version Pro 10 this is a free upgrade
I'm Dan Ahmed and that is Apple's Logic
Pro 10.1</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
