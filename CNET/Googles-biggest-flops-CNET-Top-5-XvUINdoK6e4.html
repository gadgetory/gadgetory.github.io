flops Google has had lots and lots of
successful products their search maps
assistant chrome pixels that's a pretty
good track record but the company does
not always knock it out of the park with
everything let's talk about the duds
number five Google video stuff we're
going to lump google video and the
original Google TV together when it
comes to video Google did not get it
right for a long time in case you forgot
Google video was a site where people
could upload their own videos for a
while the company had both Google Video
and YouTube coexisting before betting on
YouTube YouTube was something Google
acquired so at least it bought wisely
then there was Google TV you could get
it on Sony devices like the NSC gs-7
what was the problem no dedicated apps
for things like Hulu Amazon and even
Google's own movie rental service Google
TV became Android TV which has since
taken over the world as we all know
right coming in at number four is Google
Wave do you remember Google Wave it was
this collaborative editing web app you
could write entries with other people or
add comments in real time it was also a
cross between email and forms and Docs
so as it was a confusing product it
didn't really catch on as of April 30th
2012 Google Wave was shut down all parts
of Google Wave ended up in Google Docs
which made sense since you'd want
real-time collaboration there and number
three is Google Buzz this was a Google
social networking venture here's what
happened if you tried buzz in Gmail
you'd automatically follow everyone in
your Gmail contact list of vanity URL
made your email address very very
available oh did I mention that the
mobile version of buzz broadcast your
location by including it in your buzz
post yep the close linking of Gmail and
Buzz Plus the hole location thing did
not fare well for Google those are just
some of the reasons why buzz was shut
down it's a good thing Google didn't try
to do a social network again right wait
they did number 2 the Nexus Q seriously
what the heck was this thing look at it
it's an orb of wonder here's what it was
supposed to do play music directly from
google play music as well as video from
Google Play and YouTube the cue could
also power speakers if you wanted to
stream from something like Netflix or
Spotify nope what about your own server
nope how do you control it an Android
phone it only costs $300 Google
rethought the queue before going all in
with it pre-orders were shipped at
people at no cost most of the features
you would get from the queue wound up in
the much more successful and reasonably
priced chromecast and the biggest Google
flop has to be Google Plus Google Plus
arrived at a time where people were
hungry for an alternative to Facebook it
seemed like a good way to start over
with a social network you could easily
share two circles of people but it
failed to really catch on like Facebook
did which is not a ding Facebook has
something like 2 billion monthly active
users
that's insane Google Plus is in the
process of shutting down at this point
after a big flock came to light one
Google engineer wrote about his
experience on the plus team he said that
if your team integrated Google Plus
features on Gmail or Android the team
would get a 1 point 5 - 3 X multiplier
on top of their yearly bonus he went on
to say you read that correctly off ton
of money to ruin the product you were
building with bloated garbage that no
one wanted no one really needed this
this made plus the center of the Google
universe Google put a lot of time money
and personnel into Plus and soon it'll
be dead I think that qualifies it as the
biggest dud so the lesson here is Google
will eventually be successful with
social networking once it buys Twitter
special mentions to the Nexus 7 Android
for tablets and frugal Amaya's actor and
I'll see you online</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
