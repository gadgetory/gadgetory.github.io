their cars in recent years this one may
be the most conservative here's the
third-generation came in and compared to
how they redid the Boxster and the 911
recently it's relatively subtle the
wheelbase is longer the cars track is
wider but overall the proportions look
about the same to me you've got the new
corporate headlight shape in there as
well and kind of a little more of a
massive angular thing to it but just a
little now in terms of engine not here
back there you've got two engines the
2.7 flat 6 which delivers 275 horsepower
and gets you the 16 about 5.4 seconds
the hotter engine in the S is the 3.4
litre flat 6 325 horsepower and 0 to 60
about 4.7 seconds depending on the
gearbox now you can get a pretty
efficient Cayman if you get a base car
with a PDK and don't hammer it too hard
you're looking at 32 miles per gallon on
the highway this might being in the
little fuel sipper you've been looking
for other steps to increase the
efficiency on this guy include greater
use of aluminum in the body and
structure takes off 5060 pounds that's a
lot in a fairly small car you're also
gonna find auto start/stop technology in
here not my favorite in performance cars
I hope it's defeatable an electric power
assisted steering purists will squawk
but knowing Porsche it's pretty well
dialed in pricing hasn't changed much on
these cars still in the high 50s low to
mid 60's and then you start to option
them up and they can get to the 80s
really easily these will be arriving in
early spring 2013
