get an iPhone and should you get an
iPhone se the tiny iPhone se came out a
year ago it's still around but Apple
added more storage it's 32 or 128
gigabytes now versus 16 or 64 gig back
then the SE is still the best bang for
the buck though in iPhones it looks just
like an iPhone 5s but its insides are
basically an iPhone 6s it has Apple pay
touch ID good front and rear cameras and
it runs iOS 10 well all you lose is the
pressure-sensitive 3d touch and a larger
screen I've been living with the se
again and it does everything fine except
that screen being so small with a lot of
bezel to take some getting used to
you're either in love with the idea of a
super small phone think you can deal
with it for the price or hate it you
probably already know the answer but
considering the iPhone se is $400 for 32
gigs of storage which is acceptable
compared to last year 16 gigabyte
package or $500 for 128 gigabytes it
cost considerably less than the iPhone
6s which starts at 550 the iPhone 7 and
7 plus are still better phones but you
don't actually lose all that much with
the SE the 7 and 7 plus are faster had
better cameras and they're
water-resistant at least the SE has a
headphone jack there are more affordable
Android phones that do a lot of things
well but this is the best budget iphone
at the moment it's still a good choice
for people who don't want to pay a lot
but if you want a good tiny less
expensive iPhone the iPhone se is still
worth it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
