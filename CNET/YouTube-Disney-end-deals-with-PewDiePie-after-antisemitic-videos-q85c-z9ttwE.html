relationships with YouTube superstar
Felix Shelburne better known as
PewDiePie after he posted multiple
videos that featured anti-semitism and
Nazi imagery on his YouTube channel the
27 year old Swedish born video star has
YouTube's most subscribed channel with
53 million subscribers in a video from
January 11th he paid two men to hold up
an anti-semitic sign in another video he
paid a man to dress like Jesus and talk
in support of Hitler The Wall Street
Journal found 9 videos that included
such anti-semitic jokes and Nazi imagery
the YouTube star had a business
partnership with Disney's maker studios
and when the journal reached Disney for
comment
the company said it was severing ties
with shell Berg and a spokeswoman said
quote although felix has created a
following by being provocative and
irreverent he clearly went too far in
this case and the resulting videos are
inappropriate after the videos gained
widespread attention YouTube cancelled
the second season of pewdiepies reality
show and pulled his channel from its
premium ad revenue program his channel
will still be making money from
traditional YouTube display ads in these
controversial videos shel Berg did not
outright endorse anti-semitic ideas he
has since insisted he does not support
any kind of hateful attitudes and that
he was doing it to highlight the
absurdity of services like Fiverr where
you could pay someone five bucks to say
anything
PewDiePie became popular for making
videos of himself playing video games
and he's known for crude humor he
reportedly earned about 14.5 million
dollars last year from his videos for
