Facebook announced changes to its
newsfeed with the goal to defeat ad
blockers according to the New York Times
Facebook's plan would be to make content
and ads indistinguishable to ad blockers
Facebook also said it updated its ad
preferences controls so that users had
more control over what they saw
Facebook's ad blocker blocker would only
work on the desktop version of Facebook
Facebook will not go around ad blockers
on mobile devices the company said it
would take an ad blocker too many
resources to attempt to parse out ads
from content so of course adblock plus a
popular ad blocker found a workaround
within two days however Facebook says
adblock pluses workaround also filters
out things other than ads the battle
wasn't over at this point according to
TechCrunch Facebook then upgraded its
methods and now has a workaround for
adblock plus his workaround you got that
in short Facebook's newest ad blocker
blocker should block adblock pluses ad
blocking which defeated Facebook's old
ad blocker blocker clear as mud right
let me try that again
Facebook wants you to see ads on the
desktop and if you have an ad blocker
installed Facebook will keep trying to
defeat it that's it for this tech news
