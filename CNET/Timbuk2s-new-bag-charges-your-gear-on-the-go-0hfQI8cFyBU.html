we're taking a first look not at a piece
of software but at something a little
bit more physical we've got this new
Timbuktu power commute bag and what
makes it so special is that it comes
with a rechargeable battery pack that
can recharge your devices like phones
and tablets while you are running around
with a bag on your back let's take a
look inside so the power commute is a
standard timbuk2 messenger bag it has
Timbuktu's well-known three panel design
it has Timbuktu's multitude of pockets
here here here but the best thing about
the timbuk2 power commute and what i
like about it so much is in this little
pocket inside is the joey t1 a battery
pack that you can use to charge your
devices the joey takes about six hours
to charge fully overnight but from there
it can charge any of your devices like
your phone's up to two and a half to
three times and it can charge an ipad 2
up to one and a half times the pocket
that the Joey lives in allows it to stay
in one place as the cable can reach all
the way across the bag to charge the
device the bag comes with an external
cord that you can then plug into the
Joey and then you plug the other end
into your phone so the joey is now
charging my phone and it can take it
from about 5% battery charge to 30
percent in around 20 minutes the joy
works with a multitude of devices
including Apple iPhones iPads Android
devices really anything with a USB or
micro USB the bag is not only TSA
compliant with pouches for laptop and
tablets but there's also a little slot
for the Joey to slide to the back of the
bag so can reach your device's here
while the bag is closed the timbuk2
power commute bag also works with most
Timbuktu accessories like the snoop
camera bag the timbuk2 power commute
retails for 199 and it also comes in a
backpack model for around the same price
with your first look at the timbuk2
power commute I'm Seth Rosenblatt</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
