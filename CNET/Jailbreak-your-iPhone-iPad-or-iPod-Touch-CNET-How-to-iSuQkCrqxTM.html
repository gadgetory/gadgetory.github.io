difficult task only the real tech-savvy
would tackle but nowadays it's so much
easier and totally legal so if you want
to completely customize your device
install app so you don't see in the App
Store and get new system settings that
make your life easier
here's how you jailbreak your iPhone
iPad or iPod Touch first backup your
device plug it in to your computer
launch iTunes and adjust the settings to
back up everything like photos and
contacts then right-click your device
select backup and let it sink when
that's done grab your device and go to
Settings General reset and erase all
content and settings when it restarts go
through the activation steps but set it
up as a new device okay now back on your
computer go to the green poison website
and download the most recent version of
absinthe for your operating system I'm
currently using iOS 5.1.1 on my iPhone
but new versions of absinthe will be
released as Apple updates its iOS launch
the Installer and it will spend a few
minutes extracting files then open the
new absinthe folder and launch the app
you'll see this dialog box and when it
detects that your phone is plugged in
click jailbreak this will take a few
more minutes as the phone resets itself
again while the new software is
installed when absinthe is done running
your phone is officially jailbroken but
now you'll need to get all your old data
back on it so you can use it to do that
launch i-tunes right-click your device
and select restore from backup select
the appropriate backup and when you're
done you're good to go at first your
device might look the same but now you
can find all the extra apps settings and
tweaks in this new app called Cydia it's
like an underground app store filled
with content you could never get
otherwise so
with my jailbroken phone I can create
hidden shortcuts from the lockscreen
access settings from the Notification
Center and even get Siri to do things
like toggle Wi-Fi turn Wi-Fi on enabling
Wi-Fi again when iOS 6 is released and
you want all of its new features you'll
have to jailbreak your device again but
that's a small price to pay for complete
control over your gadget if you have any
questions hit me up on Twitter and
