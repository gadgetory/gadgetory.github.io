phone is missing something you'd want
say a great camera long battery life for
a headphone jack
Samsung has been the only phone maker to
offer into everything but the kitchen
sink phone but now there's the LG v 30
as well okay it's big and expensive at
eight hundred and thirty dollars for the
unlocked version that works on every
carrier trust me you'll want that but
for the money the V 30 includes
practically every feature I cranked
vibrant OLED screen check gorgeous glass
and metal build yep
waterproofing and wireless charging
totally fingerprint sensor yes and it's
beautifully placed unlike samsung's
camera smudge magnet and if you're a
headphone jack junkie check this out the
V 30 has the jack and a built-in digital
and analog converter that makes my music
sound awesome it it idli you'll need
some decent headphones to really notice
so here's the part where I'd usually
revealed the deal breaking law say a
crappy camera a poor battery life but no
my v30 always lasts well past bedtime
and our tests show the battery
neck-and-neck with Samsung's similarly
sized phones and while Mattila cameras
on the v30 don't have a fancy portrait
mode they take better photos than
Samsung during the day time even a Phil
G's slow autofocus made me miss some
shots in low-light particularly love
LG's wide-angle camera which you won't
find on competing phones honestly I do
think that the V 30s design needs some
work it's wide kind of slippery and the
rough edges on the USB port make my
usual pinkie hold hurt and I wouldn't
buy this phone to shoot casual video
either Samsung Apple and Google pixel
phones all have better video
stabilization and shoot crisper footage
in full auto mode but if you're a pro
it's worth noting the V 30 can natively
shoot log format video which offers more
dynamic range that you can tweak and
post
speaking of which curious to find out
did you notice we shot this entire
review with the LG v 30 itself
