of the Samsung UN 55 F 6400 LCD
television if there's one thing Samsung
has traditionally done well its
mid-price LCDs with respectable image
quality and affordable prices the F 6400
sits firmly in this category and comes
in a variety of sizes from 40 inches way
up to a huge 75 inches which at five
thousand dollars breaks the mold just a
little bit the focus in the F 6400
series is features with voice
interaction Smart TV cable box control
and 3d all included the TV comes with a
touchpad remote which also makes web
browsing easier the TV's design is
fairly slick with a thin bezel all
around but it has this fairly flimsy
feeling stands that Samsung has
introduced this year on its cheaper
models and we don't like it very much at
all picture quality is fairly average
for while the TV has micro dimming it
doesn't enhance contrast at all so we
left it off black levels and shadow
detail are better than the equivalent LG
la 6200 but compared to the excellent
Vizio m-series or Panasonic ST 60 it
just can't compete color performance was
mostly good darker colors such as
shadows did look a little d saturated
though the TV also had some issues with
uniformity and there are a couple of
kidney-shaped gray patches on a black
screen on the model we received the
Samsung F 6400 offers up a lot of
features but compared to the best TVs at
its price it doesn't offer competitive
picture quality and I'd recommend
looking at vizio or Panasonic instead
surprisingly even the Panasonic East 60
LCD is better than this table this has
been ty Pendlebury for cnet.com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
