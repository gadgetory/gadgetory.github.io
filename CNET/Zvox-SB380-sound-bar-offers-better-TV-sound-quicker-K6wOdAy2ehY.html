have ever owned one you have ZBOX to
thank the company basically invented the
soundbar and with the new SB 380 it's in
the process of trying to perfect it
trying is the operative word though this
model isn't quite there yet at $300 it's
a bit too expensive and weirdly doesn't
have bluetooth but it's easier to use
than its competition and it's excellent
if you need help hearing dialogue in TV
shows the speaker itself is 35 inches
wide and it's taller than most at almost
6 inches high you can lay the speaker
flat though where it only sticks up
about 3 inches it's made of aluminum and
can easily survive more than a few
knocks if you happen to lose the dinky
little remote the speaker has controls
on the side this is a three point one
system in a single bar with three
mid-range drivers and a four inch woofer
its ported at one end so you can wall
mount it without any problems the lack
of Bluetooth means you won't play music
through this thing unless you use one of
two optical inputs for the analog ports
but we found that music replay wasn't
very convincing anyway most sound bars
aren't set up for music and this is true
of the C box it's dialogue of movie
soundtracks with the SB 380 excels and
we had a great time listening to some of
our favorite scenes through it it makes
dialogue easy to hear with or without
the active voice mode it doesn't go all
that low in the base and you can't add a
subwoofer if you want most competitors
offer this option with all-in-one
systems the Zee Vox SB 380 is a fine
sound bar but companies like bulk vizio
and Yamaha are able to squeeze even more
performance out of your music movies for
much less</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
