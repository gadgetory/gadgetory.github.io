in New York with Panos Panay from
Microsoft's user just got done
introducing the world to this which is
the new surface pro 3 a lot of changes
in here new kickstand new display
keyboard can you give us the highlights
of this new this one yeah yeah so it's a
12 inch corner to corner display but
it's a 3 by 2 aspect ratio those are
words it feels and looks like a piece of
paper that's another way to say it I
mean we had a design point that was hey
listen what's the most familiar thing we
can give to people when they hold
something beautifully in portrait what
have you done your whole life at 12
inches and when you're using the windows
scaling you get a lot of content on this
screen it's actually seven percent more
content on this screen maybe six and a
half percent more content on this screen
then like a thirteen point three and 16
by 10 laptop so it gives you the feel of
if you really want to be productive that
bigger laptop is all packed into this
punch of a screen we also added a
friction based kickstand that's kind of
a dorky term to say this thing
articulates back down to 150 degrees and
you can hold it at any position so just
having a couple of points you can pretty
much put it wherever you put it wherever
you like and I think when people would
give me feedback like Wilpon us a laptop
I can use any angle I want like okay
here and so now you have this kickstand
you can pick any position you got this
screen that's as productive or tablet
friendly as any screen ever made those
two things come together nicely and then
the new type cover has some little
subtle features in there that start to
stabilize it on your lap and on the desk
and once that happens it starts to
transform into this full PC but the
truth is it's the core processor and it
that drives this thing we've got a core
i7 in here yeah yeah the one you're
holding probably is a Core i5 i think we
gave everybody an i5 and the i7 is
launching a little bit later than the I
thought okay but yeah so we have the i3
the i5 and the i7 coming the i3 is an
entry point I think people find the
device probably you know elegant or sexy
whatever however they determinate they
want it we want that desire of course
and but we didn't want to keep the price
point so high that people couldn't enter
into this market you choice I three i5
i7 yeah I'm thinner and lighter to me
about battery life that was one thing we
did so battery life like you get up
taking nine hours of web browsing on
this thing and so you call it all-day
battery life another point I didn't make
and I haven't given out is it literally
has a standby time of a year and I was
supposed to say it like when this
product decides to put itself down like
go to sleep it'll be because it knows
you haven't used it it's smart enough
and once that's the case it'll put
itself in a mode we're okay with a two
and a half second boot time you
literally or three seconds not incurring
the exact time anymore because we keep
optimizing it you literally can keep a
battery on this thing for a year and not
lose it something else that I notice is
at the start button has actually moved
to the short side is shown a
presentation it's making it makes two
points which is really important one
it's the right place for it when you
come here same idea when I when I'm
swiping in from the left but if I come
to the if I come to this side sorry I
wasn't ready for this but when I swipe
in this is where the natural spot for
the Windows key was meant to be the
second thing was it was meant to point
out that in portrait use this is a
powerful device and you know surface is
beautiful in portrait the design here is
really meant to scale windows perfectly
so when you are in something like
OneNote it is a beautiful writing device
it's exactly what you'd expect as
opposed to something too thin or too
wide also from a holding it perspective
same idea that's exactly what's kind of
happening here where it feels
comfortable you'll feel the distribution
of weight pick up your laptop and hold
it by the by the thinnest part and you
can't hold it hold it by the thickest
part and you can't use it like that
change now I mean the iPad it's
definitely a portrait oriented device
with the one down on the bottom like
that the surface though traditionally
was a landscape it yeah that was one of
the problems I think when we set a
tablet to replace the laptop one of the
biggest missing parts and the
traditional surfaces you can't use an in
portrait now let's talk about the market
reception surfaces have been very lossy
from a hardware standpoint yeah not
necessarily from a sales standpoint
we've got a lot of interesting
improvements here a lot of nice tweaks
yeah is that gonna be enough do you
think yeah I mean it depends what you
think the goals are I think the answer
is yeah it's enough I think people will
be excited about the device and run
after it it solves a whole new problem
you know it's one we've been going after
but I think you find surface pro 2 you
get a lot of feedback that's a really
good
see and sometimes it's a tablet it
doesn't hit it but it does great work I
think when you get to this device yeah
you start to cross it you cross that
line of people are excited you there are
two devices in people's bag right now I
don't think you need them so you spend a
lot of time talking about how a lot of
people who have a laptop and a tablet
96% I think you said people who have an
iPad in a laptop to back yeah as well
why do you think that is that people
have been unwilling to really kind of
combine the two and go with a device
like this and because tablets can't be
productive it wasn't big enough and it
was too heavy and there were and it
wasn't thin enough and so you start
putting yourself in this place of like
wow you know these subtle trade-offs
they mean something to people if you
look at the price point that's starting
at $7.99 that's that's quite a nice
price especially if you consider this
against a tablet and a laptop but that
shows that people aren't willing to
really compare the two in terms of
pricing anyway they're willing to pay
more to buy two devices yeah than they
are and you're seeing it yeah and so why
buy two devices it doesn't make sense to
me tell anybody about the operating
system as well because that in the past
has been part of the the negatives
against surface set a lot of people
aren't exactly in love with Windows 8 we
see a lot of good improvements to
Windows 8 yeah but that's helping the
experience as well I think it is I think
it's not just I don't think it is
helping the experience
Windows 8 one and the latest update is
phenomenal I mean Joe and team have done
amazing work Teri's leading a great team
over there I think you're starting to
see Microsoft become one Microsoft and a
lot of things coming together and coming
to life and Windows is a massive part
man you can't get to the battery life
we're getting to you can't get to the
beauty of this screen you can't get to
split screen you can't use all these
features without the power of Windows
and it's been you know it's still
amazing
we shot Adobe up on stage talking about
a special yeah shop is that something
that we might see more yeah you will I
mean final draft I didn't say it but
that's exclusive specifically maybe I
did but you're looking at the guys over
at Autodesk that are really starting to
optimize for service pro three look you
have a device that you can carry with
you at the full power it's it's it's
hard to debate it people get excited and
watching developers get excited about it
and develop for it I think it's natural
it's gonna happen yeah so we got the
hardware we got the software is there
anything missing not to make this to be
a huge
huge success well we'll find out I think
you know I think from a technology
standpoint there's not much missing
right now but I will tell you you know
we won't stop we're gonna keep pushing
the boundaries if people want to give
you more feedback what's the best way I
know that you guys are active on reddit
yeah Twitter's yeah you'll get me on I
think what I read every tweet at Panos
underscore Pinay do you want to send
something to me send it I look at it I
don't respond a lot but I read every
single tweet that comes through for sure
it's important to me and that feedback
comes through pretty quickly and we use
it I'm excited to try this out I'll give
you my feedback I drink it I can't wait
I know you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
