of CES 2016 I'm Roger Chang executive
editor of C that news we have something
cool to show you it's a fully funded
Kickstarter project that is a
cloud-based Android smartphone the next
bit Robin and with me to talk about this
is the company's chief designer and
product officer Scott Coyle Scott thanks
for being there good to see you again
right so for those of the many of you
out there who don't know who next videos
want you talked about what this what
this company is what this phone is and
we'll go from there
sure you know next bit started with this
idea our thinking about the connect
cloud future that's gonna come 10 years
off and there's ubiquitous 5g speeds
right enacted all the time and bringing
some of that thinking into today's world
you know you have the power of the cloud
but today you still get these messages
that say when you're if I got a concert
or you're recording a video or taking a
photo that says oh you know what you
can't take that photo or we can't save
that photo cuz you're out of space on
your phone right so basically we use the
cloud integrated into the operating
system to dynamically move stuff on and
off the phone so what I don't for folks
who don't know what the cloud is
break it down simply what what does that
mean for this phone for the rather yeah
so basically what it means is this is a
32 it has 32 gigabytes of on-board
storage on the phone but we've
integrated 100 gigabytes of cloud
storage into it so when you're basically
connected to the cloud the phone looks
feels and acts like a hundred gigabyte
phone all right well that's great but
you know you're not always connected to
cloud right cell phone coverage from
these spotty at best in a lot of places
especially on the show floor how does
that work if I don't have that coverage
yeah sure well I think first of all when
we're actually freeing up space what we
do is we look at how you've been using
your phone so let's say it's six months
after you've gotten the phone you filled
up the 32 gigabytes of storage we look
at how you've been using your phone and
we're gonna pick the app that you're
least likely to open and it's just a
simple queue we basically can just we
look if you use an app it goes to the
bottom of the queue if you look at a
photo it goes to the bottom of the queue
so we're gonna pick something you
haven't used in six months or nine
months right and then what happens the
app or photos it just sort of sure
shipped off to the cloud then so
actually so from the time you get the
phone we're already synchronizing
the phone so actually from day one when
you're on Wi-Fi and you're plugged in by
default everything your apps and your
photos are all synchronized to the cloud
so actually in that moment you free ups
when you were freeing up space yeah you
can actually be an airplane mode because
everything's already already
synchronized well why don't we check out
the phone sure so I think that nice
color yeah so I think one of the things
about the design of the phone is that
you know we wanted to create something
that was unique something that stood out
you know if I were to put the iPhone out
with every Android phone we pull one out
if we were to put all that stuff here
you go
if we would have put all that stuff out
here on the table nothing really stands
out anymore
it's something we've talked about before
is like where and where's the excitement
in the industry and then I think if you
look at from a software perspective you
know you look at Apple and Google
basically playing tennis they're copying
each other features and they're not bad
features but there's nothing super
exciting so with the design of the phone
we want to create something that
obviously was iconic yeah but also
something that was fresh that was that
was modern they kind of traded on kind
of design equities that's different than
what everybody's else doing and in case
you don't know Scott I mean he's got a
lot he's got a good pedigree in terms of
design and he was the guy behind the
much-beloved HTC one smartphone did the
first all-metal device for for HTC
secures what design cues did you take
from that to bring to robin well you
know it's funny I didn't really take any
design cues in fact if you think about
the m7 which subsequently which had the
all metal unibody which subsequently
Apple did after HTC how you know if I
were to kind of put a critique at what's
in the market nowadays everything feels
like a derivative of either what the m7
or an Apple iPhone and so that means so
great the quality level the execution
level has kind of caught up across the
board but it also means that everything
feels the same right which I kind of
wanted to jettison kind of everything
that I knew about the design of
smartphones to come up with a different
kind of different set of parameters and
kind of create the phone that that I
wanted to have something that stands out
from the crowd you know I was at a party
last night and I was actually looking at
my phone somebody came up to me is like
what is that and that feels great you
know it feels great to kind of first of
all to kind of have something that
you've worked on kind of recognize but
but I think I think the point is that
people are thirsty they're hungry for
something that's new and they kind of
sets them apart from the rest of the
crowd I mean you know this is a long way
from HTC you're doing things a lot
differently going through Kickstarter go
into consumers directly talk about how
that went I mean this is most people buy
their phones from a Verizon 18t store
right they don't necessarily go online
and back a project talk about you know
what what made us do that it's supposed
to go work with an 18-2 yeah you know
we're a venture backed based company so
for us you know we had we had money but
what kick-started allowed us to do is
start a conversation with people and so
it was super powerful cuz that's the
company we want to create we think that
era of you know you create a product you
have a beautiful purse beautiful person
hold the product on TV we all look at
that and say I mean you're gonna hang
out with those people or I'm gonna be
beautiful if I get that sir so we think
that's kind of old-school marketing we
think there's a new way of marketing
where people want to have an authentic
conversation with people right in fact
on Kickstarter one of the things that
was unique was that if you look at like
the top 25 tech products that were on
there we had 10 times the engagement of
the average of those which was super
powerful you know people are super
excited about what they're doing and
having a conversation with us and giving
us feedback on what we did right what we
did wrong and we can take that and
internalize it and actually it affects
our roadmap and we can build and we can
build software features kind of response
to Communion and we can add for you know
other features in as we move forward to
the next products and so how the
Kickstarter close you got about 3,600
backers there how sales big I know
you're in pre-orders now right yep so
sales have been great we know there's no
reviews out yet so we're I think people
are kind of waiting to see we're still
trying to get our hands on actually
exactly so they're coming soon and we've
announced this week that pre ORS are
gonna close down January 15th but I
think that I think the important thing
there is that for anybody that orders a
pre-orders a phone by January 15th we're
gonna ship those in February okay the
other thing that we've announced is that
we're going to ship the early the early
Kickstarter backers is first thousand
people that bought a GSM SKU we're gonna
ship those February 16 so those are
gonna go out the door all the other
Kickstarter backers or at least for the
GSM SKU will go out we'll go out a few
days after that okay and you told me you
got a little news to share with us today
yeah sure so the other thing that's
going to happen on that
six days we're gonna go lie with the
ecommerce store okay and on that as
basically you know like a super in-depth
kind of presentation the product how the
cloud storage works what the specs of
the phones are so you can kind of go
super deep as a consumer that's number
one number two is obviously all the
accessories that we have from screen
protectors to cases and all that stuff
and then also support what a support
looked like for us so the forum's you
know it's funny there's kind of two
different types of customers people that
love to go deep on the forums we saw
that on Kickstarter and then people that
want to contact us through social so
looking at our you know next bit sis
handle on Twitter or Instagram you know
we had there's kind of all these
different avenues where people want to
have conversations with us well why
don't we take a look at the phone itself
the india i guess what's unique about it
as you told me some of those apps when
you're they're not being used often
actually get taken off the phone putting
this cloud why don't we zoom in there
the skype app is actually right now it's
grayed out well yeah that's grayed out
that's right so the Skype app is grayed
out here that's means it's actually been
offloaded can I have it use it in six
months or so well let's say I want to be
Skype
I don't Skype actually you know we're
we're Andrea the phone is any Android so
we use hangouts a lot but I do you Skype
occasionally anyway so if I tap that
what's happening now is we're pulling
down Skype back from the cloud and when
it actually gets pulled down you can see
that the icon is becoming going from
that shadow icon back to being the kind
of normal sky park icon that you'd
expect
and once it's brought back down we
reinstall it we hook back up the
credentials and app data and so when I
actually launched it it's like it's
never been removed you can see here now
this dot is blinking that ones were
actually installing the application now
yep I mean you don't have to sign back
in it's basically as if you've never did
touch like it's never been removed
that's right
you know the alternative for people
nowadays is what I'm gonna go delete
that yeah and not only that is when I've
missed that run when I've taken a photo
and I have to go through my okay which
app do I want to remove I don't I
haven't used that but I might use it and
so basically it eliminates that it
eliminates that issue well look thanks
so much for joining us it's time for a
quick break but when we come back we'll
roll some video the latest products over
our editors have seen on the show floor
then we're gonna hook you up with Brian
Tom for an extended tour stay with us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
