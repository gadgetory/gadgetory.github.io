an Android phone I'm Bridget Carey this
is your scene at updates another week
another devastating hack revealed we all
may feel numb to hacking reports by now
but if you have an Android phone you'll
want to pay attention researchers are
warning about a glitch that impacts 95%
of Android phones it seems a hacker can
take control of an Android phone to
steal data and spy on a user and all it
takes is for a hacker to send you one
text message laced with a poisonous
video attachment you don't even need to
open a text message or play the video to
be infected this vulnerability is being
referred to as stage fright
named after the Android software that
reads media files
the problem is with how Android reads a
video embedded in a text message some
text messaging apps like Google's
hangouts may read the video file before
you open it and thereby infect you
before you even know you've got a text
once that text message goes through a
hacker can copy or delete data from the
phone or even access the microphone and
camera to spy on you at least that's how
it's being described by Android
researcher Joshua Drake of the security
firm as imperium he's releasing details
of his findings next week at the black
hat hacker conference Drake shared some
early details in an interview to NPR but
before going public he did notify Google
about the flaw in a statement Google
thanked Drake for his findings and said
it is sending the fix for all Android
devices to its partners now the question
is how long will it take before Samsung
LG HTC and Motorola and others push out
their update to their Android models if
they don't send out software updates
soon you may want to consider blocking
text messages from unknown numbers in a
conversation I had with Drake on Twitter
he said blocking text from unknown
numbers could be a temporary fix but it
doesn't stop you from getting hit in
other ways such as stumbling on that
malicious video code on a website it's
estimated that more than 950 million
Android phones and tablets are at risk
in other Google news the company is no
longer requiring you to have a Google
Play
account if you want to sign up to
YouTube or another Google service back
in 2013 Google wanted to grow its social
network and to do that it required you
to have a Google+ profile if you wanted
to sign up for YouTube or post comments
that's no longer the case the company
says the social network is still going
to be around but it has a new mission to
connect people based on shared interests
that's it for this tech news update
