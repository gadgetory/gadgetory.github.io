- 100 it was basically a Sebring and
dragged there was nothing about it that
anybody loved turn the page and let's
drive the 2015 all-new Chrysler 200 C
now I wouldn't blame you if you think we
screwed up and brought the wrong car to
the shoot today yes this is a Chrysler
200 it's a whole new platform though a
whole new Fiat corporate platform that
has real nice lines as I look at and I'm
kind of seeing out ea4 and some Kia
Optima which from me is high praise this
is a nice looking vehicle and of course
it doesn't hurt we have a 200 C which is
upgraded everywhere the body the wheels
sports suspension much nicer interior
this is as good as a 200
okay first thing you notice getting in
this car is they've done a really nice
job doing a distinctive sculpted look on
the dash and the whole center stack
right here the angle that your wrist is
called upon is actually an angle it
wants to bend I can't tell you how many
cars want to make you do things that
hurt to operate knobs and buttons ditto
for the buttons here on the wheel look
how large they are about twice the size
as that on most cars on they're actually
about the size of your finger who
thought of that brilliant directly in
front of me is a large LCD nestled in
between two analog gauges tack and
speedo it's got a matching should I say
garish blue design to go with a head
unit now Chrysler's UConnect here is 8.4
inch and it's an interesting way they've
done the navigation they continue to use
Garmin here and they get incredibly high
marks on usability wear to very simple
hit the address look how fast that
response look how big these menu bars
are navigate to 235 second Street San
Francisco California 2 3 5 2nd Street
San Francisco it took it a while to
figure it out but in my use of this car
it gets it right basically every time
under radio you've got am/fm and your
satellite radio media they consider to
be your USB iPod connection auxilary
jack and bluetooth streaming now it gets
a little bit subdivided too far when you
have to go to apps to get things like I
Heart Radio Pandora Slacker or AHA I'm
not a fan of companies that still think
a media app isn't media come on guys
it's all one thing and the meta tag
information from broadcast and/or the
way you can look at your track
information from onboard media is quite
good not perfect there's some truncation
but things are big enough to read
without staring at it for too long now
in terms of absent connectivity it's an
interesting grab-bag
everything from aha and other media apps
like I mentioned to you assistance
technology telematics the Wi-Fi hotspot
function you can turn on in the car
Sirius travel information which comes in
by a satellite radio and here's yelp
walk kind of all by itself because they
didn't know where else to put it oh and
notice what's missing under our media
selection optical disc CD DVD not
available on this head unit that's
starting to be a trend now this row of
buttons gives you a pretty good look
into what is a large suite of
driver-assistance tech on this car you
have blind spot warning of course let me
move on to parking assist this will work
for parallel or perpendicular
here's your lane departure defeat tells
you've got lane departure tech you also
get an indication here in the center LCD
in the instrument panel this car has the
best lane keep technology in the
business period it's calibrated spot-on
seemingly when my tires just touch the
line it kicks in and then it has the
most nuanced yet effective pushback via
the electric steering rack puts me back
in my lane and aiming straight nice work
the rotary shifter is novel but that's
about it
I've never driven a car with one that I
like it does nothing better than an
ordinary shifter except free up a little
console space but I find all of these to
be imprecise and fussy this one to your
forward collision technology it can also
bring you to a full stop and do stop and
go again depending on your traffic speed
of course we have adaptive cruise
control indicated here with your
distance selector for the distance to
maintain to the cars in front of you now
on a 200 C the rear camera is standard
it's got trajectory and then your
distance is indicated by color bars and
of course accompanies your automatic
parking assistance technology there's
not much missing here in terms of driver
assistance considering its affordable
price tag this is pretty aggressive at
least on the optional basis now you
don't build a trim little car like this
with ample front seat room and a rakish
sloping roof without somebody paying the
piper and that somebody is gonna be your
lower back if you sit in the rear notice
you pull that door open and it's just
all obstructed it's more of an aperture
than a door opening because first your
thigh hits this wheel arch pretty badly
and then your head hits the roof and
then you try and get through there this
is kind of like getting in a submarine
I guess I'll push to get in it's not
easy once you get in it's not bad but
wow this opening it's like an SAT test
for your spine
I'm actually kind of disappointed that
we have the big engine I'm more
interested in the high-tech little
motors these days we don't have that the
base engine will be a 2.4 liter inline-4
what they call a multi air engine this
is the v6 it is the more desirable it's
a 3.6 liter
it's got direct injection but no turbos
or superchargers relatively common by
today's standards output is 295
horsepower 262 pound-feet of torque
always through a 9 speed automatic
that's your only choice
however front wheel drive or all-wheel
drive available now that all-wheel drive
system is geared for efficiency it has a
freewheeling technology so when you're
not actually sending power to the rear
wheels it's going to D couple the drive
shaft as well as that whole rear end
19:32 is your front wheel drive mpg
18:29 for the all-wheel drive not
stellar but not bad now you know me I
like cars that are of a whole it looked
like they drive and drive like they look
that's not really going on here it's not
a bad car to drive by any stretch this
v6 of course has plenty of power and it
comes on in a nice unassisted way the
transmission it's a nine-speed ear
engagements tend to be a little soft
it's not bad same for the suspension
it's not bad and as good ride quality
it's not much fun to plow through twisty
roads at the one I'm on today it's sort
of you get a bit of ocean liner wallow
and front-end
Wow but the power comes on very nicely
once you get into it it's a car that
likes to be revved and keeping these
revs up with the shifter it's not gonna
help your mpg in sport mode is
interesting when you kick it over there
you get higher held rpm I don't detect
faster ship but I do notice this it
doesn't turn traction control down your
traction control off that's unusual in
most cars I'm not sure of legal signed
off on that now visibility is an
interesting story out to the front you
lose a semi in this a pillar it's
absolutely massive that is not much fun
in the back though the rear quarter
visibility is not bad it carved out some
very useful little quarter windows back
there and manage the thickness of those
seat pillars in all a pleasant driver
but not as sporty as the outside
promises all right you want to pick up a
200 see here's how the pricing breaks
out seen that style first of all little
under 27,000 base for the seat rim
you're already well into the good stuff
but here's how we load it up for $4,200
you can get all-wheel drive that sounds
steep doesn't it but that includes the
upgrade to the v6 powertrain if you want
the v6 only in front-wheel drive just at
1950 the navigation and improved sound
package is 1395 1300 more for safety
tech which is the whole basket of driver
assist technology can last about it's
$800 but it's required if you get safety
tech all in about thirty two five four
what is absolutely one of the best
looking cars in its class if not the
best it's not the most inspiring driver
at least not in this configuration but
it's no slouch and most importantly you
can pick one of these up bring it home
and nobody will think you bought a
resold rental car</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
