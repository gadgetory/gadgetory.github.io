for the oculus rift it's called the
climb it's from Crytek makers of crisis
I'm going to scale this rock face with
that an Xbox controller and my own body
just grabbing all of the grips on this
wall I have to look every time I want to
get to a new handhold come on got
carabiner here looks like I'm safe for
now
whoa kind of bounced off the cliff face
so I'm gonna lean put my hands on this
rock face what I need to do to get hires
I just need to tilt my head further up
actually like reaching it with my body
to the next ah to the next handheld okay
grab grab oh gosh this is actually a
little bit of effort and I'm really
really close to this rock face like I
can definitely see the cracks in it so
this is like uncharted in in virtual
reality I don't feel like I'm in a
danger or anything you can definitely
tell there's a drop got a first-person
Nathan Drake thing going on here there's
something written on the rock says climb
somebody wrote it wrong see lym being
crossed it out
climb you want me to climb all right I
can climb reach shock I'm gonna make
those hands nice and chalky so I don't
lose my grip this is actually a little
bit nerve-wracking I I need to figure
out if I want to make it if I can make
it to this other rod place let's give it
a try Oh fairway this way there's the
summit it looks like I need to go around
I can go either way down here okay let's
say let's go left gonna jump for it
my heart's racing Check Point C gettin
close to it
area and that's the climb pretty
impressive as you'd expect from the
makers of crisis that's one good-looking
game looking forward to trying to full
version next year</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
