or you're in the market for a fridge for
a back room then you might consider this
model it's the LG LT NC 1 1 1 2 1 V it's
a $700 top freezer from LG
that's only 24 inches wide now this is
the smallest and least expensive fridge
that LG makes inside you'll find 11.1
total cubic feet of storage space 8 and
a half of which are allocated to the
fridge and that's obviously not a lot
and not enough if you're going to use
this thing to try and hold groceries for
the whole family
ideally you want about 4 to 6 cubic feet
per person still as a compact option I
think there's a lot to like here LG has
a very very good track record in our
cooling tests and while this low-end
model did have some hot spots in the
door and in the crisper bin you can see
that does a really nice job of holding
temperatures down below 40 degrees in
the body of the fridge take a look at
that top shelf at the default setting
it's right at 37 degrees which is
exactly where you want it and then at
the coldest setting it's really accurate
to just above 30 for entire fridge is
kind of engineered around that top shelf
keeping it at the right temperature and
letting it kind of work out from there
as for features you really can't expect
too much from a $700 top freezer but
there are still some nice touches here I
really like this shelf that slides out
for easier access you don't see features
like that and top shelves very often
there's also an interesting icemaker in
the freezer you actually pull it out and
fill those ice cube trays and then twist
them when the water is frozen to dump
the ice into the bin all in all this is
a perfectly decent little fridge and a
recommendable one if you aren't in need
of a lot of storage space</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
