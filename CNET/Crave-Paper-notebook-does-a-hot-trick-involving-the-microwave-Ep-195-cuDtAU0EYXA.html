here just happening this week on CNET
scrambler
researchers at MIT Media Lab are
developing a reading device for the
blind the finger reader is a small
device that is mounted on the users
finger and contains a small camera and
sensors to read text off a page
converting the words to audio for the
reader money raised our current theme
load era as the reader moves his or her
finger across a page of printed text the
text-to-speech feature will simply read
the text in real time the device is able
to detect the beginning and end of a
line in a sentence of printed text and
uses algorithms to predict the next word
in the sentence to help maintain a fluid
stream of speech from the text-to-speech
software the device must be tethered to
a laptop which parses all the
speech-to-text calculations although
they are developing a mobile Android
version for smartphones the finger
reader has the potential to help
thousands who need assistance reading
including children with dyslexia and
other learning disabilities as well as
parents who just want to teach their
kids how to read NASA's scientific
visualization studio recently released a
video animation of 19 satellites
currently orbiting earth used by the
agency to monitor weather and
atmospheric conditions here on our home
planet the animation includes the
International Space Station as well as
the a-train satellites aqua aura cloud
sat and Calypso which all follow the
same exact orbit crossing the equator
every day at 1:30 p.m. the a and a-train
stands for afternoon so that means that
the animation looks a little busy with
so many satellites circling the planet
but there are in fact about 1235
satellites from many different countries
orbiting our planet every day the team
at the European Organization for Nuclear
Research known as CERN has produced a
drone guided tour of Alice aka a large
ion collider experiment in France as
they gear up to resume experiments at
the controversial facility
in the video they show off the Alice
control room as well as their worldwide
grid called alien used for data analysis
by over 1500 collaborators then we fly
down beneath the surface to see Alice
which they say is like a telescope aimed
at the first instance of the Big Bang
check out the full video in the Krave
blog to take a drone tour of the large
ion collider the rocket book looks like
a regular spiral notebook with paper but
it's actually a cloud-based computing
device that is able to backup your
written text and magically erases the
text written on its pages when you put
it in the microwave now you must use a
special pen called the pilot friction
pen in the rocket book to use the
microwave 30-second erase feature but
you can use a regular pen to write in
the rocket book as well at the bottom of
the page there are icons that coincide
the different apps like Dropbox for
instance once you have finished some
notes or drawing you want to backup you
simply scribble over the icon at the
bottom of the page you then launch the
rocket book app on your smartphone and
then hold the camera over the pages the
app will automatically create images of
your work and upload them to the correct
destination as you simply turn the pages
the rocket book has already passed its
funding goal on IndieGoGo and will be
available in June for about $25 all
right guys that's your show thank you
very much for watching as always you can
find all these new stories to see that's
craving I crave cnet.com make sure you
follow crave on Twitter at crave and
check out this week's crave giveaway
this week's crave giveaway is the Sphero
2.0 app controlled robotic balls like
the idea of a glowing robotic toy ball
that controls apps and games then go to
the blog and enter to win
