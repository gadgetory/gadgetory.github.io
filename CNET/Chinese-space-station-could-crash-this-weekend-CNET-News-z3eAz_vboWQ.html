Earth's atmosphere on April 1st and no
this isn't a joke
China's tiangong one space station
launched in 2011 and the plan was to
complete a controlled reentry over an
unpopulated section of the South Pacific
when it's time was up in 2016 though
reports surfaced the spacecraft was
malfunctioning and new projections from
the European Space Agency predict an
uncontrolled re-entry between March 31st
UTC and the early hours of April 2nd
here's the wild part the ESA also says
it can't really predict when or where
tiangong 1 will burn up or if parts of
the space station will make its way
through our atmosphere and fall on to
the ground its orbit covers a huge part
of populated earth though scientists
think the edges of tiangong once orbit
would be more likely for re-entry since
it spends more time in those zones we'll
know about a day in advance when the
craft is headed back to earth but Jay
Milosh a professor of Earth's
atmospheric and Planetary Sciences at
Purdue University said quote in terms of
where it will land a few hours of
uncertainty spans a lot of territory
that could be the difference between
landing and chile and the middle of the
Pacific unquote that's not scary at all
it's really scary so where do you think
tiangong 1 will reenter the atmosphere
drop your dresses down in the comments
until we know more exact information
we'll be keeping our eye on the skies
