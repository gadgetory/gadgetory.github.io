Windows 7 it should be a fairly easy
install you can do what's called an
in-place upgrade as long as you install
the same version of Windows 7 as you
have a Vista for instance if you have
Windows Vista Home Premium you can
upgrade to Windows 7 home premium you
can also go from Vista Business to
Windows 7 Professional and from Vista
ultimate to Windows 7 Ultimate any other
upgrade like let's say you wanted to do
something wacky like go Vista Home
Premium to Windows 7 Professional you're
going to require a clean install does
that mean well you can't just turn Vista
into seven you have to export all your
data erase the hard drive and then
reinstall all your applications and data
now a lot of computer experts actually
think you should do a clean install
anyway just to make sure your machine
runs better see our video for upgrading
XP to Windows 7 for that clean install
process but if you're lucky enough to be
able to do an in-place upgrade and you
want to here's what you do first backup
your data just to be safe
I recommend Mac reom reflect is a great
way to image your Drive next put in the
install DVD and run setup dot exe press
Continue if you're unsure whether
windows 7 will run press check
compatibility online though really you
should check that before you buy windows
7 it'll take you to a web page where you
can download and run the windows 7
compatibility advisor but if you're sure
you're compatible go ahead and click
install now windows 7 will begin copying
temporary files and start the install
it'll first ask you if you want to go
online to get the latest updates I
recommend you do it it could save you
some time later then agree to the terms
which you have fully read and understand
select upgrade windows will check
compatibility and then begin copying
files after a while probably hours not
minutes your machine will start back up
into windows 7 now once you're all set
you may find that some of your settings
didn't transfer and got overwritten by
Windows 7 defaults the most notorious of
these problems is your taskbar program
so be ready to do some tweaking to get
things just
actually the way you like them also
since you didn't start fresh some of the
quirks in Vista may carry over to seven
most of them won't over although it's a
much simpler and faster process than the
clean install enjoy your new OS I'm Tom
