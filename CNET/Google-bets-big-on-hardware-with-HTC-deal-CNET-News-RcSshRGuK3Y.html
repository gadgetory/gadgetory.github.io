hardware and it's paying 1.1 billion
dollars to get there the company
announced a partnership with HTC on
Wednesday to get access to talent from
the HTC team many of whom are already
working on Google's pixel phones Google
will also license HTC's intellectual
property under the deal but Google
stopped short of an anticipated buyout
of the Taiwanese smartphone company
perhaps indicating that it's not quite
ready to make the kind of big
investments it's made in Hardware in the
past five years ago the company bought
Motorola Mobility for twelve point five
billion dollars only to sell it at a
loss less than two years later but
Google is no doubt hoping the
partnership with HTC will be different
after all
HTC was the manufacturer behind Google's
flagship pixel smartphones in a market
dominated by Apple and Samsung these
handsets helped Google win new fans in
the premium smartphone space in a
statement today Google's senior vice
president of hardware Rick ostilow said
the company was building on 10 years of
history with HTC and investing in one
team for the long run
so what's next for Google well we won't
have to wait very long to find out
they're unveiling their next generation
of products on October 4th</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
