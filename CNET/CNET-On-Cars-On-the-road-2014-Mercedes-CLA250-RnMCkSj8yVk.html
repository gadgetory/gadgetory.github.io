days is small take a look at BMW to
refresh to is from Lexus this CLA from
Mercedes and the nice thing about
working the other end of the market that
you're also working a younger part of
the market and they will be your s-class
buyers of tomorrow and this car is part
of what helped push Mercedes back to the
top because we closed out 2013 and
they'd like to stay there the overall
lines are not so much derived from the
c-class it's one notch up brother
but interestingly borrowed from the way
upscale CLS you see this kind of droopy
over arch across the top that's real CLS
kind of stuff on the other hand they're
very proud of this face they say this
came right off the concept car on the
Auto Show circuit and I gotta say it
does look pretty hot and it was what we
saw in concept form and then out back
you've got these sort of aggressive faux
vents on the corners of the rear bumper
it all speaks to a younger ethic than
most Benz cars now the front row cabin
on this car is one of its strong points
you get a good quality Mercedes feel in
here and I think it's about the most
modern looking cabin they've got which
is good cuz this car aims toward a
younger audience that doesn't want a lot
of baroque at least I don't think and
most importantly it's got the family
steering wheel this is a big part of the
identity of a car ditto for the head
unit and this sort of pop-tart toaster
look and display which is all in vogue
right now as you see you've got the knob
which is push kick and click and then
you've got back and clear buttons on it
simple streamlined and of course the
German car so don't touch the screen
doesn't do anything this is Mercedes
current command system the navigation is
hard drive based 80 gigabytes of hard
drive data on there but they've also got
10 gigabytes set aside for media for you
to put your collection on which you're
never gonna do on this car we have
Sirius satellite radio which also brings
in traffic and whether that's optional
by the way as you can see the audio
display is good and rich good use of
meta tags they do get truncated though
and you do have album art in there let's
take a look at some of the sources I am
an FM with HD radio satellite radio as I
mentioned is optional disc or six disc
CD DVD that's an optional
SD card no thank you there's that 10
gigabyte storage USB and in here I've
got a media interface for an iPod which
I had to use an adapter for because I've
got a newer iPod Touch bluetooth calling
and bluetooth streaming by the way our
standard on this car which is a nice
touch some cars still make you pay extra
for the streaming part and then way over
here under the globe you get the
interesting connectivity things Mercedes
apps streaming radio apps there's your
serious weather and you can also enter
the website URL you want to look at
although not when you're driving and boy
is this whole system dogs slow this
needs to be sped up with I don't know
what firmware changes connectivity
optimisation this is tedious I'm also
not a fan how internet radio lives over
here separate from audio it's all audio
guys put it all together that navigation
system right there is optional
interestingly so is rear view camera I
find that kind of chintzy in a car that
coughs 30-grand there are plenty that
cost less they give it to you for free
by the way if you've got an iPhone
consider the $600 iPhone drive kit its
dealer installed and does a different
interface than you've seen here for
social media streaming radio and Siri
voice command now it's like with the
drive control technology in this vehicle
it doesn't have an adaptive suspension
so there's no elaborate control for that
here's your shifter its stalk base which
is kind of funny dedi for a car that
aims so young you know a lot of folks
gonna wish they had a lever down here
but look how much console space you'd
give up so this is smart if not hip and
of course you got paddles that go with
it on the wheel down here is the Eco
mode this defaults on if you select it
off it defeats the auto start/stop
technology which I'm okay with because
even on this car as you're going to see
it's a little crunchy and then down here
is your last drive mode control sport
manual efficiency the efficiency is the
nearest thing to a normal mode the sport
is obviously sport and the manual lets
you hold your shifts without the car
jumping back to its own logic now while
some things like rear view camera are
annoyingly optional some other things
are not that are kind of nice the
attention assist that figures out if
you're drowsy and alerts you that
standard on this car as is forward
collision warning and pre braking
technology it does not have automatic
full braking to stop a collision
at optional or standard levels last
thing I want to show you in the cabin is
the optional but I think rather
impressive panoramic roof it's a pretty
small roof so the glass panels money nor
this by today's standards but it's way
bigger than a classic moon roof or Sun
roof and it opens up a small cabin
nicely which is good because if you're
in the back seat hating the person in
the front who made you sit there at
least that will help air things out now
this is a CLA 250 which tells you almost
nothing about its engine it's not a two
and a half liter it's a two liter inline
turbo four with direct injection in
other words it plays all the hits of
modern motor design but it gets real
weird for Mercedes in a couple of ways
first of all it's sitting sidesaddle it
drives the front wheels their first
front wheel drive car sold in the
American market also going to be
available though as an all-wheel drive
variant but this is how it starts here
are the numbers you've got two hundred
eight horsepower 258 foot-pounds of
torque because it's a twin scroll turbo
it's real torquing 3,200 pounds or so
gets up to 60 in about 6.9 seconds
certainly respectable the mpg number is
nice 26:38 you're getting into small
Japanese car territory with that one and
the transmissions interesting one choice
only 7-speed dual-clutch automated
manual one they develop in conjunction
with this car as opposed to going out
and buying it
we'll find out if it was worth their
effort now I've told you before when I
get into our review card I don't look at
the specs or even the room so I don't
really know what the powertrain is when
I got in this one I thought it was a
diesel with an automatic here's why I
thought it was a diesel because there's
kind of a coarse engine note and there's
that sort of turbo lag that turbo
Diesel's of course are known for but
then tons of torque after that
I thought it was an automatic because
the gearbox was so civilized and smooth
it couldn't be anything else they did
that tack and said oh god it's a gas
engine look how high the RPM is for the
redline so the fact that it felt like a
diesel is not a compliment necessarily
to a gas engine but the fact that this
dual clutch transmission felt like a
regular automatic is a high praise
this mode switch down here when you're
in economy the car's just too lazy it's
buried under 7th gear all the time and
the throttle response is like numb you
go to sports now it's frantic it's like
a coke addict it's just like hang on
hang on
finally the ride quality just isn't for
Sadie's which may or may not be a good
thing depending on your tastes you'll
either hate how harsh it is or like the
fact that it doesn't feel isolated from
the road I think it's a little too much
the former beyond that though all the
other driving inputs are very pleasant I
think steering is well rated and
variably ratioed and when you do get on
and shift it yourself power is great on
the car you keep it in that sweet spot
it's real nice
okay let's price our CLA now you know
the headline on this car under 30 grand
well not by the time you had destination
now you're pushing 31 but that's fair
enough but here's where things really
leave the land of 30 the options you
need to go see that style start with
that panoramic roof for 1500 the Premium
Package for 2300 gets you automatic temp
control heated seats that Harman Kardon
audio iPod interface and things like
that
multimedia package 2300 more which
includes rear camera and some other
niceties that iPhone drive kit 600 bucks
at the dealer driver assist brings you
adaptive cruise and the passive blind
spot and Lane technology another 2500 if
you want semi-automatic parking nearly a
grand for that and then if you want to
activate all those apps we saw on the
dash and have the embrace app on your
phone so you can locate the car unlock
the doors things like that that's about
450 a year in monthly fees you can even
go as far as spending 40 bucks to get
AMG door lock caps what all-n seen that
style disguise north of 41 thousand
dollars but still a very inexpensive
Mercedes I would wait a model year or a
heavy refreshed I think the ride quality
needs one more pass on it maybe some of
those drive profiles something in
between II and sport please but there's
no mistaking this is a Mercedes and
that's a big part to them
