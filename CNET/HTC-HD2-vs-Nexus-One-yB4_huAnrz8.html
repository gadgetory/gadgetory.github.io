and we're here with a new smartphone
challenger looking to take down our
recently crowned king of the prize fight
ring it's a heavyweight prize fight
between the unlocked version of HTC hd2
and Google's Nexus One we're bringing in
the big guns for this fight senior
editor at 10th german senior editor
bonnie chop and myself will do the
honors now we'll take all three judges
scores and average them out to the
nearest tenth each round the final prize
fight score will be an average of all
rounds using the same decimal system
who's bringing the sexy round one is
design the nexus one is a sexy machine
it's a slim profile with a solid feel
that fits nicely in your hand and that
3.7 inch o le d-- display makes me drool
now HTC hd2 is a marvel to look at with
its high-res 4.3 inch display it's real
sturdy and just as slim as the Nexus 1
which is pretty impressive the trade-off
is a wide footprint that is a pain to
hold and probably more comfortable if
you have gorilla sized hands plus is
protruding camera lens is sharp around
the edges the Nexus 1 gets a 5 and the
HD 2 gets a 4 next round is navigation
both phones feature a combination of
touchscreen and buttons the Nexus one's
touchscreen is responsive multi-touch is
here across several apps and it works
well this is still the most customizable
phone OS on the market but we're not the
biggest fans of the trackball that
you'll never use and the haptic feedback
touch controls aren't always that
responsive the HD 2 has changed how we
feel about HTC Sense UI that covers up
the windows mobile OS it's snappy
navigation is straightforward you can
customize your favorite apps and there's
a lot of eye candy like the weather
bonnie likes her weather Q now
multi-touch is here but its performance
is more sluggish compared to the Nexus 1
the HD 2 swings back and takes this
route with the 4 and the Nexus 1 gets a
three
after averaging two rounds the nexus one
leads by just two tenths of a point
round three is features both phones
feature Wi-Fi GPS and Bluetooth but
since it's the unlocked version we're
reviewing the HD to only supports edge
networks in the US there's no free
turn-by-turn directions app on the hd2
and the mobile office suite is included
but it doesn't work in landscape mode at
the moment the Nexus One is still the
king when it comes to features its voice
search and voice commands are still
unmatched had time its turn-by-turn Maps
can stand up to GPS solutions there's
also the Android store for thousands of
apps and we love its multitasking
drop-down even if it has some Outlook
syncing issues the Nexus One scores a
perfect 5 and the HD 2 gets a 3.7 round
4 is web browsing and multimedia the
Nexus one's web browser is solid with
multi-touch bookmark icons and multiple
windows support but we're still waiting
for flashlight it's bringing a 5
megapixel camera with flash but one of
androids the biggest works is it to
media player
sure it gets the job done for music and
video playback but its interface is
starting to look prehistoric the HD 2
comes with IE mobile and opera as its
browsers so you'll have some options but
you'll only find multi-touch support in
Opera even it's not as smooth to use the
big standout is the HD 2's media player
which takes on a Cover Flow s
presentation that's fun to use it's 5
megapixel camera with flash also
features a panorama stitch mode but the
screen takes center stage here and media
looks great the HD 2 guests of 4.7 and
the Nexus 1 gets a four so after
averaging out four rounds the Nexus One
still leaves by two tenths of a point
this one's not over yet
the final round that decides it all is
called quality and performance we were
all impressed with the Nexus ones call
quality its dual mic noise cancellation
tech really helps with excellent voice
clarity and a natural sound on both
sides of the line the AC 2's call
quality was tested on t-mobile and AMC's
Network by our judges call quality was
good with just a tad bit more background
noise his speaker phone was the real
disappointment and it was hard to
understand both sides of the call
now both of these phones feature one
gigahertz Snapdragon processors and they
are snappy especially when you think of
the hd2 which is the snappiest windows
mobile experience we've ever used in the
final round the Nexus One throws a
haymaker with the 4.7 and the HD 2 gets
a three point seven so let's average out
all five rounds and in a battle where
Google's Nexus 1 had only a one round
edge over HTC hd2 it took a small lead
early and never let go take you this
battle four point four to four and is
your prize fight winner the HTC hd2
stands out as one of the best
experiences on a windows mobile phone
but it was the Nexus ones features and
call quality that helped it retain its
status as King of the Ring
I'm Brian Tong thanks for watching I
will catch you guys next time on another
prize fight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
