least it was for a few moments the stock
briefly hit the magic number of 207
dollars and five cents on Thursday and
the shareholders were all about the
dollar dollar bills y'all
Apple shares the limelight with the only
other public company that's hit the
trillion dollar mark before PetroChina
which does oil and gas but that was way
back in 2007 and it was only sitting
pretty on the Shanghai Stock Exchange
for a short while it since lost around
800 billion dollars in market value the
other company that's potentially worth
even more than Apple is Saudi Aramco the
oil and energy company report suggests
it could be worth up to two trillion
dollars but unlike Apple because it's a
private company there's no way to know
for sure now let's put this trillion
dollars into perspective only 15
countries in the world are worth more if
you look at GDP or gross domestic
product all things considered this is a
serious turnaround for a company that
almost went bankrupt in the late 1990s
there was an investment from archrival
Microsoft followed by a string of hit
products like the iMac the iPod and the
iTunes Store in more recent years the
iPhone became a best seller Apple
projects the last quarter of 2018 will
also end on a high note the company
expects revenue between 60 and 62
billion dollars but other tech companies
are nipping at Apple's heels
Amazon's hovering around the 877 billion
dollar mark while alphabet aka Google's
parent company is around eight hundred
and fifty four billion dollars that's a
whole lot of zeroes for more on the
