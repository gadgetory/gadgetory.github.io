the future of a show where we take a
look at the biggest companies and what's
in store for them in a year ahead right
now i'm joined by casey newton senior
writer who covers google big company
obviously Casey what are your thoughts
in 2013 what do you think that company
and you as the beat writer are really
going to be focused on well I think
we're going to see a ton coming out of
Google in the next year and the first
thing that I would probably mention it
would be there futuristic Google X
Division oh that sounds so cool it is
they're working on two things that
you've probably already heard about one
of which is google glass those are the
wearable computers that kind of give you
a heads-up display of the world around
you and in the first part of 2013
developers who pre-ordered them earlier
this year are going to get their hands
on them so they're going to be able to
write their own software for them try
all kinds of things do you expect that
they'll hit the public market then later
know it chances are we won't see them be
available to consumers in 2013 but but
we are going to get a lot closer oh that
video is so compelling whenever you
watch the Google glass stuff absolutely
and remember this is also the same
division that's working on self-driving
cars google has gotten a lot of
legislation passed this year that lets
them drive those cars on roads in
various states state of Nevada being one
being the most recent and so I think
we're going to see a lot more out of
that very cool google also is very busy
in the hardware division I'm sure you're
going to see some developments in that
section absolutely so you know we're in
the holiday season now Google just
refreshed its lineup of Nexus products
these are the Google branded tablets and
smartphones that it makes with other
manufacturers so there are some real
questions out there about how much
traction are these devices going to get
we're seeing the first 10 inch Nexus
tablet is that going to sell be
competitive with the iPad time will tell
but expect to see Google release new
versions of those next year and continue
to try to compete with its many many
competitors and that's based we can't
talk about Hardware without obviously
talking about google phones and i think
i read somewhere that more people are
now using android than even iOS these
days that's right android market share
has really been on the march this year
it is the fastest growing
operating system in the world and that
poses some interesting questions for
2013 historically developers have been
building for iOS first so you see a lot
of the best apps coming to apple devices
first but as more and more people buy
android devices the question as well our
developer is going to say you know we're
going to start building for Android
first and that's definitely something
we're going to be watching in 2013 now
it's hard to talk about Google without
talking about what even Google started
as and that's search I imagine hopefully
we're going to see some search
developments in the next year that's
right we will did to really interesting
things this year with search one is that
they created this thing called the
knowledge graph which is their effort to
map out connections between all sorts of
different things so if you search for an
actress that you'll start to see a
little box on the side of the search
window that tells you about other actors
that person may have worked with or
here's some of the films that they were
in Google wants to bring this to a lot
more different parts of the search
experience so you're going to start to
see more and more of those connections
surface when you start typing in your
queries so I think that's going to be
really big next year the other thing is
they introduced this thing Google now
which is a kind of predictive search so
that when you take out your phone it'll
say you need to leave to get to your
next appointment because there's traffic
right now you might want to take this
road because it's closed that's only
available on devices that run the latest
version of Android right now next year
you're going to start to see a lot more
people starting to use that Google's
going to invest a lot of resources in
developing this kind of new world of
search where you don't even have to type
in a query so 2013 sounds busy enough as
it is but is there one final thing that
you've got your eye on for next year
there's an open question of an antitrust
case is the US Federal Trade Commission
going to come in and say Google you have
violated competition laws there are some
within and in Washington who believe
that Google is favoring its own search
results over those of its competitors so
will the FTC come in and say Google you
need to change the way you're presenting
search results that could have a few
different effects on the company one
might be that Google agrees to make some
minor changes one might be that they
fight it and it would be a huge lawsuit
some have compared it to having the
potential impact that the antitrust case
against Microsoft had
a couple decades ago and what would the
impact be to the consumer or the user
right so it could change that well what
your search results look like maybe when
you started searching for things that
you wouldn't see Google products like
you know Google Maps or its own
restaurant ratings float to the top
maybe it starts seeing Yelp or other
products rise a little bit higher in
search yeah interesting well Casey thank
you so much it certainly is going to be
a busy year ahead best of luck to you
and thank you everyone for watching the
future of I'm cars Tsuboi cnet.com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
