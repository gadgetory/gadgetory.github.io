least I've got a Kindle my laptop my
cell phone my ipod touch and my cell
phone whether flying for business or
pleasure most passengers packed multiple
electronic devices in their carry-on
luggage all of which they have to power
off prior to takeoff and landing but
that's about to change an advisory panel
to the Federal Aviation Administration
is recommending that passengers be
allowed to use their e-readers and
listen to podcasts watch videos and play
games during takeoff and landing the new
policy could take effect as soon as 2014
in a statement the FAA acknowledged the
need for change saying quote the FAA
recognises consumers are intensely
interested in the use of personal
electronics aboard aircraft that is why
we tasked a government industry group to
examine the safety issues and the
feasibility of changing the current
restrictions aviation experts say that
in the era of in-flight Wi-Fi service
the FAA had to concede that there's no
hard data supporting the theory that
electronic devices interfere with flight
instruments the most logical reason for
lifting the ban is everyone else is
using them they're on private planes
they're everywhere they're at the
airport as soon as that plane touches
down you can turn them on again so
obviously it doesn't interfere with
communications at or near the airport it
just was no evidence today's aircrafts
are also well protected they're all
shielded not only not shielded against
errant radio telecommunication signals
and by the way they operate on dedicated
frequencies and dedicated lines those
aircraft are shielded against lightning
strikes you still won't be able to place
calls throughout the flight and the ban
on texting emailing and using Wi-Fi
during departure and arrival will remain
intact as well but you can turn to your
playlist and ebooks for entertainment in
