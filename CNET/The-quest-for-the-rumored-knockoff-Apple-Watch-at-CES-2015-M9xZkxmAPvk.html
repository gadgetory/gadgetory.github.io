doggone it people like me I'm good
enough I'm smart enough and doggone it
people like me what's up guys Brian song
here at CES 2015 now Apple biters you
know we'd taken care of you right well
we are here in the North Hall we see all
kinds of cases in the Apple section
cases galore we'll check this out this
is the lifeproof fre power try saying
that 10 times fast lifeproof fre powered
flight fruit you can't do it neither can
I now here are the specs on this case
you can drop it from two meters you can
also submerge it two meters underwater
for an hour it's dust proof it also has
a 2600 milliamp hour battery you get
basically two times the battery power in
here but we've never seen really a case
that combines both additional battery
juice and protection just like this
little retail for 129 sometime around
the second quarter of 2015 but one of
the hot things you'll find here at CES
2015 alright guys we're hearing the
iDevices booth now and what we wanted to
show you is one of the first home kit
compatible smart plugs this is iDevices
switch and what it does is it can talk
to whether it's a lamp a fan you plug it
in here and then it has an app that
allows you to control it whether you
want to turn it on or off it has remote
access so if you're away at work you can
plant out as well that's Wi-Fi and
Bluetooth compatible another cool
interesting thing here we have this led
here it's kind of like a nightlight that
you can put on there so you can change
the colors and control as well but what
also makes it special with home kid
right is the ability to use Siri to say
turn off your light turn off your fan
and it automatically does that as well
now this will be coming out in the
second quarter of this year retailing
for 4999 but there you go one of the
other really cool things here at CES
2015 the switch from I devices
there have been tales of a mythical
device the Apple watch here at CES some
call it fantasy I call it legend I have
traveled thousands of miles to find it
crossed great distances in Las Vegas
just for a chance to find the one and
only thing I hold dear to me
oh that that do you do have that
no-no-no look-look this this this is
what I want I've come here for this do
you have this
Oh
ah
