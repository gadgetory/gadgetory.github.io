asset of Japan just yes we did what any
self-respecting Mario fan would do we
flew a Tokyo and got one just so that we
could bring you our impression is and
this is it on the outside it doesn't
look all that different except for these
plates Nintendo's released about 40 of
these replacement plates which will
allow you to do some customization to
make your 3ds look a little bit fancy
the top one just pops off real easy the
bottom one though unfortunately is held
on by a couple of screws so you'll need
some hardware to replace this but you
can now personalize your 3ds make it
look however you like it's important
note though that they're not gonna
provide much protection the sides and
edges are still exposed on the new 3ds
even with these replacement plates
installed so you're still gonna want a
case but you can add something like this
nice wood tone effect that Nintendo has
released lots of broadly colored options
for you if you want or you can just go
with a standard white or black colors
which are certainly on offer
oh yeah sad we've got new shoulder
buttons I told the fore shoulder buttons
now rather than just the two that we're
on there before if you open it up on the
inside there's a new stick in here this
is the C stick kind of a throwback to
the Nintendo 64 camera buttons of your
it's not a sliding in lock stick like on
the left it's just kind of a firm thing
like a track point on a laptop it
doesn't really give you very good
feedback and in fact we don't think it's
going to be very good for something like
a 3d shooter on the system but if you're
just changing the camera angle like you
can on Monster Hunter it works just fine
for there buttons are now brightly
colored and they moved the start and
select buttons to the right away from
the position beneath the display that
they were right before we still got the
home button down here now the display is
this is probably the biggest and most
important change or the new 3ds which is
the 3d display up front you've used a 3d
s in the past you know that it's got a
pretty compelling 3d effect but if you
move your head at all it effect is
immediately lost Nintendo's built some
face tracking software into the new 3ds
so as you move the system around it
actually tracks you and optimizes the 3d
effect of the display to keep up with
you and it's a significant improvement
over before in fact I wish that this is
what Nintendo had in the 3ds in the
first place as soon as you try this
you're gonna have a hard time going back
to the older 3ds
there's also a faster CPU inside and a
slightly better battery life maybe about
10% more we don't really see a big
improvement there but there will be
games in the future that will require
this new 3d
but I don't think there'll be that many
certainly I think most systems will use
both the older 3ds and this one we'll
see what comes to pass now is this worth
importing for you in Japan this is
selling for 16 thousand yen which
equates to about one hundred and sixty
dollars here in the US so a fair price
but it's worth noting that like the
older Nintendo 3ds this one is
region-locked
which means only Japanese games will
play on this system so if you don't
speak Japanese and if you don't feel
like importing Japanese games to go with
your system you should probably wait for
the international release this will be
hitting Australia in November and the
rest of the world sometime in 2015
once this is released internationally
you probably want to think about picking
this up if you are a serious Nintendo
fan and a serious 3ds gamer if only for
that new display which works much much
better than before again this is the new
Nintendo 3ds available only in Japan
becoming to the rest of the world very
soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
