questions for Apple to answer in 2018
Apple's had a pretty great 2017 with the
introduction of the iPhone 10 but Apple
needs to answer some questions if it
wants to have an excellent - 2018 for
this we're ranking these questions from
the least important to most important
however they're all important coming in
at number five is does touch come to the
Mac in a bigger way right now the
MacBook Pro with its touch bar is the
only Mac with Touch and it's pretty
limited pcs have had touch screens for a
long time now
so what's Apple going to do the iPad pro
has a lot more computer-like
functionality so people may be getting
used to doing complicated things with an
Apple touch interface we're going to see
more convergence between iOS and OS 10
and wouldn't that knee touch on OS 10
okay that's too many questions at number
four is how deep will Apple get into the
entertainment business
remember when iTunes was the place to
get movies and TV shows well that was a
long time ago with things like Netflix
Amazon Prime and Hulu competing for your
dollars
how far will Apple go to develop its own
shows we've seen Planet of the apps okay
we've heard of it
Apple is also working with Steven
Spielberg to revive amazing stories for
ten episodes will it appear on Apple
music like apples and other originals or
should it somehow tie into the Apple TV
again this question raises even more
questions number three where is Apple go
with augmented and virtual reality iOS
11 brought to a archit Apple's augmented
reality programming interface with it
you can place virtual objects in the
real world using apps Apple already has
around 1,000 aar apps there are rumors
of Apple glasses which could work with
AR and VR will Apple diversify its
hardware offerings by selling a new
wearable that could feel app development
let's face it when Apple hops on a
bandwagon things frequently change great
AR could make Apple products stand out
from every other competitor at number
two what does the iPhone lineup look
like in 2018 the iPhone 10 is supposed
to be the future well how quickly will
that be apples present the iPhone 10 and
offer different ways to interact with
iOS how long will a Polly pees parallel
versions of iOS for phones then there's
touch ID which just made its way to the
MacBook Pro is that going away on
iPhones in general when they go all in
with OLED or stick to LCD for some
models and OLED for the premium one how
many different iPhones can there be at
one time and the most pressing question
for Apple in 2018 is how does Siri
become relevant especially in the home
remember when Apple integrated Siri into
the iPhone 4s in 2011 it was a big leap
ahead but then Amazon and Google just
blazed past Apple in the voice assistant
category Siri is in the Apple TV now and
it's okay
Siri will be in the home pod as well
which is not out yet Apple needs to
figure out how Siri can be what it was
originally intended to be an assistant
Siri needs to be reliable intelligence
and be able to work with tons of
products so how does Apple do this
I don't know throw money at the problem
that might help we'll have to see what
moves Apple makes in 2018 and if it
really answers any of our questions what
do you think Apple should address in the
new year let us know I'm is a kernel see
