across what I think is the first smart
shower it's made by the company moanin
and it's called the you like the letter
u what this is is a smart connected
shower has a digital interface that
connects over Wi-Fi to your phone you
can have up to 12 different presets and
each preset could be for a different
user so for example I can set the
temperature of the water I want I can
even set a timer for children on the
water
I can even set a little alarm to remind
me how long I've been in the shower to
those heart presets are actually on the
physical interface the other twelve are
within the app another really cool
feature is the remote activation so if
I'm getting up in the morning I can
actually just tap on my preset and the
shower can start warming up before I
even step into the bathroom once the
shower warms up to the temperature you
want it will actually stop the water
flowing until you're in it so you're not
wasting all that water waiting for it to
get to the temperature you want so the
price on this thing there's basically
the digital interface with two buttons
or two presets and that's gonna cost one
thousand one hundred sixty dollars u.s.
but there's also a digital interface
with four preset buttons that will cost
two thousand and two hundred dollars
both of them come with the digital valve
that actually controls the hot water and
the temperature we think about this is
one of the more useful ways of
connecting your home to your technology
it's all about creating a personal
experience for you and giving you a
delicious fun shower</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
