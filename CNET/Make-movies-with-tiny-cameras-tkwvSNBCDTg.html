very special episode that looks at some
unusual tiny pocket cameras now we all
know as technology improves everything
seems to shrink in size and cameras are
no different naturally larger cameras
have more features and more manual
controls that goes without saying
however if you like me and you can't
resist a good quality of gadget a new
gadget and these toy cameras are just
too much fun to resist this one is
called a fugu be now it's a toy camera
and believe it or not a fan of a vending
machine of all places it's a very low
fire camera designed to simulate those
warm dusty tones of the old 1970s home
movies does it really well and it
captures it in 640 by 480 resolution
sound quality it is a bit ordinary it's
got a very small microphone however the
pictures just so dreamy and cute you
won't be able resist using it you're
going to need to pop a microSD card
inside to record onto and via the USB
cable you can charge it up fully you're
going to get at least a hundred minutes
of recording time before it's going to
run at a juice I think you can't get
smaller these are some tiny spy cameras
i found on ebay and guess the record
video very cheap very portable and they
record video too respectable resolution
of 1280 x 960 on a micro SD cards as
well now you don't have a preview screen
on the back of these tiny little camera
so whatever you shoot it's a bit of pot
luck that's half the fun of it okay if
you love nano blocks I've even got a
camera for you check this out now this
one's made by the same people that made
the 3d be you just build on it kids love
it it's going to USP just like straight
in your computer my absolute pick of the
bunch however of the tiny cameras we're
going to go up a little bit bigger in
size for a tiny camera but we're going
up so much more in quality if the newly
released nikon s01 these things are
absolutely incredible 10.1 megapixel
stills 720p video 96 grams in weight
it's all metal it's really sturdy it's
no bigger than a business card it just
fits in your pocket or your hand super
easy fortunately it's also got a 3 times
optical zoom ur which helps get you in
closer to the picture you filming it's
got a lot of special filters and effects
that you can apply to the vision either
while shooting or afterwards plus you've
got this two and a half inch screen on
the back that preview screen is pretty
you're trying to look at your work and
it's something we were missing on the
other cameras we were looking at all
right before I go here's a pocket film
to check out this week it's one I
actually shot in 2010 or my trusty
iphone it's called design crimes and
heap of fun I even make a cameo NAT a
parent of this crazy tool air watch out
see you next time bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
