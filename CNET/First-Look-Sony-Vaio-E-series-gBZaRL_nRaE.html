a first look at the new Sony Vaio
eseries now the e has always been Sony's
most mainstream most budget-friendly
line of midsize laptops this year
however the e is getting a pretty nice
makeover the new design it's very
rounded it's very sophisticated what it
has is basically a two-tone look it's a
wraparound in one color that's the
keyboard tray up to the back of the lid
and then sort of an interior color in
this case it's black and if you look at
it from the side it's almost as if
somebody sort of sliced into a
straighted thing almost like you kind of
cank open I've seen some other color
combinations that pop a little bit more
than this gray on black version although
this is still pretty nice-looking one of
the things I like the most about this
new eseries especially because it's a
laptop that's fairly inexpensive is the
excellent keyboard the keys are nice and
chunky they have a really good typing
feel to them and of course they are
backlit which is something I appreciate
in a laptop of any price range and
seeing it on a lower-cost laptop I think
is really great they've also made a move
taking the touchpad and turning it into
what we call a clique pad that means
that they work the left and right mouse
buttons right into the pad itself rather
than having separate buttons you do
multi-finger gestures on there it's not
really as smooth or responsive as let's
say the click pad on a MacBook is apples
are really really the guys who started
off I'll click pan thing but for again
the mid to lower mid priced laptop
it does it does fine I got a couple USB
ports including a USB 3 port and you
have something really odd you only find
in Sony Vaio's you got the memory stick
slot and a regular SD card slot because
obviously a lot of so many products
still use that memory stick although I
feel like it's less and less all the
time one thing that's going to make the
system stand out as sort of a lower
priced laptop is the fact that the
15-inch screen only has a 1366 by 768
resolution that's fine for a 13-inch
laptop or 11 and guess on budget midsize
laptops but when you get up to that 50
inch size that is one thing that sort of
gives away that this is not a super
expensive product you spend a little bit
more you can get let's say a 1600 by 900
screen which I think works a lot better
in this size but other than that does
this is a very nice update to Sony's
eseries line I
that is the first look at the Sony Vaio
eseries</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
