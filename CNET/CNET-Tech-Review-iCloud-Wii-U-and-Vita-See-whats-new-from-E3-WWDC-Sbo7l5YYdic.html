sony Nintendo Microsoft everybody had
big announcements this week and we have
them all covered stay here for all the
news for me three and apple's WWDC plus
an all-new top five countdown and the
series 5 Chromebook it's all coming up
right now
hey everyone I'm Hollywood and welcome
to the cnet tech review where we collect
our hottest videos of the week and tell
you what's good and what's bad in the
world of tech plus offer some unique
tech wisdom in the form of the bottom
line let's start with the good Apple
held its annual worldwide developers
conference in San Francisco this week
and there weren't many surprises mostly
because apple gave us the heads-up on
what to expect ahead of time no new
iphone sorry but lots of software
updates including a new service called
iCloud which Steve Jobs says will
totally change how you use your iDevices
so you like everything so far well I'll
try not to blow it so I get to talk
about iCloud now some people think the
cloud is just a hard disk in the sky
right and you take a bunch of stuff and
you put it in your dropbox or your idisk
or whatever and it transfers it up to
the cloud and stores and then you drag
whatever you want back out on your other
devices we think it's way more than that
and we call it iCloud now iCloud stores
your content in the cloud and wirelessly
pushes it to all your devices so it
automatically uploads it stores it and
automatically pushes it to all your
other devices but also it's completely
integrated with your apps and so
everything happens automatically and
there's nothing new to learn it just all
works it just
now you might ask why should I believe
them they're the ones that brought me
mobile me
it wasn't our finest hour let me just
say that but we learned a lot now the
three core apps in mobile me or contacts
calendar and Mail three things we'd
obviously like kept up to date we've
thrown them away we've riorca tected and
rewritten them from the ground up to bi
cloud apps and we've put them on all of
our devices so as an example in contacts
when I make a new contact on my iPhone
it's automatically brought up to the
cloud where it's stored on the cloud
right the truth is on the cloud and then
it's automatically pushed down to my
other devices so they're all in sync
it's that easy I just update a contact
on my iPhone and don't even think about
it and that contact is updated on all my
other devices and if I change it on any
device it's updated on all devices
wirelessly automatically without me
doing a thing we've also added calendar
sharing so as an example if I'm sharing
a few calendars with my wife school and
soccer calendars let's say right and I
add a new calendar for a teacher parent
conference on my phone it's again
automatically pushed up to the cloud and
automatically push to my wife's iphone
if she adds the she adds an appointment
for a soccer game again goes up to the
cloud and back to my iPhone it's that
simple and then we have mail mail was in
the best shape of all but it's even
better now we give you a mail account it
at me calm your new messages again are
pushed to all your devices and like we
used to your inbox and folders are all
kept up-to-date on all devices so that's
mail and no ads
we build products that we want for
ourselves too and we just don't want to
ads so we can't get there so these are
the three apps that form the core of
mobileme we used to sell them for a
subscription price of ninety nine
dollars annually as of today this
product ceases to exist and those three
apps are out of the food don't worry
mobileme folks you'll get a refund all
52 of you now an iCloud is officially
released later this year it promises to
streamline sharing media between all
your connected Apple products but Sharon
Vaknin is here to show you how you can
start using some of these services today
hey everyone I'm Sharon Vaknin for
cnet.com steve jobs recently announced
apple's new service at the worldwide
developers conference in San Francisco
it's called iCloud and it finally lets
you wirelessly sync your music books and
apps across all your devices the full
version of iCloud won't be available
until fall but you can start using some
of these features right now the whole
point of iCloud is that music and other
media you purchase on one I device can
be automatically downloaded onto all
your other devices as long as they're
using the same iTunes account to get
started using iCloud you'll need to set
it up on each device you want to keep
synced so gather up all your idevices
like your iPhone iPad or iPod Touch
first go to settings then store here you
can set your device to automatically
download new music books and apps you
downloaded onto other Apple devices and
Mac or PC apples letting you connect
with up to 10 devices just switch the
different content categories to on and
automatic downloading will be enabled if
you're on an iphone or ipad with a
limited data plan i suggest leaving the
option to use cellular data off because
if you turn this option on automatic
downloads will be counted against
your data plan if you leave this option
off automatic downloading will then only
work when you're connected to Wi-Fi now
change the itunes settings on your
computer iCloud requires itunes 10.3 or
later and you can download it by going
to apple.com / iTunes once you have it
go to preferences then store here you
have the same options as your idevices
and you can check the items you want to
keep synced so now that I have these
settings enabled if I download a song in
itunes it'll also start downloading on
my iPhone or if I download a song on my
iPad it'll be added to my library on my
computer but if you're like me you don't
have a lot of storage space left on your
device for my iPhone I left automatic
downloading off but since my computer
has lots of storage I kept automatic
downloading on for everything on my
iPhone I'll manually download new
content to do this go to iTunes then
purchased you'll see a list of all the
songs you bought on any device to
download them just hit the cloud
download button you can also view songs
you purchased but haven't put on your
device by going to the tab on the right
the same goes for books and apps for
books open I books and head to store
then purchased for apps go to the App
Store then updates then purchased except
on the iPad where purchased gets its own
button to manage your content in itunes
go to the iTunes Store then purchased in
the right sidebar in this screen you can
download previously purchased items at
no extra cost for now I cloud only
supports music books and apps but Steve
Jobs explained that the rest of the
feature is like calendar mail and photos
syncing will come in the fall and will
get you caught up with those features
when they arrive for cnet com I'm Sharon
Vaknin and i'll see you on the interwebs
be sure to come back next week for an
in-depth look at iOS 5 or if you can't
wait head over to cnet TV com for more
of our coverage from WWDC 2011 meanwhile
down in Los Angeles III kicked off on
Monday as well we got new hardware from
Sony and Nintendo scores of new games
available for demos booth babes and a
dude with muscles the size of Brian
tongs face here he is with a wrap up of
all the action hey guys Brian song here
at e3 2011 we're all eyes are fixed on
the video game world we've got hot
hardware announcements from Nintendo and
Sony we've got a lot of booth babes and
you always see a few curious suspect
things here but you know what it's all
about the games there front and center
so let's check out the floor
in my hands I have the new controller
that's part of the entire we use system
now when you look at this roundabout
this is unlike any controller we've seen
some of the games for example shield
pose that we're going to show you offers
you an additional window into the world
so you can move it around and give you
different views within the game that
you're playing another cool example of
how this can be used in different ways
is with chase me we've kind of see a
bird's-eye view of a map while other
people see a completely different
experience with what they're playing be
coming out sometime in 2012 but there
you have it really a nice feeling a nice
hold and a pretty sleek design alright
guys we're inside of Microsoft booth in
their connect pod and this is your 24
connect so we're looking at a lot of new
software titles and apps and functions
one of the features here is inside
connect fun labs I'm going to be able to
make an avatar of what you see here and
connect to me so let's just see how good
this thing is all right you see all this
you see all that up there check it out
the Bruce Lee face right there right so
you can see this obviously looks just
like me it has the big nose there's a
big nose the hair ok looking for the
blondes right but up look
obviously another thing that's big here
are the girls 83 have you seen any
lookers yeah I'm telling you they ship
them all out for some special island or
something man I don't know what it's
about it's crazy oh it's so glorious all
the Sam feels so good oh my gosh diamond
in the rough a beautiful looking lady in
a line waiting for a game sometimes
gamer guys are a little socially awkward
sometimes so if you had a tip for like a
guy of really like how to get a gamer
girls attention well what do you think
don't be scared of women in my hand we
have Sony's PlayStation Vita now the
first thing you're going to notice right
off the bat this gorgeous 25 inch OLED
display also the power of the graphics
in this handheld unlike anything we've
seen before they really touted that it
was on or almost on the level of ps3
graphics I'm going to tell you when I
look at this it's made me a believer now
this screen on the front is a
touchscreen it also has a touch panel on
the back side that is incorporated in a
game player for a variety of titles one
of the most anticipated handled that I
can remember and it feels really light
and I can't wait to get my hands on this
more hi guys nothing bigger and badder
than Hulk Hogan here at e3 vulture did
he just cover my face now you don't you
just covered my face with your guns you
can do it all familiar I fire you for
protection
another title that we're looking forward
to this coming year kinect Star Wars
let's see what this Jedi's all about
baby seriously I could do that oh I
guess I might not do this don't do that
there you have it another successful e3
2011 you know over the years we've
covered so many things we've covered
great games gadgets we've even got to
meet a whole what else is there really
left to cover Oh Brian hey at least Hulk
Hogan was willing to give you the time
of day actually to see Brian's whole
interview with the Hulkster and all the
rest of our III coverage take a look
over it see you at tv.com all kinds of
good stuff there and while you're there
you can also find the latest installment
of tap that app this week Jessica dole
court is on the warpath about bland
search results luckily she has a
solution
is it just me or is anyone else bothered
by the fact that Google search returns
are so freaking boring look at all those
plain blue links I mean come on blah
anyway I'm Jessica's all court for
seeing it and I'm going to show you a
far cooler way to search for stuff on
your iPhone this my friends is duet it's
a new free app and it uses the idea of
categories to help you narrow down your
search so let's say that you're looking
for information about a movie that you
want to see just type the title and pick
the right shortcut from the list instead
of waiting through those generic results
duet will actually bring you live web
pages from popular websites just keep
swiping through until you find the one
that you want if something's out of
place you can easily delete the ones
that do it gets wrong the sites that you
heart are the ones that you'll see more
often in your results list okay so I
mentioned before that the sites are live
that means that you can tap them and
interact exactly how you would in the
browser heck you can even buy movie
tickets if you want when you're all done
you tap the tab button in the bottom
right to return to the main list of
course no app would be complete without
sharing options to social networks and
do it has those 20 and the app will also
offer to help you install a native app
if there is one there's more than that
too and I talked about some of the other
features in my hands on review on cnet
download.com so check it out there if
you've got other suggestions for great
apps to cover send them along to tap
that app at cnet com I'm Jessica doll
court and until next time keep on tap
now as with any search app it's going to
work best if you have a good data
connection on your phone especially
since you'll be waiting for not just one
page to load but several maybe you want
Wi-Fi alright we've covered a lot of
ground already but there's still plenty
more to come we'll be back for more tech
review right after this
welcome back to the Cena tech review our
weekly video digest of all things good
and bad we've seen here at cnet TV
continuing on in the good if I do say so
myself one of the best things that we do
here at cnet is give good buying advice
but with some products like smartphones
there are so many variables that we can
only do so much without knowing how you
want to use the phone so if you're in
the market for a new smartphone this top
five countdown should help you figure
out how to look for the right one
look I feel for you buying a smartphone
is complicated you never feel like you
really got the right one I mean I work
at cnet for crying out loud every time I
buy a new phone i feel kind of sick I'm
Brian Cooley with top five things to
think about when buying a new smartphone
inspired by a survey done by business
intelligence they asked people what
their number one smartphone buying
factor was at number five we're starting
off a little wonky its data migration
now just three point nine percent of
folks said this is their number one
concern but I think more should have I
mean how are you going to move your
contacts calendar media photos messaging
history account settings from whatever
you carry now to your new smartphone
well check cnet TV and Google around for
tips on how to move your stuff from
phone to phone it's different and
sometimes barely possible depending on
the combo of phones in question and pack
a lunch you may end up doing it several
times before it gets done right number
four seven point two percent of you said
carrier does the carrier you want offer
the phone you want now it'd be pretty
damn frustrating if you lived in
illinois wanted buy a honda accord but
they only worked on roads in wisconsin
sure you could move but is it worth it
that's kind of the situation with phones
so as much as i hate to give the
carriers that much power in my life or
yours that might be where you want to
start your search number three
surprisingly is app selection I say
surprisingly because just over eight
percent of you said this is the top
priority but there's all that hype
around apps much of what makes a
smartphone smart are the apps you load
on it but clearly a lot of folks
remember that the web which all
smartphones access is kind of the
ultimate app and oh yeah call quality
still ranks higher than angry birds well
for now
number two now we get into some big
numbers his features thirty-three
percent of you said this is your number
one concern area this is stuff like
screen resolution battery life keyboard
type the cameras the storage doesn't
support flash but don't fall for the
spec arms race is an eight megapixel
camera meaningfully better to you than
five megapixels do you even know or do
you just want to brag can you really see
that extra bajillion dots of screen
resolution or is a really good screen
really good read our reviews because we
tell you what specs make a real
difference and so do the users who chime
in as well before I get you to the
number one thing people cite as their
main reason to choose a smartphone let's
look at the one that ranked bottom of
the list price just three percent said
price is their biggest concern that's
because price is pretty irrelevant right
now the sweet spot for all the top
smartphones is 200 bucks for the two
year activation a few of them are a
hundred dollars few or 250 maybe 300 but
not for long expect to pay two bills
period it's the full cost of your
two-year contract you want to scrutinize
that's where you'll spend anywhere from
a couple grand to 2400 to pushing $3,000
okay what's the number one thing most
often cited by people buying a
smartphone their top concern
thirty-eight percent say platform
android iOS blackberry Windows Phone
webOS phones have made operating systems
hot and crucial again the operating
system the phone runs on dictates what
it's good at in many cases and how the
interface looks and feels the stuff you
have to look at and navigate every time
you pick up the phone so you better like
it and platform also determines which
tech jihad you've just signed up with
which fan boys will dis you and the
comments your smug techie friends will
make behind your back so you see a lot
rides on platform okay hope while this
has helped and remember relax whatever
you get something better comes out next
week for more top 5s like this go to top
5 cnet com I'm Brian Cooley thanks to
one
so now that you know what you're looking
for let's see how the new HTC Sensation
stacks up against your criteria hey
everyone I'm Bonnie toss senior editor
at cnet com and I'm here to bring you a
first look at the HTC Sensation 4G this
is t-mobile's latest Android smartphone
and I've really been looking forward to
getting my hands on this device ever
since I got a sneak peek at it back in
spring and the smartphone definitely
does not disappoint what really grabbed
my attention first was the design the
smartphone features a 4.3 inch display
but unlike a lot of other 4.3 inch touch
devices out there such as a thunderbolt
and the Samsung Droid Charge the
sensation is pretty slim and not too
bulky it has tapered edges so it's
really comfortable to hold and it has a
high quality feel to it which is
something I expect if I'm paying two
hundred dollars for it the display is
also gorgeous it's a quarter HD super
LCD so not quite the calibre of the
iphones retina display or samsung super
amoled plus screens but text and images
still look sharp and vibrant on the
sensation screen there's more to the
smartphone than just a good design
though it's running android 2.3
Gingerbread along with a new version of
HTC Sense sense is HTC's custom user
experience for Android and they've added
some really great features to it the
biggest thing is the new lock screen and
now offers application shortcuts so
instead of having to unlock the phone
find the app and then launch it you can
just drag the icon to the ring at the
bottom and the sensation automatically
goes to the app you can also feature
more content on the lockscreen such as
photos and french stream once you unlock
the phone you'll find even more
enhancements like this 3d carousel for
your home screens and an improved Mail
app and widget that provides you with a
preview of your messages powering all
this goodness is Qualcomm's dual-core
1.2 gigahertz processor which has kept
the phone running smoothly so far save
the t-mobile g2x which uses in videos
dual core chipset is slightly faster but
the sensation 4g is still very
responsive and it also offers good call
quality and battery life the only real
downside to the sensation 4g is the
internal memory there's four gigabytes
of internal storage but only one
a bite of that is available to the user
t-mobile does ship the phone with a
pre-installed a gigabyte microSD card
but if you plan on taking a lot of
pictures or caring a lot of music or
videos it's worth upgrading to a 32
gigabyte card all things considered we
think the HTC Sensation 4G is one of the
best android phones up there and worthy
of our Editor's Choice Award t-mobile
has two great Android devices in the g2x
and now this and if you like stock
Android and want a little more power go
with a g2x but i think the sensation 4g
is better for the general consumer
because of the design and great user
experience the HTC Sensation 4G will be
available starting june fifteenth for 1
99 99 on contract i'm bonnie chen this
has been your first look at the HTC
Sensation 4G do we have a winner well
like we said that's up to you and your
needs but if you're looking to go
android and you can live without LTE you
can't really go wrong with the sensation
and with that let's move on to the bad
apple isn't the only one with their
heads in the clouds these days Google's
actually been there for a while now with
their laptops based on the chrome
browser although this one might be a
little ahead of its time here's Josh
Goldman with a slightly skeptical first
look hey I'm Josh Goldman senior editor
with cnet and this is a look at the
samsung series 5 chromebook it's the
first of two laptops the other from Acer
that runs on Google's Chrome OS now if
all you know from operating systems is
Windows and Mac this is nothing like
those while there might be a lot going
on under the hood on this thing to the
user it just appears like a web browser
and that's it there is no software to
install or uninstall for that matter
there is no updating no security to
worry about that stuff's all done
automatically really it's about as
simple as a computer can get because
everything is web-based to go along with
the simplicity of the OS you get a
simple
computer the series 5 is powered by an
intel atom processor typically founded
netbooks integrated graphics two gigs of
memory and 16 gig solid state hard drive
that's plenty of power to stream movies
and music play casual games like Angry
Birds and of course run all of googles
productivity apps like Doc's mail and
calendar while giving you a potential
battery life of up to eight and a half
hours it also wakes instantly and boots
from off in less than 10 seconds the
thing is if you're used to being able to
do a lot of things with your Windows or
Mac computer the shine fades pretty fast
from the Chromebook working only on the
web can be very limiting for example
editing photos requires that you upload
them to a site edit them and then
download them again someone send you a
zip file for work that you need to open
tough it's not supported so you'll need
to find a website to handle it one last
thing getting the most from the
Chromebook means having a constant web
connection there are a number of offline
apps you can take advantage of but it
really limits what you can do when
you've got no Wi-Fi access you can get
models with verizon 3g mobile broadband
access but it means getting a data plan
to do anything significant and again if
you're out of range you're out of luck
I'm Josh Goldman and that's a look at
the samsung series 5 Chromebook I'm all
for keeping some of my music or
documents or other data in the cloud but
all of it let's just say the internet
will have to catch up to the Chromebook
although I kind of hope it gets there
soon let's wrap things up with this
week's bottom line
when the time came for sony's press
conference at e3 monday night pundits
were placing bets on how long it would
take for somebody from the company to
acknowledge the recent playstation
network outage and other security
concerns well it turns out not very long
Sony's Jack Tretton addressed the
problems right off the top of the
presentation and our own car tsuboi sat
down with him soon after this isn't the
first time that have come to the stage
in an e3 press conference with an
elephant in the room Jack Tretton the
CEO of sony computer entertainment
wasted no time addressing the recent
security breach of the sony playstation
network at this year's e3 in Los Angeles
and I want to apologize both personally
in on behalf of the company for any
anxiety that we've caused you treadin
says the breach which compromised
information of up to 77 million users of
the PlayStation Network resulting in
three weeks of interrupted service in
the u.s. could have happened to any
company hacking right now is becoming a
major major problem across all facets so
I think we're confident that were much
more secure than we were before but
there are very few guarantees in life
but there was some good news announced
new games and a new handheld device the
PS Vita they take everything that was in
the PlayStation Portable and now it's
got a touch screen so it feels more like
an iPod Touch and iPhone and it's got
much better graphics like a playstation
3 and sony has made a play for more
advanced 3d technology this is
Playstations brand new 24 inch 3d
display it allows two players eh for 3d
glasses and see different images
pletely eliminating the need for a split
screen sony plans to offer the 3d
display as a bundle with glasses a 3d
game an hdmi cable and with the price of
five hundred dollars it will make it one
of the least expensive ways to view HD
and 3d movies at home in Los Angeles I'm
Cara Tsuboi cnet.com for CBS News the
bottom line this week thanks I guess I
mean I'm glad Sony acknowledged the
security breaches up front but I felt
like they mostly just apologize for the
inconvenience of not playing games
online and not like the inconvenience of
the possible identity theft from all the
data that was stolen I don't know maybe
I just wanted a little more begging for
forgiveness or cooler hardware all right
folks that's our show come back next
week for a hands-on look at iOS 5 on an
all-new cnet tech review until then
there are tons of great videos available
every day at Cena TV com I'll see you
next time and thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
