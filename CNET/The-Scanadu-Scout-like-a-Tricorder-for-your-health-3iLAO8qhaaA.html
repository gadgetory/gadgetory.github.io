com and we are at CES 2013 and we're
taking a first look at the scanadu scout
now do more one of these things it's a
Star Trek tricorder now this isn't a
real device but this scanadu Scout is
essentially supposed to be a medical
tricorder basically a mobile thermometer
that's super high-tech and will place
your old you know analog thermometer at
home so he just stick it right here on
your temple wait 10 seconds and after
that you basically get readings for all
sorts of health stats so you get not
only your temperature but you also get
your blood flow your blood oxygen level
your heart rate once you get all this
data you can send it to your mobile
device that would be either an Android
handset your iphone or a windows phone
smartphone so basically what you do with
this you can take a look at this data
you can see it online you can track it
over time basically gives a whole
recording of your health that you can
take to your doctor to prove you know
maybe your feel fine or something like
that but it's also basically something
that you can use to maybe even measure
the kids temperature if you have no idea
if they're sick or not and you don't
have to you know use any sort of
invasive methods so all in all this is a
pretty interesting product as far as
availability is concerned it's still
undergoing FDA review but we're told
it'll probably cost 150 and hopefully be
available by the maybe the end of the
third quarter or fourth quarter this
year I'm Brian Bennett this is going to
first look at the scanadu scout
