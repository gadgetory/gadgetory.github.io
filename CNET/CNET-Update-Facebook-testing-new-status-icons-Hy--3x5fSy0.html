Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update brace yourselves Facebook is
adding more emoticons I'm not just
talking about converting the smiley face
that you type in a post I mean status
updates that give you the option to show
what mood you're in based on an emoticon
you can also pick icons if you're hungry
icons if you're drinking tea icons if
you're reading icons if you're watching
TV what does this remind me of let's say
something I use 10 years ago on
livejournal Facebook is not saying much
about the feature except that this is a
really small test and there's no word if
this be rolled out to everyone but
something Facebook is launching now is a
new type of gift card the facebook card
can be used at jamba juice olive garden
sephora and target the idea is that you
can purchase this multitasking gift card
within facebook's gifts menu and send it
off to a friend facebook already offers
the option to send physical gifts to
your friends this is just an extension
of that if you're giving this card you
have to specify this store you're giving
the gift for they can't just use it
anywhere but several friends can give
you money on this card for multiple
stores and if you just keep it in your
wallet it'll auto refill the next time
you get a gift one thing Facebook is not
doing is building a phone CEO Mark
Zuckerberg made that clear during a
recent company earnings call he said it
would not be the right strategy for
facebook the social network reported
that it is seen fifty-seven percent
growth in mobile users each month and
right now there are six hundred and
eighty million users active on mobile
each month twitter also has some news to
share it's rolling out improvements to
photo and video viewing now users can
view enlarged photos directly on the
page instead of having to go to another
link and videos shared are showing up on
the photo gallery of your profile the
tivo integration feature on the wii u
has been delayed it was scheduled to
come out in January but nintendo now
says it will come out later this year
also delayed is an update that brings
google street view to the game system
during an earnings call Nintendo's
president said that since the Wii U is
already being sold below its
manufacturing costs there are
plans to mark down the price for square
the network for checking in to where you
are has released a best of guide based
on more than 3 billion check-ins and
tips likes and dislikes pick from 30
cities across the u.s. and it shows the
top places users visited it's yet
another move by 4 squared to become more
like a tool for finding good places and
going against sites like Yelp that your
