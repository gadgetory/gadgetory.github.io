welcome to google issues for all the
google that we can pack inside of a show
we're still waiting for the official
release date for google's new nexus
goodies but according to bright side of
news the long-rumored HTC built nexus 9
will be unveiled on october the 15th and
will go on sale november the third now
it's a convenient time to squeeze in an
announcement with apple's ipad event
happening on the 16th and Samsung's
Galaxy Note 4 releasing on the 17th if
true now the wall street journal is also
piggybacking off of what everyone has
been talking about the past few weeks
with the Nexus 6 super phablet coming
sometime this month as well and just a
side note with google plus and an actual
improvement i like is the ability to add
interactive polls to your post now
thanks to the acquisition of polar one
of my favorite apps now you're limited
to five choices and it's sleek but it's
kind of a waste that they're limiting
this to just google plus all right
iHeartRadio is bringing support to
Android wear with a nap of its own on
October the 15th supporting all current
Android wear devices including voice
search favorites and a thumbs up and
thumbs down feedback system this may not
be as official but you can also play
gameboy color games on your Android wear
device to check it out Corbin Davenport
shows it off using his Galaxy gear live
paired with the Moga controller to run
the emulator including games like Tetris
and Super Mario Brothers little games on
your watch I'm not sure how often you'd
actually use this but I love the work he
did to get it done and let's not leave
the chromecast out of the fun a new
Kickstarter that's only asking for 1,600
bucks is looking to turn the chromecast
into a multiplayer games platform now
the first planned app is called busby
and it's a quiz game for the casual user
that will incorporate YouTube videos web
images and SoundCloud audio and you'll
use your phone to interact with it now
it's their first step but really a cool
way of adding to the chromecast
ecosystem alright tons of Android
gadgets are dropping in October motorola
and verizon finally pushed out there
official sneak peek of the droid turbo
with its 5.2
qhd display to be released later this
month sleek and yes very red also at
ACC's recent double exposure event they
revealed the new HTC Desire eye that
features dual 13 megapixel cameras one
on the front and one on the back and
it's also water-resistant so really is
the ultimate selfie cam plus the
official unveil of their GoPro light
camera called the ree that can capture
16 megapixel still shots 1080p video and
allows you to stream live from youtube
through your phone now it looks a lot
like an inhaler but even better use it
in a pool to look like a human submarine
now both products are expected in time
for this holiday season and we know
lenovo has been working closely with
Ashton Kutcher to give his input as one
of their product engineers he has a
proven tech-savvy background investing
in multiple successful startups like
Skype Airbnb and path and he studied
biochemical engineering in college so
yeah he's pretty legit now the results
of his efforts and the team a lenovo has
resulted in the yoga tablet 2 pro the
successor to one of cnet's favorite
versatile tablets now this one runs
android 4.4 features a 13 inch qhd
display with this neato hanging hinge
system 32 gigs of storage 15 hours of
battery life and it's the first tablet
with a built-in pico projector so truly
one of the innovative tablet entries
we've seen to date starting at 499 and
available the end of October and really
it's worth checking out alright that's
going to do it for this week you can
always email us at google issues at cnet
com or tweet me a brian Tong and i'll
respond when i'm not looking for comics
on ebay alright thanks so much for
watching it will see you all next time
