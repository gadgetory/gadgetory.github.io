show that covers everything related to
alphabet to ink that's the company that
owns Google whammo jigsaw tinky-winky
and Lala okay maybe not those last two
I'm your guide I as actor knew or the
fantastic audience today's top stories
include even more pixel news and Google
promising they won't try to kill you but
first up let's head on over to Lenz
lanes Google Lanza is a really cool
feature it seems as though someone at
Google figured out that the super
awesome thing that can identify which
cameras looking at was a tad bit
difficult to find I think we have some
footage of how that meeting went so I
hear you have an app idea for me yes sir
I do you see people find it difficult to
find google lens oh really we had to get
to Google lens you have to launch
assistant and then hit that gray and
white icon that nobody knows is lens
right or you have to go to Google Photos
and click the camera icon that nobody
knows is lens oh the camera icon is
tight it is but I want to make an app
that launches google lens without
bringing up any other apps is that going
to be difficult to make actually super
easy barely in inconvenience so it's
here google lens the app there are no
bells and whistles for the lens app
compared to what you'd see an assistant
but it is quicker to launch since you
only have to hit the app icon to get it
going google lens is capable of
identifying texts products books places
and barcodes here's just one example you
can point your camera at text on a flyer
or a menu then you can select the text
either copy and paste it into some other
doc or you can use it for a google
search google lens is in the google play
store and cost a whopping $0 by the way
Google did announce that lens will be a
part of the default camera apps and
phones made by LG Motorola Sony Nokia 1
plus TCL a sous and Google next up let's
head back to pixel Park
even more pixel 3 stuff xda-developers
four-member Mraz 9000 posted pictures of
what looks like a Google pixel three XL
prototype and guess what it matches up
with that Bloomberg report we mentioned
last time there's a notch on the top
with two cameras on the bottom it's that
chin on the back as a single camera you
might be thinking wait wait what's that
logo on the bottom that's not the Google
g1 don't call me g2 the good folks at
nine-to-five Mac did some detective work
and found an old image of pixel 2
prototypes that Google published take a
look at that blue fellow on the right
zoom in and in now let's compare that
image to the logo on the XDA leaked
pretty similar right the editor-in-chief
of xda-developers com asked mariah's
9000 for more pics and he gave them a
bunch this prototype does not have a
headphone jack which is a real bummer
the back is glass which suggests
wireless charging but that's not a given
the pixel 3 is expected to launch in
October next stop we're not going
anywhere yet we've got a leak
potentially anyway a tweet by roland
quanta is making the rounds in it he
says Google is working on a mobile
device based on the snapdragon 710
currently scheduled for launch in the
first half of 2019 sounds like this
might be the upcoming mid-range pixel
phone how reliable is mr quant that's
kind of hard to quantify there's also an
older report from the Economic Times
that says Google is working on a
mid-range pixel that could launch in
July or August now does it make sense
for Google to introduce a third kind of
pixel with a third generation of pixels
well yeah it's a headline there right to
self Google introduces three pixel
threes also a lower-cost pixel would
make many old Nexus fans happy while
giving Google a chance to grab more
market share
next stop policy promenade
Google says it's not trying to kill you
using its AI technology Google CEO
sundar Pichai published a blog post
titled AI at Google our principles in it
Pichai says Google will not pursue AI in
four areas one technologies that cause
or are likely to cause overall harm to
weapons three technologies that gather
or use information for surveillance
violating internationally accepted norms
and four technologies whose purpose
contravenes widely accepted principles
of international law and human rights
the post goes on to say we want to be
clear that while we are not developing
AI for use in weapons we will continue
to work with governments and the
military in many other areas this post
looks like a reaction to reports of
project maven project maven is a
Pentagon drone program that uses Google
AI tools to analyze drone footage Google
is still in that deal but said it will
not renew it once it terminates in March
2019 next up comments Cove
this is the part of the show where we
point a spotlight on our awesome
audience talking about the pixel three
excels potential knotch
kenny 92 said if the nuts can be hidden
why are so many people making such a big
deal about it just turn off the nut you
know what that's a really fair point
speed racers might have some insight
saying I don't know anyone who wants
that sliver of extra screen in exchange
for the ugly knotch
ellis and taya said enough with the
notch already the notch is a boring
useless feature I don't get why the
phone designers imagined that so many
people think oh great I waited so long
to display something on each side of my
top front facing speaker now like I've
said before one day we will all look
back at notches as the mullet of phone
design it was a trend that should happen
only once never to return
ever that does it for us big thanks to

oh you're still here great so there's a
report that says the Samsung Note 9 will
be unveiled on August 9th this isn't
official yet
it's supposed to have a better camera
another outlet said the note 9 was
delayed because of VP 1 of the glass on
the front of the device to be 0.5
millimeters thinner do you think that's
true let me know in the comments</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
