its episode 275 of the 359 podcast I'm
the ultimate man behind the curtain BVG
and here we are with Ben Fox Ruben and
Roger Chang good morning guys
morning morning what are we talking
about no I Samsung not Samsung Samsung
not Apple
true there's that well we have some
Amazon news we've got a lot of Amazon
news
CNET's new hashtag keeping it fresh yeah
so we've got a big story from been on
Amazon's efforts to make Alexa more
human we'll talk a little bit about
Amazon's takeover of Whole Foods which
was official yesterday right
which meant cheaper avocados right and
other stuff all I care about the
avocados well we'll run through that and
there was also some news this morning
about Amazon launching multi-room music
playback that night Chris wrote about so
all right people have questions about
that we'll try to get through that it's
an all Amazon day so if you have any
questions about the retailing giant
leave them in the comment section we'll
get to them in three minutes in 59
seconds
stick around from the recording of the
podcast we'll be back in four minutes
from three to welcome to the 359 I'm
Roger Chang I'm Ben Fox Ruben it's all
about Amazon today Ben you've got a
fantastic profile of Alexa really the
effort that Amazon is putting to make
Alexa more human aw shucks think that's
the only compliment I'll give you
further so then tell me more about this
story why should people read this so
it's interesting to consider what
exactly voice assistants are going to
become not that far from now into the
future I think a lot of people that
watch the movie her by Spike Jonze see
this idea of us having voice assistants
being much more integrated into our
lives us developing relationships with
them and we it was really fun to kind of
delve into this piece to understand how
Amazon and Alexa are getting us closer
to that as a possibility right and there
was this this
principle is Casa principle right
there's this really so this is an idea
back from the 90s called computers or
social actors paradigm it essentially
describes the fact that even though
people know computers aren't human
obviously they still treat computers
like they are human they say thank you
they say thank you yeah or if I like
yellow Siri for getting something wrong
like I kind of feel bad about it
afterwards I mean like Syria doesn't
have feelings
so casa explains that or at least it
tries to I will say I so yesterday I was
the first time finally set up a smart
home switch for my AC and when I finally
did I might Thank You Alexa and Alexa
didn't say no yeah like that's rude so
but but that's interesting to think
about because like if Alexa was actually
gonna say you're welcome it would mean
that Alexa was yeah it would respond
without the wake word which would creep
people out and would create privacy
concerns but at the same time how
exactly are Amazon Google Apple Samsung
how are they going to try to figure out
different ways to make these things more
human-like and in making them more
human-like increase engagement increased
discovery make them more useful but at
the same time potentially create this
like creep out factor of we're talking
to these robots right now they're acting
more like people and you actually went
up to Princeton to visit a team of
students who actually they're
participating the competition to make
Alexa more human right right they're
creating a social bot named pixie that
the primary concept of it is to be able
to just chew the fat and talk to you
about fashion or travel or not all the
challenges to have pixie hold a
conversation for what's 20 minutes 20
minutes that's a long time yeah I mean
like you can barely stand talking to me
for four minutes
I know it's it's and and it's really
cool to think about how much actually
goes into any given conversation among
two people for 20 minutes yes so it's a
super complicated very difficult
unsolved problem in the AI world to
actually create an artificial
intelligence that could carry on a
conversation for 20 minutes
really really hard all right well
there's plenty to unpack here but you
know definitely take a look at then
store it's fantastic peace as I said uh
next up or lastly I guess we have to
talk about the Whole Foods takeover
Amazon officially took over the grocery
store chain on Monday what did it mean
yeah it's it's a first of all what it
means for Amazon is is that it's the
biggest acquisition ever it's 13.7
billion dollars this is also their their
first major foray into brick-and-mortar
there's already questions as to who are
they gonna buy up next are they gonna
get Nordstrom are they get beyond that
for the for our viewer is really that I
think the immediate impact you started
seeing echoes at the store right we
seemed a little tacky I was surprised
they they right off the bat and and we
got discounts on special items right
select items yeah they got and and
select is really the operative word here
it's really just a handful of
bestsellers and they lowered the prices
on you know avocados responsibly farm
tilapia all stuff are mine like yeah
like brown eggs buy you know between 7%
and 43% Bloomberg you know crunch the
numbers on this and so they're planning
on doing more of that but at the same
time they got a lot of excitement and
positive press about cutting just a
handful now and this was this eligible
for like these discounts were for
everyone for just prime customer for
everyone
prime is going to become the rewards
program eventually but they still need
to do the integration got it okay and I
take that back I'm not into farm tilapia
okay Wildman well there's nothing all
right
okay plenty of Amazon user day that's
all the time we have a more lease
ownership goes on Cena I'm Rutger Chang
I'm Ben Fox Ruben thanks for listening
how dare you say alex is not intelligent
Alexis intelligence she's an AI she's
intelligent
she salted her she still gets things
wrong sometimes all the time she gets
things wrong a lot you get things wrong
a lot I do I do I do but they're not
selling me at Whole Foods okay putting
me in a farm-fresh
stance and Ruben
that would be weird have a conversation
have a 20-minute long conversation with
Ben five each other like imagining how
difficult it is for an AI to do it just
a human to keep it between minute
conversation like I'll get bored before
our twenty minutes goes violent yeah
wait what yeah exactly right and one of
the one of the cooler things to think
about just about how fascinating people
are is it's it's already like they could
they could put basically almost all the
world's knowledge into an AI it's not
gonna make it be able to talk right you
know you put every single news story
that ever happened today or any day over
the last couple months into an AI it
still doesn't have the necessary context
to actually understand all those I think
the last episode of Rick and Morty prove
that right no actually I would say
that's not sure I think like this like
stream of consciousness TVs were walking
around us robot yells at clouds yeah and
that's one of the aspects that like I
talked to one of the you know the heads
of AI science at a from the Alexa team
and he talked about the idea of like
what what would like a robot takeover
look like yeah and he said that like
look this isn't this isn't really that
likely that we're gonna end up with
something like Skynet because they're
gonna grow and develop in our world
they're gonna learn from us so the idea
that they learned that were terrible
people and must be like wiped out the
face of the earth that's like words or a
little feel bad for us you know and try
to handle the only way to solve this
problem suppose our misery right but
that was one of my for all of us Roger
right the only way to save humans is to
kill them all exactly right that's been
saying that for years all right let's go
jump into the chat I'll pimp says maybe
we should give the computer system a
kind of acknowledgment when they do get
it right maybe that will help the
process of them getting better right I
think I don't do that well the computers
need positive reinforcement but you can
do that within the Alexa app if you open
up the Alexa app it does ask you
did we get this right or is this what
you actually are whether it's like to
ask first yeah part of it just saying
good job yeah no I didn't really have to
like there is something in there to give
some sort of reinforcement to show the
other thing is is that Amazon knows that
if you ask for the same thing over and
over and over again you probably didn't
get it right so even if you're not gonna
do that reinforcement through the app or
you are in fact so in tune I don't mean
to make light of the situation but if
you're obsessive-compulsive into a
certain extent and that is something
that you are pursuing frequently what
how is that going to differentiate is it
one of two extremes what if you do want
to order pizza every single night um I
mean like you put up a good point that
humans are super complicated and trying
to chain train a bot to live in our
world and talk to us is very very
difficult and you don't have to just
train like Brian's but you have to train
a bot that's gonna talk to millions and
millions of people so it's they just
certain concepts about like what what
you take for granted and what somebody
else takes for granted as like just the
fact in your world it's entirely
different and Alexa is gonna have to
thread that needle I think it's entirely
more likely that before the robots take
us over they're just gonna get sick of
us and leave did watch the movie her
right I haven't seen it's okay I've seen
movies no spoilers AI which wasn't great
but no that was terrible and potential
yeah I wanted it to be good there was
the right idea there but it just
visually it's cool it's gorgeous yeah
yeah the thing with that one is is that
that's like a boy that looks like a boy
I mean it was Pinocchio yes just Pio
to me this this concept with the like
said this was Y to me it was fun to like
write about this is that it's almost
entirely cerebral in that it really just
targets voice as like a very natural
medium as opposed to trying to convince
somebody that this robot is a human
because it looks like a human you know
you're talking to you know a cylinder
like a plastic cylinder let's talking
back to you right back into the chat
Danny Green shout out Danny Green hey
what's up yo Alexa needs to work on
understanding southern
lect she doesn't understand me half the
time I'm working on like linguistic
variances too at the same time though
yeah I think any kind of like multiple
accents last I checked
Alexis still has a hard time
understanding the elderly understanding
young people like little kids all right
so it makes perfect sense that it
wouldn't understand a southern dialect
either the more you use Alexa the more
it should be able to actually understand
what it is that you Danny are saying but
it's still limited just keep talking to
Alexis yeah it's a chance to like learn
more about that algorithm and how they
actually learn language because I myself
I often admittedly struggle with some
accents it's difficult maybe I'm a bad
listener I don't know but I'd be
interested to know how they do that on a
mechanical sense a lot of it is brute
force machine learning where just if you
feed it enough recordings it's gonna get
better
but even after years of the echo being
out in the market and millions of people
using it it's an enormous amount of work
and training that's still required yeah
I mean like my I've lived with echo
basically since the get-go and it it
still gets things wrong so a lot echo
from the get-go I go from the get-go
putting that on the t-shirt imagine
soggy and you already kind of brushed on
this earlier when we kind of had the
breeze through the whole foods
integration but any thoughts on the
large Amazon product presence in Whole
Foods looking at the pictures of
displays yesterday seems like they may
be in danger of ruining the organic
ambiance
oh that's a good point yeah I agree I
think that it felt to me that it was a
little tacky a little forced do you
think that's gonna be a permit thing is
that like a whole picture like the
Amazon area I mean look it's it's a easy
way for them to get real estate right
rather than having to rent out or open
up their own stores you know they've got
an established location right how many
stores are there 20,000 locations about
460 I was I was on our way
I don't think there are 20,000 sours
about anything I just threw a number out
there all right so a couple hundred
stories so it's like a couple hundred
locations that yeah they have no real
stated they fit much better in one of
those Amazon book stores yeah also
seldom I believe in Best Buy and Target
I don't think this is the best place to
really position those but you think
they'll create like a little coffee shop
book thing kind of the corner that might
fit a little bit better Oh barista yeah
well I mean like almost like a borders
Barnes &amp;amp; Noble type thing like in a
Whole Foods with that fit I don't I
don't even know it's possible I think
that this was a little bit more force
than people were making fun of it on
Twitter so but I think Amazon was
interested in just kind of putting their
stamp on the whole food saying like hey
you know we sort of like the Prime logo
yeah that thing was a real hey I believe
that was real and it was pretty gross
yes yeah yeah you should kind of let
Whole Foods be Whole Foods cut the
prices make people happy that way but
overdoing it with the Amazon
integrations the tech stuff makes dawns
taking a lot of the credit for the price
cuts but the Whole Foods was already on
its way to cutting its prices cuz it
needed to cut prices it was it found
himself it is yeah found it something
basically in a sea of other markets
offering the same kinds of organic goods
for a lot cheaper so that is exactly
right I mean that's that was kind of the
issue before Whole Foods got in trouble
we've both been business reporters we
know that more often than not if a
company that's been around that long
ends up getting acquired there's a
reason for it yeah and Whole Foods was a
bit on down cycle I'm not saying that
they were about to go bankrupt that
obviously was not the case but they were
struggling and they were having a hard
time really trying to represent
themselves in the market after everybody
jumped on the natural and organic buzz
yo all right back into the chat Jackie
touchwood says why are these computer
assistants always women so I asked the
Alexa personality head in
in Seattle when I went out there why is
Alexis voice female and I got a somewhat
unsatisfying answer which was we
surveyed a bunch of different voices and
this was the one that did best in the
surveys so that's that's the answer it
wasn't it wasn't some weird like
matronly type appeal to it I'm sure
there yeah I'm sure there's something a
subconscious level that people respond
to yeah okay so there isn't there is one
this is it there's one study that I read
that I kind of feel like the conclusions
are somewhat controversial but it
ultimately said that certain computer
voices can be more persuasive than
others and it ultimately found that male
voices attempted to be the more
persuasive ones because people took
their biases and stereotypes from the
human world and applied them to the
computer world so the argument is is
that in a shopping environment according
to the study it would be better off to
have a male voice according to the study
according to the son reinforce that yes
according to the study by so Amazon is
creating Alexa not simply to sell you
things that seemed pretty obvious to me
so there were a lot of different aspects
that came into it but yeah I guess from
a survey perspective that was Siri you
can technically have you can have a male
voice yeah Cortana is obviously a woman
wasn't that was based on that was based
off the Haley laughter yeah that was
just kind of a big speed bixby is
supposed to be gender neutral they chose
the Bixby name because and I associate
with Bill Bixby though sorry right what
is that it's their male and female
voices for bed space you know what I've
tried Bixby kind of hard to find a phone
that would actually use it right
so the complication here is that also
according to that study that I
referenced is that even if you had a
completely tor
mechanical computer voice in the study
they found that people still gendered
that voice regardless so there's no
there's no such thing as like a
non-gendered computer voice and it also
I think we've been trained to think that
way it also it also takes away from the
experience we're likely to respond to it
if it has a more human voice Star Trek
episodes the computer is always a woman
mm-hmm
but the og was Hal 9000 sure how try to
kill us
yeah maybe that's why they're leaving
from Isis last time we had a male
digital assistant great yeah all right
we are just about out of time we got
time for one maybe two more questions
Scott Myatt says 3d TVs died out before
they really got going even though all
the major companies got behind it do you
reckon AI might die out in a few years
as well no I I think that's I feel like
3d TVs struggled to be useful
totally gimmicky it's very gimmicky
there wasn't a lot of content for it was
expensive to produce content for it
AI you can see immediately right off the
bat there are uses for a are talking
about voice assistance specifically or I
mean like AI is really broad trend well
if you want clarify our officials
artificial intelligence or visual
assistance I mean either way I don't
think either these trends are going away
right like the mean they're both huge
huge initiatives for basically every
tech company that's out there right now
yeah
broadly I think most companies most
major tech companies these days see a
huge opportunity to both melt in AI
with humans you make both better and the
expectation is is that that's going to
and I think in a lot of fields the 3d TV
analogy well kind of make sense on paper
breaks down when you think about the
fact that 3d TVs is hardware is
expensive to produce hardware and the
content cost of produce
you know AI is mostly software the
software can be put into anything
whether it's a phone whether it's a
computer whether it's your washing
machine it can be there are way more
applications for AI and for digital
assistants than there are 3d TVs right
that being said the the primary aspect
of that question is
like is this actually gonna remain a
thing or is it gonna get short-circuited
at some point and I think it's always
good to consider that
yes sir any time we talk about tack a
number of people comparing contrasting
VR to 3d TV including Jeff er who thinks
AI might have some potential behind it
more so than VR itself
he also expands and asks going back to
the whole foods topic whole foods being
relabeled as pantries thoughts on that
Oh like Amazon pantry um I think talking
about some of the smaller Whole Foods
like they they have like some if I
thought they were called the 365 total
ripoff of us not just the brand of Whole
Foods food that's sold in stores yes
yeah like brand right all right
admittedly I don't know a ton about this
question so I'll try to research it a
little bit more yeah well thanks for
stopping Ben before we wrap it up for
the day let's go down through a line of
who we think really really great
celebrity AI voices might be Josh Boyd a
submits bender from Futurama and I'm
gonna go ahead and second that who else
do we think okay I was gonna say sir
Stallone would be just hilarious no no
it's let's put robots in the suit in in
the place oh I can actual like Johnny
number 5 I'm going steal it that's a
great oh crap KITT KITT from Knight
Rider I'm surprised nobody's done that
yeah yeah that would be great yeah kind
of like yet that man just had a very
subtle it was more like Stewie from
Family Guy kind of yeah aristocrat Ian
arrest yes is very aristocratic I like
that voice yeah then I I don't even have
any other ones we already mentioned how
9000 like I think could be how it knows
that would be unnerving
I got one more I got one more than me
the absolute most annoying
robot voice to put into AI that would
ruin everybody's life you would smash
your echo punky from pee-wee's Playhouse
I don't that would be horrible right
cooking complete full sentences oh my
god be awful that would be a lot of fun
I really I really a minute I have to dig
that for a second remember what the hell
that was but make a like a high in the
kinda honey hole all right let's get out
of here before I ruin anything else yeah
Oh before we do go Alexa subscribe to
the 3:59 podcast ooh does that even work
I don't know we'll find this it works
we'll see anyways you like to Athey you
saw or heard hear chicks on a sea net
our podcasts also available in iTunes
tune in stitcher SoundCloud feedburner
and Google Play Music than seen it I'll
see you all tomorrow bye everybody bye
