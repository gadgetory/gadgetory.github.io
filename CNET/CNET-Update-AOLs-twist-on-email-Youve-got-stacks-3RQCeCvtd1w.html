overload I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your cnet update keeping your email
inbox organized could be an impossible
task especially when accounts are packed
with so much gray mail and deal alerts
personally I simply gave up trying to
tame the beast but AOL is working on
answer to fix email yeah I said AOL it's
created this email client called Alto
which puts different categories an email
into their own piles and it teaches
itself to sort messages into stacks
automatically people don't use email
folders so this is a new very visual way
to get your inbox more organized without
putting in much effort and if your
messages look organized you won't feel
stressed or so that's the idea right it
also lets you break down the analytics
of your email and see social media
connections from the sender like their
most recent tweet or other connections
they have in common with you it works
for Gmail Yahoo apple icloud and of
course AOL you can have it manage up to
five different accounts at once and you
have to sign up to be part of the
private beta test now it probably won't
be publicly available until February of
next year Yelp is cracking down on
companies that sheet by painful reviews
if Yelp sees that a business is trying
to flake reviews it will post a consumer
alert for 90 days to call out the
company for not playing by the rules and
there will be a link to the evidence
that it compiled it would also show a
warning when it sees too many reviews
posted from the same IP address and
Pinterest is also getting tough users
can block and report questionable
activity like posts that involve nudity
hate or violence over the next week
people will be able to block users flag
pins or report an entire user's profile
to be reviewed need a cheap laptop just
for doing work online google announced a
new chromebook made by samsung and it's
for two hundred and fifty dollars it's
very light and thin it's a browser based
system meaning you don't download
applications everything's run through a
chrome web browser it's not a very
powerful laptop because uses a processor
found in tablets but it could be
something you keep around a house to do
some quick work online and it's good if
you do most of your work in Google Docs
and the app uber is in the news again it
lets users call a car for pickup it
shows the location of the driver and the
app automatically charges your credit
card on Thursday uber added the ability
to hail a taxi in San Francisco but at
the same time it canceled a taxi feature
for New York uber gave up battling New
York's regulations the city's Taxi and
Limousine Commission is strict on how to
pay for rides New Yorkers though can
still use the app to order black car
pickup which can be more expensive that
