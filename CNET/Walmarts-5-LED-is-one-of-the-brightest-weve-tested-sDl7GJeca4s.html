here in front of the Walmart great value
60 watt equivalent bulb this is a 10
watt LED that puts out well over 800
lumens of light almost 900 lumens so a
very good 60 watt equivalent now this is
the soft white 2700 K version of the
bulb you can also get it in a daylight
variety that shines closer to 5000 K
kind of that hot blue light both
versions cost less than five dollars and
are fully dimmable now these bulbs are
brighter than almost all of the other 60
watt replacements we've tested and
they're also more efficient than a lot
of the low cost options out there more
efficient than the G bright stick and
the cree 4 flow LED not quite as
efficient as the philips 60 watt LED
though with plenty of brightness in a
very nice price tag we'll of 5 bucks
I like these bulbs a lot but I have some
qualms with their dimming capabilities
neither one dimmed down much further
than 20% at minimum settings that's not
very good you really want your bulbs to
dim at least below 10 percent if you
compare it to this Ostrom bulb here that
dims down a lot lower you can see the
difference another key dimming
difference these bulbs flicker a little
bit at low settings on certain dimmers
not every dimmer we've tested but enough
of them take a look at it here next to
the Ostrom bulb again you can see it
flickering I do the same thing with the
Osman bulb you can't see that same
flicker awesomes got a better dimming
bulb there I prefer a bulb wipeout Osram
one or maybe the Cree for flow LED I
wanted a dimmable bulb for less than ten
dollars that does a nice job getting
down to those little levels without
flickering but if I'm not so concerned
with dimming these live up to their name
they're a great value and if you don't
need dimming at all they've got a non
dimmable version that is even less
expensive only cost about three bucks
per bulb that's a very good value my
problems with the dimming aside these
are still a no-brainer upgrade over
incandescent an incandescent light bulb
will cost you about seven dollars a year
if you're using it's three hours a day
use one of these bulbs for the same
amount of time and it'll cost you about
a dollar 20 add that to the $5 price
point it's still a cheaper option so
even for a free incandescent
this is a better value for my full
rundown of these bulbs check out the
full review at cnn.com along with the
rest of our lighting coverage for CNET
appliances I'm right Chris
