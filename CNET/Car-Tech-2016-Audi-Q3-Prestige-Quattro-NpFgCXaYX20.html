it's kind of nice compared to the
mercedes-benz GLA for example it's
extremely quiet you get a bit of engine
noise coming through from the 2-liter
but not a whole lot of Road and wind
noise it's a very well insulated vehicle
and the ride is very comfortable where
the Mercedes is a bit stiffly sprung and
bumpy over city streets the upright and
vertical seating position takes a little
bit of getting used to for me feels a
bit weird almost like I'm sitting on top
of an Audi a3 as opposed to inside of a
q3 but at all seating position in a
commanding view of the road are sort of
the point of this class
and so it's very easy to really get used
to and appreciate like a better view of
the road around you and ahead of you
then of course we've got outie
technology which is a bit of a mixed bag
at this price point for Audi you've got
a bunch of really nice things like
they're very powerful I'm in my
dashboard technology that's going to
pack a whole lot of very crisp graphics
and snappy performance into a very neat
and well-organized package the a3 comes
with a dashboard controller as opposed
to the console controller that you'll
find on some about 'higher in sedans
things are a little bit more spread out
and it's all just a bit clunky also it
sort of seems like you have to rotate
the knob the wrong direction to scroll
through lists it's just very
counterintuitive the way they've got
things set up there
and then of course in the center console
we've got the proprietary outing in my
connection which is a pain in the ass
because how to keep sending it to us
with the 30-pin dock connector as
opposed to a lightning or USB connector
that's a minor annoyance for a reviewer
like me but in a household that has
multiple phones that use different
connections I think a lot of drivers are
going to prefer just a straight-up USB
port what it's not is will the most
powerful car in this class under the
hood we've got a 2-liter turbocharged
four-cylinder engine it's basically the
same engine that you'll find in the
Volkswagen Golf GTI but slightly retuned
here we've got 200 horsepower 207
pound-feet of torque but this is a
significantly heavier vehicle than the
Volkswagen Golf GTI at around 3,700
pounds it's about 700 pounds heavier
than the small hatchback so of course it
feels a little less than
a little more hesitant and even with our
support package this is feel
particularly nimble we've got a nice
drive select button here that lets off
toggle between sport comfort and
automatic programs but generally they
all feel more or less the same and that
is a bit sluggish we've also got paddle
shifters in a sport program on the
automatic transmission which again don't
really feel like they do much for the
overall zest of driving if you're
expecting driving dynamics from the q3
well you're probably better off spending
you're around thirty five thousand
dollars on a fully loaded Volkswagen
Golf R you're gonna have a lot more fun
with that vehicle and there's really no
denying the map that more weight equals
a whole lot less fun of course if you're
looking for a comfortable small
crossover to drive around the city
that's got some nice creature comforts
and a nice tall seating position well in
my opinion the Audi q3 is a better buyer
than for example the mercedes-benz GLA
at least until the BMW x1 gets here
later this year to challenge it
the 2016 audi q3 is going to start at
around thirty three thousand seven
hundred for the front wheel drive
Premium Plus model but this fully loaded
prestige all-wheel drive with its mythos
black metallic paint and Sport Package
is going to roll off a lot at around
forty one thousand eight hundred twenty
five bucks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
