Apple but changes due in iOS 9 which was
just unveiled at the company's WWDC
conference could give apple's tablet a
much-needed shot in the arm revealed all
the way back in 2010 the late Apple
co-founder Steve Jobs promised that the
iPad would fill the space between a
smartphone and a laptop that vision
resonated with shoppers and in 80 days
Apple sold three million iPads sales
continued to skyrockets but have
declined more recently as smartphones
became bigger and laptops became more
portable apple's solution is to make the
ipad a lot more computer-like with iOS 9
apple's tablet will get slide over which
lets a second app occupy on-screen space
without closing whatever you're running
the more ambitious split view gives you
simultaneous control of two windows
which can be resized to fit your needs
meanwhile you'll be able to size down
video so they play in a smaller portion
of the screen treat the iPads keyboard
like a trackpad for easier cursor
movement and text selection and there
are even keyboard shortcuts for when
you've got a physical keyboard connected
hinting that there may be an official
Apple iPad keyboard in the works the new
ideas on show for the iPad aren't
especially new and have been seen on
rival tablets before but until now Apple
has resisted making its tablets this
computer liked the fact that these iOS 9
treats are only coming to the iPad shows
Apple is keen to differentiate its
tablets from its increasingly large
phones and with the attractive split
view feature only available on the iPad
air 2 the company is generating reasons
to upgrade if Apple's plan works this
new computer iPad OS could turn things
around for the faltering tablet Tim Cook
and pals are still playing a dangerous
game though by making the iPad less like
an iPhone they're making it more like a
Mac and if Apple continues to
computerize its tablets it'll have to
take care not to put people off buying
it's more expensive laptops iOS 9 is
expected to launch in a few months so
stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
