here is a 3d printer HP has gotten into
new 3d printing technology with
something called multi jet fusion now
industrial 3d printing uses a lot of
materials and customs take a lot of time
multi jet fusion aims to produce high
quality very strong objects in a lot
quicker process and hopefully create
more affordable objects along the way
multi jet fusion right now uses fused
nylon to create its parts and HP was
demonstrating that things like chain
link could actually support cars if they
were done right now using this
technology it's kind of like inkjet
technology compared to other 3d printers
creating a little droplets and doing a
horse stage process to build up the
object the idea is the accuracy is down
to 20 microns which is a lot more finely
honed than a lot of other 3d printers
that are out there
HP is open to creating other materials
too down the road you might see others
similar to what other 3d printers in the
market use or even other materials this
is going to be launching in a 2015 beta
window but the idea that people will
finally get their hands on these in 2016
this is not for home use this is a big
3d printer but HP is also designed front
end computing platforms like sprout to
be able to use immersive computing to
create objects that then can be sent to
3d printers maybe 3d printers around the
corner HP certainly seems invested in it
I'm Scott Stein and that's a quick look
