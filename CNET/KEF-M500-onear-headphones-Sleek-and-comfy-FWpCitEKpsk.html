at cnet.com and I'm here with the keffe
M 500 headphones in case you've never
heard of keffe it's a British company
that makes premium speakers but now it's
entered the headphone market with a
couple of models the first thing I'll
say about this headphone is it's one of
the most comfortable on-air models I've
tested it has memory foam in the ear
pads and those pads rests nicely on your
ears sealing out a decent amount of
ambient noise without feeling too snug I
also like the way they look they have a
sleek modern design they also appear to
have excellent build quality with a
lightweight aluminum frame and caps
multi-directional smart hinge which
allows you to lay the headphones flat or
fold them up for storage and they're
included carrying case along with that
carrying case you get two detachable
cords one of which has an integrated
remote / microphone for cell phone use
both cores have a flat tangle resistant
design and I liked how they connect to
the headphones on the back side of the
aluminum frame I caught the cable on a
door handle on the cable detached from
the headphone without incident which is
a good sign for these holding up well
over time this model has bigger base
than keps in-ear m200 headphone and
while I prefer the sound of the M 200 s
the m5 hundreds are still quite good
they're well balanced accurate open
headphones that offer good detail and
are pleasant to listen to for long
periods while they may not have the body
you know that fullness of sound to take
you into the Wow's own they're very
likeable headphones and when you factor
in their combination of strong design
and comfort level they make for an
excellent set of everyday headphones
that work well with a variety of music
at $300 they may not be a bargain but
neither are most 300 hour headphones and
at least these have aluminum not plastic
frames around them I'm David Karl and
those are the kept em 500 headphones
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
