Petrak of it and we are here taking a
look at the breath ometer now this is a
breathalyzer attachment for the iPhone
and it kind of explains why we have a
couple of bottles of booze here if we're
gonna try it out the breath ometer is
the vise here it's about the size of a
airplane bottle or a couple of double-a
batteries
it's got a little hatch in the side here
where you can fit a triple-a battery
that powers the thing but it needs an
iPhone to actually do anything at all so
it has this little retractable pin here
that goes into the iPhones headphone
jack so I got my iphone handy right here
and put this thing up together and it's
like oh wait it won't go in the top
because this is an iPhone 5 breath
ometer really seems to design for
iPhones for so I have to plug it into
the headphone jack in the bottom here I
also have an app for the breath ometer
on my iPhone it really won't work with
the out the app and you see a nice big
blue Start button here and that's that's
how you go it's a pretty easy to start
that process so Caitlin how much do you
think you've had to drink so far I've
had you know probably a regular glass of
a 10% beer that's sounds pretty hefty
you think you're safe to drive I think I
could drive ok well let's test that out
ok so I'm gonna push the start button
it's gonna wait a few seconds while it
calibrates then you blow into this
little blue glowing hole here ok for
about five seconds really it's just as
breathe in then exhale into the sensor
analyzing testing and process ah that's
a pretty happy result it's a big red
ring - yeah way over now that I don't
think that's actually an accurate result
because I haven't seen you drink a whole
lot today except for a bit of this yeah
so beans yeah seems a lot what I've seen
from the barometer is that well one
thing they say is you're not supposed to
use it until twenty minutes after your
last term and so you might have like I
mean it's been about two minutes right
you might have breathe out some like
alcohol directly into the thing so I'll
give it a try I've been drinking whiskey
here but it's been I don't know like ten
maybe fifteen means I've had a drink so
we'll give that a try it's analyzing my
breath right now my whiskey breath and
it gave me a point zero wow I have not
had a single thing to drink so that's
actually one of my critiques of this
thing is professional breathalyzer will
often have a nozzle sort of thing
plastic do any of you blow directly into
this just has a sort of open area here
so when you've had a few drinks you
might kind of blow around it or not
really blow accurately into the sensor
this thing only cost about $50 so it's a
fairly cheap addition to the iPhone
although you can find a lot of
breathalyzers online for a bit cheaper a
lot of keychain breathalyzer is that
kind of thing what I found with this is
it's it's pretty fun of parties in a bar
people always want to give it a try and
see what it comes out with but I would
not rely on it to tell you whether
you're safe to drive or not you can you
should really just count how many drinks
you've had and decide whether
safe or not and go very conservative
with that number two well anyway I'm
Wayne Cunningham and I'm Kaitlin Petrak
of it and we were looking at the a the
breath ometer breathalyzer for the
iPhone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
