it and right now we're taking a first
look at the new BlackBerry z30 the Z 30
isn't exactly new it hit the European
markets at the end of September 2013
still the device is just beginning to
make its way to other Shores
for example Verizon said it will sell
the handset in November for one $99.99
the Z 30 is BlackBerry's biggest screen
smartphone yet it packs a large 5 inch
720p HD resolution display which the
company says has a pixel density of 295
PPI of course that's nowhere near sharp
as the HTC One and Samsung Galaxy s4
whose Full HD screens offer 468 PPI and
441 PPI respectfully I have to say that
the Z 30s display doesn't seem very
bright either still since it uses OLED
technology it has high contrast and wide
viewing angles shaped like your average
smartphone slab at first glance the Z 30
could be any Android handset as a matter
of fact it's black chassis and silver
accents not to mention its soft touch
back remind me of phones I've seen from
HTC and Motorola if you look closer
though you begin to see what sets this
device apart even if you didn't notice
the Z 30s twin blackberry logos above
the screen is the iconic blackberry
notification light which flashes an
angry red when alerts occur there's a 2
megapixel front camera here too two
ports for micro HDMI and micro USB
connections sit on the left edge up top
is a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack and
power button while on the right you'll
find volume and play pause controls
ringing the device though our six
microphones which Blackberry claims will
help the phone deliver unprecedented ly
clear calls and pristine recorded audio
quality the z30 also has a set of
powerful stereo speakers two on the top
and bottom edge of the phone I can vouch
that they indeed get very loud perhaps
the loudest I've ever heard from a smart
phone yet under the back cover is a
high-capacity 2880 milliamp
battery road warriors will certainly
appreciate that it's also removable
placed here as well are slots for
microSD memory cards and micro SIM cards
also slick is that the BlackBerry z30
supports the Qi standard for wireless
charging blackberry boasts to that the
c30 should have a mixed used runtime of
25 hours another bold claim blackberry
makes is that thanks to something called
a para tech antenna the Z 30 can adjust
its cellular reception on-the-fly the
idea here is to grab a better lock on
data and voice connections when signal
strength is low the Z 30 also connects
to Verizon's LTE data network if you're
within its 4G cellular footprint the Z
30 software has been updated as well the
phone runs the new blackberry 10.2
operating system that has a few fresh
tricks up its sleeve
along with the familiar peak gesture to
quickly see your messages and the
BlackBerry hub unified inbox there's a
new priority hub the priority hub will
pay attention to who you interact with
most whether on Twitter Facebook email
texts or what have you then float those
conversations up to the top of a
priority hub view if you're familiar
with the cameras on the BlackBerry z10
and q10 the Z 30 won't offer many
surprises the Z 30 uses the same 8
megapixel sensor as its predecessor in
addition to the time shift feature which
takes multiple shots at once so you can
choose the best one BlackBerry has added
an HDR mode which uses the backside
illuminated sensor to brighten shadow
detail in strong backlighting powering
the Z 30 software is a 1.7 gigahertz
Snapdragon s4 pro processor and
quad-core Adreno graphics that's backed
up by 2 gigabytes of RAM and 16
gigabytes of internal storage
