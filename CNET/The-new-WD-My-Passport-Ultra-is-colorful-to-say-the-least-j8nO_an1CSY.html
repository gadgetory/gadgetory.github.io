ultra purple dry foam WD now this is a
new drive not to be confused with the
one that came out two years ago now note
that the drive here comes in white and
that is the first new thing about it
colors apart from while you can also
have in black blue and berry right here
if these are not colorful enough for you
you can also get the optional grip pack
like these right here you can mix and
match the band here and the drive to
create so many color options you'd have
to make anybody happy
except for me though because I couldn't
find anything that met my classy shirt
right here of the room now the second
new thing about the drive here is the
addition of the 3t by capacity which I
don't have here and only because it's
not available for purchase until next
month but one thing I know though the 3t
I would also share the same compacted as
this one or the rest of the capacity
here and that means it would be one of
the most compact drive on the market
that gives you three terabyte to carry
on the go
now the third new thing is the backup
software the ultra here uses WD backup
and not the WD smart way the backup
software is easier to use you can
quickly choose what to backup and the
software will do that for you now
there's no longer the option to backup
when changes are detected however the
dry also support to a few basic AES
hardware encryption in case you want to
keep the data safe from curious eyes out
of the box is pre formatted in NTFS file
system for windows we can also quickly
reformat it in 8 FS plus for mac now if
reformatting is too much work for you
you can also offer the my passport for
mac which i also have right here apart
from the default file system the to
drive are basically the same
including the pricing and speaking of
pricing the new ultra drive here is
available in four capacity from 500
gigabyte to 3-tier buy with the
suggested price ranging from $80 to $200
now WD say that the actual street price
will
lower than that and the optional grip
packet cost about $13 each now in my
testing the owner here performed quite
well with the sustain real will and copy
speed of more than 100 megabyte per
second via USB 3.0 it also works with
USB 2.0 come on the drive here check out
my full review at cnet.com basically if
security is a view capacity and the
colors are what you want from your start
device the entre drive here will make
you feel like a kid in a candy store
I recommend it I mean the drive not the
candy because I have very good teeth and
I want to keep my beautiful smile for a
really long time and that's because I'm
W and this has been the first look at
the my passport ultra double D</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
