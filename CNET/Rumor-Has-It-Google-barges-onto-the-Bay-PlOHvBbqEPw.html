has it the show that rounds up the
week's biggest tech rumors you can vote
on what you think about the rumors too
in the interactive player if you're
watching on cnet this week blackberry is
still trying to find a home for itself
and there's something fishy floating in
the San Francisco Bay let's get started
first up blackberry time in order to get
itself out of a jam after years in the
red blackberry officially put itself up
for sale last month so rumors are
swirling as to who could buy up the
smartphone maker the latest rumor comes
from a report in the Wall Street Journal
which says that blackberry sat down last
week with facebook to solicit a buyout
bid if Facebook were to go for it it
likely would be because of blackberry
messenger as opposed to going into the
phone making business mobile messaging
is super important to facebook earlier
this week it upgraded the messenger app
and blackberry recently released a
version of BBM for iOS and Android to
give its messaging app which was once
the gold standard in mobile messaging
more universal appeal so who knows what
Zuckerberg has up his sleeve and who
knows if the seal will ever come to
fruition at all do you think it will let
me know in the comments moving on
there's something weird going on in the
San Francisco Bay cnet had an exclusive
report last week that a company very
likely google has set up shop on
Treasure Island which is between San
Francisco and Oakland and has been
building a large structure made from
cargo containers on a barge some
evidence suggests that it might be a
floating data center including the fact
that Google itself has a patent for such
a concept so that's fine and kind of
boring but then a new report from the
Bay Area CBS affiliate new station
suggests that the floating barge is
actually a google glass door and that
the plan might be to tow it into San
Francisco's fort mason for some
indeterminate time um what the barge
even has its own Twitter feed with a
description that says you might think
you know what I am but you're wrong and
there's a second barge that's been
spotted in Portland Maine and both the
main ball
charge and the San Francisco barge are
owned by the same company so spooky an
anonymous tipster called Cena to let us
know that he had heard from multiple
sources at Google that the company plans
to float the glass stores from city to
city by rivers and that the idea for the
project came straight from either larry
page or Sergey Brin Google's founders
double what floating Google glass doors
be sure to take your Dramamine when you
head out to buy your google glass so you
don't barf all over the displays but in
all seriousness or as serious as you can
get when talking about a top secret
barge I really doubt it's a google glass
door for one thing it looks like a giant
floating box not a place where consumers
would want to try on nerdy glasses and
another thing there aren't any windows
I'm placing my money on it being a data
center but what do you guys think what
could possibly be floating in the bay
would you visit a google glass store
that floats don't forget to vote in our
poll and leave a comment that's our show
