technology when it launched its phantom
three quad copters but to keep that lead
you have to offer more than models for
enthusiasts enter the phantom 3 standard
an entry-level model that's as easy to
use as its pricier line mates but with a
streamlined feature set originally $800
DJI cut the price to 500 for its 10th
anniversary with no end date set for the
promotion at that price it's hard not to
recommend this little quad for anyone
wanting to explore aerial photography
setup couldn't be easier the battery
gets about 20 minutes of flight time the
built-in camera produces good results
and DJI includes an 8 gig microSD card
to get you started download the Go app
and connect your device to the
controller and you've got your view from
the camera flight and system data and
control over the camera and settings the
controller here doesn't have the range
or the extra controls of the higher-end
models which is the biggest corner cut
it also lacks the visual positioning
system of the others that makes it
easier to fly indoors without GPS there
are a few other features lost along the
way to get the price down but no real
deal breakers at its lower price and you
still get DJ eyes intelligent flight
options including Waypoint navigation
and Follow Me modes it might be the
company's entry-level model but it
doesn't fly like</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
