today we're giving a first look for the
Apple iPod Nano the seventh generation
iPod Nano it's $149 gives you 16
gigabytes of capacity this is the first
iPod Nano to use a kind of iPod Touch
style touchscreen design Apple
introduced the touchscreen to the iPod
Nano last year with a squared off
clip-on watch style iPod Nano this time
they've elongated the design so that
it's more of a I phone iPod Touch look
they've added a home button to the
bottom to give it that again that a I
pod touch iPhone kind of operation but
otherwise it's kind of what you'd expect
from an iOS ish kind of device it's not
running iOS it's running its own unique
iPod Nano software there's some new
features though you get video playback
on this now
so if you wanted to watch video on a 2.5
inch screen you now have that ability
the other big feature that they've added
on here is wireless Bluetooth audio then
the big one that we've been asking for
for the Nano even arguably something
like the shuffle there's a lot of
freedom there if you can break the cable
of the headphones and be able to use
wireless headphones or be able to use
this with a wireless speaker another
change here is the Apple is using their
lightning port connection on here the
same one that they're using on the new
iPod touch and the new iPhone 5 it's a
change for a lot of people that means
it's going to break compatibility with
accessories like speaker docks or in car
stereo speakers that you've got hooked
up so if you're going to buy this expect
that you're gonna have to buy some new
accessories too or just find a way to
get maybe get a Bluetooth speaker or
something to replace those old docking
accessories used to have another slight
changes that Apple has upgraded their
headphones to these new ear pod design
headphones it's a slightly different fit
I find it slightly less comfortable
actually because it's an all plastic
design the plastic is against your ears
you get a little bit better audio
quality but not that much I think if you
really are using this as a fitness mp3
player you're probably going to want to
invest in some rugged more fitness
friendly headphones than these another
thing I was kind of disappointed in is
the Apple didn't include the inline
remote on these headphones which would
be great if you
want to change tracks without having to
look at your mp3 player they do meet you
halfway though one of the new design
elements here on the Nano is that
they've included a button right on the
rocker switch right in between the
volume up and volume down that you can
use as a play/pause button or if you
hold it down you can get that voice over
information you can even use it to
navigate between different playlists
without having to look at the ipod nano
still would have been cool to have that
on a headphone remote all in all though
this is just kind of the classic
features we'd expect from an iPod but at
a hundred and fifty dollars it's a bit
of a stretch especially when you think
that's something like the iPod shuffle
here it's going to be just fifty dollars
you really are kind of into the fitness
thing fifty dollars and something you
can just clip on your clothes it's going
to be a better solution for you probably
than this one hundred and fifty dollar
glass-covered device add another fifty
dollars you can go up to one hundred
ninety-nine dollars you can get apples
fourth generation ipod touch and you're
going to get a ton more features Wi-Fi
compatibility airplay email calendar a
lot more bang for your buck going with
the iPod Touch for $199 and that same 16
gigabyte capacity there you go that's a
first look at the Apple iPod Nano the
seventh generation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
