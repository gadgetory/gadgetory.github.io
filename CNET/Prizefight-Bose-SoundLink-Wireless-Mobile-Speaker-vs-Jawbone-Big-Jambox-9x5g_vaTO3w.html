I'm Brian Tommy and this is a prize
fight between two of the top bluetooth
wireless speaker it surprised why I put
out between the Bose Soundlink wireless
speaker and the big Jambox by jawbone
our judges for this fight are senior
editor Donald give'em Hal Bell and
myself Brian the thong song Tom that
will take both judges scores and average
them out to the nearest tenth each round
the final prize my score will be an
average of all rounds using the same
system it's a four around Throwdown
showdown
first up is design Bose brings a very
safe design to the table with silver
accents on the edges that won't really
Wow Donald thinks his toaster has more
personality but the leather cover that
flips into a stand is a nice touch with
its slimmer body Jawbone's big jambox
brings back its familiar design with a
bigger form factor that still brings a
modern sense of design and is one of the
most unique looking speakers you'll see
the big Jambox strikes first with the
floor and the Bose Soundlink gets a two
point five next round is sound in
science now if we're talking speakers
sound quality matters the Bose Soundlink
creates a great sound for its size but
it has a flatter sound and its highs
just aren't as distinct bottom line we
really expected more
now the big jambox can get a lot louder
but the sound starts to break up a
little at full blast it has a fuller
sound range with crisper ahyes that
sound better side-by-side with the Bose
it's live audio feature also creates a
simulated 3d audio experience that
enhances your music and it made my
listing more enjoyable now neither of
these will ever replace a home stereo
system but Jawbone's big Jambox takes
another round with a 3.5 and the bose
sound lead gets a 2.5 so after two
rounds the big Jambox leads by more than
a full point next round is features
the Bose Soundlink is really a simple
straightforward device you can play your
music over Bluetooth or with the
auxilary cable provided and that's it it
has the built-in Cover stand standard
buttons for volume up and down and
bluetooth pairing but I wasn't lying
when I said it's simple
now the jawbone big Jambox chills it
when it comes to features there's
playback over Bluetooth and an auxilary
input plus we're fans of the physical
track skipping and play and pause
buttons on the speaker itself but the
jam box can also act as a speakerphone
when connected over bluetooth for phone
calls hey what's up baby
it's Brian Brian tom from Cena and it
can be loaded with specific audio and
dialing apps and there's unique
integration with both Android and iOS
devices this is a feature freak of
nature and the big jambox gets a 4.5 and
the Soundlink gets a 2 jawbone takes
begley but there's still one more round
left to go the final round that decides
it all ends value both of these speakers
retail for 299 dollars which is really
pricey for speakers at this size and the
sound quality you're getting the reality
is that they're solid Wireless options
at half the price
but in this price fight the jawbone big
Jambox manages to squeeze everything
possible into its modern blocky body and
ultimately gives you more bang for your
buck with better sound quality and more
features and functionality jawbone takes
the final round with the 3 and the sound
link gets a tune so let's average out
all four rounds and in a prize fight
that we thought would be much closer
jawbone won every single round of
Bo's and the big Jambox takes this
battle 3.8 to 2.3 and is your prize
fight Ritter
I'm Brian Todd thanks for watching I'll
catch you guys next time
on another prize fight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
