hear is that incoming sketch beat I
cringe instantly brian has good
knowledge and good subjects that he
covers but it's old real quick when he
starts trying to act cool or whatever he
wants to call it Brian you would have to
have a girlfriend in the first place to
break up this exotic chicken really
hates apple bra bra cut that streak out
of yo hair cut that streak at a yo hair
cut that streak out of your hair you a
grown-ass man you a grown-ass man this
dude has no chill single forever isn't
he sick of his fashion already get a
makeover already you look so dated I
used to love this show but the crew
childish and immature humor has really
turned me off damn dude working out much
coming from a straight male you look
good you are good you look good keep
stackin keep stacking keep stacking
what's stacking why does he look like a
skunk nick is kind of cute just saying
thanks brother

you used to love apple as much as most
of us I think the apple byte should get
a new host and you could go do you
android thing we need a real Apple fan I
cannot stand brian Tong thank you to all
of you who have continued to support the
apple byte over the years due to the
overwhelming constructive criticism
directed towards Brian the pummeling of
his self-esteem has turned him into a
shell of the man he used to be the apple
byte will take a break and return in
2016 Brian chose to do this fully nude</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
