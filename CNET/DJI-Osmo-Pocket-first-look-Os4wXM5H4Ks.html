also makes a line of gimbal cameras
called the Osmo now it is just announced
the Osmo pocket it is the smallest
camera i've seen on a three axis gimbal
it shoots 4k video and 30 frames per
second or 60 frames per second and can
shoot in full HD at 120 frames per
second for slow motion video now that's
all like the basic specs stuff but
what's really remarkable about this
camera is its size it is small it's a
little bit bigger than a USB Drive and
smaller than a hot dog so somewhere in
there is the size of this camera and
most of it is actually just the battery
and a screen and the controls the camera
itself is pretty much the size of a
quarter so you're talking very small
camera here so it is indeed pocket-sized
you just take it out and it turns on in
just a few seconds and it's ready to go
it just stabilizes and you're ready to
shoot slide up and you got follow mode
which is a standard one where the camera
stays level no matter what you do
there's a tilt lock mode that keeps the
camera locked in place and then with if
you tilt it down it stays locked on that
one position and then there's a new fpv
mode which is a first-person view mode
that gives the camera some role when
you're moving so having this little
screen on the camera itself is great
it's touch screen so you can get to
almost all of the functions in the
camera but if you want a bigger
experience you can connect an iPhone or
an Android phone up to the camera itself
flip around this little adapter on front
it comes in either lightning or USBC and
you can just connect your phone directly
to the camera and you're ready to shoot
with a bigger view of what you're
shooting and other capabilities like
switching all of the camera modes so you
can access all the shot modes on the
side here and change all kinds of
settings and then there's even an
on-screen joystick that lets you tilt
the camera head wherever you want to get
it so you can get just the shot you want
one of the big features the Osmo pocket
has is a new story mode where you can
just tap and create really short clips
and stitch them all together
automatically so you can share them on
social you are getting a lot of camera
in a little package and it doesn't
haven't been scary price it's three
hundred and fifty dollars u.s. and it'll
be available in mid-december but it's
available for pre-order now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
