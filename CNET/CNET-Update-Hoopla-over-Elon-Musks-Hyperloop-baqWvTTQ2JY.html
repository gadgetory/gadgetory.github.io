about the Hyperloop I'm Bridget Carey
and this is your cnet update give it
about 10 to 15 years and we could be
traveling between cities at super high
speeds and clear tubes at least that's
the concept being pitched by Elon Musk
the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX he and his
team released a 57-page outline of the
proposed Hyperloop system which are
shotgun like tubes that use
electromagnetic energy to accelerate
pods of passengers up to 800 miles per
hour passengers would get from San
Francisco to LA in 30 minutes whereas
normally it takes about five and a half
hours or so to drive by car if you're
thinking about the intro to futurama
well it's not exactly like that people
would be sitting down and the g-forces
felt would be similar to writing in an
airplane but it's not subject to
turbulence this is just a proof of
concept being shared because musk says
he has to focus his resources on Tesla
and SpaceX but the entrepreneur shared
this report in the hopes that someone
would be encouraged to take on the
project so how much could it cost to
build musk says six billion dollars to
connect LA in San Francisco which is ten
times less than the cost of the proposed
California high-speed rail project
Facebook updated its mobile website and
apps with new tricks you can make
restaurant reservations and look up TV
show listings on some brand pages
Facebook is busy trying all sorts of
things to keep you on the app it just
bought a company that does
speech-to-speech translation so give it
a few months and maybe we'll just talk
to our phones to post a status update
and listen to comments if you wish your
television had a little more curve
Samsung officially unveiled its 55-inch
curved OLED TV it'll sell in the US for
nine thousand dollars that price is
going to sting LG because it began
selling its curved OLED for 15 grand
you've seen OLED displays and Samsung
smartphones but as for the curve they
say it's supposed to make for a more
immersive
viewing experience or maybe it's just
something cool to show off to your
friends and oddly enough neither company
is selling a non curved OLED TV in the
US if you want the xbox one but you
don't care for the kinect microsoft is
reversing its stance and now it says the
new game system will not require the
connect to be attached the kinect will
still come included in the box there was
some pushback from people who didn't
like the idea of a camera and microphone
sensor always being connected in their
living room and some just didn't care to
use the Kinect but keep in mind the
Kinect can always just be turned off if
it weird you out that's your tech news
update you can read up on more details

New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
