isn't wowed by three-sixty video and its
devices like LG's 360 cam that are going
to let more people in on the action out
of the box there's a lot to like about
this $200 point-and-shoot spherical
camera it's small for one and once you
put in a micro SD card you can take
quick photos and videos with ease and
when you're done it stores in this case
that doubles as a handle paired with an
android or iOS device in LG's 360 cam
manager app you can do much more though
like preview your shot change camera
settings including shutter speed and
white balance turn on a self timer and
even shoot with just one lens like a
regular wide-angle camera after that you
can head to the gallery to see the
results but that's where things break
down a bit to view anything you have to
download to your phone first and from
there you can share them but only as a
flat equiangular view unless you upload
your photos to Google Street View or
your video to YouTube and Facebook
there's also no simple way to edit the
clips before you do basically LG did
well with the capture part but still has
some work to do with what comes after</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
