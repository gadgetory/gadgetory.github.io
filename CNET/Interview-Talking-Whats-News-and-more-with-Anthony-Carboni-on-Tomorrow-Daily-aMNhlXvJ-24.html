a man about town i would say you've seen
him font yeah yeah you've seen him on
the sony e3 coverage you probably saw
the playstation coverage it was really
amazing with Meredith molinari yes he
does a show on the new comic con HQ
channel called what's news that's
hilarious and fun and we'll keep you up
to date on all the geeky news he's also
a an award-winning podcaster with his
podcast we have concerns with somebody
else some other guy I don't know who
it's anthony carboni hi guys thanks for
stopping by we've been trying to get on
the show forever and you're not avoiding
my such a bon vivant down it's true it's
so hard to pin me down you have that
little 1960 suitcase that you carry with
you all the time has just got all your
world my sample tasteful brushes great
perfect because when you do three
internet shows you also have to sell
brushes tomatoes that's am sure probably
on snapchat oh what's news is awesome
thank you it's really fun thank you yeah
the thing that I've always dreamed of
like a Weekend Update or a daily show
for the things that I love ya nerds we
really do we want to be that sort of
thing like a daily show or last week
tonight for fandom culture you know at
for people who are really cuz when you
watch things on network TV or even even
on something like an e or a sci-fi when
they try to do a news show that's for
fandom culture you know they don't get
as they can't get as kind of deep into
it and is nerdy about it doesn't really
feel kind of condescending a lot of the
time yes cuz it's like you don't know
it's from like network people were like
this just feels like they have a
stereotype in their head of old school
like revenge of the nerds nerds and they
are like this doesn't sound like nerds
like nerds are the terrible and like
they're you know they live in their
mom's basement and all this stuff and
then you end up with all these weird
like tropes that people go for a lot of
a lot of is anybody gonna get this and
it's like yes millions and more people
are going to get your watching this way
you don't get it trust me it'll go over
great so that's why it's kind of great
to be doing this we do it with attack
media so that's Kevin perera's
production company and all the way down
it's just people who know and love
this stuff and so that's been kind of
the most exciting thing for me is it's
not something where i went in and i read
a script and i was like oh no yeah i'll
do it because i want this to be good but
it's not going to be good you know this
is a really really great shown we have a
lot of fun doing it even when Jeff comes
by I got a giant amount of what they
classified as Griffin poop dropped on me
yep it was our field reporter he was our
field reporter from Azeroth yes which
was great that happens all the time in
Azeroth miss my eye I mean I've been
playing wow for a long time and I seem
to recall a lot of uh yeah a lot of
Griffin poop and I also i also played
apocalypse so i got painted blue yep I
feel like that no Berlin Audi yes okay

like a little high my emails just a
didn't post yeah it's easy way is that
in post um okay so because I know Jeff
won't bring it up because he's very
humble let's talk about what we have
concerns it's juggle quality okay how
long he's known for his humbleness and
his biceps two things he's knows well
how long have you guys been doing we
have concerns been a while we are I will
say we are about to hit our 300th
episode yes oh sorry oh I don't know
what I don't know you asking i am asking
that's the way this goes right now yeah
I don't we all changed we're at Laura
like 295 right now Johnny seven just
came out today no yeah surely not but we
do three episodes a week yeah I'm so
that means we've been doing it for a
little over a little over two years yeah
Wow and we were podcast award or me and
Anthony didn't you win a podcaster yeah
hey talks about that we need i'm not i'm
not here to besmirched the good name of
the podcast awards there was some
confusion as to whether or not we want
and I'm not gonna get one but we want we
want it is official yeah you know we
paid a lot of pee in the entertainment
category had so many checks for 25 cents
yeah it was a lot I said all you know I
took all the revenue that you get from
making a podcast from the government yes
cuz when you make a podcast back
government podcast oh yeah yeah porn
yeah yeah no uh so yeah we won that we
got when the year we started 2014 we got
an apple best new podcast award nice
we're on their new to podcasting listen
it's great I think it's a particularly
for people who watch this show I think
it will I think it will really appeal
what's very complimentary in terms of
you about science science and blood
future stuff you guys talk about you
know like word like we have concerns
about this thing or robotics or people
living in virtual reality or whatever it
is that like you guys you know riff
about it kind of complements there yeah
we nice companion pieces to one other
because we've actually we've covered
stuff on we have concerns that you guys
have covered at the same week here but
you know where as you guys kind of go
more into like the nuts and bolts of it
we're kind of just like robots spiders
creeped me out and here's why you know
we kind of got like something that I was
thinking about this week is you know an
example of a good we have concerns story
would be big dog Boston robotics big dog
we all kind of looked at big dog and we
were like that's kind of silly and
stupid and hilarious and you could kick
it and it like comes back but we're not
afraid of it and then last week they
added a head back onto my spot and now
it's terrifying it is it is it although
watching is the monetary feels is pretty
great yeah but that's they threw that at
the end to humanize it yeah that's what
I think it through it on the L better
yeah yeah it's fine you he's very hard
that won't kill us it'll kill you
probably is watching I was waiting to me
the head was very sharp and that was the
thing that worries me I'm like that head
looks like it's gonna puncture my skin
in my dear major give it a mouth yeah it
looks like a sacrificial RAM skull or
something like you would see like in
Temple of Doom yeah like that's the
scary thing it's like dead oh we're
almost like nightmare before christmas
like stop motion it is funny yeah that's
right or it looks like what is
underneath my dog's skin because i have
two italian grace sometimes I look
exactly like haha um how that's my
peeler pan tomate good
do that how long have you been doing
hosting stuff how long have you been
doing this and what made you get into it
I guess since around to 2008-2009 i
moved i moved to new york to be an actor
because that's what you do when you're
in your 20s sure to New York to be an
actor and then I kind of fell into the
kind of the comedy scene there and then
hosting things there because next new
networks was just getting started and
like a lot of you know my damn channel
and a lot of these like video platforms
were starting up and I just kind of fell
into it because a lot of friends were
doing it I started with a show about
indie games called bite jacker in 2009
and that sort of just spring boarded the
whole thing you still have any games I
do have you played inside we're gonna
talk about it later so here's the thing
man oh we're gonna have an inside
discussion here's the thing is that I
still don't have an xbox one and now no
one do you get we happen now that Hank
or pios come in I know what I'm gonna
buy an xbox one now to end by next year
cuz this is the big i know inside inside
is out below is coming before the end of
here like I still haven't played through
sunset overdrive cuphead like there's
all this stuff that I want to play but
now I'm like I'm terrified of buying an
xbox one because what am I gonna do I'm
gonna buy it and then six seven months
from now I'm gonna buy another one let's
see if you bad decision okay there
they're like you do with your phone so
why not just do with your xbox because I
haven't bought the initial xbox yet
right so yes I do upgrade my phone like
every year to two years but I haven't
but if I know that the new phone is
coming in four months I'm gonna way I
that phone like I'm jump ship to an
iphone that's 24 months before a new one
comes out or buy a laptop for months
before the new laptop so it's like wait
but next week I think it's out on pc so
I'll plate a week after everyone and
I've just kind of been like a lot of a
lot I can't hear you all week about it
pretty it's it's simple i'm just gonna
say it's amazing that's right so far so
good I'm really enjoy can't wait I can't
wait I love to limbo I love those guys
yeah really great stuff um so what keep
I keep my elbow keeps creeping in this
is it I'm just showered all departments
it's all good I was like watching it up
language just
I'm sitting like this and answering
questions those were cozy i look like i
just got let out of the the shelter
where i've been living for 15 years
against my will just like thank you i'm
glad to be here so glad to see the
sunlight and sit fake sent lights yeah
what's it like working with this guy oh
well it's the worst and i think we can
talk about that because we are we both
have similar experiences and we don't
hate each other I have a real mutual
hatred but also respect there I know
it's great I you know when we started we
have concerns Jeff and I both did shows
for revision 3 and that's how we knew
each other is like we we got to do
videos together twice in the whole time
that we both worked for revision three
so when I moved to LA I was like we
should do something and so we just
recorded a podcast to see if we could
stand each other kind of sure yeah I
didn't think of it that way you're going
to work together you know like how would
I know where mystery yeah it was a good
stand of work to me I get each other I
say you know we were cuz you know what
it is you know why I say that you know I
say that cuz he comes off so just so
like square-jawed and all-american and
perfect money--- I'm great yeah I know
so you're worse you're worried that he's
gonna be some kind of dick when you
actually meet him right cuz who can be
this nice and perfect I know I didn't
want to invite him why did I argued
sipirili is he is that nice and trying
for months to get you on the show and
I'm like Jeff hasn't been trying it yeah
Jeff and I see each other multiple times
during the week Jeff's like yeah
whatever if a year before in another
room together that's fine we do that we
do that a lot already it's true oh man
no it's it's great it's a lot of fun and
I think my favorite things honestly it
you know it's he makes me laugh every
week and it's always fun yeah when we
kind of um you know we picked it we
picked doing it in a way that's that
very much a lot of people don't do
podcast so we do we do 15 minutes three
times a week yeah 3 15 minute episodes
because it was kind of like well how are
we going to work together and how what
would we like to see in podcasts because
you already do 17 hours of podcast a
week I think yeah that was kind of like
am i limited by law but no and that was
actually Anthony's idea he was very very
adamant about like let's make short
shows that are easily digestible if some
of
on a commute they can put it in a list
of the whole thing they don't have to
you know have a two hour marathon of
elbow and that's our America it's the
other great thing about audio can't see
them I'm constantly elbowing jack well
we're doing video doing video now yes
started doing video um so we're gonna
I'm gonna wrap things up yeah right this
is this is almost too much you guys I
