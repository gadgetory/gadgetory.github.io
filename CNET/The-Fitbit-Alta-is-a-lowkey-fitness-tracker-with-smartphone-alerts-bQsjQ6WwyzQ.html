Fitbit showed off the blaze a fitness
watch with smartphone notifications
what the company didn't show you was the
Fitbit Alta announced today this is the
newest product to join the Fitbit family
it's slim like the Fitbit flex but also
is a nice large screen for showing
information on activity progress along
with incoming calls text messages and
calendar notifications from your phone
the Alta is low key which I like but it
can also be a fashion statement the band
is interchangeable so you can
personalize your look with a lineup of
accessory straps available in different
colors and in both metal and leather
while it doesn't have a heartrate
monitor like on the charge HR the Alta
does include a special move reminder the
band will encourage you to meet a mini
step goal of 250 steps each hour which
Fitbit says is equal to about 2 to 3
minutes of walking so company claims
this could help keep your metabolism up
and reduce the negative impacts of
sitting as for battery life the tracker
is set to last up to 5 days which is the
same as the charge HR but worse than
products from other companies like
Garmin for example the Fitbit Alta is
available now for pre-order for $130 it
will make its way to stores in the US
and March and retail locations around
the globe a month later for more
information check out my article over at
Cena comm I'm Dan Graz never seen it and
that was a first look at the Fitbit Alta</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
