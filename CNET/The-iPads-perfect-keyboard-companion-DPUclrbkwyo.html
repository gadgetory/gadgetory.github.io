docked inside a keyboard case you've
heard that before but you don't know we
see great ones and the Belkin ultimate
keyboard case is one of the best ones
that I've seen the best I've seen since
last year when Logitech had its
ultrathin keyboard cover a very thin
Smart Cover dockable device which was a
very nice backpack friendly keyboard
solution but didn't have any back cover
protection Belkin solution is a full
package so you've got back cover it's
got the keyboard and it's not huge and
thick and weird it feels comfortable
enough that I might consider using it as
my regular iPad case which is saying
something the 99 bucks which is about
the price range that you're gonna pay
for a keyboard case and it has a few
special tricks up its sleeve one is that
it automatically connects and
disconnects with Bluetooth once it
attaches onto a little magnetic strip on
the bottom pretty neat trick and it
saves battery life so when you fold this
thing down into non keyboard mode you
won't be pressing any keys and it makes
it pretty versatile if you want to flip
it shut and open it up again
speaking of which it's got adjustable
angles there were three magnetic strips
here not just one wire three angle is
important well if you're using it on a
desk or any surface or if your lap where
angles matter there's a pretty compact
little keyboard solution sometimes it's
a little hard to to make it fit so the
difference between putting it at this
angle and this angle over here is bigger
than you'd think it can save you some
neck strain I like that if your keyboard
geek that's a big deal and speaking of
keyboard geeks this keyboard does not
make any weird compromises there aren't
any compressed Keys or strange movements
it's a regular keyboard and it's a
little bit compressed because it's got
to fit an iPad I mean if you're used to
touch typing and really used to where
the keys are laid out you're gonna find
yourself adopting this keyboard really
well and it's got a lot of iOS specific
features including hey look a Siri
button so what's not to like about this
case well it's a little plastic e but
you know that's kind of quibbling
because what are you gonna make this
thing out of solid metal and also
there's no backlighting on the keyboard
but no iPad case has backlighting yet
maybe some fancy one coming on the pie
would but for an all-around package
that's compact that's easy to use that
folds up pretty not pretty nice and thin
for a keyboard case and doesn't feel
like the keyboard the keys are
scratching the screen or anything it
feels comfortable to hold automatically
shuts off anyway it doesn't make it a
look a bit like a Chromebook right or a
laptop but hey that's kind of the appeal
right you're turning an iPad into a
laptop the Belkin ultimate keyboard case
is probably my top pick right now and I
like using it I'm Scott Stein and that's
a look at the Belkin ultimate keyboard
case which by the way works with the
iPad 2 3rd gen iPad and 4th gen iPad
sorry 1st gen users</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
