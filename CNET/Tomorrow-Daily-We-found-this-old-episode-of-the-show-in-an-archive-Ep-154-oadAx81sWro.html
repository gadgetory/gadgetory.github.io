about the IBM Simon personal computer
it's a weird little gadget and Sony's
decided to start making consoles along
next to Nintendo so that's weird let's
talk about that we'll talk about that
that is weird and an article I saw in
the newspaper the other day says that no
one's using the Internet I'm not really
I don't barely even know what it is
tomorrow daily
greetings everybody welcome to tomorrow
jelly the only geek talk show on the
internet cuz let's get her head exactly
pretty fresh I mean cnet just launched a
month ago yeah I know it's great that
you know now there's a place for for
tech yeah like God like on this like
thing where people we can like log in
and do stuff like it's pretty cool I'll
weird is a little bit weird but anyway
we're gonna do our new show for you
there are some super bizarre things that
we have to talk about like that Sony
thing is like throwing me I don't even
know where begin with that but let's uh
let's hit the headlines here so IBM has
this really weird I guess it's a phone a
cellular phone but it's it's not it does
other things it's called the IBM Simon
personal computer and they're calling it
a personal digital assistant like a they
said it's PDA is the you have to carry
around a big computer well its kind I
guess like I mean it's kind of a like
little computer with a screen on it so
it's like a celly it's like a cellular
device and we've been hearing about it
for a couple of years but it's finally I
guess we're finally gonna be able to buy
it I mean if you're rich but like it's
about like eight inches long so it's
pretty small yeah that's thing I need
tiny and it only weighs 18 ounces so
it's like a little over a pound which is
super light and you're gonna be able to
like use it to have like Oh your office
in your phone so that yeah like it's
everything on your phone it says that
you can make and receive phone calls you
can use it like a fat yeah but I have a
computer what but they like they said
you could take it with you and like do
your business other places like you
don't need to take your IBM with you
your Macintosh you don't need to take
that with you you can do electronic mail
on this thing and something called
cellular pages which I don't even know
what that is so cellular pages but
that's the battery which is like really
small yeah that's a tiny little battery
but I was expecting him to use like D
batteries or like sees like a few C
batteries but yeah you can like touch it
and there's a pen that you can like pick
things with
but it runs it's not daus though it's
like a graphical user interface they're
saying right I guess I can see how this
be useful for business people like I
guess they have to do work when they're
not at work yeah I mean there's a quote
that I saw attached to this product was
that it take quote takes all the gadget
tree of the modern business executive
and puts it into one unit so that sounds
very fancy yeah that's really strange it
looks it but it's a but it's a phone
yeah it's like a cellular phone it's a
phone that you take and then it connects
to like places and then you make calls
I'll tell you what once i get a cellular
phone then maybe i'll think about
getting something like that what you're
gonna be waiting a long time not a
businessman so i don't need it well
here's the thing bellsouth cellular is
gonna sell these and they're gonna be
really expensive like eight hundred and
ninety-nine dollars with a two-year
contract or a thousand ninety nine
dollars with no contrary he's never
gonna spend that much money on now on a
businessman thing but i mean i get like
all in one knot is fine but how often I
mean I know I send a lot of faxes but
like do I need something to go out and
send like well I'm Howard and about
having my day no I can wait till I get
home and use my computer like you said
in my fax machine talk to people yeah
just pick up the phone and call somebody
yeah so yeah super weird but I mean hey
if you're interested it's supposed to
come out like later this year august i
think they were supposed to release it
in May but then they said no we can't
we're not gonna make that so they said
August yeah you know I can I talk about
another thing that nobody saw coming
yeah so you we all know Sony you know
the guys that make your like your
headphones yeah my woman i go i love my
walk yeah we're walkman um well they
decided to make a video game console
they would like you can play video games
on like a super nintendo yeah like a
superintendent but it's all there's it's
called the it's called the playstation
so it's as the sony playstation oh yeah
what's crazy about it is it's gonna use
discs like cds well did you compact
discs yeah i know i don't know i don't
know how that's gonna work out but I
mean it's not gonna be a cartridge
anymore so now i can have to blow in it
yeah what you but I like to like you
know wave you a drop a card you like I
don't feel it's always safer like we
just see you
you can't scratch a cartridge yeah that
seems pretty good see these are cool I
like yeah I mean they're all right so I
get I guess we'll see but uh yeah we but
it's different than you know the Super
Nintendo and the Sega Genesis so I mean
it's like why why is Sony getting into
this it's so he's weird so it's so
strange we heard about it looks cool
though look at that there were yeah that
looks really perfect unbelievable yeah I
mean I think those are pre-rendered like
I don't think like I don't think that
those are it's like a bug me at the
cycled movie like it's okay I think they
just made it and then they're like okay
this is what we think it's gonna look
like but it won't it won't look like
that it's not gonna look like that do
you think Sony's gonna get like into
movies or something I don't think so I
mean I never heard a while ago like
there was it I don't even know if it's
true or not but we heard like I remember
reading somewhere in like I don't know
like nin 10 don't read somewhere in some
magazine that they were saying that like
oh it's gonna be maybe gamepro like it
was they said something like oh they're
gonna work with Nintendo on a console
but I guess that's not happening anymore
no that's crazy well anyway this all
this sony playstation will be out this
year in Japan I don't get it for free we
have to wait till next year the
playstation playstation or playstation
like place T playstation or playstation
I have no idea what you're talking I'm
sorry I'm just trying to figure out it
for now it's like kind of weird so I one
word so like how do you but I mean that
brings the question I mean obviously
heard how we feel but our topic of the
day is a do you think this will have a
chance you think the PlayStation is that
the sony playstation will have a chance
moving forward with like having it on
cds instead of cartridges and what and
going up against Sega and Nintendo which
I already have a Nintendo I can't afford
cavesson I have a Sega Genesis and a
tenia and Anna Super Nintendo it's like
I don't I don't need another console
like I don't I don't need it oh yeah wow
you're like rich well my parents like
they do the thing where it's like for
Christmas they'll say this one thing is
for all three of you and so it's like
yeah
it's that kind of thing you're gonna get
shows we did well we yell shafted on
that so it's like oh you and your
brother have to share this forever and
then we end up fighting over it it's
terrible um but I don't know I say too
little too late I don't know I don't I
don't it's gonna be tough I mean they're
gonna really have to make something that
we've never seen before I love those
graphics I love the the way it looks it
looks really really real well beyond
real if it's so yeah um I definitely
wanted sony playstation so that'd be fun
next year next year the controller's
weird do you see how many like buttons
it is so many I mean what are you gonna
use them for I don't know like my mind
can't even process that many buttons is
it I mean it well it's kind of close any
SS the little bumpers like they have the
ones on the top yeah but it has the ones
on the bottom and the top yeah that is a
little bit weird we're super weird um so
I gotta talk to you about this article
and I'm curious as to your opinion I saw
this in the new york times in the paper
the other day and I was super kind of
scared because we're doing the show now
with with Cena on the internet and this
article said that no one is actually
using the internet somebody's watching
this I don't think so I don't think
anybody's watching this because in the
new york times they said the internet
might be overhyped because they a lot of
people are saying like Oh 20 to 30
million people around the world they're
using the internet but what I read was a
lot of experts think that number is way
too high they say it's way way way too
high like that it could be ninety
percent less than that's like ten
percent of that amount like two to three
million right yeah no I mean I I mean
like I can't what I use the internet
barely I don't even know how to use like
that got this thing so we get our like
AOL disk or whatever yeah and it you get
like an email an electronic mail but
like who I don't know anybody I don't
want to email anybody really they said
ask your friends for their electronic
mail addresses and I'm like why I talk I
could call them yeah so it doesn't I
don't know but so they said that it
might the problem is is that there's
about they think experts think there's
like two to three million internet hosts
out there and so the argument is how
many people are accessing the internet
from those hosts so they're saying oh
and
in an office building maybe it's ten
people are accessing the internet from
that spot okay but then a lot of other
people are saying no it's more like two
to three yeah like two to three people
are accessing the internet cuz nobody
else is nobody wants in and so a lot of
businesses like people who are trying to
like make their businesses on the
internet I don't know how that works but
I've got a lot to do besides email
people so yeah maybe pen pal business
look at a pen pal business can look at
like places and go on AOL but yeah um
you do chat room so you could talk about
do the chat rooms i go to chat rooms
sometimes ASL guys tell us ASL yeah so
um but yeah I'd like I just I think it's
really weird and they're saying that out
of those two to three million hosts like
a million of them might be like they're
calling it a firewall like it might they
might be firewalled which I guess is
like an electronic so scary it's like an
electronic wall that it keeps out bad
people like hat and they're calling it
hackers say hackers oh so they said oh
this is to keep out bad people but
nobody else can have that internet so
it's there maybe it's only two million
people see men have a firewall I hope so
it sounds really dangerous like I don't
know if we do or not but I mean I feel
like I should ask all right well I guess
not many people are using the Internet
well they said there's no real way they
say there's no real way to know exactly
how many people are using the internet
and that will just have to wait and see
so we might actually like they keep
saying like oh there's gonna be this big
revolution where people are gonna do
everything on the internet but it's like
if this few people are using it like we
might be waiting a really long time I
know if the people don't adapt it I mean
we're not gonna people aren't gonna use
it yeah it's not gonna be very good so
maybe use the internet I try it like try
it I'm sure you I'm sure you've gotten
an AOL floppy disk and you're in your
mailbox yes I think it's kind of a fun
hobby like I kind of just mess around
with it sometimes yeah we have an
electronic mail at the show which is
pretty cool we'll talk about that yeah
we'll get to that later so well let's do
a quick break and then a commercial
break and then we're gonna come back and
we have a summer movie preview or really
