understand your hand gestures that
touchless interface is possible with a
new controller from San Francisco
startup leap motion inside the device
there are two cameras and some infrared
LEDs and those are projecting a light
onto the hand and that video is getting
sent to the computer where our software
analyzes it and extracts the 3d
information instead of clicking on an
object with a mouse or touching a screen
you can point to it with your finger in
Google Maps users zoom in and out by
moving their hand up and down that could
prove easier than clicking on tiny
control buttons you know you can do all
this with a keyboard mouse but you know
you wouldn't be able to do it nearly as
fluidly the controller can't track your
every move gestures must be within two
feet of the device but in that zone the
technology is remarkably accurate so
this is a one centimeter square that I'm
zooming in on in space so you can see
even this one centimeter square and stay
incredibly precise at eighty dollars the
controller is affordable but what can
you do with it roughly 75 apps are
available to start with a heavy emphasis
on games like drop chord a puzzle game
and block 54 which presents Jenga like
challenges this is really something that
you couldn't do with a mouse or keyboard
right because it uses all the data that
the controller provides and it captures
every little jitter of your fingers
there are educational and drawing
offerings to don't expect a lot of
productivity apps however leap motion
says it's not out to replace the
keyboard or mouse everyone has a desktop
or a laptop and these are very powerful
machines but people only use one percent
of them we're hoping that we can let
them use the other ninety-nine percent
to learn a musical instrument or play a
game or build something one potential
hurdle users face is having to remember
various gestures there definitely is a
learning curve as you go from app to app
because even though our philosophy is
about
making the interaction as close to real
life as possible every developer is
approaching it in a slightly different
way the technology will also be embedded
in laptops down the road leap motion is
partnering with HP and Asus still the
bigger question is will consumers buy
applications for yet another platform
when there are so many others competing
for their money in San Francisco I'm
