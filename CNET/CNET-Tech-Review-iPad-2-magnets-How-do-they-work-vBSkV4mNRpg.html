inside an electric rolls-royce at the
Geneva Auto Show lovable lizards get
animated in il M's new Rango two sets of
speakers that you're better off without
oh and some stuff about a new iPad or
something like that it's all coming up
right now
hi everyone I'm Hollywood and welcome to
the CNET tech review where we collect
our hottest videos of the week and tell
you what's good and what's bad in the
world of tech plus offer some unique
tech wisdom in the form of the bottom
line let's get started with the good
this week in San Francisco Steve Jobs
though Who am I kidding you're just here
to see the iPad 2 here's Donald Bell's
first look hey i'm donald bell for
cnet.com we're here at Apple's iPad 2
launch event and I'm holding the iPad 2
in fact I'm holding the white version of
the iPad 2 there's now two colors a
white version and a black version all
the same prices all the same capacities
as last year's but you're now getting
much thinner design a lighter design and
also getting a faster processors there's
there's a dual-core a5 processor in here
it's promising nine times the graphics
performance of the original iPad you're
also getting a few new features you're
getting a FaceTime feature for video
calling
you get HD cameras on the back and a VGA
camera on the front Apple is also
announcing two new applications for the
iPad their own applications ones iMovie
for the iPad which was available before
on the iPhone and the iPod Touch it's
now coming through the iPad is the most
sophisticated version or at least the
most sophisticated mobile version of
iMovie we've seen yet the other
application the Apple announced today
for the iPad is GarageBand this is going
to be a pretty cool application out
there for you musical types does
multitrack recording virtual instruments
a lot of fun we're gonna see this thing
March 11th so having played on off the
iPad 2 the little bit that I've had to
hear I have to say the thing I like
about it the most is how thin and light
apples be able to get the design having
seen a lot of their competitors this
past year I haven't seen anything that's
gotten this small and I think be able to
preserve that 10 hour battery life is a
big deal it's gonna be hard to be able
to keep up with that so for cnet.com I'm
Donnell Bella showing off the Apple iPad
2
I think everyone was a bit surprised to
see Steve Jobs take the stage for the
iPad 2 announcements but he did turn the
spotlight over to some other members of
the Apple team to demo some of the
tablets key apps take a look at FaceTime
iMovie and GarageBand all optimized for
iPad 2 FaceTime is the best and easiest
way to videoconference we supported on
the iPhone and we supported on the iPod
Touch and now we're bringing it to the
iPad you can FaceTime between two iPads
between an iPad and an iPhone or an iPod
Touch and between an iPad and a Mac let
me go ahead and just give you a demo so
it's calling him in a second he'll
answer how you doing doing great Scott
how's it going oh that's going great I
was just giving everyone here a demo of
FaceTime you can see already that the
size of the iPad is just ideal for video
conference and the person's face is a
great size you can see all their
expressions it feels very personal you
can also use both the front camera and
the rear camera so Michael why don't you
flip to the rear camera and show us what
you're looking at sure thanks guy
okay Michael's been locked in a tree
they very sad cafe you can also move the
the pip around to get it out of the way
so it's sort of pong you can move it
wherever you want but FaceTime on this
really is a great experience and we
can't wait for Phil to get their hands
on it and of course from day one you can
FaceTime from your iPad too with all the
iPhone 4 customers out there thanks a
lot Michael so there's two apps we're
introducing today and the first one is
iMovie for iPad and we have a long
history of video editing we are the
largest supplier of video editing
software in the world we think and
iMovie for iPad is in that tradition
it's got a precision editor on it
multitrack audio recording this is not a
toy you can really edit movies on this
thing it's got new themes you can
airplay your video right to Apple TV
from the application you can share your
videos in HD with some really popular
sites and it's a universal app so it
will also run in the iPhone when we
start up the app you can see our really
nice new home screen with the old-time
theater really gorgeous display here you
can see each of your projects has its
own little poster there's a thumbnail of
the movie and the poster is based on the
theme that's in the project you can just
scroll back and forth between these
works great and portrait it also works
really nicely in landscape and this
looks really great on the Retina display
of the iPhone 4 and the iPod Touch as
well
let's go ahead and do a little bit of
editing so I'm going to scroll down here
now I can actually use there's a camera
button on the right that I can use to
they use the camera of the iPad 2 to
record directly in the timeline or I can
go for my video bin now I can just press
and hold on a clip and I can skim my
finger back and forth to take a look at
the video before it's been placed into
the timeline or I can just tap on a clip
and then I get two handles so I can
actually choose the segment of the video
that I want to put in and we have two
different Clips here I'll put in a piece
of that one select the second clip
another shot of that the girl going in
the water so we'll
kind of a corresponding position there
tap that drops into the timeline and
we've got a cross dissolve between if we
want to do a more precise edit for the
iPad - we have a precision editor so I
can do a reverse pinch apart bring up
the precision editor and now I can see
all the content of the clip on the left
before and after the Edit and all the
content for the clip on the right I also
have full control over the transition I
can double tap and we can set that to
none so that'll make a cut I can press
and hold on the top dot and that allows
me to choose the point within that video
where we want to end so we'll pick a
spot kind of where she goes out over the
water then I can press and hold on the
lower dot and do the same thing so we
can make this kind of look like just a
cut in the same shot I can press and
hold on the center dot as well and I can
roll the edit I can add and subtract
frames from both sides simultaneously
when I want to take a look we just back
up a little bit and hit play
really easy to keep going and adjust
your edits to get things just the way
that you want and with a pinch we close
it up
Raj ban for iPad is remarkable
it's got touch instruments you can plug
in a guitar and play real instruments if
you want but it's got touch instruments
that I think are gonna be a huge hit
with our users guitar amps and effects
8-track recording and mixing over 250
loops you can add to your songs you can
email files around of your song to
anybody and it's compatible with the Mac
version so if you want to start
something on your iPad and finish it on
the Mac no problem a launch GarageBand
and the first thing you see is an
instrument browser so these are all the
touch instrument Steve just mentioned
and you can just swipe to tap through
them and it's incredible they turn the
iPad itself you know musical instrument
that you can play wherever you go now go
ahead and bring up a keyboard to start
showing this off and you can see this
beautiful grand piano comes up and it
fills the display and the keyboards not
just a grand piano I can tap on that
icon right in the middle there and you
can see all the sounds that are built in
there are organs
electric piano clavinet look at this a
whole bunch of great synthesizers that
are really really fun to play well iPad
has an accelerometer built in and we use
that to measure the force that my finger
strikes the display so garage man knows
if I tap something really soft or really
hard and we use that throughout the app
and that lates lets us create these
instruments that are incredibly
expressive and and fun to play a lot of
these smart instruments have this auto
play dial and I can just go ahead and
dial up a pattern the strings fade away
now I have these big bars so the only
decision I make is which chord do I want
to play and look what happens with one
touch of a finger when I tap on one of
these chords
let's choose any chord
that cool so that's just a quick look at
GarageBand for iPad it turns your iPad
into a complete recording studio and a
collection of these incredible touch
instruments and we just can't wait to
hear all the creative things that people
are gonna do once they get this in their
hands
Thank You GarageBand for iPad $4.99
editing videos and composing music on
the iPad pretty cool
hello I guess I can't help thinking it
would be a little easier if the screen
was bigger although be sure to come back
next week when the iPad 2 goes on sale
and Donald will have an in-depth review
meanwhile over in Switzerland the 2011
Geneva Auto Show open this week and
Bryan coolly was on hand to peruse the
new production models and concept cars
there were plenty of plugins and hybrids
on the show floor but not necessarily
where you'd expect to find them
check out these highlights yeah it's far
from the biggest outie but it's got a
lot of good stuff in it this is the new
Audi a3 concept being rolled out just
now here at Geneva not that far out
there so I get excited about concepts
like this because they might actually
make it to showrooms more or less intact
so let's see what's going on I'm not
gonna bore you with all the damn design
speak about harmonious fluid lines and
fenders that hint at the power that lies
between them which sounds kind of
obscene anyway but there is a two and a
half liter turbocharged gas direct
injection engine 408 horsepower 368
foot-pounds of torque gets hip 216 about
4 seconds and a tiny fraction while
doing 28 miles per gallon so although
that's kind of great but what's inside
the cabin is a whole lot more
interesting inside there's a revised
version of audi's MMI and includes the
touchpad that is currently only found on
the a8
there's an 8 inch LCD that pops up
ultra-thin out of the middle of the dash
built-in wireless broadband is
envisioned to bring Google services into
the car on screen or screens as well as
creating a Wi-Fi hotspot for the
passengers iPad holders in the rear of
the front headrests and check out these
speakers on the rear deck these things
pop up a few millimeters when you power
up the system just to say I'm cool this
is the FM the Ferrari FF it stands for
for passenger four-wheel drive and they
don't even have a letter for what's
about to approach you right there in the
rear end that my friends is a hatchback
this is what they call a Shooting Brake
a station wagon in Euro terms now this
vehicle is gonna slot in to replace the
612 Scaglietti which is their current
high in two plus two biggest Ferrari
engine ever in a production car 6.3
liter v12 651 horsepower 504 foot-pounds
of torque
typically drives the rear wheels
primarily that's why we have this
enormous trans axle back here at times
when it wants to apply power to the
front for better performance better
handling you've got this sort of
two-speed Haldex gearbox underneath the
front of the drive sump on this guy that
allows this car to a torque vectoring
method when it detects slip this stuff
kicks in it applies power to the front
if it doesn't it remains a rear-wheel
drive car in the sporting tradition this
is rather a nice place to do business
wouldn't you say we've got an actual
mechanical or analog tech notice on the
right side I've got a split screen of
two cameras here's our Ferrari head unit
this can be a 1200 watt system with gobs
of surround sound speakers I don't need
to convince you that it sounds good oh
just see in the back fitted luggage is
available as well including two full
sets of golf clubs and some nice-looking
releases now pricing and availability is
not yet set on the FF although I see
some potential customers milling around
uh that looks like Nick Mason and Pink
Floyd over there so they'll get the
regulars in first these may not be in
ready supply of her quietly
well you know when you see the Spirit of
Ecstasy illuminated an electric blue
some things happening at Rolls Royce the
something is the electrification of the
phantom this is an experimental phantom
the 102 E X an experimental platform to
make one of these guys all
battery-powered the engine came out that
was the 6.7 liter v12 and in goes 96
batteries of a very sort of complex
chemistry nickel cobalt manganese I've
not actually heard of that before that
gives you 270 kilowatts of power it's
about 360 horsepower but 590 potential
foot-pounds of torque
0-60 can happen about eight seconds
that's slower by over two seconds than a
gas engine phantom but still not a
slouch the power goes out down to the
back where the electric motors live and
they split it up to the rear wheels only
via a differential almost a quaint
traditional set up range of this guy
about a hundred and twenty miles they
say they hope they will figure out
because this is a testbed for use
throughout the year ahead oh by the way
charging time on this despite the
massive number of batteries in here they
say would be industry standard about
eight hours for a full charge on a 223
phase circuit now inside I had a bourbon
I'd get my mail forwarded here where was
I oh yeah inside we've got some more
indications this is a very different
vehicle here is a charge state indicator
echoing the lights that are over there
at the charging port oh by the way if
this little Smuggler's bin of key little
tech switches is not enough for you
you'll love this one there's a
traditional analog clock there's the
very non traditional LCD display and
that is by the way specific to the
electric version of this car torquey
emissions free avant-garde technology
although that's great but what really
intrigues me is that these cars are
already as quiet as the day after you
died and that's where the v12 barnburner
up in front imagine what it would be
like with a virtually silent electric
powertrain you just want to curl up in
these are not for sale like I'm interest
is a one-off electric prototype but
they're gonna be testing it and testing
it hard through 2011 who knows there may
be a real one one nation look if you
didn't have one of these yourself you
know somebody who did the VW Rabbit
slash golf Cabrio this thing sold like
mad from 79 to 2002 then it got bumped
off the stage by its two drop-top
siblings the New Beetle convertible and
the EOS drop-top but now it's back
although not yet for the US this guy's
going to offer a choice of six power
plants in Europe one of them is a 1.6
liter turbo diesel that delivers 53
miles per gallon and no hybrid isset II
involved the top is interesting it's a
ragtop in the true sense not a
retractable that keeps the price down
but as you can see when it's down it
almost violates the definition of a
Cabriolet which normally infers a
convertible that leaves its top
apparatus kind of untidily piled back
here but this is almost flush with the
belt lines another big question when
this is down what happens to the trunk
we've seen some cars lately had seen
that car tech that are a joke when the
top is down let's find out
tilt the logo handle not bad look at
that it's almost like magic and yes
there is a lowered ceiling on the trunk
all the time but that makes room for the
top to go down and not change your
volume back here which is kind of good
I'd rather have a little less room all
the time
then nasty surprises when the tops down
some of the time now again this cars not
slotted for us distribution just yet I'm
not going to quote prices in Europe
because it doesn't equate that way on a
simple currency conversion but we'll see
if they can bring this to the US and
maybe send the Aeons happy
well if the golf does make it to the US
a whole new generation of high school
girls can look forward to some sweet
gifts for their 16th birthday all right
the time has come for us to take a break
but we will be right back with more tech
review right after this
welcome back to the sina tech review our
weekly video digest of all things good
and bad we've seen here at CNET TV
continuing on in the good it's time to
go to the movies or more accurately it's
time to go behind the scenes of the
movies
Daniel Tournament got a chance to talk
to some of the folks behind ILM s new
animated feature Rango starring Johnny
Depp or starring his voice anyway you
ain't from around here are you um I'm
still working on it
so hi I'm Daniel tournament from CNET
news and this is Rango from director
Gore Verbinski it's also the first
animated feature that Industrial Light
and Magic has worked on after more than
30 years of live-action movies last week
we got a chance to visit ILM and talk to
a visual effects supervisor and one of
the lead animators on the movie about
what it's like to treat an animated
feature like a live-action movie well
early on we realized that we didn't know
how to make an animated feature so we
actually reached out to the community
and had people come in and talk to us
and tell us about how to make an
animated feature and really early on I
realized that we were actually breaking
a lot of a lot of the rules of how
animated features are being made and
that we weren't actually making your
standard animated feature so in the end
it actually really came to be that we
were kind of making a live-action movie
so a lot of what our backgrounds were
coming from a live-action background
really helped out and really actually
became a benefit and a strength for us
rather than being maybe a detriment that
some people thought it might be so we
had really great art work
two-dimensional artwork from from crash
is the production designer for each
character but the problem with that is
that you don't know what the character
looks like from all angles so we would
make in the computer what we call them a
cat which allows us to actually look at
the character from all different angles
so that we could check the proportions
and and check to see you know how
they're gonna look from the back or from
the side so our modelers would spend
about three days making this maquette
and this was kind of a new process for
us at ILM we
really done this before but we found out
that it actually really actually made
the process faster for us because we
could get a buy off on the proportions
of what the characters gonna look like
before we did all the really hard work
of adding hair and dirt and grime and
things like that he wanted this film to
be gritty dirty and sweaty he wanted to
be able to smell the wrath of the
characters so we looked at we looked at
life as we always do at ILM and for some
clues this gave us some interesting
textures and markings and you know it
seemed like that is that is rangos eye
the eyes were wild you know these their
flick in different directions and they
can even cave in which we didn't go
nearly that crazy with them on the anime
feature versus a live-action film we
were we were way more overall it was a
really really rewarding and artistic
process it was great it was like a
little theatre troupe full of talented
actors running around acting like
cartoons and it was definitely a joy to
watch and extremely informative for for
animation as long as that sign says
Sheriff you can believe that there's law
and order in this town they shot the
movie like they were making a like they
were making a movie no different except
less locations and and the props weren't
quite as fancy returns on neighbor
pretty soon we're eating our children
dogs and cats are getting together to
create all sorts of unnatural mutant
aberrations I am totally going to see
that movie and I might even take my kid
all right enough frivolity it's time to
get serious and check out the bad
whether it's playing games on your
laptop or watching movies on your big
screen having to settle for crummy audio
can really put a damper on your
experience all the more reason to steer
clear of these two speaker options
hey I'm just a new associate editor at C
net with a review of the razor ferrets
gaming speakers for 60 bucks these USB
rechargeable speakers are marketed as
gaming specific but there's really
nothing about them that specifically
benefits gaming audio that said their
audio quality is more on par with USB
speakers and you can get much more
features and better amplification out of
the creative d100 bluetooth boombox that
ones reviewed on CNET as well it's $20
more but you'll be more satisfied with
the sound quality now the hardware
consists of these two satellite speakers
joined by a nylon cable that features a
USB charging plug on one side and a 3.5
millimeter audio jack on the other if
you push the top of each dome the
speakers expand to reveal a mesh chamber
where the sound comes out so you can use
the jack to play music out of any device
with a standard headphone port like an
iphone or ipad but the d100 by creative
has a more elegant wireless bluetooth
solution so you don't have to carry
around this clumsy cord with you and
razer makes the claim that that chamber
is actually strengthened the base and
resonance of your music but we tested
the volume levels and are disappointed
with the audio fidelity we played
several songs across a variety of genres
through the ferric speakers and we
noticed lots of bass and treble
distortions even at low volumes like we
said before your dollar will go much
further with a slightly more expensive
audio solution like the creative
bluetooth d100 speakers so you should
definitely check those out if you're in
the market you can read all the details
in our full review on CNET but that's
going to do it for me
I'm Justin new these are the Razer
ferrets mobile gaming speakers and that
sounds good
hi I'm Matthew Muscovy AK from cnet.com
and we're gonna take a look at the onkyo
htx 22 HDX this is a 2.1 home theater
system and it's currently selling online
for about 250 dollars now akio is known
for having big boxy speakers but this is
really more of a lifestyle system there
are just too small speakers and the
subwoofer which also has an AV receiver
built-in the subwoofer has a glossy
front panel with an LCD display and
there also a few controls on the top
such as volume control and input
selection for when the remote goes
missing now around back you'll see all
the inputs the most important are the
three HDMI inputs which will cover most
of your home theater gadgets and there
are also free digital audio inputs and
two analog inputs for all your extra AV
devices you also notice that there are
extra speaker jacks on the back and you
can buy an additional speaker package
from Onkyo to upgrade the system to a
full 5.1 home theater system now the big
missing feature for us is an easy way to
connect an iPod we would have liked
either a front panel mini Jack input or
even better a built-in iPod dock which
we've seen on a lot of other systems now
for a home theater system sound quality
is the most important feature and here
the akio was a little disappointing when
we listened to say action scenes in
movies the onkyo just didn't sound
powerful enough to fill up our medium
size testing room music didn't fare much
better either and we could really hear
the limitations of the smaller speakers
included with the system so in all the
onkyo HDX 22 HDX is a nice looking
system and has a strong feature set for
the price but its sound quality really
didn't impress us and it's much better
suited to smaller rooms I'm Matthew
moscovia and this is the onkyo HT X 22
HDS
tough week for the audio guys in New
York I guess hopefully something better
will come across their desk soon all
right let's go ahead and check out this
week's bottom line so back to the iPad 2
yes it's faster it's more powerful it
comes in black and white and so on and
so on but the real question on
everyone's mind was what about that mind
blowing case seriously miss it the first
time here you go
it's one of my favorite little videos it
actually kind of reminds me of a Pixar
short or something like that but as you
see we actually built magnets right into
the iPad itself and then there's magnets
in the hinge for the smart cover and it
not only holds the cover on but it auto
aligns it it's really cool and of course
what would these cases be if they didn't
come in colors so we've got five
polyurethane colors and five colors of
leather and they're really really
beautiful they look great with the black
unit they look great with the white unit
the polyurethane cases are $39 the
leather cases are $69 and we think this
is going to we think people are gonna
love these cases the bottom line this
week doesn't anyone at Apple have kids
the Smart Cover is pretty slick but
how's it supposed to help if your
four-year-old drops your new iPad to
while he's watching the Cars movie for
the 350 third time hypothetically also I
can't wait until we start hearing
reports about bus passes and credit
cards getting all messed up because of
the magnets my suggestion
keep it out of your purse all right
that's our show for this time everyone
but we'll be back next week with a brand
new scene at tech review and until then
there are tons of great videos available
every day at CNN tv.com
I'll see you next time and thank you for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
