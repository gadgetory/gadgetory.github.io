is a bag of chips with an alcohol sensor
blow onto the bag then use NFC to call
an uber so you don't drink and drive but
why the Super Bowl of course the ad
agency for Tostitos came up with the bag
and it's obviously working because we're
talking about it well it's time to try
it out but first the bag gives us this
disclaimer this is not an actual
breathalyzer so don't use it to
determine if you are safe to drive let's
just say if you're seriously thinking of
using a bag of chips to figure that out
you are probably way too drunk to drive
because the bag doesn't give us an
actual blood-alcohol reading we're going
to use a smartphone breathalyzer to
compare this is the result with no beers
in our system
now let's blow on the bag while trying
to maintain some dignity all clear let's
party
Caitlyn took one sip blue on to the bag
and she's in the red zone
see the bag is just detecting if there's
any alcohol on your breath here's the
reading from the backtrack to get a more
accurate reading from the breathalyzer
you do need to wait 15 minutes after
drinking and eating Caitlyn finished the
beer and is now in the Green Zone but
she does still have some alcohol
detected on the breathalyzer so what
does this tell us the bag only detects
the immediate presence of alcohol and it
does work if you want to get your hands
on one for Super Bowl well I'm sorry but
they aren't being sold to the general
public it's definitely a gimmick but
with a message that's not all hot air
and the best part about it
there's actually chips inside
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
