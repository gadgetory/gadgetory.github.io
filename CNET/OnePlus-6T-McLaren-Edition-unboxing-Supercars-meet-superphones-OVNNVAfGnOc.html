ever collaboration with supercar
manufacturer McLaren very exciting and
already I have their phone the oneplus
60 McLaren Edition here
factory sealed in its packaging just
ready for me to rip into it and see
what's inside so let's do just that I
mean it already starts off being very
McLaren it's orange and we've got salute
to speed of course on the front
I brought a tool ready to crack in see
this carefully surgical precision some
may say well done go away safely slide
off the box and of course carbon fiber
patterning something that McLaren uses a
lot in its cars let's open this up how
does this just a lid opens this way and
we have more salute to speed inside and
the words fast and smooth why
so let's first take a look at this book
which have a launch event they made a
big deal about the fact that this is
packaged as a book you open it up
dedicated to those in constant pursuit
of speed shouldn't that be in the
constant maybe I don't know maybe know
we have some words about Bruce McLaren
we have the truth track of the 1968
Belgian Grand Prix and there why what
else do we have more more words there is
actually this is actually a whole book
it talks about oneplus as beginnings it
talks about MacLaren's beginnings and in
the launch event they tried to talk a
lot about how both companies have
similar background I don't really think
they do but you know I'm not going to
argue if they've spent all this time in
trying to develop this story there we go
okay
lots more pages lots more words these
books are limited edition of course so
you're not going to find them
necessarily on the shelves of your local
and WH Smiths but hey that's why we're
here we'll probably show a bit more
close-ups on these on another occasion
now we're getting something about the
phone one +60 McLaren Edition inspired
by f1 10 gig of ram 10 gig of ram that
is a lot of ram arguably too much ram in
fo snapdragon 845 + 10 gig of ram and
256 gigabytes of storage that is huge
also it has what they call walk charge
30 that's one plus as we fast charging
systems and it claims that you can get a
whole day of youth from just 20 minutes
of charging but it's something that is
really appealing because I often don't
charge my phone in US and then suddenly
find a need to go out and I've got no
battery left so what's at the end of
this book it's the phone itself isn't
that exciting on the last page you open
it up and there it is we can take this
out
carefully does it and we start to see it
covered in stickers let's peel these off
first of all if we don't need these
stickers and we don't need this barcode
it's ruining all our fun quick polish
because I've got my finger prints over
it already so there we are we have the
phone the 60 it's black it's shiny and
beneath the surface you will see this
very very faint pattern of carbon 5 + r1
+ talk to loss about the carbon fiber
that McLaren users now I'm a little
disappointed that it hasn't actually
used carbon fiber this is just for show
it is just an expect it isn't carbon
fiber but what we do have subtly around
the bottom now I don't know if the light
is catching this properly under these
cameras but there is this little hint of
orange around the bottom edge now that
is the papaya orange which McLaren uses
in a lot of its cars otherwise the phone
is physically identical to the 60 we've
got this fuel camera sensor at the top
and we have this all screen front with
just this little teardrop notch on the
front now of course it's time for the
most satisfying thing on any new phone
and that is of course peeling off the
screen protector always a good moment
ok let's fire this thing up and while
that's doing that you know you may not
even do that oh it is it buzzed there we
go
one plus powered by Android of course
we'll take a look at what else we've got
inside this box of course we have a case
its carbon fiber effects with oneplus
logo and the McLaren logo down at the
bottom we have a special edition orange
weaved charging cable USB see of course
to show off the McLaren color and we
have a black and orange oneplus charger
and again with the McLaren logo and is
this charger that will let you do the
superfast charge that this phone has if
you don't use this charger you won't get
those benefits so try not to lose this
one it's bright orange it's difficult to
lose now the other thing that comes in
this box which one + were very very
proud about is this
salute to speed block now in here is an
actual piece of carbon fiber in the
shape of the McLaren swushi logo thing
and they've told they said that in all
the phones that they are making and they
have this limited edition but haven't
said exactly how many but there are six
f1 cars worth of carbon fiber that
they've used in making all of these
little blocks it says salute to speed
McLaren MCL 33 edition carbon fiber 2018
handcrafted in England down in Woking
where the actual launch event took place
at the mclaren HQ now that looks like
all the actual exciting stuff in the box
there is a USB and there's a USB C
headphone adapter with a little splash
of the orange again and this is just
manuals
it's just manuals but again there's a
lot of the orange there and the McLaren
logo is all over the place we can go out
to the phone itself now get rid of all
this and we are in the phone and already
with kind of seeing nothing else in the
phone which is McLaren based the
software is pretty much the same as you
will find on any other phone any other
oneplus phone except that I have noticed
that there is some little tweak to the
interface to bring that orange color
into the software but I think that's
pretty much about it really the the
point of having this McLaren branded
phone is to have that McLaren logo down
here at the bottom to have the carbon
fiber effect and this orange bit of line
on the bottom this phone is only about
70 pounds more than the top spec normal
one plus 60 this comes in at 649 pounds
which isn't a bad price for a phone with
10 gig of ram 256 gig of storage that's
even before you add in there's this
special McLaren stuff so it's often the
case you've seen before when phone
companies have partnered with automotive
brands like Porsche design phones or
some of the lamborghini special edition
phones we've seen from other companies
they cost thousands of pounds because
they think oh we've put in this fancy
car
name let's charge loads more for this
phone actually they haven't done that
with this this is a very very reasonable
price for this handset and I think it
looks pretty cool no it isn't a massive
overhaul of anything it isn't a
completely different phone it's very
much still at 60 but boost it a little
bit and if you're particularly keen on
racing and you're particularly keen on
the McLaren brand this is probably a
phone to look out for but do let us know
what you think of the one +60 McLaren
Edition you can leave your comment in
