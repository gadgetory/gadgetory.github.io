here with the Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.7 if
you think you've seen this before you're
not crazy last year we saw the galaxy
tab 7 galaxy tab 7 + Galaxy Tab 8.9 and
the galaxy tab 10.1 you haven't seen
this one before this is the 7.7 and the
big deal here is that has a super amoled
screen that gives it a HD resolution at
1280 x 800 so you've got a beautiful
high-resolution display here also really
rich blacks really rich colors because
of that AMOLED screen it's going to be
available only on verizon so you're
going to this is going to come up the
contract we don't know the price yet we
don't know the availability yet but it's
a great size I do like this size and
it's very thin very lightweight and
you're getting the 4g network behind
this too so if you're a big fan of 4G
and you want that mobile speed you're
going to have it here other than that is
running Android 3.2 so it's still a
honeycomb tablet but it's very well done
has Samsung's TouchWiz interface on it
so there's a lot of little nice extras
and details that Samsung is added to
this another interesting thing to note
here is that there's an IR blaster on
the side a lot like the galaxy tab 7
plus in fact that's exactly like that
because it comes paired with the peel
software that lets you change the
channels on your TV view programming
guides so you can use this as a
universal remote control so that's about
it it's a beautiful screen on a fast
tablet that's small enough to fit in
your hand and you're going to see it on
verizon on their 4g network later this
year for cnet com on Donald Bell</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
