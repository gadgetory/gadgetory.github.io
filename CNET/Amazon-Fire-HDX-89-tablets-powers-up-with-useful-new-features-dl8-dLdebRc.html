tablet packs a more powerful processor
in a few new tricks up its sleeve i'm
Xiomara blanco frissina taking a first
look at the Amazon tablet at eight point
nine inches the Fire tablet HDX looks
identical to last year's model
there's a trio of concave buttons on the
back edges power on the left by the
microUSB port volume buttons on the
right near the headphone jack and dual
microphones on top
inside you'll find a zippy quad-core
Snapdragon 805 processor 2 gigabytes of
RAM and it comes in 16 32 or 64
gigabytes of internal storage space with
no microSD card option large games
launched quickly within a few seconds
and each level seamlessly loads with
minimal wait time games and HD video
looks sharp and clear on the 2560 by
1600 pixel resolution display though it
doesn't beat the Samsung Tab s and
screen quality it's really a great movie
watching slate thanks to Amazon video
included with your Prime membership you
can download TV show episodes and movies
directly onto your tablet for easy
offline viewing the Fire HDX 8.9 offers
Dolby Atmos which creates a
multi-dimensional sonic experience that
elevates surround sounds to a more
realistic level the fire HDX 8.9 packs
some of the best speakers on a tablet
with clear crisp and loud audio at the
center of the stereo speakers sits the
eight megapixel rear camera with LED
flash and electronic image stabilization
photos suffer from graininess and
digital noise but overall come out sharp
with a surprising amount of detail you
can also take panoramic and HDR photos
as well as selfies with the mediocre
front-facing camera one of my favorite
new features is Firefly which can
identify songs videos products texts and
more if you want to know what TV show
you stumbled upon or which song is
playing you simply open the tab tap the
corresponding button for music or TV and
await a result you can do the same with
objects or text
you need an internet connection for it
to work you'll find everything we loved
about last year's Fire HDX 8.9 inside of
the 2014 edition starting at 379 for a
16 gigabyte model it isn't cheap but
it's sleek build feature-rich operating
system and useful new features justify
its steep price for more information
check out my full review again I'm
Xiomara Blanca frisina and this has been
a first look at the Amazon Fire HDX 8.9</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
