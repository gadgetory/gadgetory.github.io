Google for its the next iOS update here
are the top five features iOS 10 should
steal from Android as compiled by CNN
editor Vanessa Han
Oriana at number five bilingual support
sending messages in more than one
language on iOS can be an autocorrect
nightmare sure you can set up keyboards
in different languages but you'll have
to remember to switch manually every
time you start a conversation and with
Siri even a foreign sounding street name
is subject to interpretation
when it comes to voice recognition there
is no match for Google now number four
better control center Apple borrowed
this idea from Android a few years ago
but it's still not up to snuff for
starters even though it's called control
center you pretty much have no control
as to what shows up in this section
unless you jailbreak your phone on
Android you can have up to two pages of
shortcuts and even long press on icons
to give you more options at number three
and multiple user accounts people's
phones and tablets are becoming their
real personal computers the problem
comes in when you want to loan your
Apple device to someone else you have to
really trust them not to mess around on
your iPhone or iPad Android has had
multiple user support since lollipop
which was back in 2014 maybe Apple can
even tie in touch ID to multiple user
support at number two changing default
apps Apple has a death grip on what apps
can be launched by default over on
Android you can select any browser any
Maps app or even any launcher as your
default would it be amazing if I could
click an address link in Safari then
would take me to the Google Maps app and
Apple don't worry if your apps are the
best people will gladly use them at
number one instant apps Google recently
announced its new instant app feature
which lets you use an app without
actually installing it on your phone
you're probably thinking wait I could
just download the app what's the big
deal well what do you have a 16 gigabyte
iPhone and you're running out of room
also some absolutely really useful for a
certain time period but don't really
need to live on your phone all the time
do you always need that parking meter
app when you rarely draw
I know the answer is no get out of here
remember good artists copy great artists
steal like the great Rickey Henderson
as for what Android can learn from iOS
we'll cover that in the future I Mayas
act iron I'll see you online</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
