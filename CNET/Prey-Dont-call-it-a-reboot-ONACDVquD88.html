modification aliens welcome to the world
of prey in prey you assume the role of
Morgan you key subject in an experiment
meant to alter humanity forever but when
you wake up on tellus one massive space
station orbiting the moon things have
gone completely sideways species of
alien called the typhoon have overrun
everything and now they're hunting you
we got to check out the first hour or so
of prey at this point in its development
which kicks off with our hero's
realization they're actually on a space
station and some exploration of the
game's first main hub one of the cool
things about the setting is it's not
like oh this is a derelict space station
and like a hundred years ago you know it
got shut down and now you're arriving
it's the disaster just happened like
moments ago so most of the people on the
space station are already dead but not
everybody's dead it's a first person
action game with depth that depth comes
from a lot of choices offered to you
developer Arkane Studios says there are
multiple solutions to just about every
obstacle the game throws at you and
Morgan's skill trees will dictate how
you tackle them like we really want
players to improvise and so right off
the bat in the first area of the game
whatever neurologic there's an immediate
payoff
the atmosphere in prey is very intense
with heart pounding music that ratchets
up the sense of dread when enemies are
close there's a very specific dreamlike
quality to mimicks they look like evil
scribbles that escape the darkest part
of your imagination I didn't quite play
enough to get a sense of parade larger
scope but arcane promises multiple
endings and huge hubs for morgan to
explore but the parts I did see
suggested a game filled with upgrades
modifications and exploration in this
game the entire space station is like
one giant space that you can move around
in and come back to old areas like you
can sort of make your office a home base
if you want to and so we sort of call it
an open space station game combat feels
really
familiar here especially a little half
life nod via the ultra handy wrench
you'll be beating up enemies with early
on think it's still a little too early
to say whether prey will be able to find
a niche in a crowded action FPS genre
but arcane seems confident it can
deliver a game that can do just that
I'm hoping the players are telling each
other's stories about like I saw the bit
this way and this other person is like
well I didn't even see that and I
thought I solved it this other way
