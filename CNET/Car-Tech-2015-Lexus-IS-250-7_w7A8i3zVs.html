strategy keep its luxury oriented
Mercedes alternative audience happy and
go after a younger audience is looking
for something more urban more sporty
let's drive a key part of the strategy
to 2015 is 252 check the deck
this 15 is is the second year of a
dramatic new redesign the swoopy sporty
new styling is a carryover from 14 some
improvements now we've got LED fog
lights on the 15 Siri eyes free is
supported you can do remote telematics
via the inform app now not just
infotainment apps and they've improved
the rear camera with some better
trajectory lines let's get inside
now inside the is the first thing I like
is this lay back console they've been
doing lately everything is just so
beautifully laid out
ergonomically I give them great props on
this really well-thought-out and very
comfortable we've seen that head unit
before I wish I was happier to see it
not much has changed it's a little
crunchy looking but it gets the basics
done but pretty is not one of its
attributes nor is widescreen voice
commands very logical on this car from
just about any screen you can issue a
command for any other function please
say a command
navigation go to navigation please say a
navigation address and as you can see
you can enter addresses in one gulp I
like that we have app support through
Lexus enform a basket of apps as well as
remote telematics my one big gripe is
this controller now that's not a
touchscreen you couldn't reach it anyway
but you've got this sort of love side
down puck that Lexus likes I just find
it to be a festival of overshoots and
undershoots I'd kill for a knob and a
click right now or even a touchpad but
this thing is like an upside-down Mouse
and I hate it now up front is 250 is a
baby v6 two and a half liters the
numbers are kind of compact as well 204
horsepower 185 pound feet of torque
those are not overwhelming by today's
standards you're looking at this car
getting up to sixty and seven point
seven seconds respectable but no one's
going to call that super fast your mpg
is not bad 21 City but 30 highway you
should get in the mid-20s reliably and
your only drivetrain choice base is a
6-speed automatic rear wheel drive is
your standard setup but you can also get
all-wheel drive first thing I notice
when the is250 is it's a little more hat
than
which is to say it's more suspension
than it is powertrain the car looks like
a barnburner on the outside but at least
in 250 configuration those numbers don't
lie it's just a little short on power
especially by today's standards those
cars on steroids
the handling is really nice the
cornering is fantastic and the ride
quality in the Lexus is silky with a
good everyday driver ships are a little
sleepy though is about a heartbeat and a
half even when I'm here in sport mode
before I get a reaction to the paddle
it's definitely a step behind the game
driver assist is all optional on this
car you can get passive blind spot and
lane departure alerts also a pre
collision option that just amplifies the
brakes but doesn't stop for you and
that's bundled with adaptive cruise
control
overall the is 250 is a really nice
daily car it's not gonna be the one you
take the autocross track though and get
the best time but I love driving it the
handling is outstanding powertrain is
you know pricing is about 37 5 delivered
Levenson audio and navigations another 3
grand that's gonna roll in a number of
other desirable tech features luxury and
tech package is how you get to lane
departure warning that's about four
thousand the pre collision technology is
ala carte five hundred typically special
order and you have to get 18-inch wheels
to get the rest of this stuff all in
about 46,000 loaded up see next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
