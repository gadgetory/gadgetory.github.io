technology and you can bet that there's
a fan out there who can trace that thing
back to a Star Trek episode science
fiction is where we dream up tomorrow's
big inventions and we've dreamed up some
awesome stuff that we already take for
granted but there are some hotly coveted
science fiction gadgets that I'm really
happy don't exist I'm Donnell Bell and
this top 5 i'm counting down the 5 most
awesome unrealized inventions of science
fiction that you think you want but
really aren't practical starting off at
number 5 the hoverboard from Back to the
Future 2 we all saw that spoof video
that tried to convince us that the
hoverboards time had come but all it did
was remind me what a horrible idea this
is even if we find ways to bend the laws
of physics and make this work can you
imagine the parking lot filled with kids
riding these first it would look about
as cool as a segway polo league and
second it would only take minutes before
the lot is covered in bones and tears
and lawsuits forget it this next one
really breaks my heart to admit but at
number four the lightsaber obi-wan calls
it an elegant weapon from a more
civilized age but a real version would
be a total nightmare I mean a blade of
pure plasma that can cut through people
like butter what could go wrong if
Jedi's were real they'd all have less
fingers in your woodshop teacher but at
least they'd have professional training
most of us would be picking these up at
Walmart and decapitating ourselves
before we make it to the car no thank
you at number three the neuralyzer from
men in black also known as the memory
eraser can you imagine the shenanigans
we'd be up to if all we had to do is
flash a little light in someone's eyes
to make them forget a few hours or a few
days and I don't mean Will Smith using
it prudently I mean the cast of Jersey
Shore wouldn't just be annoying it would
give us all existential paralysis no one
would know if they're mine was their own
anymore and we'd all have to walk around
with blinders on our face so I guess
we're kind of heading that way anyway
coming in at number to the holodeck from
Star Trek The Next Generation he
here's another brilliant invention that
just isn't compatible with human nature
yes some of us would use it to stroll
through Victorian England or meditate in
the rainforest but let's be real most of
you would use this thing like an
interactive masturbatorium human
reproduction would grind to a halt so if
anyone ever invites you to a holodeck
bring hand sanitizer in some clothes
toed shoes alright and now the number
one sci-fi invention that sounds cool
but would ultimately kill us all time
machine whether we're talking about doc
brown's DeLorean or Bill and Ted's phone
booth or hot tub only bad things happen
when you interfere with the continuum of
space and time now assuming time travel
is even possible if the law of causality
holds true you can't even fart in the
past without disrupting the course of
the future possibly wiping out everyone
you know and love want to travel to a
future that's full of hoverboards well
there's equal chance that you'll arrive
in a post-apocalyptic wasteland where
you're quickly murdered with a
lightsaber and rendered down for the
precious non radioactive water in your
body so there you are five reasons to
stop whining about all the sci fi tek
you wish you had it's not as great as
you think but if you beg to differ you
can tweet me at donald or head over to
top five CNN com for all the rebuttals
that take more than 140 characters Donal
Bell thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
