is a first take of the LG smart think
electric single oven range with infrared
grill l re three zero two seven s T in
terms of design this range is pretty
basic it comes with a glass stovetop and
it also has a 6.3 cubic foot oven the
displays are really straightforward on
this side you have all of the stovetop
buttons and this side has all of the up
and buttons and the stove heating
element isn't induction but it does
provide 3200 watts of power one thing I
really like about the oven functionality
is that it uses infrared grill heating
the infrared grill will preheat faster
and cook more quickly so this range is
pretty standard except that it comes
with one really cool feature it's part
of the LG smart think line that's a
select group of appliances that are
Wi-Fi compatible and connect to the LG
app within the LG app the really cool
thing is that you can browse through
recipes so if I wanted to make buffalo
wings
I can select that and it will send that
information to the range and then it'll
be preset to cook but the problem is
that you can't press start from the app
so you can't be sitting on your couch
and say hey I want to preheat this you
actually have to go to the range and
press Start also using this app you can
make a grocery list you can troubleshoot
without having to call customer support
and you can set a timer you just can't
turn it on while the functionality of
this range is pretty simple it has some
pretty cool features at the same time
stay tuned for my full review i'm megan
Willerton for CNET and this has been the
LG smart thing range
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
