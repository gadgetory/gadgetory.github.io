to read your email I'm Bridget Carey and
this is your scene that update google is
working on a way for you to protect
sensitive email messages with the same
encryption technology that's used by
spies the extra security is called
end-to-end encryption and it's a way to
stop people from snooping in on your
emails while in transit according to
documents revealed by Edward Snowden the
National Security Agency has the power
to intercept emails on the way to their
destination but end-to-end encryption
makes it much harder for the NSA or
other hackers to read those emails you
can think of normal email as sending a
postcard than anyone can read easily
encryption is the envelope that seals
your letter shut and Google is using PGP
which basically puts a lock on that
envelope and only you can unlock it with
your specific key now if someone tries
to pluck your email without the key
it'll just be a bunch of gobbledygook
code PGP is so secure that Edward
Snowden used it to communicate to
journalists normally you have to be
really tech savvy to set something like
that up but Google wants to make it easy
for anyone to use when it's released
it'll be an extension that you can
download for the chrome web browser at
the South by Southwest tech conference
Snowden spoke via video to programmers
asking them to make it easier for the
general public to have access to
encryption tools it seems that google is
answering the call and it's no surprise
encryption is an important selling
feature these days as consumers are on
high alert about their privacy Apple is
also hot on the trend the new operating
systems for the iphone ipad and mac
computers will have the option for
DuckDuckGo to be the default search
engine DuckDuckGo is a silly name but
it's a private search engine that
doesn't keep track of your browsing
history in other Apple news there's a
new video game accessory for the iPhone
it's a case called the jungle cat and it
has a slideout panel for a d-pad buttons
and bumpers it's made by razor that's a
company known for its PC gaming
accessories it'll cost one hundred
dollars and it'll be out in July there
this growth in gaming on smartphones
because people are shifting away from
buying separate portable consoles for
Sony's PlayStation Portable it's the end
of an era sony announced the 10 year old
PSP will no longer be sold of course
sony is instead focusing on the newer PS
Vita you'll be hearing tons more gaming
news in the next week as we covered the
e3 videogame conference in Los Angeles
that's your tech news update you can

from our studios in New York I'm Bridget
