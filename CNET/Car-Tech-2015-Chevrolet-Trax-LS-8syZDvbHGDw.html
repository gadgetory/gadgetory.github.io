been red-hot basically leading a
resurgent US auto sales face you don't
want to be missing Mac card-table let's
see how good Chevy's hand is as we drive
the new 2015 Chevy Trax - check the
check
now the Chevy Trax is Chevy's newest and
their crossover and SUV portfolio it's
also as you can see their smallest I
think it's got really nice clean lines
for the first three quarters or so and
then it can see it monk cheek rear
haunches in the quarter panels it don't
work for me it's a four seat vehicle
really maybe put a little kid in the
middle in the back but when you fold
down the back it's surprisingly
commodious for carrying cargo it goes up
against Nissan Juke Fiat 500l and Jeep
renegade now the cabin on the tracks as
you can imagine is pretty basic and
Spartan but I gotta say they've got a
modern interesting layout here starting
at the instrument panel you have this
sort of motorcycle inspired layout that
Chevy's been doing in their very small
cars in the last couple of years come
over here to the head unit here's the
star of the show most of what you see
here is standard like OnStar 4G hotspot
in the car the 7-inch touch LCD with
what I think is one of the
better-looking and fairly logical
interfaces out there in general this
head unit has great metatag display for
whatever source you're playing but it is
irritating how any adjustment of the
volume clobbers anything else on the
screen there is no volume knob anywhere
everything is an up and down tap either
here on the bezel or over here on the
wheel of an see that just drives me nuts
I want a knob for volume climate
controls are simple there's no automatic
temp control on this car just turn it
back and forth from blue to red the way
you used to do let me show you some of
the features now on this head unit AM
and FM radio no HD radio interestingly
enough satellite radio is optional on
higher trim level that's not always
included picture and movie seems silly
to me it's like what I don't need to do
either of those that high on the menu
your phone menu of course brings you
hands-free calling and bluetooth
streaming on the media side those are
your apps Pandora stitcher tune in and
bring those your navigation this car may
have the record for the cheapest
optional nav all you need is to pair
your smart phone spend 99 cents for that
app and you've got in-car navigation on
the dash 2 glove boxes the one on the
top has USB and auxiliary backup camera
is also standard on all tracks there are
cars that cost three
I am is this much that don't do that I'm
also gonna anti-lock brakes standard a
very good Stabilitrak stability system
standard and by the way this guy is an
IIHS safety top pick on crash ratings
drive controls are simple you've got a
true conventional automatic to get into
your shifting mode you come back here to
M for manual and then you've got this
fussy toggle here on the shift lever the
combination of that and no presence of
paddles means this is not set up as a
driver engagement vehicle one more note
while head and shoulder room were real
good in the tracks legroom never felt
like enough ok let's talk about the
tracks engine where'd it go ah here it
is down here 1.4 liter turbocharged
inline-4 sitting sidesaddle driving the
front wheels typically all wheel drive
is optional for a very good price we'll
get to that later you're always gonna
have a six-speed automatic transmission
not a CVT not a DCT just a
garden-variety automatic your horsepower
is 138 you have a hundred and forty
eight pound-feet of torque
now it all comes out in the wash in the
MPG 2634 really quite good though you
get a pretty big haircut if you go
all-wheel-drive some all sad to say does
the tracks driving dynamics aren't it's
kind of a gutless wonder to be honest
the engine doesn't do anything criminal
it's just not let's shove it for some
reason the numbers actually are okay but
I think the transmissions very much
asleep at the switch even if you
manually shifted much more kudos to the
head unit living with it day to day I
really do like it it's simple it's clean
it looks pretty good and except for a
few weird sort of organizational quirks
it's very nice for this price point now
we have a track CLS that's your base
model and that's gonna come in just a
tick under 21,000 delivered 1500 is all
you pay for all-wheel drive I'm gonna
leave that out for now because not
everyone's gonna want that but then
there's one upgrade that definitely gets
you seen that style and that goes from
LS to LT for 2,300 bucks that gets your
satellite radio the only major media
that was missing cruise control remote
start some other niceties around the car
you might also consider the Sun and
sound package 1404 the seven speaker
Bose rig and a
glass roof so adding it all those toys
but leaning out all week drive we're
still under 25,000 for a car that's
credibly seen in style</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
