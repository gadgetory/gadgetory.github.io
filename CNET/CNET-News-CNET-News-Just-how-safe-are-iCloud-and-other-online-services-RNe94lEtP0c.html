internet stars are vowing legal action
while others wonder how they can protect
themselves the best theory is that some
hackers they just sort of use brute
force right like they just tried and
tried and tried to hack individual user
names and passwords it's believed the
compromising images were stolen from
iCloud accounts Apple storage service
boasts more than 320 million users but
they aren't required to enable the
feature your device will prompt you to
set up iCloud before you just say yes to
everything think about whether or not
you want to store your photos to make
those adjustments on your device go to
settings and choose iCloud Dropbox
Google Drive box Evernote and onedrive
are a few of the other services that
have become vital for both business and
personal use but users should still be
thoughtful about what they upload to the
cloud the second your information leaves
your device and goes up to another
computer in the cloud there is a small
possibility that it can be intercepted
use best practices like two-factor
authentication which basically means
that you have to have a physical device
with a special code on it in order to
get past the username and password
settings if you find yourself in the
same boat as Jennifer Lawrence and
Rihanna act immediately when you change
your passwords you change them to
different passwords for all major
services and the most important one is
your bank many of hackers are hunting
for more valuable information access to
your finances in San Francisco I'm see
