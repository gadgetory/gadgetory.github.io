leaving and this is rumor has it the
show where we round up the biggest tech
rumors of the week and then we vote on
what sounds legit and what seems like it
won't ever happen and remember that you
guys can build on all the rumors to keep
your eyes up for the pole in the
interactive player if you're watching on
Sina way we will wait before we start we
should probably mention why you're
wearing the panda hat it's not just
because we're huge San Francisco Giants
fans but also because you lost a big bet
this week Apple unveiled the ipad mini
and it did not come in different colors
oh and this is only the beginning of the
humiliation right next week is the real
show but I want to say that I was
partially right because my main argument
against the ipad mini was that Apple
wouldn't ever introduce a budget device
and at 329 they still haven't it's still
an ipad mini our first rumor comes from
boy genius report who says that iOS 6.1
is currently undergoing testing with the
number of carrier partners with a
planned release in the coming weeks the
fixes include improved Wi-Fi support an
issue with passbook security via the
lock screen and horizontal lines
appearing on the keyboard which is a
problem that I can personally attest to
that's happened to me several times I
actually thought my phone was broken not
surprisingly there's no mention of iOS
6.1 bringing back Google Maps I think
that the iOS 6 update will be ready in
time for the ipad mini going on sale
Apple released iOS 5.1 about a month
after iOS 5 and it included bug fixes
plus multitasking gestures to the iPad
next up are you always looking at your
tiny smartphone screen and thinking ugh
this is so blurry exactly no one else is
either but Samsung wants to make your
phone a true HD device according to
Korean website mkay news who reports
that both LG and Samsung are planning
1080p phones for next year apparently
both companies are expected to pack in
more than 400 pixels per inch on future
displays that would be higher than the
326 pixels per inch of the iphone 5s
retina display great bring it then you
don't need a TV or a tablet or anything
and you
watch honey boo boo or hear phone with
headphones that way you won't bother
anybody like me I seriously don't
understand the point of this as a
commenter wrote great now I can read my
email in HD Samsung can I talk to you
for a minute please stop encouraging
people to watch full movies on the bus
it's sad and creepy and annoying honey
boo boo on the bus forever and now for
some Google rumors Google is holding an
event next week where it is expected to
debut the latest update to its operating
system a new phone and possibly a new 10
inch version of the nexus tablet as well
as an LG version of the nexus phone in a
less likely Google related rumor
according to digit times which sites
obviously sources drink a $99 Nexus
tablet could also be on the horizon
coming by the end of the year though not
necessarily to be announced next week
Google is allegedly working with
taiwan-based quanta computer instead of
a sous which is who developed the nexus
7 one shocking tidbit is that the $99
tablet will have a single core processor
no thank you but then again $99 still I
don't think this is going to happen I
don't either even though the price
certainly beats the 329 dollar starting
price of the ipad mini nobody is going
to want to use the slowest tablet on the
planet Earth so I say no what do you
guys think does Google have a $99 single
core tablet up its sleeve don't forget
to vote while we go ask the people of
San Francisco what they think
there is a rumor that Google might be
putting out a $99 tablet do you think
that that's possible sure anything's
possible with Google and do you think
that people will buy it even though it
might have a single core uh I think for
that price I think there's a lot of
people would probably buy it no no I
don't think that means who will buy it I
think that there's better options
available out there add a not much
higher price point nah I don't think
we'll be I don't think would be a good
cell I know why not maybe but why would
anybody want it when I could just have
an iPad I wouldn't buy it would you pay
ninety nine dollars for one I would what
would you pay million dollars for it if
I told you that it would have only one
core processor which is actually less
than those smartphones I actually don't
know much about computers so say
whatever that is yeah that's cool well
the reactions on the street were pretty
mixed although very few people admitted
that they would actually buy one they
all felt that somebody probably would
let's go upstairs and see what the
scenic counseled experts things the cnet
Council is composed of five editors who
cast their votes anonymously their
opinions are not an endorsement by cnet
or CBS interactive obviously because
these are rumors folks and the cnet
verdict is no three to two of our
editors agreed with us that the Google
$99 tablet is not going to happen since
the rest of the humiliation will likely
involve singing Emily please give our
viewers a little taste of what's in
store for them hello baby big novice
beacon I do out what oh what Oh baby you
know what I like Chantilly lace wanna
show me baby shoes a rumor is that rumor
has it at cnet com or call it wedding
entrance survival tree or tweet to us
tune in next week and thank you so much
for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
