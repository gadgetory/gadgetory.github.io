isn't much to look at stainless steel
smooth top but when you look closer
you'll find it this range is actually a
really great cooker with some cool
features built in one of the first
things you'll notice about this GE range
is that it doesn't have any knobs to
control the burners instead you have
this really cool touchpad control that
use lights to show you how high or how
low your burner temperature is and once
you get the hang of these touch pad
burner controls it's really easy to use
the burners which can boil water really
quickly as I saw in my test the oven of
this GE range was also a really
spectacular cooker especially when it
came to roasting chicken using the
convection fan that's built into the
oven that circulates the air for more
even cooking along with some great
cooking capabilities this oven is
equipped with GES chef connect feature
now this means that the range has
Bluetooth connectivity that will connect
with an over the range microwave that GE
has that corresponds with this oven they
talked to one another so whenever the
burner turns on lights and the fan on
the microwave will turn on as well this
is a really cool feature but it's
definitely not necessary and you have to
have the microwave to even get it to
work for $1,100 this oven packs in a lot
of really great cooking capabilities
along with a couple of really cool
features that make this a worthwhile
investment for your kitchen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
