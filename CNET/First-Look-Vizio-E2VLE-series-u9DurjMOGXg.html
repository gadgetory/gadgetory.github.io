also a 42 and a 55 inch member the
series this review will apply to all
three this is videos entry-level smart
TV which means that I've internet
connectivity with Wi-Fi so that's a plus
on the downside it's video quality
wasn't all that great so we don't
consider it the best value this is one
of videos at least expensive TVs with
the smart TV interface this year that
allows you to connect to the internet
and get stuff like Amazon video on
demand netflix vudu and a host of other
services in fact vizio selection of
services is pretty darn good especially
for a TV that's relatively budget like
this one one of the ways they're able to
get to budget land is by getting rid of
the LED backlighting found a lot of more
expensive tvs it says a standard LCD
backlight really in our picture quality
testing that really didn't make all that
much of a difference first look at the
design of this TV however you can see
around the edge it's a thicker than a
lot of the LED TVs it's got this kind of
angled look around the frame here it's
also got a pretty thick bottom and all
told it's pretty pedestrian look over
all the glossy black does catch some
reflections along the edge seen from the
side the TV is also a lot thicker than
those LED TVs so overall not the most
stylish thing for the living room other
features aside from that Internet
connectivity include built-in Wi-Fi so
you have to run an ethernet cable into
your living room also 120 Hertz TVs you
get that smoothness that some people
like although we really don't when we
took the Vizio into the lab for picture
quality testing work a little bit
unimpressed by its picture quality in
fact the worst thing was the relatively
light black levels this TV can't get
nice and deep and dark we don't really
expect it to be super dark for a budget
TV but there's a lot of other budget TVs
we've seen that get quite a bit darker
so really it's not the best of value if
you're looking for that kind of picture
quality punch especially for home
theater on the other hand the Vizio did
a pretty accurate color and we liked
that the matte screen rejected ambient
light pretty well but all told picture
quality was a little bit disappointing
it's fizzy it has four total hdmi inputs
three on the back and one on the side
which is pretty darn good for a budget
TV there's also a pair of USB inputs
there's only one analog input however
the cacama dates both component video
and composite video so you've got a lot
of legacy sources you might have to use
a switch or something else anyway that's
a look at the Vizio ee to vle series I'm
