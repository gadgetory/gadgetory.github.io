willfully leader out Bob suey
defendi floresta he was the first
indigenous chief ever to meet with
Google Earth he came to propose a
partnership between the suru√≠ people and
Google he said you know about technology
we know about the forests here in the
top they have Sally images showing
illegal incursions into this area I was
interested in seeing what was happening
with the deforestation of the Amazon and
that's when I came across this who do
each I've that is doing work with
technology to try and stop deforestation
in its territory it was kind of shocking
because you kind of go from this kind of
deforested Plains area into the jungle
and suddenly it's like you're in the
middle of nowhere
well most wanted to go now and is not

see some technology once they made

their tribe was greatly diminished down
to three hundred members
my god back to the resort is vinegar in
Peru Billy Madero they weren't able to
defend that their entire territory and
he said to his father the time has come
to put down the bow and arrow
and to pick up the laptop as a tool for
protecting their people defending their
land he came across Google and was
shocked by what he saw whoa Sepulveda
poisoning my Zatoichi the one g thing
dental faith are you a mortgage this
month amended I first met chief Almir in
June of 2007 at that time there was a
hundred thousand dollar bounty on his
head
for mobilizing his people and resistance
to the illegal logging invasions of his
land and he had a realization that
Google Earth could be a tool to
understand the threats that they face
you can even see in the satellite
imagery areas where the land had been
invaded some of these were areas that he
didn't even know about no jugamos moon
Susanne's for genesis of time my
marginal cacao cam is to map sound
Technica when the pseudo you get this
information from google earth they'll
likely go to the area to see if they can
get some really on the ground and
evidence of what's happening while
driving up there you pass a lot of
trucks with logs on them and these are
not government sanctioned shops
we're here with about 15 to 20 members
of the city there aren't a lot of
villages in this part of the territory
so they want to make sure that trees
aren't being cut down illegal miners
there's strange feeling of you don't
know who's out here anybody that you're
gonna run into out there it's probably
not a good thing they're probably not
your friend we did see evidence of
people coming into the territory we saw
illegal roads that loggers had made we
saw illegal camp sites throughout the
night I would hear these trucks rumbling
up and down the road what's really
needed in these kind of situations
is like a near real-time alerting system
that is getting fresh imagery fresh data
and can detect when changes happen and
then sending an alert to people that may
care about that the idea is that they
could see almost in real time what is
happening in a certain area we've built
a platform we called Google Earth engine
we have hundreds of feeds of satellite
data and so on coming in you can do
massively parallel computation with
thousands of computers on that data for
example where is the forest changing in
the last 24 hours
it's also possible to see longer-term
change in a forest here you can see how
deforestation has encroached on the

he has found insights about the role
that technology could play in helping
indigenous people and he said Google if
you can help us put ourselves on the map
then that will strengthen us

actually the start of helping indigenous
