first look at the nest protect this is a
smoke and carbon monoxide detector it's
also probably the most beautiful smoke
and carbon monoxide detector and the
most expensive you'll ever see cost a
hundred and twenty nine dollars there
are plenty of competitors that cost
around fifty dollars but don't have the
Wi-Fi capability so it works with other
nest smoke detectors in your house it
can actually talk to those smoke
detectors and tell them when an event is
happening so that you can be alerted no
matter where you are in the house it
also works with an app so that you can
check your phone or get an alert if
something's going on in your house that
might be dangerous it also allows you to
wave to silence an alarm so you don't
have to get a broomstick and stand on a
chair I've been using two of these
devices in my own house for a couple of
days and I can tell you that in my
casual test they work well when I've
tested with a special smoke device
that's meant for testing smoke detectors
the alarm sounds very loud it also
sounds in other rooms and tells you
where the smoke is happening these smoke
detectors work with the nest thermostat
and if you've heard of that it's a
thermostat that is a Wi-Fi thermostat
you can operate that thermostat with the
same app that operates this a smoke
detector there are two versions of the
nest protect one that you can hardwire
into your houses electrical system and
another that works off of six
lithium-ion double-a batteries thanks
for watching I'm Lindsay Turrentine this
has been a first look at the nest
protect smoke detector</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
