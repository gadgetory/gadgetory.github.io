drive-in with Dan section Walter Eastman
writes in to ask Dan Gurney what's the
best all-round Street track sports car
you've ever driven to which gurney
simply replies a gt350 Mustang guess
what we've got with us today let's see
if gurney would be just as simple and
just as positive in his endorsement
Ford breathed on almost
every part of a Mustang to create the
gt350 one of the most obvious changes
you can spot from the outside is the
whole front clip so they pushed out the
front track on the wheels almost an inch
and a half as a result the bodywork has
to reach out to cover it you get
different fenders and a different hood
than on any other Mustang now on top of
the GT 350 you've also got the very rare
our model only two seats they lose the
back carbon fiber wheels extraordinarily
unusual a magnetorheological adaptive
suspension is standard on the are
optional on the 350 and ideally no radio
no air conditioning no rear carpet you
can spot one by the red grill back then
we've seen the insides of the new
Mustang before nothing dramatically
different there a couple of additional
gauges three choices of gearbox for the
rear wheel drive six-speed manual manual
6 feet or 6 on the floor learn to drive
it that's your only choice here in the
head unit you can have a basic display
radio like we have here or you can go
all the way up to their latest sync 3
touchscreen system or all the way down
to a stripped are as I mentioned with
nothing there no radio no a/c and here's
your drive mode selector on the steering
wheel other Mustangs put it as a toggle
down here it's able to harness all these
different drive modes you see on the
dash but unlike other mustangs it can
also roll in
an adaptive suspension as part of its
mix this is the first Ford ever to have
that now whether you get a 350 or a 350
are you got the same mill a 5.2 liter
naturally aspirated v8 no turbo no blow
or nothing like that
526 horsepower that's nearly a hundred
and two horsepower per liter a number
called specific output and in this case
it's the highest one Ford's ever posted
without a turbo or a blower at fault the
redline is 8250 peak horsepower occurs
near that compare this to a Camaro z28
which uses a much larger 7 litre engine
to get a lower 505 horse and only 72
horse per liter though it does make more
torque and it uses technologies like low
friction design for internal resistance
free breathing heads and bow lots of
lightning they took away as much weight
as they could
we've heard all that before to be honest
but you probably haven't heard before is
deep in the heart something called a
flat plane crank crank shaft has counter
weights at 90 degrees offset what a flat
plane crank does is changes that 90
degree to 180 degrees the engine buyers
from bank to bank and you get better
exhaust scavenging so one cylinder
doesn't disrupt the flow of the next
cylinder
some say oh it's a flat playing Craig
maybe it's gonna sound like a Ferrari
yeah like a Ferrari in a denim jacket
hopped up on meth
about this vehicle that I noticed
immediately as it is the godson Animorph
302 my favorite modern Mustang ever
white crisp muscular but not
that's my kind of Mustang utterly and
completely drivable every day some
people are gonna find it not hard-edged
enough not feeling special enough
I would consider them to be purists
without a cause
now I focus on the gt350 in this story
today because it's gonna be a lot more
accessible VR is gonna be
extraordinarily low production as far as
we can tell and the 350 does most of
what you want at a nice price
psychologically comes in under 50 grand
with delivery but then you've got this
very difficult decision to make you can
get the track package for 6500 which
gets you the adaptive suspension heavy
duty front Springs the drive control a
spoiler in the rear a tower brace and
heavy duty coolers or the tech package
which also gets you adaptive suspension
heavy springs and drive control but then
add two infotainment like a better audio
system sync three power seats and voice
operated nav 7500 for that if you're
curious and our ads about thirteen five
to either configuration I'd go tech
package and that gets you to about 56 -
out the door that's a pretty good value
for a car that has such track prowess
and such nice street manners which is
becoming the theme in the
high-performance market from MacLaren's
to challengers to Camaros most cars that
are super brawny
realize they also have to have clean
fingernails or cars driven see next
