host Eric McClure live from CNET's
always busy Taos New Mexico Bureau and
joining me live in the CNET Studios
there in San Francisco are Kelsey Adams
Jeff Sparkman and behind the controls
today as always
Steven Beecham and we also have a very
special guest there in the studio today
as well if you don't know his name you
probably should because he's the man who
is helping to shape the voice of our
species if not our entire planet among
many other titles he's the president of
Medi International which stands for
messaging extraterrestrial intelligence
which is what we'll be talking with him
about today
please welcome dr. Douglas BA coach oh
god
so for the next 30 minutes or so we're
gonna be talking about the search for
alien intelligence and what do we do
beyond just looking for et you can be a
part of the conversation in our YouTube
and livestream chat chat rooms and you
can also tweet at us at crave see our AV
e and at Eric C Mac with any questions
or comments we'll be monitoring those so
to start Doug a lot of people I think
probably know what SETI is the the
search for extraterrestrial intelligence
but you've started a new organization
just in the last couple of months here
called a messaging extraterrestrial
intelligence well what is that exactly
what's Medi as you say SETI is well
understood so the search for
extraterrestrial intelligence using big
radio telescopes to look for signals
from alien civilizations at distant
stars and so SETI has been going on for
over 55 years now and it's getting
bigger and better and more powerful
every year but many looks at the
flipside so at many international we're
asking the question what happens if
everyone out there in the cosmos is
doing exactly what we're doing
everyone's listening but no one is
taking the initiative to make contact
and so our core mission is to create
messages
that would be representative of
humankind and send them out into the
cosmos and you know messaging is also a
bit broader we have to grapple with how
to actually create a message and how do
you understand communication and
intelligence here on our own world but
there's an interrelated suite of
research and educational projects we
have they're all related to this idea of
innovative ways to make contact with
extraterrestrial intelligence so I guess
you know the first question a lot of
people would ask and some of us some of
the folks there in the room we've had
conversations about know why is this
something we would want to do I mean why
is it a good idea I mean some might say
it's potentially a dangerous idea
depending on who hears the message or
reads the message right right well I
think the short answer is throughout
human history we've learned a lot when
we encounter new cultures and so
encountering a radically alien culture
gives us an opportunity to get a
completely new perspective on ourselves
but Eric you asked this great question
it might be interesting but is it safe
and no less a brilliant person than
Stephen Hawking has said whatever you do
do not transmit our location to the
earth the extraterrestrials they may
come and strip-mine our planet and you
know who knows what would happen so we
should shut up I guess my response to
Stephen Hawking is twofold first of all
when he said that when he gave her that
warning back in 2009 he had no idea that
planets like Earth are plentiful so look
the man is indisputably a genius but he
can't predict the future now we know
that there are like planets everywhere
the other point maybe even more
important is that if there's a
civilization that has the ability to
travel between the stars and do whatever
they went to us here they can pick up I
Love Lucy Howard Stern and see that
transmissions that are going out there
so
so we've already exposed ourselves the
idea of being intentional about our
messaging is saying let's not just let
accidental leakage be our ambassadors
let's decide what we want to say to
another world so it's not you're not
honestly pessimistic but you have to
play them oh yeah okay good good
good it's one thing to say yes they
already know we're here but that doesn't
necessarily mean that we are actively
pestering them and try to get their
attention you know we could get
prioritized like oh well they're clearly
challenging us let's go stop them where
oh well they're clearly pacifist in a
week let's go take them you know and so
what we need to do is look at the
motivations that they might have but if
we look at human history we see that
attempts to isolate ourselves from other
civilizations typically hasn't turned
out well and so that if in fact they do
know that we're here already
my stance is that it's best to take that
message in control if they're actually
going to come and arrive here then let's
have an encounter with them and let's
let them know that we want to engage but
is it actually I mean isn't it maybe
slightly more likely that our our
relationship when we meet them will be
you know that great cultural insight we
get is more likely to be the smallpox
equivalent you know like we're likely to
be on the wiped out and of that scale
well we're likely if the
extraterrestrials get here they are
technologically and superior to us so so
the reality is you know they could do
whatever they want but my position is if
they are going to come here you know I
don't want to just wait and cower in the
corner and let them do whatever but let
them know that there is more that they
can benefit from from having us as
intelligent interlocutors than simply to
wipe us out that that that you know I
think one of the challenges that people
often have and one of the reasons people
have been opposed to many in the past is
the whole idea of what in the world do
we have to say if they have the ability
to travel between the stars or even if
they're staying at home but there are a
million years longer lived and we are
what do we have to say that is a value
you know in a sense I think it's almost
a cosmic inferiority complex that we
have but I would say look there may be
wiser aliens out there or
technologically powerful aliens there's
never going to be a more human alien
though so I think there's something
unique about us that they can't create
in the test tube very classic sci-fi
perspective I think it's a
no and I think that's true because you
know this this isn't just about
technology this is about you know what
do we care about and so I think that's
the other flipside of the benefit of
doing this it's not even if we make
contact but in the process of crafting
the messages that we stand out we need
to think about what do we care about how
do we want to represent ourselves yeah
so you you guys created a website called
earth speaks which allows people to
upload their messages to the aliens and
and a lot of the people we're talking
about you found it interesting that a
lot of people were talking about that we
don't think of ourselves as alone in the
universe right and that's that's an
important distinction for aliens to know
that we were not that you know we're not
so we don't think that we're so amazed
we we don't think that we're so amazing
you know one of the things SETI
scientists have often speculated about
is if we actually do make contact then
the differences between cultures here on
earth are going to seem miniscule in
comparison of the differences between us
and extraterrestrials and so the idea is
that if we make contact it'll be sort of
a unifying nature we won't think of
ourselves as coming from different
nations or religions yeah turns out that
actually thinking about the messages we
want to send start that process so one
of the themes we saw in those earth
speaks messages are it's not like I come
from California or I'm a Buddhist or I'm
a Christian but I'm a member of the
planet Earth and we want to make contact
that's cool very interesting what sorts
of messages have you guys sent out any
messages now I mean I know like Voyager
sent out things a long time ago but are
you guys sent to be actively sending
messages now and what types of message
are you sending we are our organization
isn't sending messages but there have
been over the last couple of decades a
number of messages that have gone out as
you mentioned the Voyager spacecraft
went out with a metal recording images
sounds of Earth greetings in 55
languages there has been the Pioneer
plaque on a couple of Pioneer spacecraft
that NASA has launched and there have
been demonstrations of our ability to
transmit
so from the world's largest radio
telescope in Arecibo Puerto Rico there
was a powerful transmission in 1974 and
a couple of follow up lines so we're
very interested in if you go to our
website and look at our strategic plan
this outlines what our goals are over
the next three years and our goal is to
have messages go out but we want to
really engage in a conversation about
what should be in those messages and and
are there rest
I mean you've raised questions Kelsey
about is it dangerous to do that we want
to have that very transparent discussion
what I hear when SETI scientists talk
about this is that people are getting
worried about this for no reason that
you know again it's if the aliens can do
us any harm it's too late and so let's
take the message into our own hands so
when I knew you were coming in Doug I
actually dug up some reporting I did
like a decade ago when I was a public
radio reporter and I went down to a
place in southern New Mexico where
they're basically burying low-level
nuclear waste about a half-mile under
the ground and so I talked to the people
who are trying to come up with what kind
of signs would we put at this site so
that you know 10,000 years down the road
people know not to dig and to keep out
you know how do you design a sign for a
culture that's probably gonna be very
different than ours if there is one and
it strikes me is very similar to the
kind of thing that you're working on
only what you're working on is
cosmically harder and you know what they
came up with well I mean was almost
cartoonish and and and so basic yeah
that's it right there it's great it's
great if the extraterrestrials have a
face like we do but yeah but you're
right so they wanted to communicate and
and I suspect the folks who put that
together we're not very sanguine about
the English text being intelligible
right but actually it and and the
challenge of marking these nuclear waste
sites so again the goal is make
something that's going to be meaningful
ten thousand years from now after
languages have changed radically but
make this also something that's not so
intriguing that the aliens are going to
take it as a challenge so you know one
was to to put up something kind of
dangerous and spiky and make it look
like oh there's something hazardous here
or you might you might leave a message
but you can't construct it out of
materials that are valuable if it's a
valuable metal people are going to strip
it away and the message won't remain so
one of the one of the recommendations
that a semiotician a scholar who focuses
on the theory of science thomas sebeok
had said is that you actually have to
have what he called a nuclear priesthood
a priesthood in which you actually carry
on from generation to generation the
message so that that message can be
adapted to changing language and
changing cultures and so that you don't
leave the message to an artifact but you
leave it to a community that has as its
goal communicating that warning so
considering an oral tradition is
actually being more more lasting an oral
tradition as being more reliable and you
know we tend to think that the the
written word is the sacrosanct the way
of communicating but you know if you
look at how some text sacred texts have
been communicated early Buddhist
writings were well writings they were
actually there was a strong oral
tradition long before a written
tradition that doesn't mean it was
inaccurate it's just they made a
commitment to communicate orally there
been any real specific strategies that
have been developed yet for you know
devising messages or how we think about
these messages that we could possibly
send out there have been and the the key
is to try to figure out what is
universal so aliens are not going to
speak English or Swahili or French
they're not going to speak any of our
natural languages so what language do we
have in common with an alien well if
we're sending a radio signal to another
world and they can build a radio
telescope we know that we have one thing
in common with them engineering and it
seems likely that if you're going to be
a savvy engineer you've got to know the
basics of math at least two plus two
equals four and so that's the basic idea
of starting with a language that builds
on fundamental math
and scientific concepts and use that as
a foundation but then the challenge of
course is if we only say yeah we know
about the periodic table of elements as
well what's the point of this whole
thing and so what we want to do is
leverage one of those possibly universal
languages to talk about something that
is unique about ourselves so Steve
mentioned the Voyager recording that has
music from around Earth well if you
think about it music is really kind of
beautiful because in many ways the basic
structure of music can be described in
terms of mathematics and physics the
things that an astronomer on other world
should know about as well and yet it
conveys something about our emotionality
so those music you know Steve is playing
now the sounds of a baby from the golden
record and now that's that's part of
humanity what about me so you're talking
about music
what about like Close Encounters of the
Third Kind they have that musical piece
do do do do do do you think there's any
I think that's jeopardy there is now I
wish I wish that the mothership would
come to earth yeah and we could actually
have this Jam that's right so I'm not
counting on that but I do think the idea
of communicating in a musical way really
frees us up from this hegemony that math
and science have had so you know the
folks who are most interested in SETI
are mathematicians and computer
scientists and astronomers and so they
tend to think about you know this is
what I want to know about yeah but I
think we also need to get out of that
mindset and so think about alternative
ways of communicating as well so now
when you when you say I know I know
you're joking but when you say you'd be
excited if the the mothership came down
you know so I wonder what your first
response is emotionally when you hear
stories like did you hear the story over
the weekend that there were some tapes
released by NASA that proved that
Apollo 10 astronauts heard like alien
music did you see doc going around the I
didn't see it but you know we get
contacted all the time by people who
said I've had an encounter and my
response is excellent
show me something physical because I'm a
scientist I need evidence it's it's the
same standard we use when we're looking
for a signal from another star we get a
signal on a radio telescope it looks
good but now we have to follow up to
make sure it's not a glitch make sure
it's not some smart graduate students at
MIT perpetuating the hoax that we want
to know if it's a real signal so if
someone has evidence of an
extraterrestrial having come here bring
it to me and show it to me and I'd love
to see it well actually we do have a
video that we produce for CNET and it is
of the the sound that they heard on
Apollo 10 so I'll just play that real
quick for it's only like 40 seconds okay
very good
Richard yeah it sounds like you know how
to space-time music
okay Stan my best one and three high
voltage are preset that's one
well that sure is weird music
now get the whistling you know like an
outerspace type thing so is that is that
sort of like what you guys hear all the
time I agree it sounds like weird news
yeah it sounds like radio interference
and so then the question is if you
really think that's an indication of
another intelligence where's the
evidence of that so we we use a basic
philosophical principle that is hundreds
of years old
Occam's razor which is the simplest
explanation and you know I I'm hearing
the audio recording of a technologically
very sophisticated and yet a little bit
bumpy and kind of seem to the pants
operation the early space mission yeah
my natural explanation is sounds like
something kicking in on the radio so I
don't I don't hear anything and I wish I
did
I wish I heard something you know the
other thing to keep in mind and and this
is true - when people see things in the
sky that they can't explain I don't
doubt people are seeing things they're
making sense out of it the most
reasonable explanation they can come up
with it it must be an alien well human
beings evolved to make sense out of a
chaotic and and unpredictable world
we're very good at that and if we don't
know what something is we'll come up
with an explanation the question is is
that initial explanation that we come up
with the actual true explanation and
that's where we need to maintain
skepticism you know in ways I'm glad to
hear the x-files is coming on oh yes I
feel like I'm sort of a cross between
Mulder and Scully I want to believe but
I need the evidence you you've had a
close encounter I when I was in college
I did see a UFO the one that you hear
reports of with like the three red
lights and a huge triangle and I did
write a story for first seen it last
year kind of finally I I found some
evidence that finally debunks that
experience but it was a real but it was
a real experience you have the
experience it was you you saw what
couldn't otherwise be explained and that
was year
ago that you saw it and it takes a while
to come up with you know how do you
explain this and again this is the
problem that we have in SETI as well I
mean for people who followed steady
fairly closely you've heard about the
WoW signal so in the 1970s there's this
this a huge signal that was detected at
The Ohio State University Observatory
the Big Ear and it looks like exactly
what you would want to see but there's
only one problem it's never replicated
and so we require replication I don't
have to look good but the problem is
we're looking for things like our own
radio and TV signals all the time so we
need something that can be independently
replicated as proof of an
extraterrestrial well over the last six
months I mean there's there has been a
pretty interesting lead and you and I
have corresponded about it in the past
which is tabi star which is that star
that has some crazy stuff orbiting it
and it could be a swarm of comets or or
perhaps alien mega-structure see what
was what was your initial reaction you
no matter what your emotional reaction
was when you first heard the details
what was not you were excited or you're
like you got to be skeptical well it can
be both because I'm excited because
there's a specific target so again a
little of the history the full name of
the star is kic 846 2852 myelin
preference is it's it's called tabbies
star all over the place honestly I think
it's a bit sexist so it was it was
identified by an astronomer named
Tabitha Boyajian let's call boy AG and
star I mean there's the you know that
there is one of the early stars that we
just discovered very near Earth is
Barnard star we don't call it edy star
so boy aging star beautiful star because
it was identified as by the Kepler
mission NASA's Kepler mission which
looks for a slight dimming of a planet
as it travels between the the star and
us here on earth so when that passed by
go happens there's this minor Deming so
an earth-sized planet it dims by maybe a
million the wondrous thing about
voyaging star is that dimming happened
by up to 20%
and when you and I talked back in
november/december Eric the hope was that
well there's a natural explanation maybe
just at the right time Kepler was
looking at this star there's a swarm of
comets that went by and that's what
accounted for it and there would be a
freaky accident
so why was Kepler looking at right just
the right time freaky things happen when
you're looking at a hundred fifty
thousand stars so it could have been the
case and so for several months the
cometary explanation was the best
explanation but now looks like that's
off the table over the last couple of
weeks an astronomer has pointed out
who's gone back to the records over the
last century and seeing that there's
actually been a low-level dimming over
the course of a hundred years so that
would require a huge flock of comets and
so the cometary explanation doesn't seem
any good so you know it was a it was a
one possibility that would suggest as
maybe it's this huge mega structure that
was created by extraterrestrial
engineers put in orbit sometimes people
talk about it as a Dyson swarm named
after physicist Freeman Dyson so it's
something in orbit maybe to capture the
sunlight of That star and that's what's
occluding us and so our question was if
in fact there is an alien mega-structure
might be there be aliens who are
signaling to us so there have been
observations at the SETI Institute Allen
telescope array and Metis International
is collaborating with an observatory in
Panama bouquet de Panama to look for
brief laser pulses bad news is we
haven't seen Danny we didn't expect to
and so that's the skepticism part of my
reaction the initial reaction is what's
great you know this this is the kind of
thing that we would want to look at but
then we have to actually look there and
see if we see any evidence and so far no
evidence of an alien civilization at
least sending intentional signals right
they'd have to the way you're looking as
I understand it it would have to be
really intentional it would have to be
your terror TV signals if their TV
signals you know the
the III was making the case earlier that
if you have if you're an alien
civilization that has the ability to to
travel to earth and do us any harm you
can pick up our leakage signals that's
not true for us I mean humans we our
technology cannot pick up our lead
leakage radiation even at the distance
of the nearest star so for us to succeed
in our contemporary SETI projects we
need to have a directly transmitted
signal now we have the technology to do
that so you go to the world's largest
radio telescope in Arecibo Puerto Rico
this huge dish carved into the side of
the earth that can transmit powerful
signals used in asteroid studies it's
mapping these earth-threatening
asteroids that comes swooping by earth
periodically and that can also be used
and has been used to transmit messages
so you know on a galactic scale if there
are civilizations out there I'm guessing
we're pretty rudimentary but even a
young civilization like ours has the
ability to send a message that another
comparably young civilization could pick
up and so that's that's what MIDI
International is interested in using
that capacity we're not gonna we're not
going to let you know any anything from
any of the Sigourney Weaver alien movies
that could come to earth and do us harm
know about us but if there's another
twin of Earth with a comparable
technology to ours that could be a
message that really does provide the
first indication that we're here so is
there a list of likely targets right now
if there was a message that was that was
ready and we were ready to send it out
well what would we aim it at like
Proxima Centauri or you know a gene star
what III would I certainly sent one to
boy AG and star why not you know the
only downside is it takes close to 1,500
years to get there so a reply wouldn't
be for another three thousand years that
light that were seen from boy AG and
star right now left shortly after the
fall of the Roman Empire so you know for
anyone who has any concerns about what's
going to happen on earth actually
picking a target far away it has a nice
element my preference would actually be
to target stars that are close to Earth
so you know one way to think about it is
well how many stars are there that are
even close to Earth so if you go out
25 parsecs it's an astronomical unit
it's about a little over 80 light years
the distance light can travel in in 80
years
they're about 2,800 stars and from
Arecibo you could target about 1/10 that
they're about 800 or so of those stars
and I would sample those stars that can
be targeted from Arecibo that we already
know have planets around them there are
27 of those targets but on the other
hand what we're learning every day is
that almost every star has planets
around them there are a lot of stars
that we haven't detected their planets
but just on statistical rounds we've
done enough of a sampling to know that
planets are everywhere so there are a
lot of advantages to targeting nearby
stars and the advantage there is you
know at its best
Mette is a long-term project but
potentially success could come in
decades maybe centuries rather than
millennia if we focus on relatively
nearby stars so you know there's this
there's this concept called the Fermi
paradox that I'm sure you're familiar
with which you know basically says well
space is so huge and gigantic that there
should be aliens out there but then
where are they so I wonder what what's
your answer are they are they dead are
they really far away yet to evolve
what's most likely do you think well
there are a lot of explanations
consistent with the fact that they're
not here you know there's some people
would say well the aliens are here
they're the UFOs but again I haven't
seen evidence that convinces me and so
then the general argument of Fermi's
paradox is that if if they've been
around for millions of years
even if space travel is kind of slow
then why haven't they come here well one
possibility is that they do have an
ability you know maybe in fact even the
nearby stars are populated but they're
simply waiting for us to take the
initiative you know if you use the Star
Trek analogy maybe they have a prime
directive but we all know that in Star
Trek once that less advanced
civilisation says hello then the
floodgates are open and you can
communicate whatever you want so you
know that's what I would like to test
I'd like to test the zoo
hypothesis I've actually target all of
the nearby stars and see whether we can
evoke a response so you know I think one
reasonable explanation for the Fermi
paradox is it just no paradox at all
I mean it's potentially possible it's
conceivable to travel between the stars
it takes a long time and anything you'd
really want you can get by sending an
interstellar email so it you can travel
at the speed of light it's a lot cheaper
to communicate by radio signals laser
pulses than it is to actually physically
move yourself and so that's what SETI
and Metis are based on the idea that we
can we can get most different all of
what we really want to know about
another civilization a lot faster and a
lot cheaper by sending and receiving
electromagnetic signals hey Douglas I
have a couple questions from our chat
room yeah someone asked Gareth Glover
asked he's making a big big big fit
about not being it not having his
question ass right away okay yeah Gareth
Glover does the United Nations have a
protocol in place for first contact if
we do make contact video the United
Nations does not but you know if Gareth
has an inroad to the secretary-general
of the United Nations send the contact
information because I would love it if
the United Nations made this their top
priority the reality is they haven't in
fact there is an international setting
group called the International Academy
of astronautics that has a group of
ongoing SETI people who've been working
40 or more years and they've developed
protocols so the protocols that guide
what happens if we make contact have
been developed by the scientists who are
actually doing SETI and and so those
protocols say if we detect a signal
first of all confirm it and then
transmit and those protocols also say
that in the event of detecting a signal
there should be no reply until there has
been international consultation but one
of the big debates of that SETI group
within the International Academy of
astronautics over the course of several
years was well should that protocol
applied before we've made contact
and the the majority a strong majority
said repeatedly we're not even going to
touch that issue because the situation
is quite different you know if we
actually make contact you can bet the
United Nations will take this up but in
the meantime your hands are tied if
you're waiting to get permission from
the United Nations you know if you look
at international space law to give you
guidelines about what to do one of the
basic principles of international law is
that if something isn't prohibited it's
allowed and we've tried to get space
lawyers involved and what they point out
is that the legal framework isn't easy
to apply to extraterrestrials because
the laws are meant to regulate the
interactions between human beings
they're not even constructed to regulate
what we do with other beings so the the
basic restrictions on communicating are
at this point regulatory you need a
license from your home country to be
able to transmit and so those are the
ways that there are some restrictions on
communication does anyone know when the
space lawyers reality show goes that's
right I know some great people who'd be
guests for you I have a couple more
there's a lot of people in our
livestream chat that are saying can the
aliens please take Donald Trump with
them when they come geez but also
there's someone Weapon X and our YouTube
chat is asking asking do you believe
that aliens are already here and live
amongst us you know I don't because I've
had no one come up to me and introduce
him or her or itself so it is easy to
create a conspiracy theory about there
being hidden information honestly I
don't know that the US government or any
other major government is able to keep a
secret like that
I mean they can barely deliver the mail
so so I don't I don't I don't hold out a
lot but but what do you do with the
conspiracy theory of saying the aliens
are here but they're keeping it a secret
I don't know what to do with that so I
haven't seen the evidence again if there
is some concrete physical evidence that
you can share with me I want to see it
I heard some news story that Hillary
Clinton said that she would at least
release all these documents about aliens
if she was president but we know Jay was
a joke you know Jimmy Carter became
president said I want to know and I know
release the information and I don't know
if you got follow-through or not but if
we don't know anything since then so you
know I wonder taking kind of the the
long view of things you know I imagine
with the work you do you probably end up
thinking a lot about the human race as
much as think about alien races so I
wonder if overall if you would consider
yourself pessimistic or optimistic about
our long-term future and let me frame
this kind of in terms of you know the
way the the new space industry is is
very often framed you know people like
Elon Musk say we need to we need to get
to Mars to become a multiplanetary
species because we're ruining the earth
and so there's this very pessimistic
view but I've been to a few space
confidence one guy at the Space
conference I started talking about you
know I don't care what happens on earth
we need to colonize you know Mars and
and the asteroid belt because you
imagine what a hundred quadrillion
humans like the potential of that which
is not a view you hear very often I
wonder which one resonates more with you
yeah I think it's a cop-out to say that
we can't control our own fate and so we
need a back-up plan I mean I think it's
fine I think it's good to explore I
think it's it's sort of in our genes
we're an exploratory species so let's go
out there but yeah I sometimes hear
people say you know if we discover
aliens out there if we if we actually
pick up a signal from an
extraterrestrial finally we'll have
vindication we can do it we can last
that long we don't need to look outside
to get that vindication even if no one
else has done it humankind should do it
and you know the big opposition within
SETI circles to a sustained Metis
project there's not any concerns about
aliens it's a concern that we're not
mature enough to be able to sustain a
project that's going to last over the
course of centuries and millennia my
view is we have nothing to lose you know
I think the the having the image of
humans as
as a species that can look to the future
make plans for the future and hope and
act as if we will be around to get a
reply back can do nothing but good and
so in in a subtle way I think that the
actions of preparing for contact and
preparing to be around can have a
salutary impact on how we view our self
as a species and it is as much an act of
hope as it is an act of scientific
exploration I'm curious if you are aware
of or your thoughts on the organization
belong now which is also based in time
Cisco and have a great bar everybody the
interval don't belong now I I agree go
to the interval the long now has exactly
the mindset that we mean because they
are building a clock that will last on a
timescale of ten thousand years and you
know scientific research is not funded
on ten thousand year timescales we're
looking and you know when when
scientific research is funded by
Congress you've got representatives who
are elected every two years and senators
every six years everyone is thinking on
such short timescales I mean if if
something comes popular it suddenly the
president's out there saying then we're
going to Mars we're going to Mars and
even if you get an individual president
who's committed to going to Mars
that president has eight years and a new
president comes in and up ends the
agenda and says I'm sorry not Mars
asteroids so the mindset of the long now
is the perfect mindset of saying we
humans at the beginning of the 21st
century are used to instant
gratification we want everything in this
now but if we're going to survive as a
species we need to extend that now and
so that it lasts until the end of the
day and the end of the week and the year
in the decade and the century and the
millennium maybe even 10,000 years but
when funding and political support can
change on a dime how do you how do you
mean in practical terms work for the
long no well I think you have to first
of all look for some funding that can
sustain a long term project like an
endowment
and you identify models that aren't as
resource intensive so for example SETI
is typically operated by big projects a
big project that takes millions of
dollars per year it's great you build it
up you have that money for a decade if
the money disappears then the project
disappears and even if you get more
funding a few years later you have to
build the group from scratch so the
approach we're using that many
international is a different model where
we're using more modest telescopes like
the one that been shoots is operating go
to optical SETI org and you'll see his
Observatory in Panama and that is it's
not just a run-of-the-mill backyard
astronomers telescope but it's it is
technically sophisticated he's a retired
engineer he's put his heart and soul in
this but it is operated by someone who's
doing it out of love I mean the true
meaning of being an amateur and so that
is sustainable that he has the resources
on his own to make his contribution so
you combine that with other smaller
scale observatories and we can really
have an ongoing effort that isn't
necessarily n't on these massive
influxes of money that can sustain
itself over the course of decades
citizen science on an organized scale
and you know the beauty of that and one
of the things that that we encountered
when we were using that telescope to
observe Boyajian star is it was visible
from Panama at the worst possible time
in Panama because it was the rainy
season so out of the course of about
four weeks of observing we only had a
half a dozen clear night so you want
other observatories where it's a good
observing and you can coordinate the
activities so there's a modest amount
you can do at one location but you
multiply that by 10 or by a hundred you
can get a lot done and if we actually do
detect a signal so we're looking at by
aging star we see exactly what we want
we want to make sure that someone else
can track that star when it sets in
Panama
as a visible somewhere else so the most
important question before we wrap up
yessum are you a sci-fi fan and if so
which which franchises you know III have
to say that Close Encounters is the one
it had special meaning because you know
I was I was a kid that was about 16 when
this thing came out and the aliens come
and you're actually able to make contact
so that would have to be toward the top
of the list if you're looking at
franchises I would say Star Trek and
from the perspective of creating an
interstellar message or really trying to
understand aliens I'm going to give the
first half a dozen episodes or so of
enterprise when they're linguist was
really grappling with trying to
understand you know it's endlessly
fascinating I could have taken five
seasons of that grappling myself but in
sci-fi you have to make concessions and
actually let everyone speak English
pretty soon but I'll give those first
few episodes of the enterprise relaunch
alright great well before we wrap things
up anything else you want people to know
about Medi yeah check out our website
it's Medi org come to our Facebook page
we are always updating the materials and
keep on the lookout for what we'll be
doing in the coming months we'll be
doing more to really grapple with the
whole question of what is intelligence
here on earth and what does that mean
beyond and so I look forward to letting
people know about that as well that's a
whole can of worms ba coach thank you
very much for joining us on the clave
cast and we'll be sure to keep in touch
and keep people informed on your work
here on crave on SEANET and I want to
thank everyone else Stephen Beecham
thank you so much for helping set this
up and of course Kelsey Adamson Jeff
Sparkman Bonnie Burton is sick today we
hope you are feeling better and we'll
see you on the next crave cast thanks
for tuning in see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
