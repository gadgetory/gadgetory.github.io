I'm Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update people are always hungry for news
about the next iPhone and we have a
fresh batch of rumors on the plastic
models that are said to be coming out in
the fall a chinese tech blog says the
factory Foxconn has begun making an
entry-level iphone in multiple colors a
french website posted photos of what
could be the colorful back plates they
are bright lime green yellow and red
reminds me of skittles but these are not
the same shades of colors that you'll
find in the existing ipod nano lineup
also from china it said that these
cheaper iphones won't be really super
cheap they could be the same cost as an
older iPhone 4 or 4s model the pebble
smartwatch has been a popular
Kickstarter project but now it's coming
to best buy the SmartWatch syncs with
iPhones and Android phones to show
alerts when you're getting a text
message or a call and also lets you
control music and some apps like
RunKeeper it lasts a week on one charge
it will be sold at best buy stores and
online starting on Sunday for a hundred
and fifty dollars but it'll only carry
the black version at first the red model
arrives in August and you'll have to go
to the pebble website to get the orange
grey and white colors if you're a
college student shopping for laptops
keep an eye out for different promotions
going on Apple has an early jump on the
back to school rush and it discounts the
price of computers for college students
it also throws in a hundred dollar app
store gift card for buying a mac
students can also get a fifty dollar
gift card for buying an ipad or iphone
now that Google Reader is a goner it's
time to set up an alternative app to
keep up on the latest post from your
favorite news sites and blogs check out
feedly pulse or also the new digg app on
iOS google reader users have until July
fifteenth to download a copy of their
favorite feeds before the data is
permanently deleted and also on July
fifteenth Sony's new 4k TV media player
will be hitting stores it plays ultra
high resolution video but you're
probably not going to buy it that's
because it only works with the new Sony
4k TVs which
start at five grand for the 55 inch
model and then you have to buy the 4k
player for another five hundred dollars
and that's the discounted price it
includes 10 films and video shorts with
4k resolution in the fall Sony will
launch a video service so you can rent
4k movies for eight dollars a pop
there's just not that much 4k content
available right now so it's worth
waiting for the price to go down but if
you like spending money because you just
have to be the first to have this new
resolution well more power to you that
your tech news update you can find more
