airplanes when you're a kid then the
carbon flyer is one for the grown-ups
I'm Lexie CBDs has seen it here at CES
2015 the carbon flyer is a carbon fiber
airplane now you can control it from
your smartphone over Bluetooth you have
a range of around 80 yards so you can
take it out to the park or even possibly
a football field that it will have great
now it's got dual motors right here and
you can control them through the app as
I said by sliding fighting the dial up
and down to increase your strength also
on the front is a 720p HD camera so you
can view all the video after it's been
shot now there's no live stream but it
records to micro SD card so you can look
at all your thrills and spills after the
fact also within the app you can see
things like the weather you can also
turn on an option called flight assist
this helps inexperienced fliers from not
crushing the device too much and just
give them a little bit of extra help now
the carbon flyer is currently a
prototype this one works but it's a
little bit too delicate to show you
flying at the moment but it will be
available in summer for around $200 or
there's around about one week left on
IndieGoGo if you want to preorder it for
$99 this is peanuts first look at the
carbon flyer my name is Lexie see babies
we've seen it here at CES 2015</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
