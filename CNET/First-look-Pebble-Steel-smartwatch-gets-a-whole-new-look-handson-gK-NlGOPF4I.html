Las Vegas and it's all about wearable
tech at this show but one of the biggest
players in wearable tech going back to
last year is pebble makers of the pebble
smartwatch what do they have in the
works now a brand-new watch the pebble
steel it's here on my wrist in all of
its variations there is a brushed
stainless steel finish also a matte
black version and all of them come with
a leather wristband too so the pebble
watch has gotten a lot snazzier it's
available for 249 and it ships January
28th you can order one right now plus
there's a new app store that pebble is
launching there has not been an app
store before so now there is actually
going to be at the end of the month a
marketplace where you can get new apps
including larger partners like Yelp ESPN
and others so it's transforming what you
can do some other new applications for
pebble include a really snazzy Mercedes
app that is aware of what you're doing
in the car as well as providing detailed
information on how your tire pressure is
doing and all of that could this be the
beginning of smarter wearable apps that
are more contextually aware that's
certainly the plan and the pebble steel
looks like it's the launching of a new
effort towards it now the screen on this
is the same as before although it's got
a gorilla glass covering to it so it
looks flashy ER and there's also
speaking of flashy an RGB LED light on
the bottom that glows for notifications
if you wear this on your wrist in analog
mode it actually looks like a regular
analog watch will be interesting to see
how many people can spot that it's
digital at a CES that's full of wearable
tech news the pebble steel is bound to
be one of the largest stories at the
show I'm Scott Stein here at CES 2014 in
Las Vegas
