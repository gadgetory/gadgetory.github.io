Sennheiser RS 175 an RF based wireless
headphone that's designed to work with
your TV or any audio source even a
computer watching video or listening to
music it lists for $280 is one of the
middl models in Sennheiser's 2015 line
of RF headphones Sennheiser touts that
line is having best-in-class wireless
performance courtesy of a proprietary
wireless linking technology that
operates in the 2.4 gigahertz band and
delivers up to a whopping 100 meter
range and since this is RF it doesn't
require line-of-sight and can transmit
through walls the system is comprised of
two components the headphone itself and
a base station that doubles as a
charging stand it's all very simple to
set up on the back the base station has
a digital optical connection as well as
a 3.5 millimeter analog input that
allows you to connect it to a TV or any
audio source with the included cables
most new TVs are equipped with an
optical connection each model in the RF
line offers a bit different sound and
features and we picked this model the RS
175 because it has probably the best
combination of sound performance and
features for the money as far as the
design goes is a comfortable close back
over ear design that does a good job
keeping sound from leaking out so you
don't disturb someone sleeping nearby
but the headphone fits snugly enough
that you may be forced to take some
quick breaks while wearing it over the
course of a 2 hour movie so I wouldn't
call it ultra comfortable the
performance is really good for Wireless
I got a clean signal from several rooms
away from the base station there's a
little base push but overall the sound
is well-balanced and stacks up well
against wired headphones that cost about
the same price so that's saying a lot
battery life is rated at 18 hours this
model features a bass boost option along
with a couple of surround modes that
open up the sound a bit but also add a
touch of hollowness once I got used to
the faux surround
I liked it with movies but you can
toggle between the faux surround and the
standard stereo modes and decide which
one you like best
while there are cheaper Bluetooth
options for using
wireless headphones while watching TV is
Sennheiser's a good option for someone
looking for a strong performing wireless
headphone it doesn't have any latency
issues and offers extended range I'm

that's the Sennheiser our s 175 thanks
for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
