you're going to be able to buy an oculus
rift virtual reality headset that you
can use with your PC I was able to check
it out at e3 and use the headset that
you'll be able to buy then and this is
what it felt like
there have been versions of the rift
that we've seen for years the new one is
a refined lighter weight version that
still has the same resolution and head
tracking technology it uses a camera
with IR that mounts near your desk and
there are 3d audio system earphones that
fit on each side of your head that are
removable the whole thing feels very
lightweight easy to take on and off and
it worked really well with my glasses
the games were intriguing they showed
extra games more like the types of games
you play in your console two of them
Chronos and edge of nowhere by Insomniac
Games they're giant flying alien
creatures it looks like we're a huge
tentacled beast that is much much larger
than me running over my head someone's
whis but the most interesting part was
trying out oculus touch this is oculus
rifts first true VR controller and
trying out a prototype of it here it was
stunning we're standing across from each
other this is so crazy like both in the
same space playing tetherball okay there
we go
it allows you not just to use analog
pads and buttons but to actually move
your fingers so it feels like you're
dipping your hands into a virtual space
you could actually wave or you could
grab something with your fingers and
throw it point to people give a thumbs
up founder Palmer Luckey guided me
through a virtual toy box where I got to
fire laser guns and slingshots and move
remote-control cars around it shows that
VR is about to become something that
feels a lot more real the touch will be
sold separately from the oculus rift the
rift will be bundled with an Xbox one
wireless controller for playing standard
games but the touch shows how oculus
rift could reach beyond
into a whole new dimension</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
