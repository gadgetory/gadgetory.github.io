was finally unveiled at a London press
event the phone's six point two eight
inch display has the biggest screen of
any previous one plus phone but its
overall size remains about the same as
the one plus 5p before it that's because
the six now has a notch yep
similar to the iPhone 10 LG G 7 and
Huawei P 20 the oneplus 6 has a black
tab up top that houses the front-facing
camera in ear speaker and the LED
notification light you'll have the
option to hide this notch though with a
software update the update will blacken
the sides of the notch so you can have a
more traditional looking alert bar on
the back is a oneplus sixes dual rear
cameras like last year there's a
standard 16 megapixel lens and a 20
megapixel telephoto shooter for bouquet
style portrait photos but the cameras
sensor is now 19% larger and it has
optical image stabilization oh is is
especially important for taking steadier
photos and video you'll also be able to
take portrait photos using the
front-facing camera after a software
update with its minimalist take on
Android 8.1 Oreo oneplus kept the
software mostly the same it did add some
navigational gestures though that works
similar to the iPhone 10 including
swiping up and holding for your recent
apps oneplus also added some goodies for
gamers you can now shift the network
data usage of apps running in the
background to maximize the intake of
data you're currently open game is using
you can also choose to have games
display in a low or high resolution to
save battery and you can disable auto
brightness while gaming if you're
interested in getting started with
Google's upcoming OS update the six is
one of the first few phones that could
run Android PE beta
lastly 1 + 4 - 5 - 6 to be a tad more
water resistant than before
now that doesn't mean you can go ahead
and dunk it underwater for any notable
amount of time but the company did say
it can survive a couple of drops here
and there from
rain or an overzealous thing that's not
as impressive as being IP certified for
higher water resistance which the phone
isn't but at least it's something the
phone is available online on May 22nd
and starts at five hundred and twenty
nine dollars for the 64 gig variant for
more information about the one plus six
