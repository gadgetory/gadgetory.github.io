selection of Apple's updated or new for
2015
Mac books we of course got the new
12-inch MacBook that's a Core M system
brand-new very fancy looking apples also
updated the 13-inch MacBook Air that
gets a new processor not that much else
knew about it and of course we've got
the 13-inch MacBook Pro also a new
processor for 2015 and the force touch
trackpad which is kind of fun as well so
if you're looking to buy a new MacBook
which one are you going to get well you
know price is certainly worth
considering here the air still $9.99 and
still a very useful machine although the
design is getting a little bit dated so
that's this big thick bezel around the
side no edge to edge glass over the
screen and it's frankly a lower quality
lower resolution display for $12.99
that's kind of a big jump you can get
the fancy new 12-inch MacBook it's super
light it's super thin it's got this nice
wide key keyboard that's a lot of fun to
use but it's also not as powerful with
that Core M processor fine for basic web
surfing if you do a lot of things at
once frankly it is going to slow down on
you a bit battery life also not as great
as these two guys and you're stuck with
that one USB C port right now and you
probably don't have anything that has a
USB C plug on it so the one that's
probably the most overall useful right
now is this guy the 13-inch MacBook Pro
it's bigger it's heavier it's also
$12.99 same as this guy but you get hdmi
Thunderball bunch of USB 3.0 ports and
you get you know a fast processor end
this very nice-looking Retina display
again with the edge to edge glass looks
great runs great it's hard to decide our
buddy Scott is actually thinking of
buying a new MacBook and now that three
new ones are out he doesn't know which
one to get
so I thought I'd take these over and try
to see what his thinking is right now oh
now Scott hey you've been planning on
buying a new MacBook you guys there's a
cover which all your here that haunt me
again I've got all three of them here
for you Dan why are you torturing me
here's a 20 pain MacBook Air Shara 15
MacBook Pro and the new 2015 12 inch
MacBook
I noticed one of these you want to buy
but you're not short someone you should
buy yeah II what you thinking I'm
totally torn this is this is not an easy
process this year because I want to get
this little I know I like to be portable
but this is a slower processor this has
one port that's is your billing machine
yeah it's my machine yeah I need to go
through and deal with old crap at home
it's - maybe it's gonna break your heart
but for your main machine at home that
you use all day every day all the time
yeah I'm gonna put this little guy aside
for now okay I figured that was probably
going to be the case but we'll say I got
the pro and the air the pro obviously
more more functional more ports and
stuff right better screen that's tempted
are so much cheaper $9.99 still 18 hours
of battery life on our video battery
test I have a hard time with the fact
that it's as a non Retina display and
that probably has everything I need but
I I feel like I would use the Retina
display and the better processing on
this what I am I just gonna wait for of
a multi-year purchase maybe this entry
here you'd go oh now it feels really old
right like two years down the road I'll
maybe feel better for forgetting this
but then you're getting even even a
little bigger and heavier what I really
want was this I want this with the right
in a display that's what I want oh my
god why can't I get that because I'd
rather have your $12.99 then your 990
yes then they say you've got a pick
which one of these I want this I want
this with retina so it sounds like Scott
is not really any closer to a decision I
know he'd love to get my OK to get the
new 12-inch MacBook and I like it a lot
but it's not for everybody
and it's maybe not for your main at home
all day every day machine if you were
looking at by kind of a high point of
each one I'd say the 13-inch MacBook Air
best battery life by several hours and
also least expensive $9.99 hard to go
wrong with that
for $12.99 the MacBook itself is super
sleek lots of fun to use it's actually
got more harddrive space it's got a 256
gig flash storage drive inside and then
kind of the best of all worlds is
probably the pro right here a little bit
less portable but to get good power good
battery life good value lots of
expandability
I'm Dan Ackerman and that will hopefully
help you decide which 2015 MacBook is
right for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
