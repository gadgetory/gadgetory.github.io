joined by eric franklin from cnet a
reviewer who was at the service event
and what were your impressions it seemed
like was more of a pre-announcement than
the announcement of an actual product
right well I did get to touch it so I
guess that proves something right I got
a very brief time to spend with it in
this kind of back room we were all kind
of funnel into this back room in groups
of seven and there were like four
stations back there and each station
went into a different aspect of surface
and at one station I did get a chance to
spend maybe 20 seconds with the surface
tablet where I got to swipe around a
little bit before I was told to pass it
on to the next person did you get any
chance to check out the keyboard I did
but I never got a chance to check out
the keyboard when it was attached to a
surface that was actually turned on all
the guys chance to check out the
keyboard when it was unattached to a
surface or attached to a surface that
wasn't turned on so I never got the
complete typing experience which
Microsoft did play up a lot in the
presentation so what do we need to know
before we get a better sense of whether
the surface is a competitive product to
the ipad or android devices a few
important things like apps battery life
price Microsoft's is going to be
competitive with other tablets but we
don't know what that means that can be
anything so until we know what the price
is going to be so we know what kind of
app supports going to have until we know
how long this thing's going to last on
our lap we don't know how competitive is
going to be against the iPad and other
androids so so would you characterize
this more as a prototype than an actual
real product as something that Microsoft
is using basically to freeze the markets
a hey don't don't buy those iPads right
now wait for this windows 8 system to
come up I think Microsoft has every
intent to release surface but I think
that it also kind of works as a it can
kind of galvanized at you know
manufacturers who are working on windows
8 tablets to be like hey well we were
kind of half-assing it but we've seen
this surface stain the Microsoft's going
full-tilt on this thing so maybe we
should step up our game and come up with
a real actual cool tablet well Eric I
hope you get your hands on one of those
surface units soon and we'll come back
and talk to you I hope so too i'm really
looking for
to it great for Cena time dan farber
