aces showing off to new extremely thin
laptops thin really is the theme here so
let's take a look at what's new first up
is the ace of Swift 7 now this thing is
extremely thin picking it up you can
really feel that it's so light and it's
so slender it weighs just one point one
kilogram so it really is one of the most
portable machines I've ever seen a
consequence of being so thin is that
this thing has barely any ports there's
no USB there's no HDMI what you do get
is some USB type-c and a headphone jack
that's basically it so if you do a lot
of connecting peripherals maybe this
isn't the laptop for you but if you
think you can pair down the things you
need to plug in it might work it's going
on sale in October and it's gonna cost
12 9 9 euros moving on to the next
machine this is the Asus pin 7 now as
the name suggests you can flip this
thing around and it's a convertible so
if you want you can walk around with it
like a very expensive clipboard now Acer
says this is the world's thinnest
convertible and it certainly does feel
very slim it weighs 1.2 kilograms so
again another very portable machine it's
a 14 inch display and ASA was
particularly keen to point out this
extremely thin bezel but the Swift 7 is
also gonna cost 12 9 9 euros when it
goes on sale
one thing I'd like to point out about
both machines is that they've got
absolutely enormous trackpads
I think that's pretty interesting and it
could make them a lot more usable than
some laptops so I'd like to see more of
that that's all for now for much more
