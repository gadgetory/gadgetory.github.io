you dare was episode 272 of the 359
podcast and holy crap it's been a busy
day Ben Fox Ruben Roger Chang and Alfred
Inge
hello everyone Hey how we hanging in
there guys for this late episode doing
great I mean we just I know I just got
back from stamps in the vent
a few hours ago gas pumped yeah I've
checked out the latest grants from
Samsung and we're gonna mine you for a
variety of yes I was play the Samsung
Galaxy Note 8 expert today we will have
just with Dylan tomorrow for even more
QA but now try I got you know the full
lowdown on the phone gonna check it out
at the try it it's a it's a good phone
yeah as usual if you have any questions
leave them in the comment section I
don't pick up the best and we'll get to
them in three minutes and 59 seconds for
um three two
welcome to the 359 I'm Ben Fox Ruben I'm
well Jay I'm Alper ding all right so
today was a pretty big day in the world
of phones Samsung came out with the
Galaxy Note 8 hopefully a redemption to
the note 7 which was an unrepentant
disaster so Roger humor at the event
today yep tell us a bit about it I'm
curious like what was the field there
like what was it was there a lot of
enthusiasm and the crowd was there a lot
of were there a lot of feelings you know
when there's a lot of feelings people
felt there's a lot of fun these two of
course there were fire I think there
were like the city sees like who's a
safety violation thing alright yeah
anyways but they weren't there because
of the phone they were there because I
know it was because it was at the
historic Park Avenue Armory in the upper
east side so I'll give you a feel of the
vibe there was love energy a lot of
exciting partly because they packed the
room with a ton of note customers no no
who are super jazzed about getting a
note 8 finally right so yeah they look
right off the bat I mean to their credit
Samsung addressed the issue I mean they
didn't really refer to the note 7 by
name or anything but they talked about
they had that long disappointment right
they showed clips of note boilers who
were disappointed were frustrated having
to give the phone up having had to deal
with this whole issue but they quickly
spun it as well he's no he's no
customers or they were disappointed back
then but they're still sticking with
Samsung Samsung was very much like thank
you everyone thank you no customers for
you know keeping this live you're the
reason it's still going on
this is from a marketing perspective I
thought it was very effective yeah they
did a good job mobile president DJ ko
was surprising sincere he bowed a couple
times what he said thank you it sound
sincere about it
no I feel like Samsung is genuinely
obviously they're sorry the whole thing
even happened my expectation going into
it was they were gonna let the note 7 be
in the rear view mirror right my
Maricopa here that I was wrong about
that and they really they really
addressed it pretty head-on that was
like the first thing they talked about
yeah it was a media visibility apology I
do respect all right so let's get to the
technology yeah I feel like the note aid
they played it safe a little bit and
that's kind of expected because the note
7 was was a pretty big failure what are
the big things that people are gonna be
looking for to be excited about the
phone is it the dual camera the s-pen
yeah I would say the the dual camera is
the big new feature you know basically
they're just now the they're following
iPhone and even LG intervene adding
multiple cameras and the implementation
is very similar to what the iPhone 7
plus is there's a standard wide wide
angle lens and then there's more of a
telescopic 2x zoom lens it allows you to
do those portrait mode like photos right
there the ones the bouquet effect blur
in the background
yeah I mean the one cool thing though
that they did that tops what Apple has
is it allows you to adjust the blurring
effect like you could make it no subtle
or could make it fully blurry in the
back
I mean and you can do it both before and
after you shoot the photo which is kind
of Awesome
kind of like that I don't know if you
guys remember there's a camera called
nitro back in the day no one bought it
but it it was but it was great no no it
had a pioneer this technology that
allows you to switch the focus of the of
the switch the focal point of the photo
even after you've taken oh yeah I
remember that it was like a huge yeah
it's a really weird thing no one ever
bought it but the technology was really
sound like that idea was I put my wife's
mouth she mean it was like wow that's
really that's the feature I would
actually care about so is there like a
big like whoa moment from this event
that you had seen no yeah because it
seemed like a lot of things while I was
watching his here's the decks we showed
this during the yeah here's the larger
screen where they also kind of show this
there's Bigsby I think they they pulled
out all the stops of the galaxy si
because I think they knew they needed a
while everyone they need to sort of get
people back in their good graces what
the galaxy Si and I think they mean yeah
they most of those innovations went into
that phone and the note I mean the no
date is really just it's a bigger phone
it's got an S Pen and it's got the dual
camera thing and that's basically it
like it's not there aren't a huge amount
of other breakthroughs there but you
have to keep in mind that you know
they're they're serving a fairly
specific market of note customers and
they know customers haven't had a good
phone in two years right they haven't
had a good note phone in two years
because those note 7 customers lost
their phone they end up getting an s7 or
kept their note 5 so for them this is a
huge huge upgrade right so the note 7
was already a very polished phone but
they could get it so alright so your
hands on after the event yep tell us
what you thought I mean it's nice phone
it's fairly expensive it's like 932 960
yeah yeah that's pretty pricey yeah yeah
wait for that iPhone I know maybe if you
have it and I hit four figures I say
maybe if you had a Galaxy Note 7 though
you're gonna get the phone for like
nearly half off so that's true what you
wrote about that yeah basically this is
only through Samsung calm for now we're
trying to find out
carriers are also providing this but if
you were a galaxy note 7 owner which
about three million people were right
you can get up to four hundred and
twenty five dollars off by trading in
your current phone
cha-ching yep not bad I mean that's like
half the phone pretty much should we all
right I don't know how much time we went
but I feel like it's more than three
minutes and 59 seconds so I'm gonna call
it a day if you want to read more about
these stories we've got a ton about the
Samsung Galaxy Note 8 coming out that's
already on the site and coming soon so
that's about it check us out
Ben Fox Ruben Jim I'm Alfred aying
thanks for listening
alright so and that's the 932 $960 that
counts for unlocked as well to connect
70 I believe unlocked will be straight
for a map from Samsung right yeah yeah
they announced the pricing a bit earlier
today I don't think it passes 969 29
sorry you're right 929 I was if there
lot of numbers the animal mixed up yeah
999 the highest I've seen is 960 from
Verizon though I think is Verizon and
Sprint okay boom sprint has the same
price okay oh we should have mentioned
this earlier in stores
September 15 2015 yep they didn't say
exactly when pre-orders would begin
right August 24th they said a couple of
tomorrow Oh at the event they just said
in a few days which was really ambiguous
pre-orders for the unlock phones start
August 24th but they didn't say
necessarily when that would happen and
they also during the big speed
presentation I was paying special
attention because yeah you know I write
about voices systems elide they really
did try to emphasize the fact that like
look we have a big speed button and it
does something and work and it's
actually useful yeah most most of the
times people look at assistants and they
don't do much though I have to admit the
the demonstration that they showed was a
cool like it was use but I like the idea
that you could bundle together different
commands for your phone like if you say
goodnight you
set your alarm clock it'll go - do not
disturb and I'll switch to blue light
all without you right thinking about it
the thing that I like is is that there
are so many voice assistants out now
from so many different companies that
there really is some there are these new
features that are starting to crop up in
other places that aren't just Alexa or
artists I feel like that voice command
futures taking like a big page out of
like Tasker though where it'll like if
you're in a certain area and they do
like multiple commands like oh yeah yeah
yeah that's exactly what I was thinking
to say if this than that it's not
something I might use necessarily on the
frequent but it's still kind of a cool
concept it's a good thing to copy but
I'm just curious if you can custom them
on your own like if I wanted to do good
night and I wanted to play like a
certain song yes I think they said and
then if there's like a list of like
things that you could do that it comes
with already because like like with the
Alexa there's like so many like skills
that I don't know that it can do oh yeah
I'd be interested if Samsung like
provides a list like here's like the
packaged like commands that we have for
Bixby I mean don't you get the emails
every week look what's new with Alexa
here's some suggested new yeah why don't
we take some questions we should take
some questions
first up mad Mike in the chat was asking
why no stereo speakers oh that's really
good question I mean I think basically
they jammed in a giant screen with very
little frame the front I mean they have
a lot of components and I imagine
speakers that I guess that was kind of
low on the priority list area but there
are speakers yeah but this is a
headphone jack please forgive us we are
human yeah
it's a live show for now we couldn't we
couldn't essential phone if I remember
correctly USB type-c and you need a
dongle does not have a headphone
obviously some switching that's going on
there is we all know the direction Apple
is gone we're gonna find out who's on
the right side of history eventually
yeah I mean like the right side of
history and my regard is you keep the
headphone jack otherwise you're gonna be
really really disappointed any time you
take a flight and forget your dongle but
no no that's true except but I didn't
stop Apple from doing and people don't
care
they're courageous everybody knows why
don't we take more questions Roger if it
makes you feel any better
sorry we have another podcasters
congratulations to whoever's playing
Super Mario Sunshine over at Giant Bomb
games I know for a fact that that's what
they're playing today awesome bye
everybody
Roger if it makes you feel any better
yesterday screwed up the date oh yeah
there's that too writable podcast
everybody Lawrence in the chat says I
heard I think we brushed on this briefly
but maybe we want to revisit a real jerk
I heard the people who once owned the
note 7 get a discount on the note 8 does
anybody know if that's true what was the
price point again what was the discount
you can get up to four hundred and
twenty-five dollars by trading in your
current phone you don't need to trade in
your note seven right because you don't
have you know seven or you're not
supposed to just to be declare this is
directly through Samsung comm and
neither the carriers at least we're
trying to confirm whether the carriers
are doing something but do have their
own deal they do have their own deals
but a lot of them are just a program
nothing so far set in stone for previous
note 7 owners everything right and we're
still trying to figure out from Samsung
like how do you verify like you were
previous notes have an owner like what's
stopping me from just going like yeah I
had a note 7 let me get this phone for
like half off but yeah you can get up to
$425 which is you know nearly half who
you presumably would be registering
these products on how though I mean I
read you for my stance register your
phone yeah you can and I mean I
registered my yeah like I registered my
refridgerator are you register it with
Samsung calm or Samsung's you do that so
like with your iPhone like we didn't buy
it you register it was the iPhone you
registered through
I cloud okay so yeah you're registering
your phone all right okay
Lawrence asks well where do I have to go
to get that discount yeah there
pre-order page when it's available
tomorrow and he we might be helping him
achieve something that might not be so
savory but if he bought it secondhand
from a friend have to be a previous
there's no I if you buy one now it's not
like it's gonna be right like if you're
what you couldn't buy one now yeah but
if they're verifying it off of like
registration stuff I'm sure there's like
a date attached to it something right
I'm sure they've found some way to track
you because there's Samsung that's a big
company so let's go right down the line
and everybody give their their top take
away from the presentation today what
was your favorite feature that got
highlighted and then we'll kind of
cross-check it with some of the some of
the fans in the chat but for me it was
in fact that big big speak custom
command what was it called again just
nice commands they didn't give it quick
command is that it awesome we all know
what I'm talking about yeah apparently
an idiot I thought that was neat again
not something I'd use on the regular but
it's something I had experiment with as
I myself and getting into like the smart
home the markets per se I've got an echo
at home I would mess with something like
that something that had like a tiered
result kind of like a domino effect so
our smart home team in Kentucky did show
me that there is there are ways of doing
this using home kid with your iPhone too
so it's not like though the first ones
to do it but I mean I think that's
getting simpler and simpler so more
folks can actually start utilizing these
types of features I mean so I would say
my favorite features the I mean the
camera of course the the live focus is
what they call it but yep just kind of
nice is the screen off memo the idea
that you pull your S Pen out and you
don't the turn your phone on you can
start jotting notes on your on the
screen of your Note 8 you know what I
might have to take it back that might be
the best thing for me because if you
guys know me I've always got Sharpie
notes or yes I hand
like I need to do this for sanity and
you can afford I can eat you can pin the
memo on that unlock on your lock screen
exactly so you've got like a grocery
list you got to-do list
there it is I might have changed my mind
I think that's yeah it works pretty well
I mean I tried it and there's I was pre
impressed but what if somebody steals
your phone and leaves you like dick pics
on there that's good that's why it's my
favorite feature frankly if they gave me
my phone back just to give me the dick
I'll take the dick pic for my phone back
small price to pay for not losing my
$930 phone I can leave it on the table
in the kitchen you go to the bathroom
you come
Chris Wellesley disagree with you about
two dual cameras as well so shout out
the Chris Wesley in the chair yeah yes
oh he agrees yeah he was also excited
about dual cameras I think a lot of
people you know photography's become so
ingrained in our day to day the fact
that they're really embracing that and
the feature of like that the modified
focus in post kind of thing and that
only became kind of prevalent a few
years ago in major commercial or
prosumer type cameras effect is in your
pocket now that's pretty darn neat did
you a recall during the beginning when
they were showing off the camera like oh
we've developed some sensors that'll
help you take better photos in low light
yeah those photos looked really cool
they have because they have the two
cameras and I think Apple makes kind of
same are giving yeah but I'll believe it
when I say the other thing that's kinda
nice about those cameras both cameras
have optical image stabilization like a
mechanical one which is a first for any
maker because I mean most have it on one
lens but to have it on both its
comparison when they did it with the
video of the woman yeah really shaky I
don't know if they shot it really shaky
on the iPhone on purpose yeah I always
feel like I don't know like that yeah
they'd think they create scenarios that
I think their phone their phone is
optimized for what you don't do
nighttime boat rides it just looks like
they shot it like this we're just like
how stable the sensor
it's one of the features that I thought
was cool that they kept referencing
maybe this wasn't my favorite one from
it but I did like how they made the
s-pen just a little bit better that you
could use it more for drawing yeah so I
thought that was kind of cool and it's a
little bit more sensitive there's a bit
more it's a level pressure different
pressures that it senses is a lot wider
than it was before so it's feels a lot
more like an actual pencil pen did you
know about this pen up community yeah
vaguely like Vicky called they keep
tallying this social network of no you
know no artists what's the call pen pal
no welcome to Penn up the war show
anyways ever did you have a favorite
feature yeah it was the memo thing that
you like I love too is there a finite
amount like the running 100 100 100 okay
and they said 100 sheets what if you
just drew one end and then just kept
extending it through all 100 sheets like
it's like super long sure all right just
stop stop we're getting some great props
from Orlando in the chat he says I'm so
glad that the note line is back and the
pen I missed a lot the cameras promising
as well good job Samsung I think we can
all kind of agree Samsung put on a
pretty good show today yes we did always
put on a big spectacle it was very
boring I mean like the phone's cool it's
like after the product is really cool
there was no snowmen ship here I see I
just agree I feel like the the floor
which I saw a year ago yeah but still
that led for was like amazing like the
way that the phone kind of shimmered
well the floor beneath the executive and
then went back to the back feels like
Davis well I guess the core of the phone
is that like it's gonna be big it's
gonna be frankly I thought the floor was
more impressive than the phone cuz
that's awesome that stage the stage I
later on it's like it's tiny little like
LED dots and then there's a plastic
sheet over for protection but it yeah it
works - like stimulate images it was
really beautiful
yeah I just say I appreciate their
efficiency in their presentation after
the last minutes yeah nice and clean I
knew exactly do enough screwing around
the the one DJ guy was a little awkward
it's it
profile pickers like a cringy thanks
thanks bro the story story cool coming
from the dude who has to record the
whole darn thing that was nice thank you
thank you Samsung yeah I thought it was
gonna be much longer I like had to clear
out my host gadget does a good job of
keeping the more more efficient over the
years I do appreciate that
just the facts move on to the demo area
amen to that
it's gonna come more questions and
before we call the day Pamela says do
you think I should upgrade from an s8
plus and I am NOT a business user right
now no not for not press it's only a
plus that's like you just do you think
that it's only for business users no but
I think if you just bought like the most
expensive possible phone before the know
it came out like a few months yeah you
know if you don't want to like specs
wise it's not even that different no
this is the same processor it is it like
a tenth of an inch if you want like one
yeah it's and the stylus would be the
only real differentiating factor at that
point and if you're not really into it
or if you don't you're not used to using
an S Pen it's not really worth it
probably something yes Bixby &amp;amp; DEC's you
would already right I recommend yeah so
I would not I would not recommend
operating like if you have a note 5 if
you have a galaxy s7
yeah maybe and you want the bigger phone
you want the stylus then yeah that that
might be when you consider it but just
if you just bought an essay it just
doesn't seem to make sense to me if
money isn't concern for you though
that's true if you're like if you're
loaded go for it yeah and my venmo is
actually Roosevelt in the chat says this
is a good strategy for
for Samsung it was a very safe release I
get through this with no hiccups and
expect more on the note 9 a question
from Anmol says what about the guys who
pre-booked the phone but their orders
were cancelled and purchased the s7 Plus
as a replacement I'm assuming he's
asking if he's still entitled to four
like it note 7 yeah imagine did he get
his money back
when he like ordered it I don't know
he's good yeah I think he's looking to
see if he can still scoop up that
discount you could make a case for it if
you wanted to call Samsung up for sure
but I don't think it's as clean as if
you had a note 7 and had to return it
yeah so elephant in the room before we
wrap it up for the day Wow
that price point is that a maker break
that's definitely that's a break for me
I'm not rich for me sure
I think the note has always been more
expected yeah traditionally a more
expensive phone I think the last year's
version started at something a bit more
expensive if you're no fan this is worth
the money this is like the latest and
greatest in tech like a lot of people
wanted to keep it for the stylists who I
remember 107 recall happened most people
are saying I can't do like bone things
without a stylus seems ridiculous yeah
but I mean but whatever I think this
will also take some of the pain out of
the potential that Apple might face or
some of the blowback that because
they're like third you know really
iPhone 8 is supposed to be more than
$1,000 maybe up to 1400 something like
that right if you think about the way
they take your memory and options like
yeah it could step up to thirteen
fourteen hundred dollars and I think
yeah that's that's gonna be the new
reality people gonna be forking over
huge amounts of money for their phone
not me so none of you none of you guys
here have the up well who's holding a
Samsung phone presently I am you are and
you're not gonna make the upgrade or
well this is from CNET's Enoch gave me
this phone or CBS Interactive fair
enough if they would want to give me the
noh8
coming from the boss yep sorry buddy
we're just wondering how you know the
people in the chat are saying like what
would you do if you were in my shoes
I do have an s I have an s6 edge that is
up for an upgrade and I'm considering
this but I really want to wait for the
pixel to I think a lot of people gonna
do that if it was wait for the pixel to
to see what happened as a follow-up
everybody's asking when's that pixel
coming out we have nothing if you kind
of follow the calendar right it's gonna
be it's like the eclipse you can kind of
predict exactly exactly
my guess is completely I guess is
October we should actually make that it
should be like a scenic graphic project
somebody puts together like a calendar
tracking like tarot card type prediction
for tech releases yes some of them work
pretty like brutes like clockwork like
maybe a difference of a week or two like
you could know that's coming soon really
like that's our next event right we've
got a phone next week which is a Berlin
touch see some with some wearables and
some yes yeah appliances laptops whatnot
and then we'll probably see it will
definitely see apples sometimes
September the rumor is the 12th but we
don't know yet but thought there was all
that suspicion about getting delayed
though I don't think that's why I think
that's still gonna happen on time
whether or not release day is what's up
in the air yeah even then I think
they're gonna like meet the release date
but you'll probably have severe supply
constraints so no one will be able to
buy their phone sure sure which they'll
play to their benefit yeah it's so
popular that in ten seconds but Super
Nintendo classic from yesterday's sold
out 30 seconds on every single where the
pre-orders sold out in 30 seconds yeah
Nintendo's being jerks yeah I'm sorry I
love nintendo but they're kind of being
jerks right now I think it is a supply
issue with Nintendo for sure yeah they
knew better it is not a supply issue
there's no way they're intentionally
keeping the supply low yes they're
basically treating these like this like
the way that Nike treats Jordans yeah
which
it's like a coal except I don't I don't
really care about Jordan so just bury me
all right that's probably the perfect
place ironically somehow I don't know
both Jared's we've been hanging out for
a long time a lot of people been
following all day with a mr. Tong out in
San Francisco yeah all of her fantastic
coverage coming from the floor so let's
let's shut up at Samsung for a while
until tomorrow morning yeah we'll have a
Jessica dual-core our actual Galaxy Note
expert she'll be able to answer not only
got to no questions but essential phone
questions yes
she'll be basically any phone okay phone
question you wanna throw a shoe salesman
hopefully she goes on
now that we've teased her yeah last
minute like no sorry that's sick do you
want to do you want to call this dude
yeah bring home Ben all right
