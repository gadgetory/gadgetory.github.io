fitness bands I'm Bridget Carey and this
is your cnet update Nike is pulling the
plug on the FuelBand cnet has learned
that Nike fired a majority of its
employees that worked on the FuelBand
fitness bracelet sources say nike plans
to stop making the FuelBand as well as
other wearable gear like the nike+
sportwatch but in the meantime it will
still sell and support the nike+
fuelband SE which came out in november
although fitness tracking bands are a
hot new gadget category the smooth does
make sense for the shoemaker nike has
always been a strong partner with apple
and if Apple comes out with an i watch
later this year and thank you will
likely have an app for the iWatch to
track your fitness so if Nikes on the
iWatch why still make the FuelBand if
you're using a SmartWatch to track your
fitness goals you probably won't also
spend 150 dollars on a fuel band it
looks like PowerPoint is getting a new
buddy in the office suite of apps
Microsoft is starting to test a program
called office mix and it turns power
points into interactive presentations
with data about how the audience is
participating you can record audio video
and handwriting and insert quizzes and
other types of interactive lessons it
sounds like it's good for teachers who
want to record lessons to view online
Microsoft is hanging out codes now for
select folks to test it there are many
reasons why some people may pick an
iPhone over an Android phone but could a
video game make or break your decision
just like the battles between the Xbox
and the PlayStation / exclusive video
game titles Apple and Google are
fighting to have exclusive app games The
Wall Street Journal shed light on this
trend reporting that EA the publisher of
the game plants vs. zombies 2 struck a
deal with Apple to wait two months
before releasing the game on Android
source has also said that a similar deal
was done with the publisher of cut the
rope waiting three months before
releasing the sequel on Android these
game negotiations are common for
traditional console video games but
the battle is just beginning to heat up
in the mobile space and if you long for
the days when mobile games are much
simpler then you probably had a Nintendo
Game Boy and if you're still holding on
to the original machine you should wish
it a happy birthday nintendo released
the Game Boy 25 years ago on April 21st
1989 and the first model came bundled
with Tetris it wasn't the first portable
video game system but it was the most
popular in the 80's and 90's the
nintendo DS holds the title now for the
best-selling portable console of all
time that's your tech news update you
