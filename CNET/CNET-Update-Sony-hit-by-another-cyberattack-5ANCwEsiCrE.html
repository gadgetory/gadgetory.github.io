goodbye to a gaming legend I'm Bridget
Carey and this is your cnet update the
bad news continues for Sony as the
company has been hit by another cyber
attack this time targeting the
PlayStation Network and store the hub
for games films and TV shows was down
for about two hours Monday but it has
been fixed during the outage player saw
screen that read page not found it's not
you it's the Internet's fault the cause
is still being investigated and right
now there's no sign that any data was
stolen this doesn't seem to be related
to last week's attack on Sony Pictures
you see this time a hacker group called
the lizard squad is claiming
responsibility with cryptic tweets the
squad also boasted about causing a
similar outage on the Xbox network last
week the attack comes as Sony celebrates
the 20th birthday of the PlayStation
video game console the company released
a limited edition version of the ps4
painted in the gray color of the
original PlayStation but it sold out
within minutes of being posted online
and now you can find them going for a
double and triple the price on ebay in
fact there's one listing where someone
paid more than twenty thousand dollars
for a unit and another for more than
fifteen thousand dollars except for the
paint job this is the same machine and
accessories that you can get in stores
now perhaps today's video game systems
wouldn't be where they are today if it
wasn't for one engineer Ralph Baer the
man many call the father of the home
video game console has died at age 92
back in 1966 bear worked on the brown
box it was a prototype for what would
become the Magnavox Odyssey the first
home console that played games on a
television screen the Odyssey had no
sound it was powered by batteries and it
cost one hundred dollars table tennis
was one game for the system it sold
nearly a hundred thousand units in 1972
which was five years before Atari became
popular Bayer received the Medal of
Technology from President George W Bush
in two thousand
six and switching over to the world of
streaming music grooveshark is coming
out with a new type of service that
similar to pandora the wall street
journal reported the grooveshark will
roll out a digital radio service in
january called broadcasts where users
can text with each other while listening
to custom radio stations that are
created by users it'll cost 99 cents a
month and it won't have commercials that
