generation SUV that's basically code for
we've largely given up on offroad but
for most of their buyers I bet that the
bullseye let's check out the 2013
Pathfinder in 4-wheel Drive trim and
platinum level check the tax
now the last pathfinder was just a
horrid looking thing like something the
Pentagon would put out an RFP for this
is a pretty boy you can see it's got a
lot of the DNA from the Infiniti JX and
under the skin things are different as
well no longer body-on-frame it's now a
unibody vehicle like a car in fact it
shares a platform with the Murano and
the Maxima the big engines are going to
used to get a four liter v6 or a 5.6 v8
no more now single engine three and a
half liter v6 an old standby if you're
having trouble spotting the new
generation Pathfinder just look for the
second row door handles for the first
time ever they're not on the c-pillar
they're down on the door inside this
thing is infinity everywhere yeah it's a
Nissan but they've really brought a lot
of infinity cues up in a lot of Nissan's
lately and this one gotten a huge dose
of it here are the things to look for in
the center of the two dials you've got
this nice LCD screen not that crunchy
8-bit nonsense that Nissan did forever
ruining their dashboards beautiful
gauges as well look over here that's the
Infinity controller we've seen showing
up in Nissan's for a model year or two
with a rotating ring an enter button in
the center and these compass buttons
around that all of this is infinity
stuff as is this sort of dual dog-bone
layout of the climate controls below it
there in the audio settings now since we
have the Platinum trim here we have some
nice features in the dash the navigation
system is one of them you don't get that
in every Pathfinder as you might imagine
beyond that nothing really new here
we've seen this sort of look of map
it'll give you all kinds of different
views there's a great bird's eye view
but it's still it's a little childish to
me and sometimes the streets are
incredibly tortured they haven't done a
great job of calling out a lot of those
street labels in this current generation
which goes back years now and if you
don't want to use the controller or the
dedicated buttons or the touchscreen
because you're picky that way you can
always use the voice command which is
I'd say basic but very robust would you
like to access both navigation
navigation please say address address
what's stayed please for Canada
California
California notice how fast I can whip
through an address there but I still
have to do it bucket style one little
module at a time but there's excellent
voice prompt commands on the screen so I
want to memorize some stupid syntax
that's a good thing
also on this car we've got an elaborate
camera system which is weird because
we're missing some other technologies
for driver assistance but not camera if
I put this guy in Reverse look what I
get I've got a rear camera I've got the
around view monitor all four angles
around the vehicle and if I the camera
button again I get this sort of down
corner look at the right front wheel so
you've got an amazing richness of
cameras on this vehicle that's part of
this platinum trim level that's for the
entertainment system you've got just
about everything you care about and all
you're missing are things you don't care
about with the exception of HD radio I
was surprised to not find HD radio on
this vehicle standard or optional AM an
FM and satellite radio of course are in
there Sat radio is very responsive in
this guy by the way it clicks up the
information for a new station like that
which I like under the aux menu here
you're going to find your auxiliary
inputs as you can see audio and video
are available there's CD and/or DVD here
in this slot and bluetooth streaming has
good meta tag support we also have a
rear seat entertainment system on this
guy that's a little something out of the
90s you got dual screens in the back
that can watch a DVD or a portable
plugged in through RCA jacks but the
kids are gonna have an iPad they're
never gonna use that don't waste your
money
now when it's you know having suburban
eyes roll the Pathfinder is nothing if
not a people haulers so let's see how
people get in the third row as you see I
got a nice big hole right here to do
that if that's too complicated to make
happen it's not worth it let's see how
easy it is there's one big lift latch on
the shoulder of the seat to pull that up
and just push the whole myth's forward
now I got one over here as well that's
actually quite easy it gives you a real
hole once you get back here you find a
bench reminiscent of the one in the
reformatory and Oliver Twist
puts the bear doesn't here I must say
Nissan deserves yet another award for
this implementation of their legendary
v6 in this case for ugliest engine bay
it's just a sea of cheap black plastic
so again people who buy this thing
aren't gonna be engine aficionados and
they've gone to the well for the
company's standard three and a half
liter v6 pathfinders used to have either
a four liter v6 or a big old 5.4 liter
v8 both gone smaller engine but 260
horse 240 foot-pounds of torque moves
this roughly forty four hundred pound
beast up to sixteen around seven and a
half seconds the Sun doesn't actually
publish a number while delivering 19 25
mpg and that's all wheel drive that's a
pretty good number for the size and
weight of this vehicle being lugged
around by this engine if you go with
two-wheel drive you get a little bump in
mpg to 2026 and I'm in treated they
looked at a number of engine components
relatively high in the engine bay this
this upper level of the air intake for
example is way up here this is kind of
off-road technique when you want a
vehicle to for deep water only time this
thing is gonna Ford deep water is when a
water main breaks at the ball
so what's it like driving a 13
Pathfinder it's like a big ol bowl of
vanilla ice cream
it's very vanilla interestingly it's one
of the few vehicles I've seen lately
whose automatic transmission we'll talk
about that in a minute does not have a
shiftable gate or a sport mode or
paddles now this is not truly an
automatic it's a continuously variable
transmission and I'm ready to pronounce
it perhaps the best ever made when I got
in this car and I always do my blind
taste test when I first get into a car
that comes in our garage I don't look at
any of the data I Drive it first I could
have sworn this with an automatic with
actual gears it is not and that's a
testimony to how firm and direct and
sort of responsive it is so nice job on
the CVT but Nissan's always done that
power delivery is perfectly good as well
but there's something urgent or
responsive about it so it's a vehicle
that feels like it's sort of not a
driver's vehicle in any condition
whatsoever
the handling is pretty wall away it's
not you know not dangerously so but
anyway shape or form
let's talk about room inside this is a
nice spacious vehicle now which was one
of the knocks against the earlier
generations of Pathfinder real spacious
lots of elbow and shoulder and Headroom
if I look back over the corner dreadful
blind spots and the far corners but the
sides are nice and nice and open for
good visibility
okay let's price a 2013 Pathfinder
platinum trim pretty much near the top
of the stack about $42,000
now I'd add to that the Platinum Premium
Package 2300 more it's gonna get you
that very cool panoramic glass roof over
second and third row tri-zone climate
control fewer arguments about that on
long road trip and the largely useless
rear seat entertainment system I'd like
to pull that out let it's part of the
package the deal is pretty good overall
so all in it's a prettier Pathfinder
it's car base it has a one choice
smaller engine retains credible
all-wheel drive and much better fuel
economy
nothing impressed me about driving it
but that isn't the point in this guy it
hauls people and stuff well while being
very suburban and that's gonna be a
bull's-eye on the intended buyer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
