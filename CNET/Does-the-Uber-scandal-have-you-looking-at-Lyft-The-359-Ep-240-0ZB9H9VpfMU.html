to all it's episode 240 of the 359
podcast on BV Jean in the house today
I've got Ben Fox Ruben and Roger Chang
the dream team
whoa room T Grimm team I don't know that
well good morning it's up guys oh it's
gonna be gonna be the easiest sugar
heavy show to have me showed it yeah
yeah yeah we're gonna be talking about
obviously the big news of the day uber
CEO Travis conduct taking a leave of
absence it sort of the culture behind
that and then to lighten things up we're
going to be talking about gamergate as
you know III is going on right now our
only insurer enterin Carson row nice
feature sort of tying gamergate to the
so that the actions taken by some of the
more extreme parts of gamergate how that
influenced so the discourse that we had
38 election there's the elections yeah
so gamergate trump can't wait can't wait
my god can only imagine what your
comments are going to be like leaving
this leave in the comment section though
troll word on Bryant Brian's gonna be
picking out the ones that are at least
coherent and not crazy if anything's
fine we'll probably focus mostly on uber
or a good portion on uber because that's
the big news of the day yeah yeah I mean
yeah I look happy to discuss roles
online we'll discuss either one and
we'll get to it three minutes in 59
seconds Brian all right here we go for
the recording of the podcast thanks for
joining us on YouTube live stream and
periscope we'll be right back to answer
your questions in three two
welcome to the 359 I'm Roger Chang I'm
Ben Fox ribbon so there's a big shake-up
at uber with CEO Travis kalanick taking
a leave of absence after an independent
investigation recommend big changes
following a slew of scandals there
pummeled the company so a couple
questions we still need answered is this
leave of absence just code for kalmyk
leaving the company or will he be back
and more importantly does this make you
want to use lift more hmm I don't know
are you asking me this yes I am asking
you this I deleted my uber app amid all
the different scandals I you know joined
the delete
uber
Tagg movement because i didn't really
use uber all that much to begin with and
was very bothered by them potentially
violating the Apple AppStore privacy
rules yes this was one of the many
controversies that people may have
missed because there were so many yes it
was Caltech you know yelling at one of
his drivers at one point tonight talking
about compensation
with Google lawsuit Google it was a slew
of sexual harassment allegation there
was the the blog post by a former uber
boy that talked about her time there
right just how safely it was as a woman
working in the environment right and
that blog post kind of got the ball
rolling
and it started a lot of digging I would
think by a lot of reporters that found
just unbelievably toxic work a culture
and environment there there have been an
enormous amount of like there's been a
huge exodus of executives somehow
traffice is surviving yes and he's
taking a quote-unquote leave of absence
if this was a public company he would
have been out on a rail yep so long ago
so do you think that he's going to
survive this like is he gonna stay a CEO
you know it's it's it's tough to say I
mean if you look at those initial
comments but he talks about uber 2.0
this is I guess a company without Travis
he also talks about Travis 2.0 grown
more mature grown-up Travis so I feel
like even there he's kind of setting up
the foundation for him to eventually
return I think it's I don't see how
that's even possible for the company to
actually be able to move on I think that
um he just he needs to resign but what
are you gonna do that's the other big
question though is this enough like are
these scandals and controversies enough
for people to actually stop using uber
yeah maybe so Farhad Manjoo
at the New York Times brought up a very
good point about this in a column
yesterday he said that it's up to all of
us to fix Ober that if we don't like
what we've been reading about it start
using lyft take a taxi prom as I'm sure
some commenters will test is lyft isn't
everywhere lift is it in multiple
countries where ruber is bets that's
part of the issue
the ubiquity of uber and even sometimes
the perception of the ubiquity of uber
gives it an advantage over some of this
competitors I agree so alright we've got
to move on to gamergate our own insured
Aaron Carson wrote about the
controversial movement which supporters
say that they're fighting for the ride
fighting against the rise of needless
political correctness games and ethics
of journalism while some of the more
extreme aspects of the moving folks a
movement of resort to extreme actions
like death threats doxxing da swatting
generally trollers behavior you know Ian
and Erin serve linked the rise of
gamergate that culture is for the
breeding ground for the kind of
increasingly volatile discourse we had
going to the presidential election so in
some ways it's all tied back to trump
yeah um what I think is at least
somewhat heartening but it's still way
too early to tell is that Facebook and
Twitter and I believe also Reddit are at
least making some effort to do something
about you know the toxicity that happens
online yes you know I'm I'm all for the
First Amendment obviously I'm a reporter
I'm a journalist but at the same time
that doesn't mean that you can shout
down or harass or you know death threat
people yes everybody deserves to have a
say on publicly listing you know
addresses and telling people to direct
people to kill them that's just that's
cool doesn't sound very cool to me all
right so that's all the time we have I
know it's a huge issue a lot of nuance
that's tough to sum down in four minutes
check out the story check out the story
and more on CNET I'm Roger Cheng I'm Ben
Fox Ruben thanks for listening so let's
keep the good times rolling oh my god so
when appointing those like solid
referential just as me being not as
indoctrinated into the reporting aspect
of this yeah I'm just the button pusher
here that really did help bring a good
blanket understanding to a lot of things
that are very very confusing it's very
easy there's a little note there's a lot
of nuance with gamergate there are folks
in who believe in gamergate who also I
don't think they mean any harm they
actually believe in some of the
the kind of the more I guess the cleaner
aspects of the movement right in terms
of that it wasn't it was earlier less it
was a leaderless right man but I guess
later there was definitely a large
element some element to gamergate that
was just toxic I was volatile that was
just frankly dangerous right mm-hmm
so yeah and the same thing you saw
during the election you saw directed
mostly toward Hillary Clinton towards a
lot of reporters yeah but at the same
time I don't think that it's unjustified
to point the finger at the platforms
that were allowing a lot of this to
happen
it really got to the point for Twitter I
would think especially where it was too
toxic of an asset for it to be an
acquisition target you know like at one
point Disney was considering purchasing
it and then they backed off saying like
you know the House of Mickey Mouse does
not want to be involved in this right so
I think Twitter at least realized that
it needed to do something to yeah clean
up its act and make itself a platform
for everybody
as opposed to making itself a platform
for just just such that we're unfiltered
culture that yes yep yeah that was
basically you know steamrolling
everybody else's conversations oh yeah
it is for the element like we start
points like the death of a polite
discourse right we're we no longer are
really allowed to disagree with each
other like if you disagree with me like
I need to stamp out your opinion cuz I
don't want to hear it yeah kind of what
I mean actually Facebook is probably
better example that right cuz like you
don't even know that people disagree
with you exactly your news feeds
basically reinforcing your opinions all
the time it's stuff that you agree with
because their algorithms know that you
believe a certain thing and they're
gonna push that that rhetoric push that
opinion yeah so yeah exactly you don't
even know that there is a disagreement
or what do you think is the norm right
so man this podcast is get do today get
pretty deep in a secretive deep don't do
it okay so first and foremost we want to
give a quick shout out to Raj who says
hey from Australia keep up the great
work thank you right thank you very very
much
 uh Matthew doctor says is there any
difference between uber and lyft from
the passengers perspective I suppose
there are
you people who have not latched on to
the questions yeah I'd sharing trend
that is out there so maybe let's spell
it out about how it works at least from
the major markets we've experienced yet
um and how there really isn't terrible
amount of difference now there is no
effect for the consumers pretty much
same experience I would sense are
actually shockingly similar I know uh I
would say like again especially depend
on the market you're in like lyft isn't
as releve l'ile I know some drivers
definitely uber and lyft uh to make
policy most drivers seems to miss most
drivers in general what I see is
watching you both yeah
sure an SF in LA that stuff with the
case but uh they're not in as many
market yeah as you said there's at least
a perception that uber is much more
ubiquitous yeah and therefore it gets
the default position for a lot of people
yes I think that's exactly what it is
it's sort of laziness that wins now
right like uber happens to be there it's
like it's all your either your front
page or your whatever your your it's
closer to the front of your home screen
that lifts usually is right is why you
usually pick it yeah but at the same
time people don't like this they may
want to inconvenience themselves
ever-so-slightly
right they don't agree with these types
of business practices no totally like
voting with your feet that's really
ultimately the end with your wallet and
the other wall that's really the the
only real power that we have ultimately
with these types of companies so yeah
yeah I mean well it this was another
point that I also wanted to make that we
didn't get to because it's a four-minute
podcast was that despite all the
controversies I still continue to
believe that uber will survive like as a
company yes absolute value a ssin like
70 billion is no what's the most
valuable startup in the world right so
despite the train wreck that's going on
over there I mean like the thing that
really bugs me on a personal level is
that the CEO no matter what happens is
gonna walk away a very very rich person
but you know there's nothing I can do
about that and that's okay but whether
he comes back as CEO or not
so you've deleted uber I have not
deleted over but I also don't use it a
whole lot yes saying I'm like especially
in New York I feel like I use cash
like 95% of time that's why I never
really used uber yeah
and I deleted it like I said during the
podcast mostly for privacy reasons was
that I was thinking if this is a company
apparently they're violation of the
privacy protocols in the App Store
yeah just like we're just to clarify I
mean what what happened was you know
they were basically flagged for letting
the app secretly identifying tagged
iPhone users even after the app was
ready for the right after you've deleted
it they're still tracking you it's
really is covered which is totally very
very roblem at it yeah that's it so is
only personally I didn't want to deal
with that tracked app it's one thing
when you opt in yes and another thing
when you've actively said if you if you
need to leave it locally the app but be
that is the ultimate opt out there to
not respect that's pretty low yeah that
was after I heard about that I deleted
it right after reading that story I was
like I don't want to deal with a company
like this so how do we I mean
how they've since put a kibosh to that
but I mean how would you even stop that
would you have to have rebooted your
entire phone I don't even know Tim Cook
Tim Cook the CEO of Apple apparently
looked Travis in the eye and was just
like I think I know what you're doing
and you better stop or I'm gonna boot
you from the App Store and that's when
they stopped but that's the type of
company this is where they're literally
going to get away with every single inch
that they can yeah until they're called
out into the carpet it's happened over
and over and over again yeah
forced municipalities to drag them out
because you know it's completely against
ordinances and laws unlike those
particular municipalities and they're
like you know customers love us so you
make us leave like make us so and that's
that's a hard thing from from a user's
perspective I mean myself I just like
the aspect of how uber works as a
functioning device
Shammi ride-sharing so let's just go
ahead a brand out of it I mean so from
my perspective I work in production here
at Cena and CBS Interactive so believe
it or not we don't have a CNET van yet
and we're a 355 in just cruise
around town so when you got to do field
productions and I have to haul around a
ton of a good it's nice to know that I
can call an SUV as much as I
absolutely 100% in favor of just
utilizing yellow cabs I can't sit there
and wait for five Priuses to go by right
and depth at something large I'd like to
be a little easily call uh you need
predictability a appropriately sized
vehicle for my needs and that's why I
like uber and nine times out of ten I've
had great experiences with the drivers
with the actual ride itself with the
amenities experiences yeah I almost feel
really bad that now I kind of don't want
to use it anymore for like I think
that's why a lot of folks have been be
telling people to switch to lift because
ultimately allow them with the same
Drive right it's a shame you like
experience they probably see one live
but you bring up a good point that
there's this very obvious disconnect for
people where they don't like the
business practices of company X but they
don't want to stop using the services
I've heard it a lot
covering Amazon a lot of people seem to
disagree with certain business practices
of Amazon they seem to think that it's
it's a deal with the devil where if you
shop a lot at Amazon you're essentially
you know killing small discs yelling
killing off your own Main Street it did
to help this gigantic retailer however I
mean I've bought from Main streets on
Amazon that is a very good point but the
thing is is that even if people really
really don't like certain things about
Amazon they feel like you know a choice
right yeah or they just they do it
anyway because of the convenience factor
I mean like these are technology
companies when is technology if not to
help you be lazier I mean like what's
the whole point of technology there's
why we invented the wheel I should be
our tagline really right
it's to help help you be lazy yep so we
will audition we will all be like those
fat people in wall-e
very very yeah and I look for iPhone
wise everyone look forward to it all
right so before we wind things down
calling out to the chat if anybody is
thinking like I have deleted over I will
delete lubbers for these guys I want to
defend them whatever you're like I want
to keep uber like yeah I just enjoy the
experience enough that I don't care
about what's going on back file your
comments away we'd love to hear from you
in the meantime I be in the chat says in
India we have Ola past month uber is
blamed Ola for harassment case done
under Oba cab driver was done by Ola to
spoil the image of uber in the country
is insane to blame them without any
proof yeah that was well the
controversies because I mean one calyx
lieutenants obtained the medical report
of the victim the rape victim there I
they looked it over because they had
this conspiracy theory that Ola was was
doing this how masterminded this to
smear ubers reputation in India we very
house of cards in yeah I didn't like is
that really like that sounds far-fetched
it's pretty extreme and it does kind of
highlights of the mentality mentality
there that yeah new birth at like
obviously yeah that that they can't even
change right now
well that exactly overhaul needs to be
done that exact is now out yeah I well
that exact his boss and now epic Alan
occurs pick his leave of absence yeah I
don't see a lot changing with Callan ik
still you know at the at the wheel they
need a new CEO like and they've needed a
new CEO mark my words is gonna be a
law-and-order episode about this this
year sweet oh yeah a couple quick
comments filing through uh rüdiger says
uber should make a background check not
a bad idea but really the drivers at the
ones in question having a background
check on their see yeah I do you do
require background checks but I think
they're fairly little and they've been
fighting more stringent background
checks I understand but yeah the
background check wouldn't really fix
this particular problem because it yeah
me the CEO would have probably clear the
background check imagine soggy says I
had ajan soggy hey I haven't deleted it
but I use lift first now before over so
fair enough fair enough yeah and lastly
Lim Ming Quan is asking are those two
headphones Sennheiser HD - OH - s yes
they are sir
Wow fear uh-huh very good I we have good
taste you have good taste
