we cover everything related to alphabet
what's alphabet alphabet owns lots of
companies most notably Google Google's
behind all kinds of things like Android
YouTube pixels and everyone's favorite
thing ever
Google+ I'm your guide I as actor you're
a wizard Harry today we've got a lot of
catching up to do
we'll talk about messages on the web
podcasts and Google home but our top
story is a new phone
first stop Android Avenue we published
new episodes on Tuesdays so what did
oppo do last Tuesday it introduced a new
phone
that has virtually no bezel say hello to
the Oppo find X the front and rear
cameras on the device
rise out of the body it's a really neat
looking trick how sturdy do you think
that mechanism is do you think it'll
survive a fall let me know in the
comments
inside the find X you'll also find a
snapdragon 845 processor 8 gigabytes of
RAM and up to 256 gigabytes of storage
the find X is running a pose color OS on
top of Android which is kind of iOS like
you won't find a fingerprint sensor on
the device or in the device there is no
fingerprint sensor on the find X
unlocking it will require using the
front-facing camera for 3d face scanning
Apple calls their facial recognition and
I'm not making this up Oh face I'd
imagine you'd also be able to use a
passcode if you don't want to use Oh
face the find X is on sale in China
right now and heads in North America and
Europe in August for around $1,100 next
up play plaza
there's a new podcast app in town and
it's called google podcasts if you've
ever used a podcast app before you'll
likely be right at home with Google
podcasts the app is kind of bare that's
the wrong kind of bear when you load it
up you see several rows with top
podcasts in certain categories if you
don't see a show you're looking for in
those rows you can always search if you
start listening to a show on your phone
and want to continue on your google home
you'll be able to do that podcasts are
synced up using assistant more Google
Play stuff ahead Google introduced
messages for the web if you head on over
to messages Android comm you might be
able to link your phone to your computer
Google lays out the 3-step process on
the site open up messages on your phone
tap the more options menu select the
messages for web and scan the code with
your phone then you should be able to
send and receive text right from your
laptop Google officially announce
messages for web on the 18th of June and
said it will be rolling out around the
time this episode is published next up
home highlands
let's talk about Google home there's a
new feature available called continued
conversation it lets you keep talking to
assistant without having to use a Google
wait phrase again and again for
follow-ups it's opt-in so don't worry
about Google listening to you more so
than normal you can turn on continued
conversations in the Google assistant or
Google home app under preferences a
system will keep the mic open after
responses to listen for follow-up
questions you can have assistants
stopped listening to you by saying thank
you or stop if assistant hears no
follow-ups it will turn off the mic
after eight seconds
last stop comment code this is a part of
the shell where we shine a spotlight on
the best audience in the world except
that one guy boxer test says talk about
the Apple find X we hope the first
segment address that Mister test Luke
Taylor says the backlash against the
Samsung Chromebook plus v2 has been
pretty widespread from what I've seen
due to the screen being downgraded
as well as the USB layout being shifted
he went on to say and since camera
software on Chrome OS is still terrible
the addition of those cameras really
doesn't add anything just yet thanks for
that comment Luke it really gives us
some context to the Chromebook plus v2
and thanks to everyone for writing in
the comments that does it for us if
you've enjoyed your stay in Alphabet
City remember to like and subscribe hit
that bell if you want notifications when
we add new episodes spoiler it's usually
every Tuesday pop oh wow I'm Maya's
actor and I'll see you online
we've got to stop meeting like this all
right I'll give you one more bit of
information a new rumor from et News
said there will be three different
Samsung Galaxy S ten models one would
have one rear camera the other two and
the third three rear cameras
do you believe et news on this one seems
a little strange</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
