just wrapped up Connie Guglielmo from
Sina news editor in chief has just been
inside now Connie the big question on
everyone's lips how did Tim Cook respond
to the San Bernardino and FBI
investigation
I think the most interesting thing was
how shareholders in the room responded
as soon as he walked in there about 500
shareholders attending the meeting they
gave him a standing ovation so even
though there's some public opinion polls
with mixed results and what people think
of Apple stance against FBI shareholders
today decidedly were in Apple's favor so
I know that Reverend Jesse Jackson and
the Electronic Frontier Foundation were
also in attendance what did they say so
they were among the first two speakers
in the question-and-answer session and
they addressed the FAI case against
Apple they applauded Tim Cook's stance
and Apple stands for privacy on behalf
of their customers Reverend Jackson
actually called to Tim Cook a man of
integrity and character and he applauded
him for standing up for the rights of
everyone not just the single iPhone user
in terms of business results and product
performance do we get any extra insights
from Tim Cook on that he really just we
you know recall to the great year that
Apple has had from a product perspective
and also from a revenue and profit
perspective Apple is the most valuable
company in the world shares of the
company have been up and down that's
more reaction to some of the things
they're doing but in terms of product
sales and revenue Apple had a banner and
record year and he pointed that out and
he particularly called out how
successful they have been in China
there's been a lot of questions about
doing business in China but he made a
point of saying that the middle class in
China which has been five million people
five years ago is expected to be half a
billion people in five years
Apple sees huge upside in China and has
invested by opening a lot of retail
stores there and apart from the standing
ovation how else did shareholders react
to Tim Cook's announcements you know it
was very interesting after the e FF and
jeffrey jeff reverend jackson comments
most of the shareholder questions were
about the business of Apple people asked
about their interest in going after
business customers through the retail
store they asked about iOS software
being compatible with older devices they
asked about services revenue so the
shareholders were very interested in
getting back to the business of how
Apple does thing
the last question they asked was about
the new campus ample Apple is building a
giant new campus that former CEO Steve
Jobs helped design before he died it's
going to be done starting in January
people will be moving in shareholders
about five hundred of them more than
five hundred then we're here today but
some ended up in the overflow room and
Tim Cook assured them in about two years
he'll have a giant meeting room so that
everyone can be in the same room and ask
questions Connie thank you so much and
