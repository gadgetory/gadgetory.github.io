today we're talking about crees new 75
watt replacement LED bulb and here it is
right here in this lamp you can see it
looks just like the old Cree bulbs but
this one is a lot brighter it's got
eleven hundred lumens as opposed to 800
lumens and the 60 watt replacement Cree
bulb if you turn it on you can see that
it's quite bright it puts out a lot of
light it's good for filling your room
it's enough light for a lot of
residential uses we like it quite a bit
it does cost a little more costs 2397 as
opposed to 1297 for the 60 watt
replacement that's a lot more that's
eleven dollars more than the 60 watt
replacement but as bulbs get brighter
they do get more expensive it's also
worth noting that the Cree bulb is
pretty good price compared to
competitors if you look at a 75 watt
replacement from Phillips for instance
that'll cost you about thirty dollars so
2397 not great but not unreasonable by
any stretch and this bulb keeps a lot of
the attractive specifications of the
previous cree bulbs it's got a 25,000
our lifespan so it'll last you over 20
years if you use it for three hours a
day it also has 2,700 k of color
temperature which gives it a nice warm
yellow glow and it's got a 10 year
warranty like other creep olds and we
love that that's something you can't
find out any other manufacturer perhaps
best of all is that this is a very
efficient bulb it gives off its 11
hundred lumens of light using only 13.5
watts of power and that means it's about
81 lumens per watt right there that's a
really good number we like that quite a
bit the 60 watt LED replaced with the
Cree put out got Energy Star
certification because it had 85 lumens
per watt so we'll see if 81 is good
enough for Energy Star that happens the
price this bowl could go down a little
bit if you're looking for a better
brighter bulb in your home I think
you're going to like the crease 75 watt
replacement quite a bit for cnet I'm
right wrist
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
