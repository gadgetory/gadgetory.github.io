a lot of video game consoles and
unfortunately your TV does not have
enough inputs to hook them all up there
is a solution to this problem my name is
Steven Beecham producer for C net TV and
I'm going to show you how to set up a
video game patch Bay to get started
you're going to need three things you're
going to be an RCA patch Bay three patch
cables and an RCA cable with the video
and two audio connections now finding an
RCA patch Bay is probably the hardest
part there are tons of them on eBay and
other sites like Google Shopping and
Guitar Center comm you might also be
able to find them in local music stores
and electronic shops and they range in
price from about twenty to fifty dollars
depending on the model now once you have
your patch Bay in hand it's time to now
start connecting your consoles choose an
RCA input on the back of your television
and connect the three inputs to the back
for your patch Bank on my patch Bay to
make it easy I like to do it in the
bottom right-hand side so the first
thing you would plug in is the video
plug in the video there audio white and
then audio red and then those correspond
to these three patches on the front
making for a simple patch plug in the
RCA outputs from your console to the
back of the patch bay in an order that
works best for you
I connected mine in chronological order
across the top of my patch Bay from left
to right starting with the NES then the
Super Nintendo Nintendo 64 and so on now
I'm obviously a Nintendo collector as
you can see here but this patch Bay does
work with older consoles like the og
Sony Playstation and the Sega Dreamcast
here because they have the old-school
RCA outputs so now that you've connected
all your consoles to your patch bay now
you want to label them with a pencil or
a sharpie so you know what sources
you're patching it to cube are so now
you're finally ready to start patching
your consoles into your television so
let's start with the Super Nintendo
first so I'm going to take one patch
cable plug it into the video output of
the Super Nintendo and plug it in the
television video input
I'm going to do the same with the audio
connections audio left into the audio
left of the television audio right of
the patch pay into audio right of the
television you can turn on your
television then change the input on your
television from HDMI or whatever it's
set to - a v1 or the RCA input and voila
there's your Super Nintendo so now it's
very easy to change consoles at any time
say you want to go from Super Nintendo
to Nintendo 64 you just literally take
the patch out plug it into the next one
in the line and now I'm playing James
Bond so that's it all your videogame
consoles in one place easily accessible
via your brand new video game patch Bay
