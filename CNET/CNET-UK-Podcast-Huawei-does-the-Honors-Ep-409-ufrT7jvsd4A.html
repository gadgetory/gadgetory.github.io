the scene at UK podcast this episode 409
for friday the 31st of October 2014 it's
Halloween but have no fear we've got all
the expressed technology news including
LG rising from the grave drones blurring
the line between good and evil and what
away adopting a new identity like a
scooby-doo villain with a sheet on their
head I'm rich showing homing in our
high-tech London studio this week is
spooky luke westaway actually my ghost
name is Luke Weston scary also here is
Andrew gargoyle ah who's Gary to Riley
verifying as always we are filming the
podcast so if you really need a fright
then that you can see us in this and all
our videos on on CETA on cnet or youtube
com / like a slasher ruining it but for
now let's start with the news
not so scary new to start off with at
last if your LG because it's got some
really good news on the whole profits
and sales thing which is what it does
all right so yeah it's a smartphone and
LCD TV sales are way up which is really
cool I'm see for LG 16.8 million devices
sold now that's across the it's l series
phones and of course the flagship g3
which saw surprising it's really really
good found we going with school people
seem to like it a lot of a networks have
it so good to see that that's helping LG
get to its profits and which is a 450
million dollars yeah and record sales
for phones as well record sales for five
years I think it is yeah also there's
been some interesting news on the TV
phone right league yes that's right LG
sort of hinted that it's next year it's
going to start producing TVs with
quantum dots on turns like the latest TV
buzz word and you want for that you
heard it here first um well rich just
off the top of my head quantum dots are
a semiconductor nanocrystals technology
yeah you really pushed me for more
information I'd say that it's a tiny
they're like tiny pieces of matter with
unique properties you're a tiny piece of
matter with unique properties yes I am
and what do they do they these tiny
pieces of matter with unique properties
include the ability to emit light at
very specific wavelengths sort of like
microscopic pieces of glitter that glow
green red or blue depending on their
size I am cribbing here from cnet's
extremely helpful what are quantum dots
and how could they help your next TV
article right so if you wanna know more
about quantum dots and how they will o
be cheaper TVs in the long run in the
future then yes that article is check it
out check it out good just good news any
other horror stories for a sandy horror
stories well there is some good and bad
news in fact and I said coming from the
whole world of drones start with some
good news so there we have an ambulance
drone now that
thing now this the idea behind this is
that a drone can travel up to 60 miles
an hour obviously in a straight line to
somebody who calls in a response about a
heart attack and the ambulance drone
will be able to quickly deliver
defibrillators and will also be able to
have a live stream so that the doctors
at the other end can tell like members
of the public how to help this victim
because I'm see the drone unless it's
particularly powerful can't carry an
actual medic to my circle yeah like a
lighter air ambulance it is a light air
and be there could call it dr. own yeah
oh yes yeah yeah yeah that works better
written down but okay I know this is an
audio thing but there you go um there
was pretty exciting right that's very
exciting very good news although I'm
sort of picturing I don't how reliable
Issa do we want how many drones do we
want in the air with with electrical
different Bellator's what if they just
drop it well just like you could just be
walking along and what's that shadow and
then room defibrillator well that's the
wrong person you're walking along you're
feeling a little bit little bit little
bit poorly maybe Smith the drones coming
I think the idea isn't that the driving
itself actually delivers the electric
shock just drops candy from 30th arrive
although the most cities there are lots
of public defibrillator points Oh ask
you some buddy does collapse have a
heart site because with heart attacks
it's all about of how quickly they can
get this attention and I think even
every minute dramatically increases the
chance of survival of that man obviously
in cities particularly congested ones
London Tokyo for example it's very
difficult for ambulances to cut through
the traffic I don't get arrived on the
scene where as this obviously flying in
a straight line and Matt high-speed can
get there far far quicker than a car
could that's good sex on but joins not
always good i mean we had a bit of a
near miss with a drone this recently
yeah so there was a pilot flying in
landing in an airport near london
actually who claims that a quadrocopter
drone was flying directly at the plane
and had a bit of a near miss and it's
when it got quite close to the engine so
that's yi you know whether it's whether
that's just a perp we don't know who did
this they actually haven't found out so
we're not sure whether that maybe
someone whose airplane enthusiasts when
I feel in the planes and was just a bit
steeper whoever it was
a kid messing around and didn't really
realize the risks but whatever the
reason this is a really really bad thing
to do dangerous stuff absolutely but
also in a slightly lighter note as well
we also saw a fantastic video shot with
that dragon Sweden yeah ok go's a new
video and I won't let you down mmm what
it's called yeah is yeah it's absolutely
fantastic and I haven't seen this before
you put this infant for the podcast and
it's it's amazing why I have not been
watching this time and time again it's
all filmed on drone until follows them
on ground level as well as the the
ghazal coming along they're also on
these electric unicycles Dean was
amazingly choreographed they seem exams
and then the drone takes off in the air
and looks down on a what turns out to be
ended up hundreds of people opening and
closing colored umbrellas in this
amazing choreograph sequence to make it
almost look like an like an LCD display
you know if I can when yep when words
would panic absolutely so it's looking
at at the moment you can check it out
the full length video on now on seeing
it as well it's what's amazing about
this is that it starts off me know okay
go they're known for their intricate
well caught you know integrally car yet
one take videos music videos and this
starts off with in there riding the
honda uni cub which is a little sore
like self bouncing unicycle thing we can
see there and so it starts off and you
think it's just a Steadicam following
them around you think that the gimmick
of the video is going to be that they're
they're kind of doing this choreographed
dance on the unicycle and then suddenly
the camera just shoots up in the air and
it's a it's fantastic sripad it turns it
was a custom created drone filmed films
whole thing's too catchy song too yeah
i'll be great to see you know drones
filming movies as tough as well yeah
well they're use loads I mean it's
brilliant and BBC users users load as
well for this natural history that's
Jake got to look out for planes though I
mean yes got yes you do hmm I mean
you've got some strong feelings on this
so you yeah I mean I says here yeah hang
on I'm just checking the script yes
strong feelings to follow um yeah well I
wonder if we don't need licenses for
drones it right I hate to be the sort of
light that the fuddy-duddy the licensing
Laura over there the killjoy to be
licensing Luke anyway it doesn't matter
but um licensing law is better nice is
it but the point is you know sorry to be
a nag but maybe not everyone should be
allowed to drive
because sure they're great first sort of
movies and stuff but it's not like it's
pretty dangerous nearly hit a plane I
could have been terrible should everyone
be allowed to have her join lyst sort of
flying around so a lot of people
listening will be like rights we go do
we have to do we have the right to fly
whatever we like we've got to start
thinking about who owns the rights to
the air above our heads just because we
can just because we could we should have
stopped to ask ourselves with exactly
should with high-powered drones comes
high-powered responsibility absolutely
I'm sure I mean it seems been loads new
Jones toys every weeks I'm sure we'll be
hearing some more very soon I do have
one thing yet to say gone we're talking
about drones flying into aircraft and
airports but you could just as easily
fling a frisbee at it I don't think
that's true this the aerobie the red one
is 30,000 feet appear as if we're
talking like flying in when it's coming
in to land website there's like 50 feet
yeah yeah it's just funny but you have
to get quite close to an airport if you
have not if you got a Nairobi those
things right what the hell then they go
for a bit I don't believe that there I
believe that the aerobie could be the
best frisbee around and I believe there
are strong people you can throw it a
long way we can they throw it the length
of the runway other other freebies are
available i point that out um so yes be
filia or what we license their Obie's
license there is a good thing i like
about Arabia is that the company that
makes them make sue products the arrow b
and the Aeropress coffee machines bloom
what's really yeah I so you guys do my
Aeropress that I love he also does the
mmm the frisbee the aeropress coffee
machine is really aerodynamic sorry can
you get it in the play yeah you play I
really use down you could just you know
if you get angry anyway speaking of
things like looking up in the air and
saying is it a bird is it a drone no
it's it's it's a superhero and that's
what other thing that's happened this
week wow we're not first thing with that
was amazing i know off the top and
everything yeah okay i don't get it
because i don't have any idea basically
about anything i'm about to say but mrs.
long words has been has given fans a
first look that's Black Panther all plus
we have dates for sequels to Captain
America Thor Avengers and guardians of
galaxies more silly heroes all of those
are films they are films faced on come
yes sir Marvel has basically announced
the next like a million films they can
be putting out so we're talking about
three films a year for the next four
years guardians galaxy sequels were
talking about Captain Marvel we're
talking about Doctor Strange and civil
war which is quite exciting that's a big
comics event a few years ago where
everybody had to change size do you
think about Civil War was it about it
wasn't really like good versus evil
goodies and baddies and superior's and
supervillains it's not superior is
having to take sides but kind of moral
question this idea it's what licensing
things yes like doing licensing well I
would be siding I believe with iron man
who apparently is who is the one that
the government shill that's right who
thinks that's me licensing or licensing
law hey thanks who thinks that superhero
should have to register no identities no
iron man yeah hmm I know he's one with
the metal suit yes you actually iron as
the name would suggest because that's
like the worst metal to pick two to
crack like that from heavy yeah it's so
affordable yeah it'll rust and all the
possible Caesar he'll be you can just
use a big magnet as well even in the
early days I think it might have been
but nowadays it's nanotechnology and you
actually it for a while II actually add
the suit stored inside him as
nanotechnology particles store insider
stored inside him he was ugly when it
erupted out yeah it was pretty much it
was the end of it not on I mean this is
quite good which thing quite a range of
range of he returned yes that's right um
it's good there are sort of more diverse
superhero so this should bring in the
sort of first black and female character
hello yeah movies yeah headlining man
thor and captain mob and kept long yeah
I mean lots of these films aren't out
for ages so I'm not sure in 2019 that
kind of thing I'm not sure sort of how
much we should be exactly praising
Disney in 2016 or something is doing
it's like it's not the most progressive
idea in the world like basically this
should have happened already just around
a long time ago it's a superhero movies
especially like the Avengers could
definitely stand to be more sort of
inclusive sorvall super films could be
yeah but as well as good good Stefano
graduation okay well I'm gonna have I'm
gonna have superior fatigued by 2018
2019 but I already have you guys are
being very same
already and I've never heard of any of
these ones they're just scraping a
bottle of bottom of the barrel they
haven't they haven't scraped the bottom
of the barrel until they do the eel who
was a supervillain who I think used to
fight daredevil and his super villain
power was he would grease up his body so
that when the police grabbed him he
would slide out of their grip and run
away that's like she's bridge am also
fished it does that am an eel hahahaha
I'm stilt man I don't not done stilt man
well we'll wait until you get to the
quiz because the quiz is going to have
more on this kind of silly see well on
this quiz now that's great peaking of
things that are a bit silly what else is
speaking of small things that it's maybe
technology that said yeah oping segways
just falling apart the next or so how
would you feel about a small phone yeah
that connects to your big phone I won't
say like phones so yes maybe I got
another phone to my phone so this if I
need to call my phone Taiwanese company
why me yeah why me I think that I think
as wireless me is what it our getting
something with is that is that basically
as a meanie phone if you're watching the
video version you can sit on screen now
looks a bit like like a little pocket
calculator it does you actually I that
is that it's basically just the phone
better you can send and receive calls on
this the idea being that phones some
phones like the note for the Lumia 1520
when they're like six inches in the verb
there's two big and cumbersome to get
out your pocket but you can just have
like in this little little tiny phone in
like your shirt pocket for example and
you can just if that rings you can
quickly get that on hand yeah answer
your call I have it in you in your
trouser pocket because that takes ages
to get from there there yeah get a
getting shirt or get them sake bow bow
yeah or i can see maybe if you've got
your your phones and a docked on charge
it without a room that sort of thing and
but you want to be able to have a little
thing to carry around if you take your
calls yeah i can kind of see the idea i
can see it being too efficient because
when you call someone on the phone you
don't expect them to answer straight
away and often if they do yeah it's
quite alarming if your saw like ring
ring or normally while it's ringing
you're kind of looking
around thinking about what you're going
to say in about 20 seconds time and if
they're like ring hello ah you must have
a why me so what do our readers think
about this I mean this is something I've
imagined divided opinion it has divided
opinions Oh time o day in the comments
says call me old-fashioned but a
SmartWatch still seems like the more
suitable solution to more or less the
same problem is something that this must
be so crazy that the SmartWatch seems
old-fashioned yeah good old-fashioned
smart what should be they don't make
them like they used to Jim 1348 says I
also am an avid horseback rider I
usually listen to something on my Nexus
4 while I'm on the trail yeah I keep my
phone in a jacket pocket or the chest
pocket of a vest I usually wear the
pockets are big enough to hold the nexus
4 in the ballistic case but if I move up
to a larger smartphone in the future I
might be inclined to keep my smartphone
in a different pocket and possibly use
the tort case which is this is the Y me
feel is that right yeah in that pocket
to hear the audio there you go good at
yo the horseback riding crumpled says
create named crumpled says this is
absurd / engineering in my design
opinion also if you upgrade one you have
to upgrade both our world is becoming a
consumerist fever dream and moving
swiftly on from that frightening
comments cloud matt says law it's a
little silly but with all these new
phablet phones it kind of makes sense
kinda makes sense if you've got a tablet
where it's also when maybe like what
some of like the eight and nine inch
tablets where they also are your phone
and then you know maybe you wouldn't
need to buy a small phone and a tablet
you could just have the tablet been
stead of looking ridiculous holding a
big tablet to your face you even have
this and that would be your only device
you wouldn't need the phone part so I
can succumb see that it sounds a bit
daft but it has actually it's on
Kickstarter and it's reached sixty seven
thousand dollars of its 60,000 goal with
22 days to go so that's why they be
funded so it's gonna be a real thing
it's gonna be to know what it really
needs though joking that we really put
over the top little curly cord so yeah
some zactly pocket so yeah right hello
on your little curly cool hello and you
can spin around and get humorously
tangled up in it and then the dog can
run around around your legs with it
that's all oh but what about like a cord
like you have a
new Hoover where you still stretch it
out and then you can Tony's press a
button it goes I'm here it's the best
bit Rach you in the gentleman zone when
it when it's exciting quickly be careful
with that and very quickly a last story
this is a nostalgic 1 this is 1 for an
old-fashioned speaking of old-fashioned
stuff this 1414 classic gamers well over
next news BCBS yes sir I keep ruining
all these segues just like a surreal
Segway riders mmm there we go we'll
eventually ruin a Segway ruin all the
time due to normal wear and classic game
classic game yes Star War Khattak Star
Wars games to be specific and was loving
the which ones were they expecting a
fighter yes those games you can now play
on Good Old Games that's gog.com as a
wave teamed with disney interactive and
there are some lucasarts games on there
that you can play on your window right
so you can see this on the screen now if
you watching on the video that takes me
back that does see the little shield
things and the flying around you
basically fly towards a Star Destroyer
for half an hour and then you overshoot
it you have to turn around and fly
towards it again for half an hour it
takes me right back that azz I don't
like every flight simulator ever fly in
real time over France and then crash by
accident overshoot the thing you a a
mile to land I ways to play that my and
my brother used to play he was the pilot
he did the flying around the shitty
needed the fun stuff and I had to like
manage the shields and oh I was the r2
unit that's actually like pressing the
profession a number when he spoke to you
did you I did at the crucial moment did
he did he disabled you see like I don't
turn off the shields and they'll be like
Rick rich red riches brother you've
turned off your targeting unit if you
like shut up rich I'm feeling the force
and I'm doing it I'm going for it
flowing through me actually also on
there is secret Monkey Island Indiana
Jones the fate of Atlantis and Star Wars
much the older public what do you guys
think well we haven't said it's how much
it costs which is six pounds 19 per game
which is I think vastly too much money
for these L games actually most of the
games on gog.com and for really all
games are super expensive I agree it's
also expensive just us would take us I
mean should Beatles records be be free
should Hemingway novels be free
yesterday old doesn't mean
it will be awesome if they were i should
be free they shouldn't be a statute of
limitations on on on some of these
things of when you can stop charging
because people have bought and paid for
whatever fact they're so long that now
they kind of they've done their job of
making value they should then become
like public property I think I don't
matter I don't mind paying I just think
that this is too expensive so I was
having a look through there's beyond
good and evil which is one of my
favorite games ever is fantastic and you
can get that for six pounds 20 which is
not that far off what I saw paid for it
the first time around I think I got in
the pre-owned bid at game station or
something when that was still a thing
well like three pound six pounds and 20
shillings yeah yeah yeah exactly with
enough left for a halfpenny of toffee
and and something for the cobbler um and
like three pounds 74 roller coaster
tycoon that's roller coaster tycoon
that's that's an old old game fair
another old old old k it's a few quid
for theme hospital as well I member i
think maybe in Morrison's you could get
like a pack of them by four or five of
the theme games and they were only about
three or four quid yeah fair enough but
then again you can't put a price on
memories right well I can and it's
slightly over three pound seven auto
Anderson in the comment says great now
Disney needs to spend a fraction of
their billion-dollar Empire to port
these two android we need quality games
like this and not clash of Clan clones
designed to microtransaction molest me
so yes that's a good no more contact
lens I suppose yet you only paid once
roller coaster tycoon then you get the
whole thing no microtransactions to pay
for extra bits of roller coaster stream
I just like the brakes well hospital
came to android it was very easy
particularly I did it to absolutely ruin
all the fun with oh you want to bind
more space you can either pay 299 now or
wait for like three weeks just like the
real like building system yeah
absolutely well it tell us what you
think were you a big fan of an Indiana
Jones Atlantis or tie fighter or x-wing
back in the day which classic games
would you like to see brought back to
life and would you pay for them or do
you think they should be free these days
anyway that's enough for that why don't
we move on to the big picture
yes so it's not every day a new
smartphone brand comes along but there's
something familiar about the first phone
from new brand honor it looks a lot like
the Huawei honor 6 which is fair enough
because it's the same phone as honor is
a new brand from huawei itself which is
increasingly popular chinese
manufacturer but why has the chinese
manufacturer decided to disguise itself
behind a new name especially when it's
already spent so much time and money
establishing the huawei name lately
could it be why we wants to play down
the negative connotations connecting its
name with the Chinese government and
concerns over privacy and surveillance
or could it be as one expert we spoke to
things because while we is worried about
our perceptions of cheap Chinese
products or maybe they're just trolling
us by spelling on or wrong it's got to
you in it guys anyway so and that you've
actually spent some time with the honor
6 what do you think about it I have
already spent time with Ghana sakes and
in fact here it is oh my there right
here this isn't go cry or listen to me
hold it if you're only listening yeah I
I have got it and I think it's um it's
really good actually because it in the
price ok yeah so this thing has this the
spec should expect to find on like a
high-end phone Full HD screen octa-core
processor it looks ok it's got cats 6lt
es su fast 13-megapixel kill 2 megapixel
camera but this you can pick up sim free
on Amazon UK for 250 pounds and there's
very little else that you can get that
even comes close to that at that price
ok and what a realist thing like we had
rethinking about this well star brown
and 3 says hmm this phone has a lot of
promise on paper the specs and price are
insane great design too I think there
should be an honorable contender in the
smartphone world that's worth taking a
look at nice early what you've done this
time I'm yes loreen depo PA so if I've
mispronounced that says a brand that's
not afraid to do things differently but
we will start by doing the same as
everybody else because we need another
cheap iPhone knock off as so you can see
the pictures on screen right now and it
little especially like from the side see
sort of as soon as I held it there is an
iphone alike I'm dealing with this black
glass front and back hmm it's it's gone
it's got some of the iphone stuff going
on it does feel a bit cheap though I
thought because it's it sort of
enlightened plasticky yeah it is cheap i
should say yeah and once and he's so
tell us quickly about cat6 so cat6 is
basically it's a different wavelength of
using of getting onto 4G LTE really i
mean i won't go into a technical side of
that and we do we have it here can we
enjoy it in this country yes and no it's
kind of being steadily worked on roll
that x ee i believe but it's a
combination of using different
frequencies as i understand it so it's
kind of it's a bit of it right now a bit
of a gray area know if you're on 3 or
giffgaff or something one of the cheaper
networks on you're hoping to get a phone
and finds that you can get up to 300
megabytes per second which is what cats
6lt offers no that isn't the case and
phones like iphone 6 don't have cat6
radios they have cat for yeah i mean
there is is there a reason to buy this
phone for the cat 6 meters ways wellness
right now you wouldn't buy this phone in
England fill the cat 6 LTE but it is at
least kind of future proofing yourself
if you aren't gonna buy one phone to the
next two or three years and by that time
yes your one Kasich's phone i think i
think probably the phone would be pretty
out of date by the time Kasich's comes a
locker but a good cuz you happy I aegis
but you know it's like 4g is 4g s 4g is
great it's really fast it's one better
than treaty yeah you know like I've been
on 4g for it from since like the stuff
the year i think it's great i love it i
could never go back to 3g so you know so
we're pretty impressively honestly other
they might guess I'm pretty brush with
the phone itself yep I think it's I
think it's a good idea it's it's it's
the branding that's weird the corner the
whole the law nation alright was a bit
hard yeah well tell us what you think
about honor and huawei and yeah let us
know do you think it's an iphone rip off
or do you think it's 250 quid it's it's
about solid gold bargain anyway well
that's enough of that let's move on to
this week's quiz
yes so it's Halloween edition of the
quiz the leaderboard count stands at
jason is in the lead with five Andy and
Luke are both tying with force this
exciting one of you might be able to
pull ahead sent in terms of buzzers Luke
sounds like this terrifying she late
lately chilling stuff and speaking of
buzzes Andy sounds like this Oh will it
be a chainsaw massacre for Andy okay so
it's actually a halloween-themed but
going back to what we talked about at
the superheroes and supervillains and I
want you to tell me how these
superheroes or supervillains got their
powers okay question number one the
original flash was a college kid who got
super speed from an experiment that went
wrong there's no smoke without fire but
why did the experiment go wrong Andy how
did he throw me go wrong Sam's gonna say
that I know nothing about any
superheroes so I'm not gonna win this
quiz so let's just stop some fun I think
yep I was a question the original flash
for the college kid he got super speed
from the experiment gone wrong I did his
frame ago rod there's no smoke without
fire but how did the experiment go wrong
there was a fire in the testing chamber
no I'm afraid that's not the correct
answer Luke you'll never crack this 10
ft ceilings chillin um I feel like I
should probably know this cuz I by
feeling of a person I've gone for fairly
obscure ones I'm gonna say that
something fell into the magimix set on
fire like someone put a spoon in the
micro thats that's not the correct
answer what happened was the original
flash he stopped for a cigarette break
what and knocked the experiment over he
studied got three thirty he stopped for
a smoke and he knocked his experiment
over and the next thing you know he had
superpowers there so no one got that one
correct but they go well I mean there's
the moral of the story no smoking kids
don't smoke especially in a lab
environment why did they pick him to be
the flash exactly he was a terrible
flash question number two ultra boy has
a whale of a time electro boy he has a
whale of a time with powers similar to
Superman but
how did he get his powers and by the way
his name is Jonah he's a space character
and for Jonah Luke I think universe now
did he find them inside a space whale he
did behind the milk amazing who asserts
play even Superman remarked on the
coincidence well your name is Jonah and
you were swallowed by space well so
there you can Superman suit man's not
like the sharpest knife in the drawer
there is he so when one of his powers
math is stating the obvious yes so you
can lead one point there so I last last
question this is this could be the one
that tied up for a local my band he can
come back question 3 the Whizzer great
gain super speed after a brush with
death are these real but what animal and
what what animal bit him and what
happened after that to give him super
speed Andy I think it was yeah um was a
fast animal an animal that's known for
go fast not especially as dc-based I
think a scorpion that's that's a long
the wrong the right lines but now I'm
afraid that's not the correct answer
that's that's not too bad Luke you
another crack at this one what's his
name the wizard the Whizzer whether
cryptic clues in the in the question
I've forgotten not he was pretty was
bitten by an animal ok just for just
buzzing in there's a formality um was it
the humble and swallow it was it was not
that would have known for fighting well
i'm young smearing their powers to yeah
it's what i said quick know what
actually happened was he was bitten by a
cobra and his father that that wasn't
what given the powers I mean I'm you
don't guess I was just because you get
bitten by a cobra unfortunately don't us
but what happened was his dad same time
to make some calls yeah thinking quickly
his his dad then injected him with
mongoose blood but I shall see mongooses
and cobras they may forget sure and that
added up to the pass their blood doesn't
fight each other that is quick thinking
but it is but it's but ridiculous
thinking I mean why didn't he suck the
poison out that's what you're supposed
to do in a quick thinking poisons to H
no idea no idea but look you at one
point so you win so that yeah it is salt
well that's good that's a solid victory
I know I say swales Luke and Jason are
both on five points so it'll be awhile
before Jason comes back in podcast
I'm going to address quest because it
plays to deliver of my strength was
there a tiebreaker question or even if I
was a tiger / question it was about the
toughest superhero in the Marvel
Universe who is of course Squirrel Girl
that way as we all know squirrel girl
squirrel girl see I get point so yeah
sure a nice try but man rich has already
changed the scores in the running audio
which we can all edit incidentally so
there you go that was this week's quiz
come back next week who's gonna go black
I don't know all about my new black yeah
sure why not not gonna do that let's go
on to this week's feedback Andy good
wind on email says hi chaps keep up the
good work I really enjoy listening to
the podcast exam dating sandy kind I
just wanted to share an odd story so I
may potentially help other tech fans
okay um this week I was flying out of a
small private UK airport terminal for
work fancy hmm and my hand luggage was
randomly checked no bother I thought
happens all the time but when my ipad
mini and magnetic cover was swapped yeah
it returned a strong hit for a
prohibited chemical gasp I was shocked
to say the least and had no idea why
until the security guard asked if I'd
done anything to it recently and I
remembered cleaning the cover with
antibacterial spray oh she said that
will explain it after multiple retesting
and filling out the form i was told
never to attempt to fly with the
contaminated ipad cover again and warned
that at a busy major terminal it could
have been confiscated and the police
could have been called chatting to a
colleague it turns out they have also
seen a laptop being confiscated after
someone had given it a once-over with an
antibacterial cleaning wipe moral of the
story be careful how you spruce up your
tech if you plan on taking it abroad or
you can end up losing your gadgets or
even missing your flight I'll be
sticking with good old soapy water from
now I'm never washing again just in case
I get swapped down and yet refused to
use the flight well let's walk down is a
sort of wash hmm anyway don't i do i'm
going to just get a wet wipe your nose
it over the danger zones or something to
bear in mind if your if your fly yes
thank you Andy that was a good
and frightening tech story because of
those antibacterial things you get them
everywhere you'll probably buy them in
airports all right what else we got um
what do you have Monsieur Adi saying
this week avnish arani says what are the
10 top budget smartphones out there
which have the same sound capabilities
as bows or sennheiser so I'm not really
sure what's going on with this question
maybe avnish means top 10 budget
headphones which have the same sound
capabilities bows as bosal sennheiser
well I I thought maybe the point of the
question was wanting a smartphone that
has like speaker quality for playing
music allowed that will rival like a set
of bose or sennheiser speakers in which
case none of them because their phones
not speakers but the closest you'll get
would be the HTC One m8 because their
front facing speakers out that's quite
powerful actually okay um he's talking
about head fairies pricing though then
both bows and sennheiser do do some
quite good budget headphones around yeah
34 a big mark with you actually really
good my sennheiser pretty good yeah you
can also google CNET's best budget
headphones and we have best cheap
headphones of 2014 we have best earbuds
in ear headphones of 2014 it's all going
on they have all the cheap stuff you
can't want to written know about Nathan
King says how on earth do one plus one
offer the specs they do for two hundred
and ninety-nine dollars sweatshops oh
that's not check out those that's
probably libelous up um yeah we don't
know well I cost components first yeah I
mean it's I don't think it's that
surprising when you look at so we were
talking about the Huawei honor we've got
like the Moto G it's it doesn't it seems
it doesn't really cost that much to
build and really cheap smartphone and
even be very thin profit margins as well
yeah so they'll be hoping to sell very
familiar mean tech always gets much
cheaper which is why it's amazing the
apple store charges as much for the
iphone and we still do I guess more
expensive they're sore margin is
unbelievable anyway um Andrew temple he
says which set of fanboys has the
biggest set of trolls we be asking for
trouble if we answer this we would
either all as bad as it is each other so
as good at lovelyz as they're all as
wonderful as each other uh yeah i mean i
don't sort of i'm like this kind of
trolling sort of family welcoming
robusta is a healthy discourse you know
a conversation yeah but you know like
we're all sort of we all like phones
which is itself a pretty niche thing to
like why must we device out further you
know like it's already a kind of glee
key sort of nerdy nerd income I think in
real life if you went to a developer who
wants to introduce yourself to a load of
strangers and over there in one corner
you've got all the people talking about
banking regulations over the other side
all people shouting at their football on
TV you only find a bunch of people
talking about phones whatever your
allegiance you're gonna go and fit in
with these guys and chat so just get on
my eyes as a message of peace yeah and
of tolerant I'm why can't we split line
because of just watch bands get along
and that is a much yeah a lovely message
to end on please get feedback coming yes
by emailing us at our email address
which is seen at UK podcast at CBS i.com
that's right now there isn't gonna be a
podcast next week we wash in a couple of
weeks you have afraid so I am off in
Dublin interviewing famous people not
really I'm in Dublin for web summit and
I producer Mark people never see is also
not here apparently he's even harder to
go on holiday I don't know what that's
about that's in my other baby anyway
thanks tomorrow he doesn't know who
doesn't get let out the building you
just are technically on holiday with in
the middle to go to the second floor
yeah those guys they've got a blow-up
palm tree maybe that's what it's got in
mind gathers dust off the balcony yet so
easily misused must be what it is
alright well thank you ND look who's
face thank you obviously you'll never
say especially not next inked and we are
now off to see what that noise is in the
cellar see you next week bye
