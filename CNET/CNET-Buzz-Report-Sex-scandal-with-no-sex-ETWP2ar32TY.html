buzz report the show about the tech news
that everyone is talking about this week
you're perfectly serviceable home
theater solution the entire future of
the friggin internet and a sex scandal
without any sex first up the gadget of
the week this week that gadget is the
super utilitarian actually kind of neat
little thing gadget of the week that I
really sort of one it's the Sony HTC
t150 it's a sound bar home theater
system that includes just the bar and a
subwoofer cost less than three hundred
dollars has three hdmi inputs and it
sounds good right technology doesn't
have to be confusing sometimes it's just
what you want actually can we pick this
show up again after i order that is it
just me i love that thing and now for
the news google and verizon have
announced a modest proposal they're
calling it a legislative framework for
how net neutrality should work in the
future they said the current wired
internet should remain totally open
non-discriminatory and scalable no pay
for extra access just a wide open field
of innovation then again that's the old
wired internet that no one is really
investing in anymore and that's running
out of bandwidth so then there are two
other areas of potential net neutrality
regulation first wireless broadband
networks like the one Verizon currently
operates under Google and verizon's
proposal those do not have to be neutral
networks Wild West out there and then
they have this concept of private
networks which could be like premium
content or medical networks or the porn
channel and those could also be tiered
and cost extra and be unnatural too so
you know basically all the stuff verizon
and Google can make lots of money on in
the future should be totally free from
consumer friendly regulation or rules
nice thanks you guys I am super glad
you're not officially in charge of
writing laws so everyone email your
congressional representatives would you
and hope that there's nothing juicy
about them on google street view what a
world moving on let's talk about a sex
scandal without any sex shall we it's
strangely appropriate that Jodi Fisher
is the soft course kinam actress I made
that up because she's the woman who
apparently brought down HP CEO mark hurd
and
both of them insist there wasn't even
any nookie heard stepped down last week
after reports that he patted expense
reports in order to maintain a close
personal relationship with Fisher and
considering that he's a bajillion air
and also didn't get any that would seem
to make him kind of a double sucker and
either HP is very very serious about its
accounting policies or this guy was not
as popular as HP stock price would
suggest and in news that says stubborn
as a herpe the verizon iphone rumors are
back this week according to TechCrunch
Qualcomm is making CDMA chips for Apple
in large quantities the phone is
expected to be announced in december and
delivered in january and it will have a
newly insulated exterior antenna you
might even be able to get a white one
I'm over it and finally a very special
clogging the tubes senator ted stevens
the man who gave us the series of tubes
meme that inspired this segment was
killed this week in a plane crash in
alaska and the internet had kind of a
soft spot for the corrupt old senator
who totally didn't understand the
internet so on that note we wish him a
fitting farewell the internet is not the
internet is not a big truck the internet
is not something that you just dump
something on the internet is not
it is not a big truck the internet
series of coalition yes and that's the
buzz report for this week everyone i'm
molly wood and thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
