coverage of CES 2018 and I'm about to be
joined by a special robot friend this
from Segway robotics with Adam Bao hi
Adam what an entrance to me know what is
this this is the this is a Segway with
more yeah well show you about transform
loom oh yeah this is basically a Segway
mini mini plus spill on the mobile
capabilities of Segway but also with AI
capabilities especially with the vision
okay
it's I see my face in here mm-hmm is it
looking for me yeah you want to say hi
to everyone here all right well hey LUMO
say hello okay so it's basically your
typical Segway with a personality now
let's give me the backstory here yeah
absolutely I mean I think is um there's
a lot of robots out there just robots at
home robot robots outside I think the
the LUMO is probably one of the only
robots they can have with you both
indoors and outdoors if you're going out
for adventure going for a joyride you
can bring it with you and you can write
it to a park for example you can get off
if you're tired maybe put your back on
top of it so it can actually recognize
your face in your body follow you around
it's facial recognition exactly a soda
so the AI is really focused on computer
vision and it can first detect your face
in your body you can recognize it and
then can track you to follow you so I
like my Segway knowing who I am I guess
because it just will follow me oh yeah
sure you know I think um it was you know
Segway is incredible company but this is
not not just a transportation vehicle
it's a robot companion so you know it
can do a lot of things it has
increasingly more personalities it's
moving it's moving yeah exactly exactly
so I mean in this state when we're not
telling do anything in particular it's
actually assessing the environment right
kind of certain things a season my like
maybe I'll give you the heart face
maybe you'll move around if it'll come
up close to you I think it likes the
folks over there right now
so you know there's some really initial
basic emotions but I'm increasingly grow
over time but emotions
you mean like it's got a little buddy
personality yeah yeah exactly I mean I
think um when you have mobile
which is a key robotic trait unite a eye
and a vision but you also add a
personality that makes they're really
really cool and really really fun really
more and more so robot companion in just
something that does things for you all
right give me a little demo what else
you can do yeah exactly so why don't we
try to put a use case let's say you're
in a like a park or something and then
you can have it fall again you're tired
so I'm so tired of riding my Segway not
walking okay gosh I wish I could walk
should I go over there actually I'll
share because quite robots gonna move
around a little bit so lumo follow me
okay lumo follow me follow me okay all
right so sees me it's following me huh
it's bit of a narrow space so that's
what we can do can I walk further oh
yeah yeah think again okay so there's
need to see my face it can kind of focus
on my back as well so he's kind of
locked on to you once he like locks on
your face yep follow me mm-hmm
it seems my god yes yeah I know exactly
it's pretty cute so I mean if you have
something like this which is claimed
oboe but also is smart right like it's
it's really cute you don't want it just
to be something that does things for you
but you want it purely helpful exactly
you would tell me it also like it has
remote control capabilities too and yes
I see through it yeah exactly well I
mean even in the state right now you
know it can follow me it can take videos
and pictures but if I want to control
myself
sure document okay yeah I mean if if
your hand with your friends right like
maybe you don't want to take pictures
all the time they can take a picture and
video of all of you guys together
you mean track your faces actually
position it properly so you know no
moments go unnoticed and what about this
mode you were telling me earlier about
called avatar mode yeah let me show you
can't find a smartphone oh I think our
our friend over there's got the
smartphone thanks alright so you can
kind of like see through its eyes yeah
exactly so I mean let's make sure the
camera can see that okay so there's a
it's an app but it's one of the feature
is right so you're seeing the camera
point of view right now of yeah exactly
so you can control it here there's the
monent and then you know this is that
the head swivel take video you can do a
bunch of other stuff can I use two yeah
yeah yeah put the mic down for a second
alright alright can it find me so let's
see mm-hmm one second at least you know
when the robots come we can still
control them somewhat okay I see it's
still uh is it connected hold up I think
the wife has a bit of an issue actually
yes an issue yeah there's a lot of
people here I saw you do it earlier when
you know practicing oh there it is okay
just a little better okay so oh there it
is
I think we reconnected I so sees you
over there right
okay so it's uh hello sono hi down boy
good boy good boy
and I guess we're living in the future
now hi hi LUMO
all right so got a camera here camera
here it's okay we could be friends I'll
be close oh can I can I write this thing
cuz that's like the only question I have
in my mind this whole time I want to
ride a robot and now I feel like it's
the perfect CES finally we have merged
writable things and robots oh hi even
see my face in here it's looking for me
yeah now you decided not to have like
like a like a little cutesy face I think
a lot of robots these days have like a
cutesy personality face like I've not
seen little eyeballs on this guy I mean
once it gets to know you you know it'll
you know recognize you you don't know
you better and as a friend it'll give
you the hearts give you like the funny
faces so that's the personality
component right right now it's pretty
simple overall but over time when it
gets to know you better
it'll treat you the way you treat it
okay so when we look at it alright so
while we were talking it did this thing
just flipped and converted um so yeah
have you written these things before
well we wrote it for one second before
so let's hope I don't
okay sure alright one foot at a time
okay okay I'm good we're good yeah you
can pick it up me a couple minutes time
be very sensitive with it like I was
trying to turn I turned a little too
much yes I had to be very focused with
my Jedi thoughts and just think think
about going forward and think about
slightly tilting right like I'm using my
knee to kind of tilt the centre there
yep
this isn't that hard considering I have
no balance and coordination skills
whatsoever I have never written it's
pretty good yeah not bad at all I feel
like I feel like with a day I could
totally get this down oh yeah I think
someone like you know take five minutes
or three well thank you so much for
showing this I really appreciate it
I'm just gonna write off with it so
thank you for joining us this has been
Lomo and we're gonna be back and with
with Sony so stay tuned for CES the CNET
live stage whoo-hoo the future</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
