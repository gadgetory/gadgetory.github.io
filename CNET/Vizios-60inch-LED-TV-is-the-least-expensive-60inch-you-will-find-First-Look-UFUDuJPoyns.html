next to vizio 60-inch e61 ia3 that
mouthful denotes a 60-inch LED TV with
Smart TV now given those specs how much
you think it costs if you guess a
thousand dollars your rice TV is the
least expensive 60-inch LED TV we've
ever seen and @s Smart TV it's also
pretty darn good let's get to the design
on the set around the edge of the screen
you'll note a very thin bezel it's about
7/8 of an inch thick on the top and
sides the bottom is a little bit thicker
of course the slim design the set makes
it look like it's pretty much all
picture when seen from the front and
from the side it's an LED TV obviously
because it's pretty sliver thin
especially for such a large screen that
Smart TV feature is the headliner on
this set aside from the screen size
Vizio is via app suite has an excellent
selection of content including Netflix
Hulu Plus Amazon Instant and pretty much
no missing streaming video services
plenty of good audio - including Pandora
and Rhapsody on the downside the design
of the interface is not quite as
intuitive as a lot of the other
competitors out there but again for this
inexpensive we'll scroll around a little
bit on the bottom in the trade-off for
having such good content TV does have
built-in Wi-Fi of course you can connect
wirelessly without having to run an
Ethernet cable at the back of the
television other connections are ample
there's four HDMI one component video
two USB as well as a PC input so there's
really nothing missing from the back
panel another cool feature on this vizio
nothing you'd expect at this price point
is a flipper remote so it's got a normal
remote on one side when you turn it over
the back side has a QWERTY keyboard that
enables you to enter searches and
passwords and stuff used in smart TV a
lot easier than those virtual on-screen
keyboards the downside is that there's
no backlighting and you do have to keep
the keyboard aimed at the screen because
it uses IR instead of Bluetooth but
still pretty cool to have a QWERTY at
this price point vizio offers umpteen
picture presets named after sports they
really don't improve the look of sports
but it's nice to have those extra slots
anyway advanced adjustments include
two-point grayscale and ability to
adjust the smoothing D judder on this
hundred twenty Hertz TV moving on to
picture quality the Vizio rated a six or
good overall on our review which means
that it's pretty darn good or better
than a lot of the other LED TVs out
there but really not the best especially
compared to some of the
other more expensive models main
weakness on this video picture wise the
inability to Bruce a very deep shade of
black and dark scenes you can see the
image is a little bit more washed out
than some of the other LED tvs we also
saw some uniformity issues which are
some brighter spots especially in dark
scenes in near the corners and sides on
the flip side the color on this TV is
very accurate especially in brighter
areas darker areas did tend a little bit
towards blue we also appreciated the big
matte screen did a great job of
controlling ambient light so if you have
a very bright room this video is
definitely going to be better than a
similarly priced large screen plasma on
the other hand some of those large green
clouds will definitely produce a better
picture in this vizio in dark rooms so
they're going to be the choice for video
files that's a quick look at the vizio
e1i a3 series available in 60 and 70
inches for one in two thousand dollars
respectively the best values among big
screen LED TVs we've tested this year
