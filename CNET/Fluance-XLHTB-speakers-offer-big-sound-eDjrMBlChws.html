speakers for your home cinema there
isn't really a sweet spot you can keep
on spending until you've mortgaged off
your house and never fully achieve movie
Nirvana however there are some
psychological stops along the way with
1,000 bucks being one of them the
fluence XL HD B is a 5 speakers surround
package without a sub that fits
comfortably below this limit at 799
dollars the first thing you notice is
that these speakers are huge and unless
you have a large living space these are
pretty much overkill for the money this
is a very handsome looking offering with
a combination of piano gloss and cherry
vinyl wrap black is also available and
the appointments are very nice with each
of these towels coming with an 8 inch
base driver in the base though they're
not really subs as fluence claims as
they don't have their own volume control
and the fittings also high-quality with
possibly the best-looking binding posts
I've ever seen the other speakers aren't
quite as high-quality with an audible
hollow sound when you knock the
satellites and the fittings aren't quite
as cool this lopsidedness carries over
to the performance as well with the
towers being decently good and the
all-important center channel only being
okay with boxy dialogue the towers are
immediately oppressive though with those
subs pairing a very big sound but what
is missing is subtlety mid-range detail
is just as important in movies as it is
in music and it can get lost on this
system
it sounds up sided at times just to
Basie and we've heard some harshness in
the treble if you push the volume up on
the wrong material which wasn't evident
either on more expensive or cheaper
speakers the fluence XL HDB is a very
nice system and it works well for
blockbuster movies but music or
dialogue-driven movies are left wanting
compared to its competition this has
been ty Pendlebury for cnet.com
