least two years you probably notice that
your battery doesn't last quite as long
as it used to you that's because most
smartphones use lithium ion batteries
which typically only function normally
for about two to three years so how can
you tell if your battery needs a
replacement well here are three easy
ways to figure it out the first is that
your phone just isn't lasting very long
this is pretty obvious but if you've
charged your phone and then you unplug
it and it dies immediately or even if it
dies in like an hour or two I so tell us
how sign that there's something wrong
you also want to make sure that it's not
a software problem so you'll want to
make sure that it's happening
consistently also check for any software
updates that may address the issue make
sure you have the latest software
updates that's always important number
two is that your phone gets hot and I'm
talking really hot like uncomfortably so
a normal functioning battery will
periodically vent excess heat but one
that's on its way out will have a lot of
trouble doing that which will result you
playing hot potato with your really
really hot phone and lastly if you can
access your smart phones battery you'll
want to check for any swelling or
bulging on the physical battery itself
now this is a properly functioning new
battery so you won't see that here
swelling or bulging occurs when one of
these cells inside the battery has
ruptured due to overheating so you'll
definitely want to stop using it
immediately because it can still explode
or catch fire
now two ways to extend the life of your
batteries - one never leave it plugged
in and charged to capacity for an
extended amount of time and to never let
it deplete completely to zero doing
either of these will adversely affect
the life of your battery the big
takeaway here is that lithium-ion
batteries don't last forever and
eventually you're going to have to
replace them whether that's replacing
just the battery or your entire phone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
