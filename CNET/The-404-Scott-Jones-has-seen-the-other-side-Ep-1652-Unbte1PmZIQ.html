the 404 show it is friday march forth oh
man you know I every now and then and
we've had a great string of guests
lately we have I think we're in the
midst of an all-star this is like sweeps
week lycra for us it is really is this
is how were judged you ready air king we
had jordan hoffman two weeks ago you
know that guy well Steve Guttenberg for
four all-star and now is this your
second appearance I think it's my third
third I've been in two of them because I
was here the last time you I think the
last time i did one with russ yeah and i
did one one time where it was just the
two of us oh right that was an intimate
ordeal was a great day ladies and
gentlemen help us welcome back for the
third time mr. Scott Jones yeah Scott
Jones a little awkward I'm clapping for
myself why not we don't do it enough
right we don't as a people we don't do
it enough why shoulders off I love me do
you as you should why not totally why
into it it's so weird to be back in New
York I'm staying at a hotel that's just
about a block and a half away from here
Scott staying at the Ace Hotel which is
a very very nice very high tell ya
hipster coffee in the basement Aaron
stumptown club Hannah yeah I stop there
on the way you can see I have it right
here uh but uh you know coming back to
New York and I first moved here in the
mid-90s right I feel really old now and
for years and years I felt great every
time I would come here wherever I would
go I just feel like I'm not aging at all
and now coming back to New York this
time I feel like everything's maybe
because I've been in Canada for so long
I think Canada does that to a person so
what does that mean that people in
Canada look older no I just feel like
this is a city that very young people of
Charis gathering yes and in the hotel
that I'm staying which is now yeah it's
super hipster shit tips are central yeah
it's kind of douchey but I mean I kind
of like it too at the same time to tell
it I don't really fit in yeah anymore
even like you know I have to when I
first moved to New York I was so nervous
about the people in New York
accepting me and finding me appealing hi
everybody feels like way from originally
I'm from upstate near Syracuse all right
okay the good you're one of the good
guys am I he's ghost good guy I'm an
East Coast good guy but you know I
dreamed of New York for so long as an
outsider and i would i'd never visited
New York until I was in college okay not
as a kid my parents weren't interested
but I would watch TV shows like The Odd
Couple and they were always open with
Oscar and Felix you guys we haven't you
especially the same age he's a little
bit oh yeah a little long a couple years
old there that TV show would open with a
montage of new york city area I'm just
like why don't we live there here all
these people they live in little rooms
on top of each other their roommate but
they also love their roommate yeah one's
a sports writer when runs the vacuum and
the ride trains that go underneath the
city like what a magical place it's
amazin a shin with New York growing up I
I was lucky enough to be here you know
my whole life kind of coming in and out
all the time yeah that's a great part of
that but then I moved here and I was
thinking about this story last night
because I went out for a walk when I got
here was just totally gently here and
it's freezing like that it hasn't it
never snows where i live in the part of
canada that i live in and so last night
with like whoosh weather shock for me i
went out to look for water and finally I
found a little deli i'm in a weird that
Ace Hotel exact whole yeah nothing
around yesterday so i found a little
random delhi and i got two bottles of
water it was four dollars a bottle hmm
I'm like I said to the guys guy leaning
over the counter he's looking at his
phone he's not even paying attention I'm
sure he's charging me the out of counter
price I think big bottles I mean they're
like the two liter bottle SmartWater
it's Poland Springs toyota brand i wanna
areas like smart water would cost
whatever looks right no spring that do
you think you got you got like swindle
oh yeah I look like an outsider now I
was feeling really insecure and I said
to the game like four dollars a bottle
for this every other part of the world
even every other part of New York it's
three dollars at most yeah two dollars
in most parts of New York is like these
are the New York that's that's what New
York water costs ah
and I went back to the hotel and
ironically not New York water poland
polish water who knows words actually
who knows what tap it came out her but I
just felt likes it like for sure that I
got fleeced I've been here for like 20
minutes that I got fleeced and you have
this legacy were like I don't deserve
that so I was gonna say been here you
know being on weights what I told him I
said to the guy used to live here I
lived here for 15 years like my baby I
the outside I was gonna say you look
very good you look young hale hearty I
wouldn't say like you're getting up in
years certainly but now you're
complaining about water prices and that
might be the first step into going down
i right not wrong all right all right
we'll just send it back did you write a
letter when you come to New York you
wonder can I still cut it here yeah have
I still got it well then will they will
they buy the illusion of me pasas in New
Yorker but I just felt like some old guy
from out of town who's wearing all the
wrong clothes no I think you're also in
that neighborhood like who there's no
one living in that neighborhood you know
it's just essentially Taurus and people
that work there during the day so in the
neighborhood I mean you know if you were
added bodega in whatever like Queens
jackson heights mm-hmm um I don't think
you'd get that same sort of treatment
all right you gotta you gotta really
take the all the context into account
yes I you know I don't know if you want
to do this I know you have an agenda and
we don't a lot of time today but well I
just want to tell you my first night
going out in New York I felt so insecure
about going out I had to go meet some
people I knew one person but I was
getting introduced in all these mid 90s
mid 90s and so I had this shirt it was a
flannel shirt I'm sure I look like some
hillbilly that was cool then though it
wasn't cool yeah I wasn't even with the
grunge thing like that was like late
night okay so what I did is I was in my
tiny apartment that I couldn't afford
and I cut the sleeves off of it like
right down here and I rolled him up just
to try to make it look cooler yeah and I
went out and I saw my friend at this bar
and she said what did you do to your
shirt like I will never pass here
so tough but that was an edgy move and
that's what the city is about is making
edgy it was Asian even if even if you
walk away looking a little brighter bill
cunningham would take a picture of you
and you'd be famous about that now i
want to back up a bit and explain to
people who maybe don't know who you are
yes and explain that you have been in
this industry in the one space in about
15 years about 15 years your veteran
better in I do feel like I'm one of the
elders of the village sure and it's a
village that's changing you guys know
this but anybody go to any press event
i'm a video game guy like I loved games
my whole life yeah for city long before
I moved to New York I didn't feel like I
was ready for New York so my starter
city was chicago i moved to chicago and
i was obsessed with video games because
i didn't want to I didn't want to face
all the things that I couldn't I wasn't
ready to face and where life I damn I
didn't want to deal with all the
complications so I got a job but at
night I would drink 12 packs okay that's
a bad first step chair and I would play
video games you have an itch the 12-pack
yeah some nights I'd okay yeah but I
would play video games and they this was
the this was like the early 90 you know
I was playing a super metroid my Super
Nintendo was just like I couldn't
believe what a magical machine parish a
definite entre alien wars yes I'm super
smash TV everything had super in front
of it is super generation but electronic
gaming monthly was in Chicago back then
I guess that's another time effin when
when magazines used to have offices at
very rare now like press room is either
yeah yeah yeah it's very rare but I was
a i would get this magazine like holy
crap it's right here in Chicago it's
probably right down the street from
where I live and I just remember like
who I was then i remember my hopefulness
for the future and i remember being
excited about something like working at
egm really is aa is been operating on
fumes for years at this point but at the
time I was a juggernaut the time I was
the only one that was you standard
I was a computer gaming world was also
floating around their pc gamer was still
floating around there but I mean they
were they were like I would say four or
five that were like big buts egm was
like the they were the going down yeah
so you did so so explain that path out
of Chicago uh function when I was in
Chicago I was trying to be a writer and
his thought at some point I'm gonna have
to give up video games i'm gonna have to
get serious i'm gonna i was put on a
suit well no I wanted to be a poet I
wanted I thought that that was the way
to do things that is serious I will see
you so it's mid 90s you're in chicago
and you're like I got it I'm gonna be a
poet you know what I'm going to quote
some TS Eliot for you right now yes go
then you and I when the evening is
spread out against the sky like a
patient etherized upon a table wow you
know up lapua tree is barely permeate
lovesong of j alfred Prufrock yeah again
like I can make up stuff to you know I
didn't know i'm joking nobody i was i
thought well i can do this like i can
become a successful you were passionate
you you it that affected you loved you
yes yes uh and so what i was doing in
chicago was i was getting some city
experience i was applying for graduate
school uh thinking about working or
probably for poetry okay and and so i
applied to graduate school I got into
Columbia variable I got into Iowa it's
amazing I was like that big writing the
big writing one the right girls all
right I've seen a girl's that's right
and uh and then i also got into syracuse
and syracuse was back where I grew up
and I got a full scholarship holy shit
so I mean you kind of almost always do
if you're gonna go back to school for
some sort of RT thing here you shouldn't
accrue more debt right you're going I
totally agree with these like I didn't
get any money from Iowa I didn't get any
money from bear I would have had a
really struggle I could have gone to
either one but I went with the freebie
and went back to syracuse settled for
Syracuse oh my god that's it that's a
great set it's pretty far down on the
list I feel regretful that I didn't go
to Columbia bullet what was your endgame
here like okay so you go to school for
poetry what's what is what is the not
depressing outcome
no altercations you know I was
fascinated with like New England
colleges like I like those little sort
of snow globe come at some things I
wanted it all says another time I want
can I talk they're charming on a level
that is not I want anywhere I wanted an
office that had a little fireplace in it
right and allowed to write my stories
and I want to be in my office on a meet
with my students maybe have an affair
with a student I don't know you want
your profession I wanted to be a
professor got it and so what they just
not that in there the old affair with
the students tell me I'm being honest
about what's in my heart or what was in
my or younger you these were the things
that cross the room and label how old
were you then I was in my mid-20s on me
20 was about your age now I'm 30 I'll be
34 in a couple weeks you're so sexy 434
thanks man that's nice uh so yeah that
was my non depressing endgame okay so I
I got my degree my MFA in poetry very
useful degree move to New York City and
I don't know why I'm going into my whole
life I like this because this you know
people are like oh who's this Jones guy
whatever and you know we've had you on
before and when you were on before you
were very ingrained in the video game
industry writing and courteous being I
don't know less so a little less so you
you spend a lot of time in Canada on on
Canadian television very famous in
Canada very famous in Canada uh yes yeah
you don't don't don't hesitate I don't
know you know like I'm the show that I
used to host ended on December 31st that
was the end of it electric playground
that's it yeah Victor Lucas with Victor
Lucas yes legendary Victor Lucas and I'm
so grateful that I got a chance to work
with him for so many years how many
years are we there is six year I've been
there I'm been there for a little over
seven years yes American maybe from a
Canadian citizenship very exciting you
know what what I would get that I would
get it in a heartbeat why because things
are going listen I've been doing a
little bit of reading you can't just get
up and move to Canada I found out it's
not even doesn't work like that even if
things don't go also with the whole
Trump situation just like if for
whatever reason you ever needed you know
to take a trip and get some medical
procedures done for real cheap I names
like a good stuff I know we're not the
one's the only ones who told you this no
and and I'm i like it like I like the
graphic rates are higher it's it's a
great country our dollars destroyed
right now there every year dollars is
worth like a dollar fits amazing that
quickly that happened it was when white
a while i was in what during the
recession i feel like they were above
for a little bit i was a montreal in
july of 15 and it was 121 that's crazy
and now it is half that right that yeah
it's probably like every it's about 60
cents that's bit so that bottled water
was like 20 bucks for you i would have a
point about that always asks that now
because i have been doing some different
kinds of work and then you know where's
your paycheck coming from is it from the
us or canadian and whenever I say well
that one's from the US bit oh sweet
Alice Oh take dinner tonight don't know
the cave us what you guys are better in
the US money a long time I feel like we
have it if you live in the US it doesn't
really benefit you you understand like
it's all sure everything's priced
accordingly yeah which is great which is
fine i mean so so now that's a a chapter
in your life that's that's that's
closing yeah well as clothes the
journalism side will the EP stuff yeah
the EP stuff is done and I don't know if
I want to do TV anymore like I I felt
like it was something I needed to learn
how to do when I was trying to be a
writer write really all I'm really
interested in is writing I don't want to
do TV I like having a conversation with
you guys yeah but I don't need like I'm
not dying to share I don't even know
what it means any more like why why
would you want to be on TV like TV is
going away yeah really interesting is
like it's pocono like people on cruise
that work at like whatever like big
national networks here in the city and
it'll be like an assistant director or
someone like that and all they talked to
me about cuz I'm just there to guests or
whatever it is is like hey so you know
any like new media companies yes then
they see the writing on the wall that
Mike this is not a ten year or 20 year
plan here see i right they definitely
see they see a little bit of the future
in what's coming and you're crazy to
ignore something like that yeah I think
I don't think the the big networks are
going anywhere no but I
think they're sort of like spider
webbing out yeah and sort of uh reaching
you on a different plane I know that's
not groundbreaking or anything but I
think there is still room for production
value air like TV sets it's just not a
television you like all that stuff
wherever it's consumed I still think
that is still very relevant so when we
say like TVs going away and we mean
gathering around the couch is going away
like your living room is going away
essentially yeah I just think about the
ways in which we spend most of our time
these days and I did have cable during
the NFL season this was the first NFL
season wife committed to every game this
year okay i watch as many games as I
could I enjoyed it so much but as soon
as it was over as soon as the Super Bowl
was done i had the plug pulled yeah cuz
i was watching okay i was watching like
like people's court in the afternoon
yeah and i started craving it every day
I'm like oh it's two-thirty and I think
people's courts on maybe something
interestings going on I like that judge
milian see what's happening her eyes are
really beautiful uh but then I'm just
like I can't go through my life like you
have I mean I so during lunch you know I
work at home and during lunch I watch
like new girl on netflix like you have
things to get addicted to an outside to
see I know but I feel like at least
netflix you're making a choice okay he's
not making the tragedy so if you can't
just leave it on his background see and
I've always argued that there should be
this sort of always on thing that
Netflix duh Yeah Yeah right where you
kind of uh this is gonna sound may be
crazy to follow it but it's like i wanna
i want netflix to know the shit i like
which it does some degree and then i
want to be able to just like turn it on
and i want something to already be
playing even it is head way through like
a film i've seen already yeah don't
start me new on something i haven't seen
yet right but start me in the middle of
like Oh die hard 3 is just on right now
right cuz that's something that it
should know that Jeff just loves to
watch okay you know I'm saying like
there should be the sort of like you
should because the channel surfing
psychological a gratification I get that
we all get maybe it's gone on a new
generation but they're still the legacy
of that
rustling I created that you turn that on
and like famke janssen is crushing
someone with her legs and golden yeah
the second you turn on your like sick
i'll watch the rest of it i do feel like
the the the thing that is getting lost
and it's not a huge thing but it is
getting lost for sure i think you've
articulated it very well both of you it
is the that coming in to die hard three
halfway through watching the second half
of it and just thinking like I really
have to kind of revise my definition of
what's a good movie re was wasn't bad at
all like that I'd read at all it is high
it is the second best diet ever one is
so good yeah so good um so before we
take the brake that's coming up I wanna
you know get pivot into a thing that
happened getting awkward now with your
life okay I can talk about that no I
mean it's an awkward topic so it's a
little difficult for other I think it
might be cool and I'm interested in it
but we should dive in because you'll see
it's a little bit difficult and we will
dive into that right after this break oh

so you uh had something happened to ya I
got really sick and I missed almost an
entire year of the TV show because of
this I i started i was dating a really
sexy woman for a while she was like 5-10
she used to model i did not know this is
how the story storm you're a tall guy as
well what are you 64 65 63 but with a
very small penis okay yeah okay what do
you think that's part of no I
is that what happened no what's I was
dating this woman and uh and I uh you
know I have not lived with a lot of
women I know you've been married for a
while and you're married not almost
married july uh so you guys are used to
sleeping with women but I'm not uh and
so I I would wake up every night just
completely drenched in sweat yeah I
would soak through my sheets only when
she was staying over every night every
she was there not there okay when she
was there at least a witness chair uh
but I didn't know it was wrong with me
so I went to the doctor and he said
maybe eight something spicy I said okay
and I went I went back home and I kept
sweating so the sweat was the only swing
that was it that went on for about a
year and so well I went to a walk in
clinic they sent me home i went to the i
went to the ER a couple times they sent
me home just like I really don't feel
right something's wrong what sent you to
the ER if you don't mind me uh a little
granular here I don't really remember
and you'll know what why I don't
remember a few seconds but I I kept
trying to get diagnosed know it's very
difficult to diagnose I had something we
ultimately discovered called
endocarditis which is an infection in
your heart so in one of my heart valves
there was an infection that was growing
and growing and growing and so my
sweating was my body's way of trying
phytate yeah exactly and so I had had it
for so long even though no one was able
to diagnose it that the infection grew
so large the pieces of it broke off and
went to my brain oh my god and so I had
a stroke wait so you so the stroke was
an event that happened after the
infection infection you'll did the
stroke that's right so but them so the
stroke was a specific moment I thought
we were friends how do you guys not know
that even I did I knew about the show
could you know all about the stuff I'm
talking about the chrono like right how
it was any action stroke there a thing
that happened at a moment uh what it
wasn't like this kind of I fell down and
I come collect me but it was little
pieces God what so were you in the
hospital already when you had the stroke
no I had probably been having it for a
few weeks if not longer cuz I I was in
the impression that a stroke is
like like an events having a stroke
that's one way a straight can go for
sure Kevin but this is the way mine went
care and uh so I didn't know this I went
I got checked into the hospital finally
usually the people who get endocarditis
are IV drug users I had obviously have
never done heroin or any IV drugs and so
they had a very tough time diagnosing at
one dr. guest and he was right and I
still haven't I have to find that guy
and thank him sandy guess that like did
the right test to confirm it eventually
yeah and so uh I was in the hospital and
what they did is they decided to give me
do open-heart surgery they took out the
part the valve that was had the
infection yeah and they installed a
plastic valve okay in my chest so I had
open-heart surgery that was maybe 45 at
the time and then after that I you know
I there's no way to say this without
sounding melodramatic but there was a
doctor who came to me and said listen
we're going to do the heart valve
operation he came back the next day and
said we've talked about it we're not
going to do that operation then he came
back the day after that said we are
gonna do the upper oh my jesus and i was
like i do whatever you guys are they
saying why they're like nobody I didn't
hear but I do have a friend who's a
doctor who was at some of those meetings
and she said they didn't want to do it
because they were kind of sure that you
weren't gonna make it Wow so I'm here
but you are and you your your your back
like me I I don't see a difference I
don't I'm it I'm probably a seventy-five
or eighty percent but maybe I was here a
year ago last April yeah and I came here
for Guitar Hero event right and it was
my first time back in New York and I
think about the the person I was the
Scott that I was back then and I'm
stronger now Decker I'm more myself my
energy levels back I got really tired
for a long time I went I was in the
hospital for maybe ten weeks uh no
prompt six weeks and then I was in rehab
like they have a legit Arab facility and
and I was there for another ten weeks
yeah well and like the recovery from
something like this and for sure this
isn't as dramatic a stroke as you've
probably seen right if you've seen older
people and had strokes they're all there
super screwed up but for me I have a
numbness on the left side of my body and
I'm still yeah it will probably always
be there is it a like a prickly kind of
thing or just an omniscient sale and I
don't feel anything Wow and they're not
sure if it'll ever come back I did a lot
of rehab trying to get my brain working
properly again had trouble remembering
anything in the beginning like passwords
on your computer I know we all are
overwhelmed by them but when you have a
stroke and then try to go back to your
computer I couldn't remember it sheraton
yeah so I had to redo all my passwords
everyone kept recommending these
password apps like 1password yeah all
the different ones are out there but I
kept the faith I kept doing my best i
kept trying to be optimistic yeah and
I'm just trying to enjoy my days now
globally like I feel like I see the
world through a different lens the world
that I saw before and even being back in
New York right now and for sure there
are things I can pitch about you know
the four dollar wad bottles of water and
so forth but I'm just happy to be here
I'm proud of my life but I'm proud of
the life that I made and I'm proud that
I got to be on TV for all these years
proud that I wrote all these stories
that I mostly well mostly I'm proud of
those dry but I just I feel like I've
had a great career I had great you know
great friends I'm glad that you guys are
my friends and I don't know I just kind
of wake up with that every day and that
that is this such an amazing thing to
have after that I really think it's I
don't want to say like well but the
silver lining in all this but it's but
it's like you know it to be able to like
be aware of that is something that I
think a lot of people need it's very
difficult to your sort of basically
internalizing your mortality and Jang
okay well this is literally like you
forget if you're in the day-to-day
you're doing the same stuff every day
whatever you forget you have so much
freedom and so much like you can do
really whatever you want so like both of
you who have had great job oh yeah no
great job she's gone to do a lot of
things like the fact that you get to go
to e3 and you get to go to CES and like
oh yeah easy oh yeah it's it's I mean I
think there comes a time when you kind
of realize how grateful you need to be
yeah for stuff like that and yeah and I
know
you get up and just put the plow down in
a bunch of stuff chair but you gotta
take time every day and just remember
you know like i know it we always say
yeah yeah yeah I get it when I we don't
live forever blah blah blah whatever but
we really don't write and and Russ and I
can talk like that forever but you are
in a different I went into the show's
man you you saw the other side I really
did I do feel like I've seen the other
side I I'm not a believer in the
afterlife I have no patience for
bullshit anymore none yeah no no BS yeah
and even trying to go back to being a
movie reviewer and a game reviewer with
Vic was very difficult I just couldn't
sit through some crummy movie so was it
cause you're like this doesn't matter
like what yeah exactly i'm just i don't
want anyone to waste through i started
giving out zeros all the time and Vic
was right he was ready to hang me yes
like this one you know it's but I'm like
this is how I feel like I feel like this
is an awful wretched piece of garbage I
feel bad that I had to sit through it
and God help anyone out there from
having to sit through it but that's
always I'm certainly viewed like a
service that we as a business provide is
like saving other people from misery
sorry I think a relatively noble way to
look at it but maybe before I got sick I
would have given it a three okay now it
just no pressure like that's the end of
it don't happen don't would like
seriously do something better with your
friday yeah I see you know what whatever
there's so many bad movies out there
that Everest movie I couldn't stand you
guys like which I didn't see it
everyone's Angela no I didn't see that
you both made the right choice yeah yeah
I love that Creed movie from last I
liked it I liked it I really liked it
yeah yeah is that is that your favorite
live every time yeah the thing is the
the great thing is now like I now I'm
not in the media anymore and so I I'm
just I'm a normal consumer again yeah
when I go to the movies I gotta go like
every other a hole out there and I had
to sit through all the commercials I
gotta sit through all the trailers I got
all the coming soon it goes on for like
45 minutes at the screenings they just
go right into them yeah right and so I
missed that
but I kind of like being a consumer
again yeah I'm enjoying and I like you
know a couple weeks ago I felt this
impulse to go to the store I felt
excited about it and by far cry primal
right and and I read your review which I
thought was really great thanks terrific
job appreciate that a good writer oh
really am i right now thank you look at
you but Jeff's blushing a little ring no
I appreciate uh bones a lot it just it's
fun to just behave like a consumer again
I yeah stinks especially in Canada the
games aren't sixty dollars they're
eighty dollars yeah yeah is that even
for I guess it should be for like PSN
like online digital download stuff it's
also like super all the same you know
crazy all the prices are the sofa yeah
you gotta pick and choose yeah so that's
quite the that's quite a second act has
quite a ride and you know I just feel I
feel like whatever I still want to do I
have to do it yeah I have to do it and I
did a TED talk on this in November uh
and I didn't see your Ted I didn't know
about that I do a very eager to go back
and watch and we'll link everyone in the
show notes yeah watch the UH but mostly
it was just about paring down your life
sure and the things that matter and the
things that don't and I do it in kind of
a elegant way but also a very crude way
yeah so I don't want you go ahead and
watch it I think you're able to give
everybody the full Scott Jones sort of
treatment like I think people can know
you after watching that I think so feels
very honest I think so yeah I think it I
think that's true I felt like the TED
talk I wasn't that happy with it I was
just proud of myself for doing it fair
and i met a lot of cool people right and
I mean I mean I just that's the thing is
I just want to enjoy my day like I'm
seeing you guys I'm going to see some
other friends later I'm in New York like
this morning i got up at the Ace Hotel
where I'm Way too old to be when you
guys you punched a few hipsters move
them around to understand i'm from the
west coast of Canada Ireland so I
haven't seen snow in a billion years
this morning at it I was drinking a cup
of great coffee standing in front of the
east hotel and snows falling and I just
felt happier yeah really lucky to be
here and
beautiful be coming up to see you guys
and is beautiful I want to cry I want to
cry making fun of me I'm not even jive
you as always happen I'm I'm sorry my
fault I'm having emotions your your I'm
serious you're actually like really it's
your moving it's very it's an amazing
story I have a lot of history in the
city I know you did a lot of memories my
first job was over here in the parkin
and 28 yeah hustler right no it was one
of those clothes that was it playboy I
used to work at gallery magazine oh I
don't think I know this well that's the
story for the next time I was my first
job in New York I worked there for seven
years I thought I'd never get enough I
mean I was probably in high school when
that was happening just did just in
terms of like me knowing that I used to
work with a guy for sure you've read
some of my stories okay i'm i'm i'm sure
i was raised catholic so they make the
best porn writers for sure right at whoa
now Johnny I didn't I didn't know that
really I did not know that yeah I wanted
to have a great weird cool job in New
York and I want to have a job that I
could write about afterward like I
wanted to have like a really gutsy
learned something new job and it was
kind of a nightmare started out kind of
fun but uh yeah I have a lot of history
man like I've lived a lot of life at
this point I know you have yeah and uh
you know when I first met you I forget
who introduced us I think we just had
met at an event was a jan akkerman he
was probably there I don't know if he
was like oh jen economy this guy that I
know if you did like money yes excuse
today I know it's low-hanging fruit but
it never gets old it's so it so sweet it
tastes it's the taste beautiful and yeah
and you Jeff and everyone loves to do it
I forgot and and someone had told me
like I don't know this guy I've seen
some shit oh really and I and I remember
seeing you and being like all that guys
like what I'd been in Vietnam no I would
know basically and I'm like oh that
guy's I he's too tall to be my friend
you didn't yeah my head that's the first
thing I thought I think we're judgmental
things off the bat about p
Mike he's 66 what do you think of fresh
dick oh that's a good question I think
the first time I saw Rus I was like oh
this guy's like you know someone I went
to Hebrew school with I will say this i
will say this i do remember and this was
God two thousand seven or so i just made
skidooed take my crew his nurse canada
that's how we say thank you but I
remember Jeff was very hot like
intensely pushing the podcast and having
me on the podcast oh yes with what I was
customers need a bar on right took a
couple times the same way it did with
you and I Scott it took a few time felt
like our chemistry was right there love
at first sight what if I moved back to
New York and then the three of us did
this every now stop oh boy don't tease
me with that um no yeah you should eat
regardless you should come back because
you're involved in different things now
you're you're in why are you in New York
what is the reason to be there's a
virtual reality conference called
versions that the kill screen people do
you know I did yet okay so I'm going to
go to go to that and I'm going to that
saturday and sunday so today is perfect
i'm just with you guys today and i'm
trying to find a life beyond media
mm-hmm and I think you've been
struggling with Cheryl bit back yeah
worth trying a little bit of this is
there a half or two years has been so
many tools do we have on our Swiss Army
knives and this is the time in our lives
when we figure that out like I have the
corkscrewed out of the can opener what
can can I use this and so at the end of
last year was actually halfway through
last year I started looking for new
employment opportunities i interviewed
it a couple different places i did it
interview a facebook although i signed
an NDA i can't ever tell you guys when i
saw up there was kind of amazing though
was it like was it like the wonka
factory yeah it was really kind of what
I was glad the preview emotions for you
happy get angry faces first look
that was fun and I i I've spent a lot of
time with the in the virtual reality
space yeah very good space I I feel like
it's a very cool space and the thing
that gives me hope is the fact that the
tech is still a little crude we can't do
first person shooters yeah and I think
that's a good thing and the thing that
the only reason I love video games at
all is I'm a story guy yeah that's it
that's all I care about I want stories I
like the fact that this new medium is
telling stories in a new way and I feel
like the fact that we can't go down the
most obvious road on the Virtual Reality
front yeah which is shooters here forces
everyone to slow down tell slower paced
stories and experiment more and I think
this is a good thing this makes me very
excited I've had some incredible oculus
demo you know I've done the toy box that
we all did last year and I was really
knocked out by that and and I you know
I've done the HTC vive and I've you know
put that all that stuff on I've gotten
used to wearing that thing now and I've
gotten used to having big cords coming
onto the back of my head the wire
dreadlocks like I like the color like
some of the air you are you just assume
that character yeah and so uh I learned
some of the language the lighthouse I
know what that is now I didn't know what
that was I don't know what that is but
it's five right that's the Nazi divine
the vibe has such a specific apparatus
yes like you like not every like not
only cannot everyone afford that not
only can not everyone and I don't want
to like it ours right it's 800 bucks
yeah but you need basically a room this
big like you really did but it works as
like a normal VR device no no what no it
needs this yeah so you so games that
have developed for oculus and when I say
this space I mean I mean like an
eight-by-eight never game room developed
of oculus theoretically could couldn't
just be simply ported over the vibe no I
do i do not believe it is a one to one
conversion thing like that i could be
wrong but I don't think it's like
pouring from pc to be a seems like you
could just as easily like I understand
most like the epic five experiences
which I haven't used but I've heard it's
amazing the epic private do involve an
empty room and you're like reach around
ya around but I got to imagine there's
also a seated experience as well I think
you can I don't
no I right I think the light boxing what
like their confusion is natural check
every it's the Wild West rain brown like
everything is being built but you have
no definition yet for what good VR is
where we don't know what it's gonna look
like if everybody's just throwing stuff
at a wall and they're seeing what sticks
that makes it intriguing for me I don't
know if it's gonna last I think it's
certainly gonna have a life cycle here
it's going to be around for a while
we're gonna see some things that we've
never seen before I have mixed feelings
about it sometimes has a media guy sure
like I feel weird putting all that that
you know the mechanism on my head and
I'm you know putting on the the ocular
HTC the pre the very dystopian very
strange and I don't like cutting myself
off more from the world I already do
enough of that in my personal life right
I don't want to do it with my tech life
too so the company I started working for
it's called virtually live and basically
what they're leading with although
they're hoping to turn it into other
things is they're taking live sports
event like if there was a Knicks game
not that anybody actually goes to me
right away but then we would have a
virtual version eight seconds later so
as the game is going on we would have
sensors inside Madison Square Garden
yeah be gathering the data from the
experience they would take all that data
they would transform it through the
unity gameplay okay and like stitch it
together right stitch it together so you
would actually be in Madison Square
Garden a virtual version okay and you'd
be able to go anywhere in the garden and
you know one of the selling points of
virtually live is that you can sit and
NEC you can sit and the jack nicholson
see Karen courtside if you want to eat a
little locker rooms you can I know
thanks for the education so so now can
you and and you have the ability to
switch in real time while you're in the
while you're jacked in you can move any
chat you move any we can go down on the
field if you want to although we're
still debating whether it's a court make
that well we're leading wits with soccer
oh we can go on the soccer field during
the pitch it's awesome what was amazing
to do what are the actual athletes how
are they presented
I mean it looks it looks like a FIFA
game it's like a fever game so you're
essentially they're taking the data
they're saying okay whatever Pele is
standing right here so we're gonna put
digital Pele in that position and move
them around as pals right that's right
and the technology I don't understand
all of it there's a little bit of Voodoo
around it they use some anticipatory
gameplay stuff whether this guy usually
goes this way we're going to put them
there already so there's a little
jittery and then we're still building
and a year so that's really fast it's
very cool and uh and you know I the the
the possibilities for what they could do
with this kind of tech is is very cool
and and I mean it's basically a way for
you to gather the same way that which
lets people get together for certain
occasions and so I think that's that's
going to be a part of a success yeah a
part of the story going forward right as
it's an opportunity for everyone to get
together there's a game going on right
now let's all get in there you can get
in the kanye suite upstairs you can get
a virtual bartender you can have a drink
you can watch the game or you could do
what most sports fans do and that is
they don't really watch the game they
talk to each other yeah they just
bullshit it's an opportunity for
socializing that's that is really cool
tech and and something that I haven't
really heard anyone doing with VR so
that's really neat yes yeah so we also
we have a new demo that has to do with
the racing and we're moving in lots lots
of different directions I've never been
on this side before it so it's a little
strange yeah yeah the world from the
production side from the production side
end in this brave new world that is VR
is kind of this like amazing common we
have a huge office in San Francisco yes
they're like a week and a half ago like
I love I you know it's funny because we
you were on the media island for a long
time there was tuned there's not much to
eat there it's a very small island
that's Aaron its varied and yes you go
to the other side and it's like I don't
know there's lots it just feels like
there's it's wide open there's lots of
opportunity there's lots of weird jobs
being created virtual virtual reality
doesn't know what kind of jobs it's
going to need in the future and so I
think it's an exciting time if you're a
man in his mid-40s like I am and you've
survived a life-changing of that chair
you just there are roads for you to go
down yeah it's it's it's uh you know not
to make it like this poetic sort of
thing but it's like it's this beautiful
sort of like opening a door opening
experience for you on multiple fronts
all right was like career wise yeah your
life wise i mean it's it's cool i also
feel like every man and you know I I
usually just say this off off the air
but I'll say it again I feel like every
man has a window of opportunity to make
money and that's from when he's 35 to 55
and I feel like you or woman right or
woman or woman just people in general
yeah you just gotta roll up your sleeves
and you got to go out there and I feel
like the economy is good right now
everything's strong like there's a new
opportunity there's new options there's
new tech I feel like our e3 is going to
look very different going forward like
virtual reality is going to be a huge
part of it have you guys ever tried any
of the virtual reality headset yeah yeah
I've accepted the vibe yeah Ivy Ivan use
the visor again one here next week yeah
what about the virtual boy yeah yes I
Friday yes you have it so I do not have
it I've tried I tried actually the
Museum of the moving image enhancers
virtual boy I remember hating even when
you care for terrible mess like odors
terrible i was i was at syracuse than
when it came out doing my MFA i know it
sounds like bragging but i had a
girlfriend who had moved so i was a
little heartbroken and i went to the
store and I stood there for about 20
minutes section i get this virtual boy
yeah should i just paid you good money
for this and i ended up not getting the
virtual our way Martin listen to the
jugs he's got the right make sure yeah I
feel like I had good good instincts that
day I want to take one more break we
were and then we got to talk about this
other thing you're doing sure the thing
you're writing whatever you want all
right on the other side of this don't
worry it's gonna get oh you I know what
you're doing I know you're doing it you
know what it gets weird it gets real
with no it doesn't get weird just the
futures we had it's interesting the
future is weird the weird stuffs up
ahead yeah stay tuned the 404 shows also

ya ER is just having so much fun this is
great the way it's seriously into VR do
you feel optimistic about the future um
so those are two different things vr is
a concept in VR that I've used and loved
is amazing to me absolutely crazy super
cool i have not had even the HD jump
going from SD to HD I don't think was as
dramatic and experience as this is right
now so here's ok but you gotta say the
read so the second part of your question
am i optimistic do I think it's gonna go
mainstream which is obviously what
companies like your company is hoping
for and a lot of other people I think I
think we're all a ways away I would say
yes five years away we are going
mainstream definite just the the barrier
to entry right is such a steep wall
sibel soon are yes yeah friend sibel she
always says this I have to give her
credit she said the the VR equipment
right now is kind of like that that cell
phone the Michael Douglas uses in wall
street that's actly like it's just a
weird and awkward and will still use it
because we like to make phone calls from
the beach but exactly it's stuff that's
where robes like you I you want to be a
cool guy here's the thing no one looks
cool it win vr no one that's the worst
no one looks cool wearing Google glass I
know it is the the coolness you got any
google+ at sea yes no that's like Don
there I think they I mean I don't even
think this was a product though like to
me they were saying hey we can do this
place slowly we have worked if you saw
it but it was one thing I myself will
make that yeah there was they were
selling the dream they weren't like look
you might not want to wear this dream in
public right but you know they were they
were like look we got we made a thousand
of them why not yeah let's get them out
of storage um the thing with VR is that
it is not a product in the sense that
like yes there's oculus there's five
there's PlayStation VR coming out later
this year it is a platform it is a
universe it is a is it a new dimension
and that to me and I don't want to like
oversell this but like the way we
transferred into understanding the
internet which we're still sort of doing
that is what VR will be in my opinion
for someone like my son who is not even
a year he will probably be way more
ingrained in in the way I grew up with
the internet perhaps he will grow grow
up with VR yeah yeah it's still all
shaken out the big endorsement is really
the mark zuckerberg endorsement yeah the
fact right invested everything like
we're going osky oculus you know he
doesn't do anything half-assed right and
that makes me feel so much more hopeful
about the future of virtual reality I
feel like it's going to be around for a
while and I didn't irritate us it'll
probably irritate us a lot it's already
irritated me yeah it's so you're I mean
and everyone want you know you guys know
this at Cena you have to make you have
to make stories every day and you look
everywhere and you shake the tree see
what kind of proof drops off but there's
not always new stories there's not
always things to write about so we're
weren't you know everyone's just combing
over the same area people always want to
bang it though they always want to what
do you mean like a man likes the like
with a lady when they get together and
then a baby comes out I don't know why
this is like the evolutionary way of
things yes it always starts with sex but
a people I was right but can I have sex
with it just like yeah yeah it's a
person yeah
just how things work you can bang this
thing you can be doing in the Garden of
Eden there was two people one was Adam
and one was even and then they went to
dinner yeah they went to a candlelight
man one little italy and they went to a
hedonism resort uh uh yeah it's gonna
start with sex for sure and uh you know
I was working on a story for Esquire
calm about the sexual revolution that
virtual reality is going to ostensibly
present to us and with any one of these
technologies the first you know the
first vice to the doors always always
let's look at busa through it yeah let
maybe boobs look great in three
dimensions and of course I started
making some phone calls one day I called
this this porn company that you may have
heard of vivid and I you know because of
my history working over here on a
gallery I knew some of the porn people I
don't know them anymore but you know
it's the first time I called a porn
company in almost 20 years and I just
got the sleazy voicemail like no matter
what no matter who you're calling and it
you know it's the perspective my
perspective on it just this is vivid
voice man I liked not even number / s 1
it's just everything just feels so
better look at Atlanta and so I was
working on this story for Esquire and
then my friend who had hired me to do
this story moved over to a different
publication but in the interim in the
meanwhile Ben Silverman my friend at
Yahoo he said he was interested in the
story and would like to see it so I'm
still writing this story about how the
virtual reality porn will shake out and
again it's going to take it's going to
take a little bit of time and there's
going to be some really crude stuff in
the beginning and it's some of its going
to work and some of its not going to
work but I don't know I feel like it's
an interesting place to have a
conversation killer it is have you try
to hold that thought Ross have you tried
it out have you tried out like like I
said at CES we had the naughty america
company and what do you think of the
night I didn't do it well don't lie to
me no I didn't I didn't
oh you're such a good man I would love
to have tried so they they are like show
my hand there listen I would love to
secrecy I I want to see that I you know
I think of like Minority Report yeah in
that scene were like Tom Cruise runs
through like that arcade Sherrick the
the VR arcade and everyone's like in
their own pod doing the right thing for
like demolition man right of course like
strange days writing like we all have
these sci-fi fantasies of things we saw
when we were younger yes and now it's
like oh my god that stuff is way closer
than I ever thought it we would be with
any of that like the thing we don't
really realize you know like something
3d TV is done yeah everybody's given up
on that's the end of it but porn was
really all over that they were like
first ones through they would like we
got it all we got it all mapped out in
here and then nobody else went that way
only porn went that way porn is always
first because there's so much money to
be made if someone pulls this off it
does it right it's like boot it's booze
right it's it's it's never gonna go away
the American there's always gonna be a
market for porn and booze what were you
about to mention I was gonna say I was
going to talk about logistics mm-hmm so
when someone's watching porn generally
they have other activities that they're
doing while they're watching porn what
yeah their taxes their taxes so you're
if you're wearing know is that none are
you what are you doing with you I got
like the old-timey calculator and that
green visor now let's see well I could
do 8300 dollars in deductions and you
dan ackerman voice again it's not
intentional I want to say you understand
you're wearing a VR helmet there is a
logistical issue with this equation you
can see your penis among other things
you can't if you're the mass if you're
masturbating right with VR right a man a
woman it doesn't matter you can't see
you know I'm saying you can't wait
naughty bit you don't know where things
are going they get all the keep like who
looks at why are you looking at it like
I don't want to see it I don't know
nothing you just punch it I don't I
don't know if I want to see it the whole
time
but I want to see it eventually yeah
well there's there's like a you know a
concern finale maybe it's just unlike
persnickety about cleanliness I want to
make sure I know where things are going
you may need to bring that up with your
analysts but uh I have a friend you guys
know I'm not gonna say his name but he's
been caught uh while enjoying himself oh
my are not to be are no I don't know who
this person is you know it's I'll tell
you later yeah but he's been caught a
couple times you know but he's gotten
that that sort of talk builder and just
like I Ely into it by his wife okay okay
and so he told me about these taps and
yeah I was laughs hysterically avoids me
like here's another reason why not to
get married the reason why to live alone
is better but with porn uh it's very
dangerous and I I hear what you're
saying for sure I mean you're very
exposed and you're very vulnerable and
for sure I'm sure I'm sure thousands of
people who are you know they've been
caught already for sure and there's just
gonna be millions going forward yeah you
know just like somebody's wife is gonna
come home and the goggles are gonna be
on and you're just like oh well the
funny thing is like I mean that's only
part of it though like why are you
worried about about the mess why she
don't care you take it off yeah I guess
it's all over your computer I guess
that's why were you and why you ain't
get to you compare and why not so pushy
or elsewhere my point is I don't know
where the computer isn't worried a
helmet so funny though like not only
will you be walked in on but like you
can walk theoretically right in the face
of the person won't know where they are
now that's just magic that's a nice
story I don't know how far your she but
but I'm saying like I'm saying uh you
know you want you will walk in on this
person and they won't even know you're
in the room and you're just be like well
I'm gonna sit here and this is well
let's it works out let's do this you
know and you can
you can reach in and they could think
it's like a really immersive experience
is great for sure it's gonna be scary
but the you know what you're gonna get
on the far side of that is amazing I
mean what you're gonna see with with me
whether it's the oculus or the HTC vive
you know you're gonna see amazing things
yes they're building them right now
they're experimenting it's not just the
360 camera they're trying everything
right now buddy's gonna figure it out of
course and they're gonna make so much
money and and yeah let's get in on that
is what you're saying 369 camera yeah
the Nexus the 369 haha nice that's an
impossible degree but that's it I feel
like you guys have some running jokes
which is now see you're running joke
that we don't agree your both laughing
it resisted uh yeah it's crazy it's a
brave new world and I and I'm a little
you know to get serious risen I am a
immediately I feel threatened by it for
some reason I'd my natural knee-jerk
reaction to VR is like I don't like it
and I and I and it's not like an age
thing on ackerman again I don't like it
I think you just hear that no matter
what I thought um I you know I I want to
embrace it and I and as a just a born
fighter the whole thing everything of
the whole ball of your I just feel like
this is I Phi sweat in it i I uh it's
it's gone comfortable we know Victor
Lucas won't even put the goggles on he's
afraid of what I'll do to his hair yeah
well that's a whole nother so we're nice
hair he doesn't nice here but like dude
get over I know not to mention like the
15 years now VR will just be like
putting on glasses you know for sure
you're like putting on I whenever I do a
demo I always make some joke about pink
eye yeah yeah like that's a thing like
where are the bowling shoe spray
equivalent like where's back cuz that's
a problem especially like at e3 this
year I threw me out of you that shit
your house it's not it's fine fine but
but at e3 when you're like number 83 for
the day sloppy 83rd yeah like those
goggles have been
on hundreds of other faces that day and
they just they have a little boy like
white oh yeah Diana McClay not so good
now you put it on who's next wear this
at some point pink I just gotta run
rampant through one of these conventions
maybe a GDC maybe at e3 like we don't
know right that'll make national
headlines are you guys going easier lgd
c and e are not doing nice easy for me
to tears yeah yeah um yeah there's gonna
be a lot of stuff there mm-hmm uh III
i'll be out i might go to pax east also
wears on boston in a month and a half
okay i miss the circuit a little bit it
misses you yeah and but i don't
recognize anybody you guys are the only
familiar faces that i see no band
there's like a handful of people laugh
but everybody else has gone on the other
thing it's pretty much that crew that
was together for the for the e3 sony
press conference just like carved out a
nice that's right and we've just born
watching we kind of were just doing our
own we always set up top yeah just up in
the tier that's just here yeah it's a
great place to sit well it's a it's a
great feeling having here man that's
great to be here thanks for listening to
my stories it was are moving i'm sure
everyone who heard this was touched by
it it's a great story like strokes are a
huge thing man yeah a bigger thing going
forward more and more people gets have
strokes all the time they're younger and
younger ages and so I you know I know
I'm naka i'm not alone now and i'm gonna
be less alone as the longer I live yeah
that sounds like a threat no it sounds
like it I want you to take care of
yourself and I where takers yeah yeah if
knowing what you know now what what what
could you have done get checked out
earlier no there's nothing ever you were
your situation is very very rare just
beyond you know it's like a medical book
honey yeah yeah I'll just episode it is
kind of like what's wrong with this guy
that is a new not a bad analogy I'm not
trying to trivialize your spend some
good jokes today guys I think we did
okay yeah and the 369 I'll remember that
yeah you can tell you can make that work
for your story okay yeah okay all right
I want to use that one yeah that's good
what do you what do you want me to give
me one question for for the porn star
interview the next porn star I interview
for destroyed okay I've got it good
isn't she concerned that this
essentially is gonna make her obsolete
no I think if I I can answer that
already he played that's I think it
makes you more relevant than ever
because people want the real thing and
they they do and I think it open up you
know you talk about like the one on one
stuff that people pay for will now
forget it you can do a VR one-on-one
