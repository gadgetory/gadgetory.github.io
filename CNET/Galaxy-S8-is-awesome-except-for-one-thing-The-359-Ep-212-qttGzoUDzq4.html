screwing up the audio feed nothing we're
back hey get that part out I'll charm it
out later okay drop it out later let's
protect the live show boo cuz thanks for
your patience start over related it's
Tuesday it is it's April 18 good morning
everyone hahaha second time around 00 to
you clearly thank you we all for
continuing to come to this podcast for
reasons you don't even the site that
many many errors okay and prompt that we
I was so proud that we had a bit of a
snag on episode 200 cuz you were like
it's episode 200 oh crap we lost audio
for four minutes we salvaged it hey all
right so anyways we're gonna be talking
about the galaxy s 8 review as well as a
couple iphone rumors that popped up the
last day just nervous you know just
another day another samsung yeah yeah
let's make it happen so let's do it as
always if you have any questions leave
in the comments section Brian will get
to the get to them I'll try not to screw
up trying to screw him up we will answer
them in three minutes to 59 seconds and
here we go for the recording in 32
welcome to the 359 when we talk about
the top tech news of the day and all the
other craft course yes this is really
going swimmingly today isn't it all
right let me try that again three two
one go welcome to the 359 when we talk
about the top tech news of the day and
all the other crap we want to throw in
I'm Roger Cheng I'm Ben Fox ribbon the
reviews are in and experts are loving
the samsung galaxy s 8 our own Jessica
Delcourt calls it the most beautiful
polish phone she's ever held it's fast
it boasts a gorgeous screen and has
external memory but there are some
drawbacks the fingerprint sensor is
awkwardly placed right next to the
camera lens so get ready for smudge City
and the big speed digital assistant is a
no-show at launch so that that but the
side bun on the phone will at least not
much won't do anything yeah so so you
can keep pressing it all you one it'll
do something eventually eventually in a
couple days maybe ah Ben what do you
think is this enough to get you to
switch from an iphone to a android
thought so but frankly the fingerprint
sensor situation I feel like even
Samsung will admit that they shoehorned
it in at the last minute when they
realized that they couldn't put the
fingerprint sensor underneath the screen
itself yep so it sits at a very weird
place Jessica mentions in her review
that the Google pixel and I think the LG
G six yep they put them lower down yet
below the camera which makes it a lot
easier and not just that if you're not
looking at it yeah being the center of
the phone as opposed to high up movers
it's a more natural position when you're
holding the phone you don't your finger
doesn't really naturally reach up you
know where the camera guys so having you
the center feel like the pixel and it's
shaped like a tic tac it just it seems
awkward I do realize that there are like
three other ways to unlock the phone
right the pin there's the iris scan and
this facial recognition so I do think
that people are probably going to find
different ways of like what's what's the
best way for them to do an easy night
Chancellor Samsung definitely talks
about the face scanners as a good
alternative but as Jessica no to the
review you know it's more of a it's a
less secure option so if you're really
looking to kind of protect your phone
that's not the best option ok so we have
been talking about the fingerprint
sensor which is this obvious negative
but you did cram in a bunch of big
positives about this phone oh yeah
visually stunning jessica says high
resolution screen great battery life
super fast great for photos I mean
there's a lot to like about this phone
absolutely ups the ante for Apple later
this year I mean this definitely does a
good job of a wiping away the memory of
the note 7 at this moment this is a salt
own I mean assuming everything goes well
with this launch it that there aren't
only hiccups with the essay I mean this
is a pretty solid phone yeah the other
thing that I do like about what Jessica
said was that look bixby isn't really
baked quite yet it's it's not the best
it's it's not really quite there yet but
it's an ambitious idea and the hope is
is that it's going to get there and
she's willing to wait for it which I
think makes a lot of sense absolutely
next up Bloomberg is report that really
sums up a lot of iphone rooms are out
there but one of the more interesting
revelations is the the number of
prototypes that they experiment with in
terms of the the curve
right the idea that they initially
wanted more dramatic curve and now they
want now they're settling on a more
moderate one largely because of
suppliers issues with that um what do
you think that change things yeah that's
not I mean like if you're gonna have
like a slight curve or a more dramatic
curve right I don't really see that
changing much there a lot of the reports
that are out there I think we were just
talking about the fingerprint sensor
yeah the issue that Apple is also having
some problems getting the fingerprint
sensor to go under the cover glass maybe
it's not coming this year maybe we're
not quite a very end up getting a
fingerprint sensor the back just like
it's possible those are what the rumors
are which is kind of a bummer you know
these are these really beautiful bezel
lyst screen and you know well call a
sensor in the back Apple if you are
gonna put your fingerprint sensor in the
back please place it closer to the
center of the phone sure right for more
of these stories check us out on cnet
I'm Roger Cheng I'm Ben Fox Rubin thanks
for listening all right the chat is fire
today absolute fire all right I love the
idea is that we're getting pitched for
alternatives to the fingerprint scanner
so let's the first and foremost the
fingerprint scanner is not a huge deal
no no no it's kind of annoying that not
it's a huge it's a little bit and it's
very gonna be very quickly fixed I'm
sure that this is gonna be the one thing
as soon as like the s9 rolls around
alike and well what you say quickly fix
them for the person buying the essay
like they're stuck with that thing for
like two years that's not gonna change
their mind it's not and if you're right
though you're right though it's more of
an annoyance it's something that people
will probably find a workaround for and
I don't think here I agree with I think
it was a bit of a last-minute kind of
thing yeah it's better to have it than
to not because they're probably putting
all their eggs in one basket with a
retina scanner know yet so the thing of
it is a tobacco day they talked about
this with the note 7 with the when they
first introduced that Irish scanner like
they said it wasn't really great for
unlocking because it's it's a little
unnatural because it takes a split
second longer it's sort of you gotta put
your phone up to your face you know look
at it yeah it's not it's not as fast as
the fish scanner as the facial
recognition scanner or the fingerprint
sensor was a princess or so yet I think
it's probably just felt that they needed
an alternative you know I fact that it's
all your people will just
use the pen you know like and a lot of
people will just default to doing 11 11
11 I'm not just horrible decision
Android not give them options right
although that is such a samsung way like
we're encrypting this phone like five
diff you have five different ways to do
one thing which has really been the
samsung way for software right like in
terms of like taking a photo or like
pulling up menus back in the day used to
be like will give you three or four
options we won't give you any clear
directions on how use any of them but
here the options try them customers love
option I would just say that I think
it's more dramatic that this fingerprint
sensor is so annoying because I'm the
rest of the phone is like it's kind of
awesome like this is like photo the best
looking phone that jessica has ever seen
easily I looked at it it's remarkable in
the krann is such a large created with
small body so the Hat is like little
annoying thing it's like it's almost
like there's no but it's kind of like
this weird tarnish my masterpiece right
like it kind of like bugs you because
it's like oh it's like a booger on the
Mona Lisa that's poetic right there but
yeah that's that's called the idea right
like I'll bet it's perfect except this
like a fly in your ice cream sundae
there you go like rain on your wedding
day we just keep all right let we lost
our yes jumping into the chat yeah
joshua lee grot said Lee got sorry I
says the fingerprint scanner is great
for lefties that's an interesting
thought that's a good point Jessica
tried that and she said she still
couldn't get it but here maybe it works
well I think you have large hands and I
don't want making more large hands jokes
from there but it might work better for
you like I can imagine though for me I'm
gonna like stretch my finger up a little
to like say under so I left hand or
right hand yeah I kind of get that point
like it I guess is a little bit more
natural but you still have to stretch
your finger a little it's like it's also
so that's why we'll Serrano suggest just
use your middle finger oh oh that could
we heard act good that's a possibility I
don't know if you're holding your feel
like this your middle finger just
flipping off I really bunch of middle
finger like it taking a selfie you
middle of it looks out not up though
that's the problem that's over the phone
you can't let me ensure you flick off
samsung every time you do I just like
the innovators are here today ya know i
like that i like the ideas he throw
around
izzard like people will figure out some
of these things and yeah maybe the
middle finger it's a great way to do it
now expanding on that Pedro says we need
some different types of unlocking
features besides fingerprint scanner
besides iris besides scotland by the
cars drop of blood truck drop of blood
i'm not suggesting a spade roads drop of
Laki of yourself every time you want to
access facebook basically i thought you
could argue you already do that's true
right physically though physically it
just cuts I said I've got a lock my
phone let me just prick my finger here
Brent Brent Hugh says tongue print right
I love it yeah in the middle of the
phone now got make it up I thought of
just unlocking it keys hold on a second
I gotta I'm gonna take us I love our
listeners love that I really really good
idea I would love to see Johnny I've
like do a video about like the thumb or
the tongue scanner be like this is the
most impressive tongues ganna you've
ever seen a tabella video is good you
don't drink orange juice before get like
your phone hey maybe we should keep this
in the back of our heads for next year's
April Fool's episode we'll come up with
the the new pitch for the alternative
unlocking for ya we're gonna steal all
of this guy's thanks really good oh
yeah at the same time let's talk let's
get serious for a second um Mike Shaw
says the thing its print scanner is
stupid the placement is stupid i'll be
using the retina scanner i'd be curious
to see how many people would prefer
fingerprint vs retin and what your
reasoning would be going facial shatter
because the facial scanner is or facial
standard method and come back or whole
to pin if you can color I legalized
phone a lot cuz I'm an idiot Bram well
yeah that's terrible just calling out to
the chat um no no I would yeah I would
love to get comments like yeah and again
like set him to our twitter account like
just how else would you use it if you
start using these different methods
which works for you which were few best
yeah absolutely um sidelining over the
Bigsby max l asks is it possible to map
the big speed button nope we have
confirmed this the big sweet buns is
just the big speed button you will
not be able to customize it and other
people were suspect possible thought it
was possible nope it basically when it
comes when you pull it out of the box on
day one it is an inoperable bun you just
sort of push it nothing happens so they
really want to save that real estate for
the big four big speed the fear is if
Yuri map it to something else a camera
or an app or Google assistant Google
assistant which is also on the own but
you will never animus Lee be favored by
the chat over big spaeth which you can
access which makes sense but transcends
google says everything use time yeah I
go girl assistant has been out in the
market I had a track record it has a
predecessor with what was a google now
or whatever you want to call it or ok
Google so oh sorry if anybody had a bat
home I just I apologize for doing that
what's a wop nevermind what's so watch
Danny par good our good friend danny
green the red screen issue how do we fix
that yeah what does it deal with that I
kind of saw that no last night I saw the
headlines for i'm not sure what the
fixes or what what that issues its look
they don't they have a huge justement in
there so you can drift it to blue but
you're essentially forcing it into that
it that this is a new one to me I don't
even know if anyone's got any other
input on this yeah give us the details I
saw the headline but I did really we
obviously don't have a samsung I in this
office I'm gonna provide a very small
bit of perspective on that in that if
that's what people are complaining about
with the essay then congratulations the
samsung because that is such a less what
the major issue yeah compared to your
phones exploded yeah yeah oh yeah you
know like people having to go to record
though the phones aren't out yet so we
don't really know till people start
using them whether or not there are any
issues there and there i don't i don't
think there are a few trials floating
around Alex in the chat says he's got a
trial version um oh cool we'd love to
get your first impressions of it yeah
since us in this room we haven't we
haven't held one yet outside of going to
the events Ryan reversing hell the pre
production version right have a final
one I think jessica has one out in SF
right there's one floating around here
mysteriously but I don't know where it
is really honest that Scotch probably
got it hidden yes cuz that's how Scott
rolls yeah right ah another one from
hold on digging through the chat we got
a the chat is lighting up and trying to
get to everybody and thank you everyone
for being so active today this is
excellent uh svet asks do you think
Samsung is saving their duo camera setup
and screen fingerprint reader for the
note 8 in order to distinguish it as a
top-of-the-line flagship device that is
a very very good and now I think that's
a good theory is a great idea the dual
camera yes I don't know but the
fingerprint sensor I still think the
fingerprint sensor may prove too
difficult it's like apples having issues
with it now that bonus their phone
doesn't launch until October the note 7
comes out even earlier than that so I'm
i'll be really impressive Samsung was
able to pull off that fingerprint sensor
under the glass with a mass market
donate yeah yeah if it happens that's I
mean kudos of em and if they're able to
pull off an apple is it that's a huge
win for them mm-hmm Joshua says he did
not have the red screen issue um I'm
thinking Jessica must not have either
else we know her though that spades yeah
I i I've seen how these things end up
happening is if enough folks start
complaining about it online that it
really does start to turn into like a
major issue so right well like like ben
ben de gate which apple i think
completely quashed as like this isn't
really a thing right and they had to
answer to it for like a week or two so
it's possible same people just wasn't
any gate that was a litigate was legit
and coptic jokes for many many years mmm
a what points out that when you put on a
new rom then you'll be able to map the
big speed button will of course yes you
crack and hack anything you can do yes
yes but it will be bringing my essay to
yeah look let's face it people who do
that i mean it's a fairly small minority
of folks who could crack the rom like
that i mean most people just want to buy
their phone they expect their phone to
work the way they wanted so too for
someone to go through the extra hoop of
hacking their phone to make the button
workable I mean that's there are no it's
not a great mainstream solution out the
box not possible though no not possible
um boy wow you guys are really lighting
up the chat today this is really fun
awesome yeah hang on Danny Green had
another good one and I'm
in four cuz I lost track of him our boy
a good solid friend here good guy Danny
Green I we didn't get to this in the
podcast by the way but it is mentioned
in like a lot of the rumor stories about
OLED yeah becoming too what is it like
the top of the line or the premium where
is not idea was not a new rumor that's
been out for a while right the fact that
they were gonna adopt OLED which is
already what Samsung has had yeah here I
figured since we're talking so much
about Samsung like any of the Samsung
friends that are watching this I'm gonna
you know this is your opportunity to
take a crap on Apple because this is
another one of those situations where
Samsung has had OLED on their phones for
years and years and it well also it
helps that Samsung manufactures those
displays right now providing them to
apple right Apple have to source them
and so and they've been really resistant
to ola which has always been kind of
disappointment to because Oh what does
look fabulous yeah like the I mean
looking at the screen on the essay the
visuals really pop the colors pop like
just the the contrast it's it's a
gorgeous screen look at ya all right we
got one from Danny yeah he's asking how
accurate you think the retina scanner
really will be and I think it's kind of
a good segue into security because
you've also had a few people time back
in and say I don't lock my phone I don't
have anything to hide well that's it all
attached any kind of e-commerce you're
asking for trouble yeah if he's got any
saved passwords on anything counts to
use on eBay or Amazon or whatever that's
I mean we're not worried about your
needs yes so someone in question
basically somebody turn on your phone go
to Amazon just start buying a whole
bunch of stuff and yeah and send you
there and you could just you know you
could you could basically kill that by
having a simple password I mean if
you're logged into your Google Play
Store write anything like that you could
potentially be royally screw to somebody
what's off with that yep it's all too
easy I think that lock it down with a
lot of these biometric scanners or
biometric yeah scanners the hope is is
to get people that don't use pins that
don't use fingerprint sensor or whatever
right to to use them because they're so
convenient make it so dead simple that
you you are going to be more likely to
lock lock your phone because as we said
there are all these problems with not
locking your phone oh and also would say
that the placement of fingerprint sensor
is
awkward because you guys haven't had a
chance to really look at it but it's
it's a really tall phone it's it's
because the screen is so big they remove
the bezels and all that but it is a
really the first impression you guys
like wow this thing is super tall and
narrow and so that that kind of adds to
the issue if you've got smaller hands
and you're trying to like stretch your
way up to top of the phone to hit the
fingerprint sensor yeah so you're saying
Donald Trump will be staying with the
iphone trying to avoid that reference oh
not getting political not small hands
joke is funny I don't care what that's
true inside a liberal as a fellow small
hander I'm sympathetic to his cause
let's uh maybe do one quick touch on
iphone yeah real quick before we leave
just because we got a minute left and we
all know the galaxy SI it's going to be
awesome let's speculate about somebody
there's a discussion about whether
they're going to rebrand it Michael
Brown of all people are boy yeah do you
think the new iphone is just going to be
like rebranded as an apple phone that's
a really great question they've been
like a goat it when we talk to Apple we
talk about Apple we don't talk about
like the great new features are talking
about how am I gonna try to hipster fly
it yeah yeah let me look they've got
Apple music they really slapped on Apple
Apple watch right like yeah but the
iphone is it's like a dream Lee well
known yeah yeah it's possible with like
their premium to your phone they might
just name it Apple phone just to really
distinguish it yeah was it the apple
watch edition will be iphone edition or
something the Apple phone iPhone edition
what was no bows what was the really
expensive Apple watch it wasn't it just
apple watch edition was like the super
expensive like like the 13 yeah twelve
thousand dollar yeah yeah I don't
remember but I that sounds right me what
it was like yeah I feel like they're
gonna do something like that with that
that really nice anniversary edition mmm
iphone yeah the one that didn't like
rumors say won't come out with for a
mother to after the iphone 7s yeah
that's plus i like the idea of calling
it the iphone x but at the same time if
all it's going to do is provide the same
stuff that the essay provides and you
know
yes eights out on the market already
yeah but it like does a slightly better
job with a fingerprint sensor then you
know they'll keep they'll keep their
current customers but it's maybe maybe
it's not going to be as big of a
splashes we were hoping yeah well they
haven't been in a while yeah but the
thing of it is with Apple is like even
if they just get existing base to like
roll over and upgrade mm-hmm that's a
lot phones I know that is a lot of
phones being sold right there you think
we'll see a letter for K on Apple um no
people 4k OLED we will see on one
version of the iphone but 4k i don't
know i think only sony and a handful of
other guys do that it's talking about
like a 4k screen yeah 4k displays yeah
cuz I think they already do 4k video
yeah right sure that I'm yeah yeah did
the side remake sony xperia phones do 4k
displays and like they look nice but
they're not that the screens will smoke
you can't lose tell ya yeah I don't get
that one either when it justice it's
bragging rights it is it's got 4k my
course it's impressive yeah how valuable
is it could we have put that energy
elsewhere right but not given the lack
of 4k content that's out there you
you're not even getting you know that
you're not maximizing that screen of the
way coming like a freight train little
ahead of the curve here yeah yeah an
apple generally doesn't really try to go
ahead of the curve right they like to
refine existing technologies so they're
dead simple for people to use yeah yeah
I think they come out with a like an
echo excuse me an echo speaker also in
September there was a rumor about that
like what was I like a year and a half
ago yeah yeah well I'm yet I imagine
it's something they're working on but
who knows if it should come out mmm
neither than many projects I think we're
definitely gonna see some kind of like
reboot rebranding like a the iphone one
or the iphone cero or maybe just the
iphone that's following maybe reboot
trend is that without magic right yeah
now they're just called ya pad Wow I'm
not know yeah well that know if you I'd
atha your sore hurt here check us out on
cnet our podcast is also available on
itunes tune in stitcher SoundCloud
feedburner and google play music we'll
see you tomorrow later everybody
