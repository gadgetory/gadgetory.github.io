well-made device performance that pretty
much obliterates any mobile product for
it but like most new game system
launches there's currently a lack of
available games worth your time if you
took an Xbox 360 controller and slapped
a 5 inch 720p screen on top of it
shield is pretty much what you'd have
she'll cost $300 for 16 gigabytes of
storage on the back is a micro SD card
slot mini HDMI micro USB headphone jack
as well as triggers and shoulder buttons
on the front our dual analog sticks a
d-pad four face buttons two very
powerful speakers as well as home back
volume and start buttons the NVIDIA
button takes you to the shield interface
hub shield felt a bit heavy to hold
initially but after a while I got used
to its weight and that feels pretty
natural as controllers go I'd say of the
ones I've tried it's second only to the
Xbox 360 controller in comfort the
screen folds down when not in use and
can fold back 180 degrees the ideal
position for playing touch only games
like Angry Birds which space games like
Nova 3 are a lot more difficult to
control and the ability to fold the
screen back in full 360 degrees like a
little bow tablet but made playing such
games as well as typing a lot easier if
you have a PC with a GeForce 600 series
or later and a fast enough router you
can stream full PC games on shield a
streaming service is only in beta it
locks so it's still sometimes requires
that you access your PC directly to get
some games working even then not all
games are fully compatible even if they
include native controller support
thankfully most of the games I try work
pretty well
provided I stayed pretty close to the
router and didn't have too many walls
between shield and it it's a promising
feature but in its current form it
requires a true within Wi-Fi range of
your PC it won't work if you're in a
hotel or on a plane and really right now
only benefits hardcore gamers who want
to play their high-end games in every
room of their home
without buying several pcs shield is
compatible with all Google Play apps but
only about 100 games at launch work with
its physical controls and only a handful
of those are worth your time or money
despite their relatively low prices
however there are a few gems like
Riptide gp2 and core t2 that seem to
take advantage of both Shields controls
and horsepower non-game apps like
Netflix and Hulu Plus work with no
problems Android games performance on
shield is really second to none and
games like Riptide gp2 and the beta
version of dead trigger 2 look
incredible for mobile games feature lots
of effects while running at high frame
rates there just needs to be more of
them typing through the interface was
always smooth and quick and Wi-Fi
performance was fast and in most cases
consistent shield is also compatible
with the parrot ar.drone
app which allowed me to have experiences
like this shield is a high quality
device with stellar performance and
while most of what it currently offers
will first and foremost appeal to
hardcore gamers I'm looking forward to
more compatible games to see release
casual gamers should be satisfied by the
cheaper Nexus 7 however hardcore gamers
will appreciate shield superior
performance and tactile controls as long
as they're willing to wait for more
games that take advantage of them for
more information check out my full
review at cnet.com I'm Eric Franklin and
this has been a first look at the Nvidia
shield
