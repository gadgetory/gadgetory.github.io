elements that we're playing with and
evolving and each of these is intended
to help all of us developers build more
expressive engaging experiences so let's
take a look at each and get a sense for
how the canvas evolves light light has a
way of drawing our attention it's warm
and inviting fluid and purposeful we use
it to create an atmosphere and a sense
of place and we need it to practically
guide us to illuminate information now
lights been used by game designers and
photographers for years and with fluent
it'll be an intuitive way for us as
developers to draw focus to the right
thing at the right time
depth imagine the depth of the real
world transforming your flat designs
think about the typical frame that
contains the information you present now
break it apart and reconstruct how those
things relate to each other in a more
layered physical environment with better
use of depth we can redefine how people
stay focused and organized motion motion
design has a special power to bring all
of our experiences to life and I want
you to think of this like a director
who's making a movie where the
transitions keep the watcher focused on
the story on what the artist wants you
to see we can bring more of that quality
to our designs to lead people from one
task to another with a cinematic ease
making even subtle actions feel alive
material the things that surround us in
the real world are sensory and
invigorating they Bend stretch they
bounce like these acrylic cubes they
shatter we want to bring more of that
character to our designs in the right
ways with a physical quality inviting
people to touch and interact scale we've
been designing our experiences in 2d for
years and years but it's time to move
beyond mere rectangles confined to a
plane the constrained designs of
yesterday are giving way to tomorrow's
gentle whirls and we're going to use
scale to deliver benefits and
experiences that once were impossible</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
