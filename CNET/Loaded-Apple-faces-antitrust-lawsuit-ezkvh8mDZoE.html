Carey on cnet.com and it's time to get
loaded Apple has had its share of legal
battles but this would be a first The
Wall Street Journal is reporting that
the United States is planning to sue
Apple and five book publishers which are
accused of colluding to increase prices
of e-books for now several the parties
are talking with regulators to ward off
an expensive court battle it all comes
down to how publishers charge for
e-books in the printed world bookstores
buy a whole bunch of tiles at wholesale
and the stores are the ones that set the
final price whether that's the price
marked in the book jacket or lower in
Apple's bookstore a publisher chooses
whatever ebook price they want and Apple
keeps 30% of the sale the Justice
Department says Apple and publishers are
working together to raise prices across
the industry because of that model but
publishers have denied the claims
meanwhile Apple is preparing for the new
iPad to hit stores next week on March
16th
the new iPad will be the first Apple
product that can tap into faster 4G LTE
wireless connection speeds although most
consumers just end up buying the cheaper
Wi-Fi only version the 4G models on AT&amp;amp;T
and Verizon start at 629 dollars but the
data plans are different for each
carrier AT&amp;amp;T data plans start at $15 a
month to use 250 megabytes on Verizon
the pricey starts at $20 a month for one
geek of data users can cancel and start
up a data plan on the iPad at any time
but on Verizon there's a $35 activation
fee so starting and stopping on Verizon
comes with an extra cost apple also
released an update to the iOS operating
system and it's causing some iPhone
users to do a double-take those with an
AT&amp;amp;T iPhone 4s are seeing a 4G icon next
to the signal strength meter but as you
know the iPhone can only get 3G not 4G
it's not exactly an error the 4G icon
shows up when the iPhone is connecting
to a Titi's HSDPA network which is tech
jargon for 3g network with a little more
power
the thing is phone companies like 18t
like to put the 4G label on advanced 3G
for the sake of marketing so sorry folks
that software upgrade did not just make
your iPhone a 4G phone
a massive solar storm has hit earth and
could disrupt communications GPS power
grids and airline flights over the next
two days a burst of charged particles
from the sun's atmosphere has hit Earth
and it's the largest storm in five years
northern areas are the most affected
it appears that amazon is taking steps
to create original programming for its
video offerings and this all started
because an Amazon executive wrote on his
LinkedIn page that he's the vice
president of original television at
Amazon hmm very interesting Amazon has a
confirmed but it's not surprising
Netflix and Hulu both are now creating
their own original content those are
your headlines for today I'm Bridget
