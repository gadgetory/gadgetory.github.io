cybershot DSC RX 102 is a fast performer
equipped with a relatively large sensor
a bright fast lens and it's all wrapped
in a small sleek body in addition to a
new sensor that delivers even better
photo quality the rx100 2 improves on
the rx100 with a hotshoe Wi-Fi
connectivity and a tilting LCD Sony
hasn't changed the fundamental design of
the camera so my big complaint about the
lack of a grip stands combined with the
slippery metal body I'm constantly in
fear of dropping it sony now offers a
$15 plastic piece that you can affixed
to the camera but that's kind of a
chintzy solution as with other cameras
that have one I like the control ring
which you can program to operate for one
default settings such as zoom or shutter
speed and to use in conjunction with the
function button in order to program and
access up to seven more settings plus
there are plenty of other customization
options and you can tilt the flash for
better results which is one of my
favorite features given its size the
addition of a tilting LCD and hotshoe
are pretty impressive the addition of
NFC makes connecting the phone to your
mobile device a lot less annoying than
with most Wi-Fi camera connections
provided your device has NFC that leaves
out Apple folks but they can still use
the clunky manual process to connect
it's still not the most streamlined
operation for instance you have to
invoke the connection differently if you
want to transfer photos that you
initiate from the playback menu in the
camera then if you want to remotely
control the camera in which case you
initiate from the PlayMemories mobile
app on the phone on the flip side there
are too many functions that are
annoyingly only available in auto mode
for example this model adds a control
ring step soom 428 35 50 70 and 100
millimeters that would be really great
for people like me who need to replicate
exact framing but it's only available in
complete auto mode for effects junkies
the rx100 2 offers a handful with a few
very nice and unusual
one's but you've got to scroll through
every variation rotating cornucopia of
33 slots when really there are only 13
basic filters and that gets seriously
annoying plus you can't save an
unfiltered version of an image over all
the photos look better than those of the
rx100 with about a stop more latitude
you can safely shoot JPEGs up to about
ISO 1600 ISO 3200 if you're not really
picky it's got a decent tonal range
though like it's sibling it Clips
highlights and it produces saturated
contrast images for this price point
though I'd really like a neutral color
preset option video also looks good it's
bright and saturated and reasonably
sharp with no noticeable artifacts in
bright light and it's relatively noise
free and dim this model isn't quite as
fast as the rx100
but it's still faster than most of the
competition for most situations the
rx100 choose combination of looks speed
flexibility and photo quality make it a
great choice for enthusiasts who can
afford the price tab I'm Laurie Brennan
and this is the sony cybershot DSC RX
