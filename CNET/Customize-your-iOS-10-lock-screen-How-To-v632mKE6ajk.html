prompted to unlock your phone if you
haven't done so already the list at the
top shows the ones that are being
displayed while the one on the bottom
shows all the apps you can choose from

red minus ball to eliminate or on the
green plus to add to change the order in
which they are displayed press the menu
lines on the right and drag to the
desired location now don't forget to hit

look at your new spotlight page 50 app
