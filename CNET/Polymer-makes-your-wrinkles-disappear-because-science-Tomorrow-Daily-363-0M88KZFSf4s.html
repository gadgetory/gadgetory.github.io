back yes thank you for filling in for me
yesterday I really appreciate it I'm
back to give you some headlines and I am
excited about this one
Hyperloop one has just completed its
first open air propulsion test in the
Nevada desert
Hyperloop technology changed its name to
Hyperloop one last night and today sent
an electric motor down a half mile long
test track at speeds of up to 300 miles
per hour this was an open air test even
though Hyperloop official concept is
basically maglev pods hurtling through
tubes at speeds of up to 750 miles an
hour but it's still pretty exciting to
see some official real-world testing
begin for the futuristic transportation
model three companies are currently
racing to be the first to operate a
Hyperloop system and Hyperloop one
officials believe their final product
could be delivered as soon as the year
2020 I want this to be a real thing so
bad this is the most brilliant concept I
mean they're saying a commute from LA to
San Francisco would be 30 minutes
that's amazing for me to drive to the
office in for LA right now my house less
than the trip from LA to LA which is
pretty intense yeah so exciting I'm
super excited about it - just keep going
Hyperloop one as fast as you can uh hey
everybody have you been feeling a little
wrinkly lately
crow's feet got you down well guess what
now this may never be a problem again
scientists at a variety of labs have
worked together and are now showing off
a new material that temporarily tightens
up your skin and smoothes out wrinkles
it's a silicone based polymer and
researchers discovered that test-subject
skin could be reshaped and hydrated
after applying a layer of the gel so
what's this stuff good for obviously the
cosmetics industry is going to be very
interested in this material but one of
the paper's authors depicted in the
video says it can also be used to
deliver drugs
bully to a patient provide long term UV
protection from the Sun and treat
chronic skin conditions I'm so curious
what this feels like
we are going to look 10 years old what
is the next show goodness we're gonna da
JH like 30 years does it feel like
wearing a mask was it feel like I mean I
don't know but they you see in the video
the guy like pinches the under-eye skin
of that old lady and like in the side
with the this polymer just smooths right
out as if as if her skin just bounce
back like it was hydrated and you much
much younger wild so I think both of
these stories are incredible I don't
know how to pick what we talked about on
Thursday I know I know I think um I mean
I think what we do is maybe we'll just
do a what I like to call a headline
scramble and we'll basically we might
pick two stories from one day and none
from yesterday well let's find out what
the people want you guys can always
weigh in and you know I think the
stories that get the most comments on
Twitter using our hashtag hey TV might
influence our decision I suggested that
yesterday on yesterday's show I think I
think you guys can carry this one this
week mostly because we are too lazy and
too excited about both these stories to
pick one that's right and if you give us
great comments we will of course
incorporate them into our long
discussion on tomorrow's show I just
want to be hurling through a hyper loop
with perfect skin yes me too all I've
ever wanted you guys piqued
civilizations
