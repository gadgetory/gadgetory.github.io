late you really can't miss the k-50 in a
crowd
notable design-wise for the ability to
configure it in innumerable two-tone
color combinations the real appeal of
this consumer DSLR is the weather sealed
body and broad photography oriented
feature set all for a good price it's
cheaper brother the K 500 is exactly the
same but without the weather sealing and
comes only in basic black the body is
comfortable to hold even single-handed
with gaskets sealing up the potential
leak points it lacks an articulated LCD
but otherwise is nicely designed with
subtleties like the type of double dials
you normally find in higher-end models
and direct access buttons for almost
everything and an interactive control
panel for the rest camera has Pentax
specific semi manual modes like shutter
and aperture priority mode which adjusts
ISO sensitivity automatically and
sensitivity priority mode which adjusts
shutter speed and aperture based on the
ISO sensitivity you select plus there
are some nice to have options like
interval shooting one big drawback
however is the camera and kit lens are
pretty noisy almost as if the purpose of
the camera is to provide camera like
sound effects well it's not the
speediest model in its price class it
sufficiently fast to keep up with most
family and vacation needs I was a little
disappointed at the photo quality though
the default color setting bright
completely whacks out the colors and it
seems like pen taxes JPEG processing
just hasn't kept up with Nikon or Sony
it's still sufficiently better than a
point-and-shoot at least if you change
the defaults so if you're planning to
step up you should be ok with it video
looks pretty meh though with lots of
more a aliasing and even rolling shutter
K 50 is a good deal if you need a
weather sealed or multi color DSLR but
similarly priced competitors look a bit
better in comparison for speed and video
and photo quality and the K 500 seems to
lose out on all counts they're both ok
cameras
just not the best to DuPont I'm Laurie
grinning and this is the Pentax K 50</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
