welcome to the cnet mailbag the show
that's brought to you on the internet
for free like all the other shows in
content we deliver because we are very
occasionally able to sell advertisements
to companies who would like to reach you
with their marketing messages and we
haven't been able to sell quite as many
ads as we'd like to as of late because
maybe you've heard of a little thing
called a global recession and it's made
us all a little bit worried about our
jobs but every so often we do manage to
sell some ads and then we can continue
to deliver the free content that we
think is high-quality to you so if maybe
you could ease up a little bit on the
bitching about the ads I think we would
all be grateful okay just check facebook
while they're on or something it's not
gonna kill you oh and as long as you're
hating on us Ethan says what is there
going to be a better cnet blog for
Kindle they're all stupid please create
a new one maybe about new tech products
Ethan Oh a smiley face how nice actually
I didn't even know we had kindle blogs
but now I do which means that I can see
how they got there and then how we might
be able to get more up there that you
don't think are so stupid ok moving on
bill emails in about some of the other
things that make our job hard sometimes
he says who's the comedian who made
don't know say netgear wndr3700 rangemax
dual band wireless-n gigabit router you
people are vicious yeah I think the
really vicious ones are the folks over
at netgear bill and I agree and also
good job don't have with me today the
router that so many of you have emailed
me to ask about your last couple of
months the netgear rangemax dual band
wireless-n gigabit router wndr3700 and i
hope you happy with the name as it took
require why to learn how to say that
smoothly okay let's do a little lover
male shall we
justin from irvine rides hey Molly I
wanted to send a quick thank you to
jason howell for his excellent work
exposing me to the various cnet podcast
podcast central is very well put
together I can navigate between
different shows with easy and find
exactly what I want whether audio video
or HD I know from conversations on bol
that he's constantly working to make my
experience with cnet shows better and he
is doing a noteworthy job so thank you
Jason for your hard work I agree Justin
and Jason worked long and hard to
coordinate that blog redesign and our
design team made it look so good and
Jason is indeed constantly working to
make things better so for all the people
who said Molly how do i subscribe to it
RSS feed for cnet conversations I can't
find it at podcast cnet com I know
Jason's working on it and it will be
available as a podcast soon and I hope
you caught our latest episode where unif
read and I interviewed Steve Ballmer you
can in case you're able or willing to
visit websites find it at cnet com /
conversations and finally a lover male
34 just because I feel like it and I
appreciated it Leonard says I've been a
loyal watcher of your scene at TV show
during my lunch hours for the past year
or so i really enjoy all of your
programs however today especially so the
three reports that got me to write this
are today's 9 23 09 buzz report how to
and loaded i genuinely appreciate
Molly's honesty with her displeasure and
pleasure in other cases at the telecoms
I second that emotion today's how to
also was especially beneficial as I've
always been frustrated with FM
transmitters and will now be installing
a modulator for my sister's truck and
last but not least the buzz report is
always engaging and entertaining and I
liked hearing about Google's further
intrusion into the Internet as a
stockholder I appreciate them growing
but that one's a little scary I'm
actually pretty sure he meant loaded in
that last part but Thank You Leonard I
appreciate it a lot and i hope the ads
didn't drive you crazy also to Ian in
the UK who sent me a camera script for a
top-tier episode holy crap thank you I
love this and that's it for this week
everyone keep the feedback in questions
coming email me at mailbag at cnet com
or send your snail mail to 235 second
street san francisco california 94 105
thank you for watching
