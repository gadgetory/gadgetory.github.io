that died in 2014 I'm Bridget Carey and
this is your CNN update as we look back
on the tech news of 2014 I wanted to pay
respects to the gadgets and software
that we lost this year the tech world
moves fast and in the quest for progress
there are casualties Microsoft
especially faced quite a number of
losses this was the year Windows XP and
Internet Explorer 6 officially died
Microsoft dropped support for XP and the
old browser in April no longer giving
security patches for the system that's
still used widely by businesses to
commemorate the death of the 12-year old
system Microsoft created a game called
escape from XP where you have to fight
to survive in the digital wasteland next
on the chopping block is Windows 7 which
ends support on January 13th we also say
goodbye to Windows Live Messenger also
known as MSN Messenger the 14 year old
chat service merged with Skype last year
but users in China where the last hang
on went shutdown in October the company
also killed off clipart Microsoft Office
no longer will have a library of corny
clipart instead if you want to insert a
photo the new office will direct you to
a Bing image search I'm gonna miss those
little sticks green beans they caught me
through so many school projects and
there's one more thing Microsoft killed
off Windows 9 well technically there
ever was a Windows 9 Microsoft announced
the next version of the operating system
will be called Windows 10 jumping from 8
to 10 porn I never had a chance we also
lost some apps in the Facebook family in
May the social network pulled the poke
app which was trying to compete with
snapchat and it pulled the camera app
which was similar to Instagram also in
social networking LinkedIn pulled the
email app called LinkedIn intro the
short-lived app scanned your emails to
give you contact suggestions but it was
criticized for its security issues in
that its end in March
Google shuttered a social network you
may have never heard of but it was huge
in Brazil Orkut the first Google social
network closed down in September it
launched the seniors
back in 2004 and flappy bird became a
top trending story of the year for being
a quirky game that was pulled in
February because the creator felt guilty
that people get addicted to it the game
was since been reborn as flappy birds
family for the amazon firetv the
two-year-old internet TV service area
went off the air for good after losing a
battle at the Supreme Court but perhaps
one of the hardest losses for techies
will be the iPod Classic music player
the last model to sport a click wheel
lasted for 7 years until September when
Apple stopped selling it online that's
