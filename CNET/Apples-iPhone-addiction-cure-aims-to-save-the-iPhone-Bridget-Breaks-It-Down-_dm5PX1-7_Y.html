the privacy worries the neck aches how
can anyone love a phone anymore it's
become this expensive tool that is vital
for your success and yet also leaves you
feeling awful about yourself and now the
companies that make phones are having to
make software to help you not hate their
products how did we get here I'm Bridget
Carey let's break it down
go ten years ago when the iPhones App
Store launched we were told there is an
app for anything you can imagine there's
an app for just about anything
only on the iPhone fast forward to today
now it's wow I'm sorry do you suffer
from phone addiction don't worry now
there's an app for that
both Google and Apple introduce new
settings and apps to put time limits on
your use to remind you to take a break
you'll also be able to get reports on
how much you're using the phone and
silence notifications anytime if you
just want to be left alone
when Apple unveiled these new options
this week at WWDC it's through plenty of
shade at apps like Facebook for being
the problem and with good reason
apps today are purposefully designed to
manipulate our lizard brains with just
the right lights and sounds and swipes
to keep us clicking and liking and
watching but Apple created the device
that lets the problem flourish the
iPhone is the playground for apps but
the apps have gotten out of control
there's just too much hitting you and
drawing you in for more Facebook is
poisoning the Apple and we're all
getting sick but when Apple comes out
with these new screen limits it's not
because Apple wants to save us Apple
needs to do this to save the iPhone to
save itself because if you hate your
phone if you hate how it makes you feel
if you despise the whole experience of
being dependent on a phone well then who
cares what phone you buy or if you need
a new phone at all once you reach that
point the game is over for Apple let me
say that I do love that we're finally
getting more controls to curb our
dependence and it's also fantastic that
parents have more ways to limit and
track their kids usage the next time
Apple paints Facebook as the villain
when these filmmakers say they really
now care about your digital health just
don't forget Apple still needs Facebook
and Instagram and YouTube and all the
rest they want you to buy that new phone
with the better camera to share your
shots on Instagram and watch those great
movies on their shiny new screens these
companies need you to back off but only
so that you don't hate them they don't
want to cure your addiction completely
after all you gotta stay a little
addicted to keep buying a new phone
every year right
thanks for watching so what's your take
on the problem with screen addiction
share your thoughts be sure to LIKE and
subscribe that isn't if you're not like
addicted to YouTube if you are then just
take a break okay just put the phone
down it's gonna be okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
