SEMA comm today we take a first look at
the Samsung my shot - also called the
SCH r4 60 this is a new phone for Cricut
pretty basic design a little bit of red
color though here on the bottom so makes
it just a tiny bit unique external
display is a little small but I does
show everything you need it also works
as a viewfinder for the camera and will
show a photo caller ID here on this side
you find a volume rocker and the charger
port is right below it luckily it is in
the microUSB format which is becoming a
standard up here is a 2.5 millimeter
headset jack we really prefer 3.5 but
this isn't a real music phone so we'll
let it pass here here on this side
you'll find a camera shutter and down
below you'll find the micro SD slot for
the memory card so nicely they put this
outside you don't have to go behind the
battery the battery cover to access it
inside
displays pretty standard average color
average resolution but it is pretty
bright and shows photos and graphics
relatively well menus are also easy to
master come in a couple styles but you
can find everything pretty quickly and
easily you have a very spacious toggle
here with an OK button in the middle
find a couple of soft keys here
dedicated speakerphone key and a
dedicated key for the music player these
keys are flush as well but give a get a
lot of room so we don't have any trouble
using them above the keypad buttons
you'll find the talk and in power key
along with the keypad buttons they are
raised above the surface of the phone so
pretty tactile we could text and dial
easily pretty easy to use in the dark as
well thanks to the backlighting and you
could dial by feel phone doesn't have a
real intense feature set has a 1.3
megapixel camera has a very basic music
player personal organizer options
bluetooth voice commands and dialing a
voice recorder so really this phone is
about just making calls sending messages
camera is OK photo quality isn't the
best but if you need a phone it offers a
little bit more than what most cricket
phones offer isn't a bad buy I'm Kent
Sherman and this is the Samsung my shot
too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
