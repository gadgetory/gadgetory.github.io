but you probably will not use it I'm
Bridget Carey and this is your scene
that update
this is going to be a big year for the
next generation of smartwatches LG is
promoting its upcoming SmartWatch called
the G watch and it released a short
teaser video with pretty much no
information about what makes it tick the
video plays this epic background music
so maybe you will feel epic wearing it
it reminds us of what we already know
that it's going to run Android and it
has a square metal face LG says it's
ready with a single charge but how long
does that charge last because that would
be nice to know and it won't get damaged
by little drops of rain water LG said
the watch will launch this quarter so we
should get more details by the end of
june and in other news for products that
don't yet exist let's talk about the
iphone 6 there have been many reports
that the next iPhone will have a larger
screen and there's yet another report
that backs up this rumor the Chinese
Network weifeng posted fuzzy computer
renderings of the iphone 6 casein which
were said to come from Foxconn that's
the factory that makes the iphone it
shows a screen that's slightly larger
than the current 4-inch screen the
renderings also show rounded corners
let's move from tech rumors to tech
murders Facebook killed off two of its
spin-off apps poke and Facebook camera
now poke was launched in 2012 as a
copycat of snapchat it was a way to send
a photo to someone that would disappear
from the screen after a few seconds and
Facebook camera was also released in
2012 designed just for sharing photos
with filters kind of like Instagram of
course facebook now owns Instagram and
oddly enough square just killed an app
that it launched in 2012 the coincidence
square wallet is now gone and it's
replaced with an app called square order
it only works in New York and San
Francisco for now the app shows local
stores that you square and you can place
an order for something at that store
like say a cup of coffee and once you
pay on the app that coffee will be ready
for you to pick up at the shop it's
different from the now-dead square
wallet app that also let you pay for
things with a nap but you had to be in
the store to use it
you how to activate the app and then
your photo would show up on the cash
register so the clerk could tap your
photo to charge you now taking out your
phone to turn on the app to pay doesn't
save you time but maybe you will save
time with square order by ordering ahead
that is if you find a business near you
that actually uses it that's your tech
