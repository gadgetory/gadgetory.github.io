too I'm Brian Cooley during my colleague
Donald Bell brian Tong hello mr. Cooley
here we are gentlemen hey how's everyone
holding up good good well after last
night's company party some holding us
some holding up a little better than
other yeah that's yeah my question is
code for how are you holding up since
the party all right well yeah I'm alive
well we'll go into that offline later
anywhere here at the live at the scene
that stage of the Las Vegas Convention
Center let's talk about the big must
know products and cnet editors have
spotted in the last 24 hours since we
last did one of these roundups shows so
guys let's start with something called
LG home chat which was an ass couple
days ago we first got a really good
piece up on it here where you can use
text commands to control and program
you're smart appliances the idea here
the LG says is instead of having to get
another app and learn another interface
and its own peculiarities just text the
thing say hey fridge how you doing yeah
one of the one of the examples that they
used in this video is that it knew way
lados it knows what's in your fridge
right so you just say look for recipe
and because it's a smart refrigerator it
would then suggest a recipe to eat now I
don't based on what's in my refrigerator
I don't know if they could find somebody
what's in your fridge oh let's say
there's ramen there is spam refrigerator
there is orange juice spirulina I'm sure
you know some some moldy cheddar cheese
so we could make a little quinoa yeah I
do you take me as a quinoa guy come on a
little Quino Quino there's got to be
yeah I'm Oliver I'm a little
uncomfortable with this I feel like SMS
is a very personal medium and this is
like a step towards my apply to become
sentient and actually judging me for
what I you know refrigerator don't
refrigerate or takeout or don't or what
I leave behind King one night and you
know when you accidentally text the
wrong person on your little text inbox
they're saying that shouldn't going out
that way well you know the things you
might say to your fridge you might not
want to say to any friends you big
square dummy
or hey I think you're cool uh-huh I'm
found um anyway that's uh that's what's
going on there yeah that's about as good
as I've got right now ok how many folks
here are using any kind of gesture
control on their technology whether it's
shake your phone or a leap motion or
something like none of you okay and you
can sleep during this story up elliptic
labs showed our Jessica dull court
something that is a new kind of gesture
control built into mobile devices or it
could be a laptop there she is showing
it there but instead of using infrared
or some kind of an optical technology
it's using sound waves that are coming
off the device toward you but you know
they're harmless ultrasonic and I was
looking over his shoulder while she was
getting this demonstration and getting
this technology down and it looks to be
very very forgiving in other words it's
not it doesn't have to have a perfectly
clean environment around you it doesn't
have stray light interference issues it
looks kind of robust and you like what
did you like it tho or I mean did you
get a ticket out what I can tell you
don't see her use it here it looked like
it was you know more or less working
right and some of the gesture
technologies that we've used of all
kinds they tend to be a little prickly
yeah you know they work like every third
time and that gets old in the hurry I
just is this I don't know this is the
perfect medium for it right I feel like
we're pretty comfortable with directly
touching our right devices but it's
something Samsung would definitely adopt
I think they want they want to throw
everything at you they'll be the first
ones to throw that in there Jessica
thinks it might come out on the next on
the next Galaxy just kind of looks like
the counting that they might be there
was I think that was a galaxy s4 like
finger free finger free x5 and they had
a little bit of that on the current s4 i
think you know i do Jedi waiting on your
pic yeah the Jedi on the glance away
town but anyway that's that's the latest
innovation we saw in gesture where do
you really want gesture in your tech
products I mean Leo if something you can
reach you could reach what would you
like to have gesture in that maybe makes
more sense i think the the one that
actually surprised me the most this last
year was the was the nest smoke detector
the girl was called yeah just one single
wave where you just kind of wave at it
and like stop beeping at me you're not
the dog like the ceiling with the broom
you can actually just like hey stop yeah
i'm sorry i overcook the food this is so
tops already judging me in text
messaging me just accept what
stop beeping the stoats already on you
the baby this is the future we go right
got that gesture control made sense to
me that was like oh that is a
qualification for them or television
because it's hard to get to its across
the room no one's cracked that not yet
so we find those are pretty hitting man
all right now let's see this is one this
this goes to be T here he went out saw
Ford's out here yeah out in or outside
of the north hall area yeah and what do
they show you there so what Ford has
they have this what they call a vehicle
to vehicle demonstration here this is a
driver assisted system and basically
what happens is these cars have a unit
on top of module you'll see it in this
video but it's a little shark fin and it
allows vehicles to detect each other
within range it's a why it sends out a
signal every ten ten times a second it's
Wi-Fi and gps based but these all talk
to each other this is a standard that's
moving forward it's not just on ford
cars i know it's on all like eight of
the OEMs and manufacturers that they're
trying to push this forward but is a
really nifty technology you're not it's
not going to take control of your car
that's right but it will give you an
alert of warning whether it's an LED
display on your car that you hear a
sound also the like seats themselves
have vibration or feedback if someone's
on your blind spot you'll hear it here
you'll feel it here i think the weird
thing about this demo though is that
they put the vibration in every seat
when the car stopped but they didn't put
it on the shoulders they put it right on
the seat area that feel if you know what
i mean and i felt it when it warned me
it was a soulful experience it i learned
something about myself all right tell me
but I don't want though yeah so what it
does is BTW mentions it doesn't take
control of the brakes but it gives you
an alert saying you need to hit the
brakes because i've detected that a car
maybe two cars up is stopped and there's
about to be a pileup or a chain reaction
so that's really cool because it can it
can be retrofitted to other cars that
don't already have it as opposed to real
drive control systems that you can't
retrofit to a car and then if the car
doesn't have automatic braking it never
will and then here in this demo this is
that there's a big Penske truck in your
right hand side so a lot of times you
might be going through an intersection
and you don't see a car that may not see
you actually coming through so you're
about to start your right to start right
here and driving toward a cross
intersection is what's being mocked up
here exactly cross traffic coming from
the right I had to put on my seatbelt
buckle I didn't have my seat but on the
whole demo and there you go and as that
car went by that
are blue red light based yeah yeah yeah
and those two would have collided but
that driver with BT was given a warning
and good the brakes and as a result
beans he's with us today and he I could
have gone wrong was a scary demo that
could have gone Romani our producers
screamed driven with the girls for my
life sony says you don't need to buy new
computer you can turn any table into a
computer this is a sort of a a new and
refreshed idea the idea here is you can
project a computer interface on to any
surface this is kind of like a different
way of doing that big it's an acer earn
it lenovo tabletop computer yeah which
is an actual computer but this is just a
tabletop and the projector projects the
computer and gives you the interface and
detects your hand motions so you can
control the thing we also saw similar
things microsoft very early on had
deserved tabletops the big surface yeah
that was where it kind of started it was
projection based as well but the
projector was coming from the bottom and
then up that's right it was under the
screen yeah rear projection at least it
kind of gets towards that Star Wars
chest table effect you wish you seen all
the kind of like you know high-tech
drama movies these days they could get
at the situation table okay you throw
you a photo Donnell is just a terrorist
you saw you know all this stuff it's all
crazy we're spinning things around uh
does this sound remotely realistic to
any anybody hey do you really would we
really use it today right now are we
intrigued by it right if we had these
over the ceiling would they be great to
have it right here I mean I think
there's so much ambient light in the
world I would never get great contrast
yeah unless I'm in the dim room I'm not
feeling it but you know maybe maybe
maybe you guys are i like i like the
effect of it feels futuristic but i
don't i don't think it's really gonna
children you think would like it you're
the father here i think my kids plenty
happy it'll be an ipad walls about the
malls if you ever see those little
attraction games from the top run over a
bubble yeah exactly that that that's
that's a great use for it you know what
you want the kid doing that on a kitchen
table no not near the knives anyway
alright t-mobile not a tech product but
a tech policy they say switch over to us
leave your current carrier and we'll pay
your early termination fee now t-mobile
has been kicking up a lot of dust lately
they're kind of you know taking it smash
mouth to a lot of other carriers with
their whole uncarrier idea but this is a
they're stepping up here mean that can
be a big fee and they're saying come on
over
we're going to pay it for you it's you
know they remain sort of a you know
second-tier in terms of their size
compared to AT&amp;amp;T Verizon so looking for
something to do differently I thought
one of the other interesting stories
here that Roger Cheng one of our
reporters posted it's up on our CES site
how he inadvertently got the head of
t-mobile thrown out of the AT&amp;amp;T party he
museum with could come they did a selfie
or something and he put it up I guess is
he right any there it is this John
Legere but who's for the heart is doing
that the photo with Roger and then this
one out and he s he did a hashtag AT&amp;amp;T
or 18 tea party or something on the AT&amp;amp;T
folks saw it said get out of here yeah
he got he got escorted out right as he
got a sorted out and then I heard he got
back here I Mac because the roadies of
the band that was playing him passing so
t-mobile CEO will not be denied no but I
do like I do like the idea of the
getting bought out of your current guy I
feel like that's probably for a lot of
people as soon as I feel the pain of
whatever situation they're in currently
like um but I have like another year my
contractor oh I don't want to sweat it
out yeah yeah yeah but if John's just
gonna lovingly just like buy you out of
it's like he's paying for your divorce
yeah you're done is fine hey Moe there's
a parent who enables you like hard I'll
bail you out but don't do meth again are
you talking to Donald directly there's
no well just okay okay different around
the table okay don't look it's all I'm
doing all right um now this support of
the show where we normally have a we go
live to one of our reporters out on the
floor and we're gonna do that let's go
to the CES show floor and see what
Sharon Vaknin has been up to now Sharon
tell us where you are and what you've
got for us hey guys i am the most
comfortable i have been throughout all
of CES here i am lounging in the cnet
lounge playing with a piece of
technology we found called beam okay
it's a telepresence device which means
that you can be at two places at once
using this it's a it's not a robot okay
they're not calling it a robot it's a
telepresence device so you log into your
computer and there you appear on the
screen and what that means
is that you can go to work and be at
work without ever leaving your house and
that's how most people are using this
device so the way I control it is with
my computer and I'm gonna start doing
that now okay I'm gonna I'm gonna ride
this thing what I'm seeing on my
computer is basically the device has two
cameras one on top at the top of the
screen I'm in another just below it so I
can see the ground below me there she
ain't guys oh there's your audience
through this guy he says come here give
me a hug right now that's right now you
big LCD thing you yeah i'm lounging i
don't even need to get out of here this
is just doing closure for me there she
is so good two cameras you guys how's it
going over there I don't have to deal
with all the bright lights don't have to
deal with the crowds I'm back here
enjoying my life I think I think you see
a little more ice cream your legs got
real skinny girl oh yeah sliced net look
great thank you I have to say though I'm
resisting like a bully impulse just push
you over you know you see this
helplessly with your reel spinning on
the ground I'm defenseless donnelly
honey that is too much effort actually
I'm sorry I get an eight hour battery
life it only takes four hours to charge
it's not for everyone it is sixteen
thousand dollars plus a few fees here
and there okay but uh for the for the
corporate guy who needs to be in two
places at once thought about deal not
bad pretty cool that's pretty cool you
know the bad the battery life of eight
hours is perfect for a work day as well
right so that that's gets excuses for
their smart about stay home yet be there
could also you can incorporate a Roomba
on the bottom to get some you know God
is how your employer can buy shares
that is so weird goodbye Sarah thanks ok
I get the foreign to take a real quick
break and we come back you know we got
to do oh come on we got to play the game
it's the game the game at CES wao we
call a CES or see II know you know what
we'll be talking about in just a few
moments coming up back after a break
here at CES live from Cena
my dad had a Honda my mom had a Honda
who was coming from a 2007 honda accord
I traded in origin titanium no joke i
test-drove 15 different vehicles I kinda
was indifferent toward Ford and then i
sat in the fusion for the first time but
I just like wow this is it you have the
power but she had the fuel economy
that's what you go goose does I love to
help people look at what board has to

hoping that they can bring this standard
to things like you know your cell phone
or other products it's a bowl that
charges siiii yes or no I thought it was
a new bidet ok he know yeah I thought it
was like a like a ironclad undergarment
or something like that it kind of not
since the Renaissance and we are
