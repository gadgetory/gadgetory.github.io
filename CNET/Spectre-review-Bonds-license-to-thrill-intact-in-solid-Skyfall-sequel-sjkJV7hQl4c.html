the author of all your pain
late in the year for the lesser gull
it'll be in Morocco within the fortnight
you've had eyes on Spector I have so
bond 24 cinematic outings bought from
audiences except well if you like
Skyfall you'll probably like Spectre
because it's like Skyfall only more so
it's sumptuously shot and Daniel Craig
is on commanding confidence swaggering
form which practice so relax even
cracked a joke or two it's easily the
funniest Bond film since our man took
the job sounds like a neat piece of work
any loose ends control should know about
has enough questions enough questions
years ago sit down agent our problem is
the plot Spectre verges into even more
personal psychological territory than
Skyfall bond facing a shadowy adversary
from his past and his job is under
threat from a ripped from the headlines
government surveillance program but
neither threat really convinces although
Christoph Waltz is as watchable as ever
control will expect a concise report can
you sum up your views on Spector here's
your report Spectre is solid bond
although in some ways it's trying a
little too hard it's too long and it
overcooks the angle of trying to get
into bonds head but there's some
cracking action and Daniel Craig is on
top form if this really is his final
mission then he's going out with his
license to thrill intact that will be
all agent and you have something for me
that will be all ages you gave your word
Gold Cornyn now get back in the field
your little scamp and stay tuned to seen
it for more Intel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
