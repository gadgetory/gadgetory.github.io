headphone the rebranded version of the
company's popular a e2i headphone it
carries the list price of one 7995 but
cost closer to one hundred and fifty
dollars online hi I'm David cardo and
I'd like to tell you that Bose has
improved the sound of the headphone but
alas the changes are really just
cosmetic with this new model coming in
new more eye-catching colors that are
perhaps designed to appeal to younger
headphone shoppers you can't really tell
that from the headphone I have here
which is a kind of subdued black but yes
there are some other colors which are
funkier poses around your headphones or
over ear as these types of cans are
often called have always been known for
being relatively lightweight and very
comfortable the design of this model
really hasn't changed much over the
years though this new version folds flat
and comes with a new nicer carrying case
while it's not as compact as the
soundtrue on-ear it's still a pretty
good travel headphone even if it doesn't
feature the noise canceling circuitry of
boses QuietComfort models as for
features the headphone quart is
detachable and that cord has an
integrated three button remote and
microphone for making cell phone calls
this is an apple friendly model so not
all the remote features will work with
Android and Windows phones this
headphone sounds good and delivers
smooth generally well balanced fairly
open sound for a closed back headphone
like the on ear this is a pleasant
headphone to listen to but doesn't offer
quite as refined sound as some competing
models it's what I like to call a safe
headphone in that it makes most music
and most music sources sound decent as
long as you aren't expecting audiophile
grade sound plotting most people should
be pretty pleased with its performance
at around $150 I wouldn't call this a
bargain but it is a very likable
headphone that's quite comfortable and
sounds decent it's also nice to see Bose
branch out with some funky er color
options after being pretty conservative
for all these years I'm David Conroy and
that's the bose soundtrue around ear
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
