solar keyboard folio for the ipad now I
know what you're saying Scott why
another keyboard case for the ipad it's
true there have been a lot of these
because there hasn't been a perfect
solution and a lot of people take their
iPads on the go to right well this one
has a wrinkle which I kind of just
revealed to you it's solar-powered and
that means that you don't have to carry
an extra USB charger with you in fact
this doesn't even come with one but if
you charge it on the back for what
logitech says could be as much as six
hours or even faster you're going to get
up to two years of use if you type two
hours a day now I haven't had time to
review this keyboard case for two years
I have however in the past few weeks
found it to be very good at charging
fast and so far it's been working great
as advertised the keyboard here is a
very high quality keyboard logitech's
really been going aces lately with their
ipad cases and their keyboard solutions
the ultrathin keyboard cover was one of
the best reviewed ones that we've had at
cnet and Logitech's made a variety of
them this one is a thicker larger
keyboard really feels like a laptop
keyboard maybe a little more plastic II
definitely feels comfortable for
extended sessions and what's nice about
this case is it has a second viewing
angle that's right if you move it down
to this notch it'll go into a video
viewing mode and all these buttons down
here will activate and turn into volume
buttons and fast forward buttons now
there's something kind of automatic
about this to use that word that this
connects via bluetooth without having to
turn it on or off the moment that you
take this case and fold it over into
this mode it begins the pairing process
and when you deactivate it voila like
magic it turns off that's really nice in
terms of saving power and if in case you
fold it up and accidentally press a key
you won't be typing something crazy on
your iPad now the drawback to this is
that one it's a hundred thirty dollars
that's expensive but a lot of keyboard
cases and covers for the ipad are pretty
expensive but to even though it looks
great trust me it doesn't feel as good
as you'd expect now I'm not talking
about the keyboard I'm talking about the
case
is meant to be a folio case so you open
it up like a book hopefully you can use
it that way but between the heavy
keyboard on one end and this sort of
almost off the Roll feeling upholstered
strip that connects the whole case it
feels a little flimsy and that's not
something that I would have expected on
130 dollar accessory now when you fold
this up it does fold nice and flat and
it feels very rigid and sturdy and this
big tubular battery that's here you know
I guess it needed to be necessary but
when you close it sometimes sometimes it
crashes up against the iPad cover and it
makes for a little bit of hard
negotiation to make sure you've nested
it just right you can get past those
elements and the fact that well this
cover here for the solar part is a
little flimsy and flexible feeling I
don't know how that will last over time
we did get dust under the edge of ours
it's a very good keyboard and if you
keep it folded up in that mode when
you're traveling you might really love
the fact that you don't have to charge
it I'm Scott Stein and that's a look at
the logitech solar keyboard folio for
the ipad and thats ipad 2 and 3rd gen
ipad</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
