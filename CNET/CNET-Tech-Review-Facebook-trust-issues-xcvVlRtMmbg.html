facebook faces the music a brand-new
color ebook reader the sony dash brings
twitter to the bedroom and yes this is
the android you're looking for it's all
coming up right now
hey everyone I'm Hollywood and welcome
to the cnet tech review the show where
we bring you the good the bad and the
bottom line in tech videos from the week
let's get started with the good stuff
now I love my droid which finally got
the android 2.1 update but even so I'll
be the first to admit that the android
OS has plenty of room for improvement so
I've been anxiously awaiting to point to
and here's Jessica dole courts to tell
you all about it google has announced
some major changes coming up in version
2.2 of its android operating system I'm
Jessica's all court from cnet let's take
a look at some of the new features on an
android phone running version 2.2 first
you'll notice that the home screen has
new dedicated shortcuts for the phone
application launcher and the web plus
new navigation soft keys and a tips
widget that you can easily delete if you
decide you don't want it android 2.2 is
noticeably faster than version 2.1 and
all that you do on the phone thanks to
some new chip architecture the browser
also got a kick in the pants on the
speed front android 2.2 phones will also
support adobe flash player 10.1 which
means that you'll be able to stream
videos and play flash games directly
from your browser it works best on sites
that are optimized for mobile phone
access otherwise you may not be able to
paint around tethering is another major
addition which means that when you plug
the phone into your laptop you can use
the phone's data service to power the
internet some android phones like the
nexus one can be turned into a Wi-Fi
hotspot that can power up to eight
different devices google has revised the
cameras menu system with a layout that
lets you select camera options with just
one hand the LED flash has also now been
enabled for video mode so that you can
film in low light settings android 2.2
has multilingual keyboard options that
let you switch among keyboard languages
when you slide your finger along the
space bar there are even more features
coming to android 2.2 like a quick
search box to search for apps and data
within apps and an option to update all
apps in your market at once better
integration with microsoft exchange that
includes a global address book support
for the exchange calendar and remote
wiping for company
shoot phones there will also soon be a
reworked online version of the android
market that will let you automatically
load things like apps music and maps
from the web to your phone mobile
carriers will upgrade the android 2.2
operating system over the air at
different times so if you've got an
android phone keep your eyes peeled I'm
jessica's all court and you've been
looking at the version 2.2 operating
system for android phones I've started a
personal countdown to when Verizon is
going to give me the Froyo don't make me
storm your offices verizon I need that
one click app update thing now of course
once you get the update you might as
well stock up on some new games too
here's Bryant on with some of his
favorite free games for android phones
oh oh welcome to tap that app i'm brian
Tong and this is the show where we cover
the hottest apps in the mobile space now
this week we're showing games for
android earlier we did a 99 cent games
for the iPhone platform but there really
aren't many 99 cent games in the android
marketplace so we're going to find out
the best free games that are more than
just demos for paid games and honestly
the free games are probably the ones
that will work the best across all the
different android phones out there so
first up is bonsai blast the idea here
is to shoot colored bubbles at a moving
chain when you get three in a row it
breaks the chain and you can move the
shooter around there's other bonuses and
it's a good one now we love doodle jump
on the iPhone but it's 399 on Android so
check out the free game called abduction
you're a cow your herd has been abducted
and using the accelerometer it's up to
you to reach the top where a UFO has
taken your friends now if you want a
retro old-school feel check out radiant
this game pays homage to space invaders
you have power ups and you have
asteroids and space aliens to destroy
and it's a smooth-running time waster
there's also bejeweled on Android but it
has performance issues and it's 499 so
check out Jules which is free you swipe
to create chains of jewels that break
and you'll also be able to post your
score to a global leader board now if
you want a tower defense game you want
to take a look at a robo defense the
free version goes up to 10 levels and
you'll need to prevent enemies from
crossing the screen place your different
defense towers down and upgrade them as
well and finally paper toss is one of
our favorites and it made it to android
flick paper balls into a garbage can
wall fan blows at different speeds and
it's probably one of the most addicting
games of this group but if I had to
choose my favorite out of the bunch I'm
probably gonna have to pick radiant and
robo defense but all these apps are free
and that alone makes them tap worthy now
if you have any apps you'd like us to
check out or a theme for a show send us
your suggestions to tap that app at cnet
com I'm Brian Tom and we'll see you
okay so maybe the iphone is still one in
the games war but hey they're free
moving on as sous the inventor of the
netbook has a new EP c and this one
actually has some cool tricks like HD
video on a netbook check it out I'm Dan
Akron and we are here with the asus eee
pc 1005 PR i know what you're asking
another EPC another 1005 model what is
the PR me I don't know what the PR means
but this guy is different from all the
other EPCs we've looked at recently in
two very important ways number one even
though it's a tenant screen it's a
higher resolution 1366 x 768 display and
we haven't seen that on a 10-inch Asia
before and it's got the broadcom HD
video accelerator chip in it which helps
you play video files and mixes much more
of a multimedia machine it's not quite
as good as having a version with the
nvidia ion which does that and also play
some games but there aren't a lot of
nvidia ion netbooks out there right now
are the broadcom chip it's pretty much
the only game in town most of the time
now if you're planning on using your
netbook as a movie watching or video
watching device obviously going to be
very interested in how this broadcom
chip works when you're playing video
files WMV files MOV files whatever from
your hard drive even 720p and 1080p ones
I've seems to work pretty good here's an
example right here so even a full screen
plays pretty smooth definitely present
for a netbook if you didn't know what it
had this broadcom chip in it now
fortunately you're trying to watch HD
videos online whether it's through hulu
or YouTube or anything like that that's
where you run into some more trouble
even though the latest flash update from
Adobe is supposed to work better with
this broadcom chip it's still not quite
perfect yet here's a 720p video file
played through youtube if I can see it
place but it's a little bit stuttering
not really great experience overall this
is a 720p file regular standard
resolution flash video files play fine
so when it comes to the video playback
with the broadcom chip you know some
good news some not so good is there
everyone's always promising smoother
online video streaming with every adobe
flash update and
driver update for broadcom hasn't really
happened yet other than that this is a
very standard EPC intel atom n450 chip 1
gig ram windows seven starter now
usually these systems coming around 299
for a very basic netbook to upgrade to
the broadcom chip and the higher
resolution tennis display it's only
another hundred bucks 399 making this
overall pretty good deal if you're
looking for a 10 inch netbook that can
do just a little bit more than your
average everyday netbook i'm dan
ackerman and that is the asus eee pc
1005 p wow seems pretty snazzy for four
hundred dollars and yes i said snazzy
now i don't know about you but i am not
a huge fan of waking up in the morning
it has a lot to do with the sound of my
alarm although from the looks of the
sony dash i bet i could find something a
little more appealing and here's Donald
Bell to tell us more hey i'm donna bell
for cnet.com and today we're taking a
first look at the sony dash this is a
tabletop touchscreen device that
connects to the internet over Wi-Fi and
displays a customized mix of news games
music and video it's a bit of a misfit a
web device that doesn't have a web
browser and a media streamer with only a
handful of options at one hundred ninety
nine dollars it does enough cool stuff
that tech fans should take notice the
dash is shaped like a wedge with a
7-inch resistive touchscreen on the
front built-in stereo speakers and a
menu button up top along with volume
controls there's a port on the bottom
for the included power adapter and a
little door on the side here that
includes a headphone output and the USB
port at its most basic level the dash be
set up as a bedside clock with multiple
custom alarms a detailed description of
the local weather and the ability to dim
the screen completely there's no battery
backup but there's also no power switch
which means if there's a temporary power
outage the dash will turn back on as
soon as powers restored that said it's a
bit of an overkill as an alarm clock
personally I found this much more useful
at the kitchen table after installing a
dozen or so apps out of the hundreds
that so many license from the folks at
chumby I could use a dash of glance the
headlines browse tweets and Facebook
updates and see new photos on Flickr you
can't engage with the services the same
way
you could with a home computer but the
smaller footprint of the dash makes it a
nice geeky distraction while you're
eating breakfast also the extra screen
size compared to something like a chumby
makes it easier to glance info at a
distance some other unique advantages of
the dash include the ability to stream
video from Netflix Amazon YouTube
crackle CBS video podcasts and more you
also get streaming audio options from
slacker Pandora and New York Times
podcasts as a touchscreen pandora radio
tuner alone I think the dash is a decent
value 199 dollars although I do wish you
didn't have to run audio out from the
side just to connect this to your home
stereo because the built-in speakers
really don't do the sound any justice so
that's the sony dash an affordable
adaptable internet media streamer with a
relatively big screen and plenty of
potential vecina com I'm Donald Bell I
don't know maybe it's not that great but
I guess if you can't get out of bed in
the morning before you check your
Twitter feed then this is the alarm
clock for you this is the alarm clock
for me okay on that embarrassing note
it's time to take a break but don't go
anywhere we've got tips on how to fix
your facebook privacy settings when we
come back
fine coolly from cnet com now when we
check the performance of a piece of tech
we check the performance of a piece of
tech if you love videos of cars and all
their high tech and high performance
glory check out the cnet car tech video
podcast cnet com / car tech TV
welcome back as i'm molly wood and this
is the cnet tech review we've seen some
pretty good stuff this week but our luck
can't hold out forever it's time for the
bad since so many smart phones have GPS
built in these days I'm starting to
wonder about the value of stand-alone
navigation devices but if that's still
your thing take a look at this first
look video form antuan goodwin just
don't look too closely right ways back
this time with updated hardware updated
software and significantly less NASCAR
gimmickry but does the new right way 550
navigator have what it takes to go up
against the heavyweights from garmin and
tomtom I'm antuan goodwin let's take a
first look and try to find out the right
way 550 features much nicer hardware
than the spotter Dale junior edition we
tested last year now it's got the same
4.3 inch color touch screen and the
dimensions are about the same but it's
got a much more powerful surf atlas 4
processor and an updated surf star for
gps receiver that should be more
accurate than the older surf star 3 and
should acquire satellite lock much
faster the 550 is also running the
newest version of co-pilots embedded
navigation application copilot 8 this
application features a 3d map view with
cool pli icons are relayed the ability
to add multiple destinations text to
speech and multiple routing modes it
features a customizable interface that
displays a ton of information however
the amount of information verges on
information overload and crams the map
data into a smallish 3.25 inch chunk of
the whole 4.3 inch screen we think it'd
be very easy for a novice navigator to
get lost in the bevy of map screen
options not to mention the confusing
menu structure then there's the
underlying window siiii operating system
that further adds a level of complexity
with competitors garmin and tomtom
making huge strides to simplify their
interfaces right way and co-pilot setup
seems like a bit of a blast from the
past then again sometimes a little bit
of flexibility goes a long way and if
you like the idea of a customizable
interface then
copilot powered 550 maybe the device for
you to find out how well this GPS device
got us from point A to point B and to
learn about a few of the hidden features
check out the full review at cnet com
until then I'm antuan goodwin with your
first look at the right way 550 gps
navigator right way huh cuz it sounds
like the wrong no I can't even I cannot
make that joke you can just fill in the
blank anywho ever since it came out many
kindle fans have been asking when we're
gonna see a color version and earlier
this week Jeff Bezos of Amazon confirmed
that they have no immediate plans to add
a color screen so if you're desperate to
do your meeting in color and you don't
want to shell out for an iPad you might
want to try out the new novel ereader
from pandigital the key word here might
hey I'm Donnell bell for cnet.com and
today we're taking a first look at the
can digital novel this is an e-book
reader with a 7-inch color touch screen
and a low price of one hundred ninety
nine dollars the main menu offers a view
of the integrated bookstore your own
book library and a dashboard of apps out
of the box you get options for music
photos videos as well as a web browser
calendar and email one of the most
notable features here is the ability to
browse and shop for ebooks from barnes &amp;amp;
noble calm you can connect the novel
over Wi-Fi unlike ereader such as the
kindle or nook there's no cellular
capabilities built in you also don't get
the anti-glare benefits of reading an
e-ink display since the novel uses of
color LCD that said for 199 dollars the
novel packs a surprising amount of
features in a thin lightweight design on
the top here you'll notice an SD card
slot that accepts up to 32 gigabytes of
external memory to complement the one
gigabyte of memory that's built in you
also get a headphone jack volume control
and a USB port when you connect us to
your computer you can transfer any
ebooks or documents you have in an epub
PDF or HTML format you can also look at
any mp3 s photos or a handful of video
formats as an e-book reader you can
perform common tasks such as enlarging
the font highlighting text and
bookmarking you also get a built-in
dictionary and a nighttime reading mode
that inverts
text color so that's the pandigital
novel a full color 199 ebook reader
running the Barnes &amp;amp; Noble bookstore
cnet com I'm Donald um now admittedly
Donald was using a pre-release version
of the novel for his video so hopefully
it gets better before it goes on sale in
june until then now the moment you've
been waiting for this week's bottom line
this week Facebook finally came clean
and admitted that their privacy settings
left something to be desired they'll be
rolling out some changes in the next
couple weeks and seth rosenblatt is here
now to show you how to set everything up
just right once again facebook has
changed its privacy settings unlike the
last time this happened today's
improvements are a mixed bag hi i'm seth
rosenblatt for cnet and in this how to
I'll be showing you how to navigate the
rocky shoals of Facebook's new privacy
settings first let's take a look at the
old settings because when you compare
them side-by-side it appears that the
new ones are much easier to navigate the
old is a text wall of options from which
you need to click through to get to even
more options then it was a clean
easy-to-read chart but don't let that
deceive you not all privacy settings
access here get equal wait to get to the
settings go to the account tab on the
upper right of your Facebook page and
then hit privacy your new settings are
automatically based on your previous
ones if you did any tweaking in the old
system they'll be imported as custom
settings on the left and other on the
chart also on the left are several
preset options everyone friends of
friends friends only and recommended
it's no accident that the recommended
settings are in fact the second most
permissive ones on the list now you can
customize your privacy by hitting the
small customized text link below the
chart the customize page looks like the
text heavy list of dropdowns from the
older settings but it does unify all
those previously disparate settings in
one place
some things are new here such as edit
album privacy and toggling wall posting
everyone means that all facebook users
can't see your info while friends only
is the most restrictive except that this
being Facebook it's not the most
restrictive if you choose customize you
can further restrict your privacy
settings to either specific friends or
just yourself still most major privacy
tweaks are now on this one page blocking
apps is a big new feature but Facebook
decided to be a little clever with it
instead of making it as easy as possible
to adjust facebook app settings for
example they could have just made
sliders to control everything you have
to click on a text link below the main
settings chart to adjust apps it shows
you what you've approved and through
another text link allows you to
selectively remove or block all apps
game activity gets Facebook's standard
for options but the info option here is
ridiculous refers to your information
that your friends apps can access
through their profiles it's a backdoor
for apps that you have no control over
getting at your data no really really i
recommend marking all these off because
if you don't the only other way to do it
is to kill all app access which includes
useful apps such as facebook on your
smartphone instant personalization is a
new feature that lets facebook's partner
sites get at your data that you've
allowed everyone to see thankfully this
is set by default to off for now the
public search option is slightly less
customizable than it was under the old
privacy settings the old settings split
facebook search from public search
engine queries but now you can only
toggle the public search engines option
the new privacy settings definitely take
a step in the right direction organizing
the settings under a more comprehensible
scheme there are serious flaws though
such as the information that's
accessible through your friends and
perhaps worst of all there's no way to
block those damnable farmville and mafia
wars updates so until somebody makes
those games an offer they can't refuse
these are your best bets for how to
manage your new facebook privacy
settings for cnet i'm suppr Rosenblatt
now hopefully these changes will help
put you in more control of your info on
facebook but the bottom line this week
you can't trust those people I'm sorry
you just can't and that's our show for
this week we'll be back again next week
with a whole new batch of videos
including this year's top five gifts for
father's day until then you can find
more great video at cnet TV com see you
next time and thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
