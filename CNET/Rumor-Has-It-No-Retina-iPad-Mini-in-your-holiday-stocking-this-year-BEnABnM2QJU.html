has it the show that rounds up the
week's biggest tech rumors and don't
forget that you can vote on what you
think about the rumors too in the
interactive player if you're watching on
CNN now this time it's all about smart
phones and smart watches oh yes and a
tablet first step the internet went
crazy last week when Google chairman
Eric Schmidt was caught using Motorola's
Moto X smartphone in the wild the phone
is the first handset produced by
motorola under google ownership and it's
rumored to be highly customizable with
swappable back plates that come in
different colors now that's all fine and
good but the real whopper of a rumor is
that the Moto X along with the HTC One
will finally land on verizon next month
according to a leaked release schedule
list which was sent anonymously to the
site phoneArena now we still don't know
when the Moto X might launch on other
carriers or if it'll be available
unlocked now take this rumor with a
grain of salt but if we're lucky and it
pans out you could look just like Eric
Schmidt by next month give or take a few
billion dollars you're welcome next up
what would the rumor mill be without
SmartWatch speculations this week on
smart watch watch see what I did there
Microsoft has decided that the surface
team should be in charge of SmartWatch
production according to the verge which
cited people familiar with Microsoft's
plans now the sources say that
previously the Xbox team was tasked with
building the SmartWatch the device would
run on a modified version of Windows 8
that would allow for integration with
other windows devices an earlier report
from among tech says that the watch
might have six gigs of storage and
connectivity with LTE networks it might
even make your coffee in the morning
also this week rumors cropped up that
Apple is aggressively hiring for its i
watch team according to the Financial
Times which cited anonymous sources this
could mean that Apple has run into some
design engineering quirks that it just
can't solve on its own and need some
fast help this also suggests that the
SmartWatch unicorn won't make it to your
wrist so sometime next year next up Oh
ipad mini fan
according to a report from didja times a
next gen ipad mini with retina display
probably won't pop up until 2014
according to sources Apple needs to
build a stockpile of displays so that it
has enough supply to meet demand and
that could take a while and that's where
the report gets a little bit spotty I
mean duh it's from didja times but the
report does come a few weeks after
analysts pretty much said that Apple
won't release a retina mini till next
year people looking for a new iPad Mini
might not need to wait until next year
though didja time sources say that Apple
plans to launch an updated non-retina
version of its current tablet in the
second half of 2013 so maybe didja x is
onto something of course if you throw
enough darts at the ipad mini dart board
one is bound to stick onto something
eventually right what do you guys think
is the ipad mini going to have a Retina
Display will a budget non-retina version
of the tablet come out first don't
forget to vote and leave a comment and
I'll ask the cnet council what it thinks
the cnet Council is composed of five
editors who cast their votes anonymously
their opinions are not an endorsement by
Cena or CBS interactive obviously
because these are rumors folks and the
cnet councils verdict is a unanimous yes
they do think that the ipad mini with
retina display will come out in 2014 i
also asked them whether they think that
a non retina ipad mini is on its way and
the answers were a little bit mixed one
editor who answered yes says that
clearing out the non retina screen
warehouse before updating the entire
tablet sounds like a very Apple thing to
do that's our show everybody please
share your rumors that rumor has it at
cnet com or call us up 1 800 750 cnet
and tweet us and tune in next week for
more tech rumors
