performance or you're gonna get a whole
ton of extra features and abilities
spending $300 on a drip coffee machine
is a little bit extravagant even foolish
I can thankfully say that the October is
the brain 12 cup brewing system delivers
on not only one but two counts on this
side of the verse the brain is its
brewing mechanism it has a filter basket
right up top here which is pretty big
holds enough grounds for 12 cups of
coffee and essentially the water goes
straight from the craft down into the
base and up and into the brewing basket
but what's really wild about the Aqsa
Bristol brain 12 Cup is inside the base
is a scale and that scale enables the
machine to understand how much water is
working with so if you fill it up to 12
cups it will let you basically brew with
the full 12 cups or if you want you
could just adjust it and say oh I only
want 8 cups and I want the other 4 cups
to be used for tea or oatmeal or
whatever you want
the barista brain 12 cup is also an
exceptionally good coffee maker it meets
the requirements for the sca a the
Specialty Coffee Association of America
their guidelines for brewing the golden
cup of coffee it's actually the only 12
cup brewer that actually meets those
guidelines so that's pretty cool if you
definitely need to get your coffee right
away this is not the machine for you
this guy takes about 10 minutes or so to
heat up its entire grass worth of water
and then you have to actually wait as it
goes through the brewing process which
can take as long as three four even five
minutes depending on how much coffee are
brewing for more about this machine and
other coffee maker reviews be sure to
