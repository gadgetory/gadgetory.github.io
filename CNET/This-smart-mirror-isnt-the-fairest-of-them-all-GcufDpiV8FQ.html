is a Wi-Fi connected smart mirror that
imitates light settings so you can put
on makeup and PS it's four hundred
dollars let's say you work in an office
and want to make sure your makeup looks
good for your nine-to-five you can take
a selfie at your office with a simple
human AB and the mirror will create a
lighting scheme that imitates the life
from that selfie we tested the simple
human mirror as much as we could
we took some readings of the mirrors
lighting schemes such as daylight and
florescent settings and the simple human
imitates those situations pretty well we
also spent plenty of time putting on our
own makeup the lighting was great and it
was easy to select settings inside the
app but the mirror only magnifies one
time that's just not enough for detail
work but we're makeup amateurs and this
is a product for the pros so we gave it
to a makeup artist and a makeup
enthusiast to get their take on this
smart mirror
bad lighting like if you do your makeup
mad lighting you may as well not have
done it I don't think women need to know
anything about lighting to do their
makeup I think they need to know about
their makeup the lighting is really good
um I wish it had a magnifier I think
magnification is key I think it needs
some magnification just for that detail
work if this were my primary mirror I
would still have to have a new larger
one like stash in a drawer or a lot of
counter space you know I do like is the
little side mirrors only a kitchen you
can see from the angles
my only concern too is like doing your
makeup for like fluorescent lighting for
an office which is never flattering for
anyone and then you walk out into the
real world to go get your coffee in the
morning get Starbucks it's not going to
translate well 400 always even if I just
had a lot of money laying around is a
pretty steep price for admission I mean
if you if you don't know how to like
make sure your map your everything's
blended there's no this is not going to
do anything we all agree that this is a
good mirror that does deliver the custom
lighting at promises but for $400 this
isn't a smart purchase for the casual
makeup wearer or even the pros
especially without good magnification</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
