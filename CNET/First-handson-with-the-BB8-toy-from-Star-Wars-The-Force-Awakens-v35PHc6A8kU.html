droid in the Star Wars The Force awakens
trailer but it's already become an
instant fan favorite and now thanks to
the genius minds from Sparrow we have
one all to ourselves this is our
hands-on with bb-8 and i'm gonna bring
them to life with an app so like your
other products there's an app that's a
companion to actually control and
functionally yeah and of course we have
to start with the iconic music we like
to say it's about 90% Star Wars maybe
there's 10% zero in there the
playfulness you know and we're gonna
bring him to life if you kind of did I
see him kind of glow a little bit he's
come to life so I know I'm connected to
him because I can access the app now and
there's a number of different things I
can do with the app um the one that we
think people will probably start with is
always driving
okay so I've shown you you know how
obscura works I have to aim it so I'm
just basically taking that blue light
and I aimed it at me no no he knows I
know what direction is going in oh my
goodness and the way we thought about it
was we thought we thought you know we
need we need him not only to be drivable
but we need to emulate certain emotions
we need to be able to projecto so we
created the certain scenes so just first
sample or you know bb-8 a you okay with
these hot lights he's saying if you say
no no no but are you cool being on
camera so he likes that and it's you
know i mean the core is obviously we see
the sphere ball is that you know what do
you guys use to attach the head is it
magnets is that magic I mean what is it
accomodations it's the horse it's the
floor so of course it's the force and we
know that people are probably gonna
they're probably gonna buy them they're
gonna bring them home they're gonna try
to figure it out we're not gonna tell
you not to but you you know I'm not
gonna give we're not gonna give away all
our tricks I also wanted to ask you
there's more features than even just
controlling this that you know you have
on the box can you tell us some of the
other like cool stuff you added 10 Y can
show you some some stuff that we're
pretty proud of we created a holographic
messaging system
the modern incarnation of a classic
design the income you line up that with
it yeah it's the first we can do for you
so you're just gonna hold that up okay
so it's gonna be like this mm-hmm help
me bb-8 you're my only hope
okay it's also basically it's gonna
transmit that message over to bb-8
okay and it was what was that at my
acting chops okay pretty good just you
stuck it was very George Lucas yeah yes
yes so we that is so cool now there's
one thing um I don't know if this is in
the product or not but the box is
something about voice commands yes
okay bb-8 so now there's a menu of
things that I can say to it so I'm gonna
send him for look around what's the
