a look at the Lenovo ThinkPad x1 carbon
of course a sequel to last year's x1
carbon which was a sequel to the Year
befores original x1 lenovo says this is
the lightest 14 inch laptop on the
planet I'm inclined to agree it's a hair
over three pounds if you get the
optional touch screen which you should
it's a hair under three pounds if you
don't one of the great upgrades this
year is an optional 2560 by 1440 screen
the same sort of better than HD screen
that you see on something like the
MacBook Pro with Retina display or the
Toshiba cure book or even lenovo zone
IdeaPad yoga2pro
there are two other things that make
this new version notable one they've
upgraded the touchpad so that even
though you still have that Lenovo
TrackPoint in the middle you don't have
the big buttons on top of the touchpad
anymore all the buttons top and bottom
are just sort of built-in click pad
style and they've made a couple of
changes to the keyboard I still love the
Lenovo keyboard best in the business
feel wise but they took the backspace
key and kind of made it split a space
with the Delete key I found it very
distracting and over here the caps lock
is now a home and Enki good luck finding
those if you're trying to touch type and
navigate your way around a page possibly
the most notable new thing is what they
call an adaptive keyboard which is
really just this trip up here that
replaces the function key row it's
backlit it has about four different
modes and depending on what app that you
open whether it's a web browser or Skype
or an office document you'll actually
get a different row of functions and
that's actually kind of a cool idea and
it works well in the application that
works with I'd love to see a future
version maybe letting you let's say
customize your perfect function key row
and tie it to a specific app but they
don't have that yet of course all this
does not come cheap this is the premium
end of the ThinkPad line starts to about
1,400 bucks goes up to 2,000 I'll get a
good in the middle about 1679 build it
has a core i5 8 gigs a Ram 128 gig hard
drive and most importantly that upgraded
2560 by 1440 touchscreen which i think
is really the big selling point here I'm
Dan Ackerman and that is the Lenovo
ThinkPad x1 carbon
