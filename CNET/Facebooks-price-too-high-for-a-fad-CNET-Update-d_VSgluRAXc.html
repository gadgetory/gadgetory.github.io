dark and catch pokemon in your living
room I'm Bridget Carey and this is your
cnet update everyone's watching Facebook
as it prepares to go public on the
Nasdaq this week values for its initial
public offering are in the 34 to 38
dollar range which at the high end would
make Facebook worth more than a hundred
billion dollars but we'll find out
Thursday where the actual stock price
will be after that it's all up to the
markets but it's worth knowing that half
of americans surveyed by the AP and CNBC
said the asking price of the stock is
too high and that Facebook is just a
passing fad twitter has begun sending
out a weekly email digest of the top
tweets and stories relevant to who you
follow which pretty much is only helpful
if you don't use Twitter and everyone is
automatically enrolled in the mailings
so you have to manually opt out and spam
amazon is planning to release an eating
kindle with a front lit screen in july

out with its glow light nook at the end
of April and here's something that'll
make you laugh next season CBS will air
a sitcom about two friends from a small
town who moved to LA to work at Groupon

guess they wanted to use that social
tech company jargon it'll start the
nerdy mclovin from superbad and playing
the cool friend as the guy who's been in
several Disney movies no word if Groupon
will be involved in creating the show

Service is giving a two percent discount
on postage when a QR code is on a card
letter or envelope the post office is
hoping this will encourage businesses to
send more mail and to show how snail
mail can engage customers last week we
reported that the chief of the foxconn
factory said the facility is preparing
to manufacture Apple televisions yeah
