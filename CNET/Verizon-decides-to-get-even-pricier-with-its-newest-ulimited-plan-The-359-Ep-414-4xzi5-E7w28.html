Alfred hang verizon's out with a new a
limited plan and it's even more
expensive it comes with perks like more
high-speed data and international passes
but bucks a trend of carriers
introducing cheaper plans so and frankly
I kind of miss the days when a limited
was just limited it's now above and
limited yeah that will never happen
again I think once they realize they can
milk as much money out of you as they
wanted it was yeah they've now broken
things out like HD video mobile hotspot
capabilities whether or not you get
these international data passes they've
even thrown in cloud services for this
really expensive plan which again it's
called above the limited it starts at
$95 for one line but goes down as low as
$60 for four lines I think a big
question that some people that don't
know all the aspects of the deal might
have is like does this have anything to
do with net neutrality not I mean
tangentially I guess well right now it's
the answer would be no I think down the
line there might be some effect but the
fact that it is an unlimited plan you
are technically getting a limited data
but they've kind of slice and dice the
definition it's a little bit dated but
it's not necessary high-speed data all
the time so now that Verizon is kind of
cross this line do you think other like
telecoms or essentially say oh hey we
can do that too we should probably get
more money I'm sorry to see a little bit
of it I mean 18t and t-mobile have
slightly different tiers and options
based on again like HD video if you want
to watch high quality video you've got
pay extra sprint just launched a $15
lumen plan that strips out all the perks
it's basically just unlimited data so
there are there you can see the
carrier's are experimenting with
different models all right Alfred you
got an exclusive look at how uber fights
fraud
tell me more about this ok so there's
been a lot of scam attempts for uber
like they say they fight them off about
every day or so well and it usually
revolves around a GPS spoofing apps you
can basically tell like your phone that
you're actually in one place when you're
not and then scammers who use like fake
or stolen credit card numbers they will
use that to basically give themselves
money on uber that way and they'll also
use that to game uber so uber has these
incentive programs where like if you do
120
five rides in one day they'll give you
an extra $500 how does this I were to
fight I mean where's yeah yeah they've
been using machine learning now it's a
kind of analyze like okay so these are
all the trips that are on this route if
you notice they're all at this altitude
hmm where as if it's from a GPS spoofer
this altitude is insane like they're
like over the place they're like 200
feet up in the air and unless these are
the new flying cars flying cars yeah
we've all been expecting it's just like
okay this is probably a scam so they've
they've been been able to work ways out
like using machine learning to block
them now got it and really this I mean
this is a good thing because some of
these scams really hurt the drivers
themselves right not just uber oh yeah
and it they it hurts the drivers where
they end up having to pay for it because
the credit card companies will say like
hey this was a stolen credit card
right right us the money back but if
they report it to her than uber ends up
paying for it so they don't lose that
much money if they report it okay but
uber like loses like three times in this
scenario because pay the driver then
they have to pay the credit card company
and then like they still have fallen
victim to the scam that they don't know
where it's like coming from alright
let's talk about comcast the nation's
largest cable provider officially
offered its deal it's a sixty five
billion dollar bit in cash to buy Fox
now Kim mine Disney already has a deal
with Fox on the table for fifty two
point five billion and in stock this is
obviously a much richer offer but yeah
as we as we said yesterday this kind of
takes away from the idea of that
Avengers x-men reunion I didn't know you
were allowed to do that I didn't know
you were allowed to be in talks for like
billions of dollars and like no you can
you can come in you can stake it again
this is unsolicited bit it's not like
Fox asked for this and come gas even
offered to cover roughly four billion
dollars in breakup fees if they were to
basically switch partners oh my god
comcast sounds very Thursday about
lastly Brazil is in the news thinks was
scooped from our own Steven Shanklin he
reported that the Firefox makers are
working on a web browser that you can
control with your voice called Scout I
mean that sounds pretty cool I really
would have to check that out but if it
gets really popular I feel like I'm just
gonna go to people's houses like
cnet.com go to cnet.com read everything
alright with that from when these
stories should sound CNET or murder
Chang I'm Alfred Eng actually
all right this music just got really
creepy
welcome to the scary zone
this is the true 359 after-hours I don't
know why it lines up like that so I'm
Stewart I was totally on it by the way
our timer never we forgot to turn on the
timer actually wasn't on at all wait
you've been using a timer yeah I'm more
like a bird where I have an internal
timer where I did well your internal
timer is always wrong then so I think
our audience just wants to hear me talk
more so that is not the case it is
definitely not the case anyways it is
time as always to go ahead and have me
jump into the chat yeah and see what
good comments and questions y'all have
listen topics at hand what's that listen
to the people Brian listen to the people
the people's voice a way who was that
was that uh what wrestler was that now
you're thinking about the rock Dwayne
Johnson here's the People's Champ
People's Champ there we go
a question from Ethan Shafer do you
think Amazon is starting to transition
into the mobile phone world I'm going
down that path
hey hit it before it didn't work out so
well the old fire phone I still keep
trying to get Ben to to talk to bring up
the idea of Amazon resurrecting the fire
phone but he's not budding no look it's
at this point they do have a program to
sell cheap phones made by other
companies there's a good Amazon phone
program but yeah in terms of them making
their own hardware it seems unlikely I
know there are some rumors about a low
low cost phone like Amazon ice like fire
nice but that never really came to
fruition maybe it's still in the works
we don't really know but as for now I
would say Amazon is probably staying
away from from phones given how terrible
the fire yes if anything they would
probably just try to get a LexA and like
as many phones as they can yeah like
yeah also providing the software then
like making the hardware themselves
totally agree I think they are
absolutely there their mission is to get
a LexA into everything to really expand
this ecosystem and really getting it on
your phone that's where you spend most
your time is critical to Amazon let's
take another question from Ethan Shafer
have you heard about the t-mobile and
Sprint merger if so you think that's
going to affect how do you think it's
going to affect sprinting Isabel yeah
no yeah that we are well aware of it
I've been covering this potential murder
for seemingly the last decade well not
decade the last four or five years at
least it's finally happening and given
what's happened with 18 Time Warner I
think t-mobile and Sprint are feeling
pretty good about themselves in terms of
the prospects of that deal getting
approved in terms of what this might
mean for Sprint users at least in the
near term even after the deal is
completed I think you're gonna remain on
your service some of those crazy deals
might go away I know there's there's
that $15 limited data plan right now
that's definitely not gonna be around
over time you're gonna see it a gradual
transition as people move over to the
t-mobile network that's usually what
happens in these acquisitions because
they've got two incompatible networks
right now one is GSM LTE that's t-mobile
the other ones CDMA LT that's Sprint
they don't work together so eventually
they've got to move all those customers
over whether through free phone offers
or whatever just to make sure everyone's
on one network down the line I would say
presumably the service would be better
this is a combined company with better
wireless spectrum assets so
theoretically that can make for a better
service down the line let's take one
more from oh who we gonna talk to this
time here's one from APEC first of all
happy birthday APEC with Comcast bidding
for Fox and Disney wanting it to Ken Fox
choose who they want and decide to just
screw the other bidding company over I
think they would get a choice ultimately
it would be the board making this
decision and and of course they still
need to shareholder approval that's
ultimately who will decide who actually
who they choose to go with and right now
it just seems like Comcast has a better
deal it's sixty five billion dollars in
cash as opposed to fifty two point five
billion in Disney stock you always want
to take the cash is there is there a
chance of that like maybe they could
sell off like all the Marvel properties
to Disney and then like just split up
the family I'm pretty sure if I'm
Comcast I'm gonna insist that those yeah
those x-men characters go with with Fox
you know there's a chance that Disney
comes back and ups the the offers so
there there's definitely people are
looking at a potential bidding war here
what if comcast is just doing like a
very like bro thing for Fox where it's
like we know that Disney will like bid
more for this so we'll just like throw
this like bid it I'm pretty sure you
don't throw on a 65 billion dollar offer
unless you mean it
yeah that would be a heck of a break
okay guys look we can get you more money
for this deal just hang back all right
we had to kind of cut the Firefox story
short because it's right at tail in
there we ran out of time yeah but let's
expand on it a little bit because Josh
Boyd uh first and foremost says why
would we need a voice-controlled browser
that sounds terrible so there are all
kinds of accessibility reasons of so
they're folks who who can't use their
hands who do require some sort of like
plugging noun so just a default voice
control web browser
I think that's useful for not just
accessibility reasons but even if I'm
walking down the street and having you
know this browser read my story to me or
like a Wall Street Journal story on your
time story to me as I'm walking down the
street just having that be the default
feature that's that's kind of cool I
think voice-based like I don't know
being online like with your voice is
like that I do think that's gonna be
like the next stage of like where we're
going yeah I mean you know if a Google
home assistant I see it now yeah echoes
in the Google homes the computer and
your browser seems like a natural like
evolution of it absolutely I like from
Alex Mitchell what if fox bought fox and
kept it out of the other twos hands I'm
you from the future
Fox Men days of futures piece here to
make you money so what about this
question does Fox have the option to
deny both willed obviously they still
keep control right I mean well at this
point you know companies have to act on
the the benefit or the sorry in the best
interest of shareholders and walking
away from two really rich deals like
that is pretty much impossible they
would immediately trigger a lawsuits and
litigation and frankly no one wants to
walk away from that I think they're at
this point trying to milk the best offer
possible
let's take one from Mike Shaw won't Siri
and Google assistant be able to control
browsers via voice soon anyways is
Mozilla project really necessary I mean
that's a great question point not
exactly so like you can obviously tell
serially like go to this go to you know
google.com or something like that but
you can't have it like read the article
back to you you can't be like click on
this page like on like click on the
first link on this article or something
like that like it I mean I think down
the line Apple might be able to
introduce some of these features but it
would sort of be like a bolt-on feature
yeah opposed to Mozilla working on a
browser that is like front and center
that's the that's the reason for its
existence is for voice control is the
ability to use this thing without
without hands without physical controls
I guess the difference is like with the
other voice assistance that exists
currently it's like assisting you like
we'll take you to this page but like for
Mozilla it's like this is the browser
like you use this to do things that you
would normally do like with your mouse
and like exactly board from Hunter
Monzon so lyft and uber should use a way
to confirm hang on let me start that one
again
so lyft and uber maybe should use a way
to confirm all credit-card GPS in the
smart card add a GPS or bring up a
notification in uber and then the tech
for you to allow this transaction I'm
not really sure what he's going out with
that um I I think the like
recommendation is to basically like know
when something is a stolen credit card
or like have some kind of like
authentication process like hey like you
know if somebody charges you send like
that person's card and email like
basically saying like hey your chart
you're like are you taking this ride or
something like right and that's but
there are some there features like that
but it's more up to the individual yeah
customer that's very tricky though
because they're not setting they're not
doing it with your account though so
like how will they know who to email
based off just a just a credit card
number I mean there's so there are
features on your credit but you can sign
up for for a large in your mobile alerts
if yeah you make a charge but that again
is sort of up to the individual yeah and
so that's very tricky for uber because I
you credit card transactions are just
credit card transactions like if I don't
check between no they don't think yeah
they don't know if they're stolen or
anything like that so that's that's like
the trickier part and that's not
something exclusive to like uber or lyft
yeah every industry like faces that
issue well that's the thing like if
especially if the card is in reported
stolen yeah yeah there's no real way for
yeah that's the other thing to like
because these cards are like these
stolen numbers are usually sold in bulk
online like that's like the bigger issue
with it right and so I think that's why
it's important for this like to have
these kind of behavioral model yeah
track like specific actions that tell
her this is fraud yeah another good one
from Ethan could Amazon partner with the
voice browser allowing Alexa to be the
key AI involved Oh with Mozilla that's
that's a great question I don't know
yeah I mean I think that would be the
big play here yeah for them but I also
think that in the same way that like
Google pays like Mozilla like millions
to be the default browser on Firefox
yeah they're gonna probably have to pay
like a lot of money to like have their
voice integration into Amazon with
Mozilla yeah maybe yeah or like Google
my that's kind of weird to see like like
I have to ask Alexa or Google to bring
up a browser and then have to talk to
Scout I guess to ask for the content of
the page just a little
I feel like now you're just talking to
like a whole bunch of different
assistants it's awkward yeah we have a
comment from Alex Mitchell says I want
to hear from my excited about smash guy
I think he's talking about you over a
Roger this is your man no Alfred please
what is the question
let's just hear me he wants you to gush
about smash more oh well I'm just the
fact that you gush about yeah so gush
away I mean I'm going to go play it
later today at the Nintendo World yes I
am letting him go to play video games
this is very important this is
give me the Paula Terry you might as
well I mean I don't know I'm still
thinking about it's very interesting
yeah yeah I mean you haven't really
played it so it's kind of hard to yeah
yeah well I think I've been watching a
ton of gameplay footage
of it because there there's this guy
video game boot camp or something VG BC
and the guy that hosts his name's gamer
yeah but he he's ID three now and he's
been just recording one-on-one matches
where like people that have the
opportunity to go up sorry that's right
I just dropped my phone they're so mad
about it but like instead of like
actually fighting each other they're
just they're like testing out different
mechanics like oh she owed exactly when
I do this and I want to see if I can do
it so instead of actually having fun
with a game they're doing like extremely
dirty to watch I mean it's like it's fun
to find out like all you can about the
game words out yeah this is like
educational yeah so like there's a few
things that I know about it already
anyway yeah there's somebody took like
framerate data where like there's
landing lag for like 15 frames whereas
in super smash brothers melee the
landing lag when you did like a certain
move was only like 10 frames which means
that you get punished more if you like
mess up that move that it's Wow yeah
this is I'd say III was watching some e3
footage yesterday I was watching the the
spider-man playthrough on the ps4 yeah
this this looks like it's probably gonna
be the best spider-man game since
spider-man 2
spider-man 3 was a complete ripoff but
yeah this looks pretty fun put
spider-man in smash so wait
would the old memes at play and you
being the meme Lord and all Alfred does
this mean that we now have to use the
phrase confirmed for ultimate while
everyone is in it now literally every
new character will be every other
character will have to be a new
character so yeah I guess a derp but
confirmed for brawl was so much more fun
to say yeah I mean but the thing is is
that like everybody is confirmed so I
don't really know what you you can do
now oh there's a new character yeah you
want to confirm any character that they
add in would have to be a new character
though they say what at this point is
there a dream character you'd won Shrek
put Shrek in the game right also
everyone really wants waluigi that's
like well he's not in it no he's an
assist trophy oh right and like he was
in brawl as well that is
surprisingly see I think that's kind of
a crime when you have Wario as well and
even green Mario but no while Luigi yeah
they even put in Daisy who the hell
cares know that exactly like like
Daisy's in it my Luigi's not in I mean I
get the argument we're like okay well if
we let wha Luigi in then what are we
gonna let Berto into but like come on
Berto is in tennis
yeah I'm just yeah while luigi is in
tennis they created waluigi from mario
tennis cuz Wario needed a partner in 64
it made perfect sense yeah
this is like this is what I'm gonna do
from now on Rogers I'm just going to be
Alfred oh my god Wow while our Gees
incredibly he deserves much more than
being left out all right let's get all
right one more serious question Troy
Road yeah Josh Boyd asks how does GPS
spoofing actually benefit people
frauding uber I guess we need a few more
details yeah alright so I explained this
yesterday to my friends cuz they're like
why are they just spending money on uber
rides so when you have a stolen credit
card
you can't like just go to an ATM and
like take money out of it or anything
like that
I mean most of the times because you
only have the number so people in Lund
like the dark web community they call
them like carter's because it's called
carding they try to find all these
different ways that they can make money
off of the stolen credit cards cuz all
you really want is cash out of it so
they'll get these stolen credit card
numbers and they'll do things like
they'll buy like a ton of ps4s or
something like that and then they'll
sell it online yeah to get cash that way
yeah so they figure out a quick way to
do it is to do it through like rod share
apps where you are the driver and then
the stolen card is the passenger so they
give themselves the money right but like
obviously they're not gonna like you
know do the drives themselves do so like
the way they do it instead is they use
the GPS spoofing apps on both phones so
it makes it look like the driver yeah
and then they use the stolen credit
cards to pay themselves uber takes like
a 20% cut of it or like how yeah I think
they take that much but then they still
get like the like the 80% of like this
yep money that they stole in the first
place so they use the spoofing apps to
basically do all this stuff without ever
having to go anywhere it would track
down these scammers through the account
that they serve to become a driver but
they
the money out before they were takes the
money back and then once there they
don't care that they're banned they can
just make another make a new kid yeah
wow I didn't realize was that easy I
thought there was a screening process
for yes so there was a guide on it at
one point on like how to pull off this
game unlike the dark web and they said
like you're supposed to like go in and
like do the screening thing and but
apparently it's like so easy that like
anyone like they don't really check that
much yeah it's crazy and then like I
said there's other they also like scam
like ubers incentive programs so like if
you do like a hundred twenty-five trips
a day they'll give you an extra five
hundred dollar bonus right that's a lot
of trips in a day but like yeah you know
you like but if you're not driving all
that much if you're just tapping on your
screen that's like an extra five hundred
dollars just for like just for like on
top of what you're already stealing Wow
so wait well how did they screw it up so
bad so that the algorithm makes it look
like they're flying that's what I want
yeah or is that part of it is that
supposed to be that way yeah that's it's
not supposed to be that way so GPS like
spoofing apps are like pretty decent
like people use them to cheat Pokemon go
all the time like when they're not like
they don't want to keep going around so
they just make their phone say like oh
I'm at this location that's just basic
VPN yeah but the thing is is that like
while they're good at adjusting your
latitude and longitude they're not that
good at like adjusting your altitude I'm
like and that's how they kind of figured
it out where like because like when
you're driving or when you're going in
and we're obviously the altitude always
changes like hills and different roads
and stuff like that the GPS spoofing
apps are like are not that advanced to
know like Oh on this street it's this
altitude and then on that street it's
like lower so they just have like one
steady altitude all the time for some
reason it's always in the sky so there
was like oh like that's how we know
these are the scam rides
I think it's funny it just makes me
think of remember the movie office space
where they try to scam like fractions of
a penny on the dollar kind of thing
transactions Superman super misses
foreskin yeah yeah Michael Scott
Superman three three three
or was quest for peace I'm sorry that
had some we will not speak of it again
Roger which one quest for peace quest
for peace
I liked it anyways it's a plot of
Superman three and then they go to check
the balance in the morning and it's just
like yeah oh crap and he's taken like a
millions of dollars from the company fun
I feel like that that's cuz it basically
this rumor is a sequel to that yeah
pretty much
except it's but it's effective yeah
they've they've caught it that's not
nearly as fun we are just about out of
time and let's just get meta for a
second math - math you'd address if I
was wondering what does the CNET gang do
on Fridays if it's not clear we play
smash well you two plays smash I don't I
don't play smash we'll get you there we
are out of time we are out a week and
it's great to be back everybody thanks
again for being patient with us during
that a tumultuous scheduling stuff that
we've been dealing with lately but we're
back yeah you know my leg will be we'll
be back on Monday with a more consistent
schedule on camera I'm sure some curse
will happen yeah we've been we've had a
run of bad luck so Thames Kevin Durant
I'll blame Kevin Durant everything is
Kevin Durant's fault alright our podcast
is available in iTunes tune in stitcher
SoundCloud Feedburner
