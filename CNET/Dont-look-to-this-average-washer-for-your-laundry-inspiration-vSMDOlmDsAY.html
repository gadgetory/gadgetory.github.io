washing machine the ideal is that you
find a model that has some defining
characteristic something that goes above
and beyond maybe performance design
features usability something that sets
it apart
unfortunately this nine hundred and
fifty dollar Kenmore top load washer
behind me doesn't fit the bill in terms
of design it looks fine but the digital
display is really small so in terms of
seeing the readout that tells you how
much time is remaining on your wash
cycle not gonna happen
it also doesn't do very well in terms of
performance it wasn't terrible it wasn't
great just kind of middle-of-the-road
boring and there are competitors out
there that definitely do a lot better
and also in terms of features I would
expect this 950 dollar washer to do a
lot more it does have a steam function
but in terms of cubic foot capacity I
wasn't impressed it has a 4.8 cubic foot
capacity which is kind of mid-range and
it won't fit a ton of clothes but it's
not really compact either but other
models offer much larger capacities so
that you can fit a family sized load of
laundry all in all while this kenmore
washer didn't fail outright it didn't
excel in any categories either and that
just isn't enough to justify its 950
dollar price</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
