I'm cnet's car s toboi joined by Shara
tip cancino rider and char we're talking
about apples earnings report came out
for the holiday quarter a lot of big
numbers to talk about but also a very
special announcement snuck in there tell
us about that first yeah we were all
absolutely surprised Tim Cook today said
that the Apple watch is going to start
shipping in April previously they only
said early 2015 and people had been
really curious whether was going to be
march april februari even typically they
don't make these kind of announcements
on earnings call so it was a really big
surprise absolutely well good have
something concrete yeah and the call
itself I mean their earnings themselves
they really kind of blue expectations
out of the water didn't they yeah it was
a huge quarter for Apple it was the
biggest in their entire history yeah
iphone was just far and away a huge huge
huge product for them this quarter and
we're thinking the iphone 6 itself the
new 1i said iphone 6 for sure Tim Cook
said that all of the iphones actually
sold well including you know the older
5s 5c but it's really the iphone 6 and
that smaller iPhone 6 that really push
them over the top here and if the sales
here in the US that's driving it
internationally do we know a breakdown
yeah the US is still the main market for
the iPhone but China is really closing
in on them overall they sold 70 4.5
million iPhones switches you know about
8 million more that analysts were
expecting Wow are there any products
that are not doing quite as well as the
iphone yeah we still have kind of the
iPad as the laggard it's been doing
pretty poorly for the past four quarters
and Tim Cook basically said that you
know they see longer-term opportunities
for this it's going to keep growing but
you know eventually when the next couple
quarters are still going to be kind of
down quarters for the ipad but a lot of
that is just the replacement cycle
people just don't get new pipe as or
tablet yeah you know that they were
saying that it's kind of in between a
computer and a phone the fact that i
watch do know any more details about
pricing specific ship dates yeah we know
nothing i know i mean they haven't
released any details beyond what they
talked about at the event in September
you know so it still starts at 349
probably goes up a lot from there we
talked a little bit you know they said
they have a lot of developers on board
and you know if you
have been public and talking about what
they're doing but so far still not a lot
of details we're waiting for that
information we just know that April will
be a big month another big month for
Apple yeah for sure shower tip kid I'm
