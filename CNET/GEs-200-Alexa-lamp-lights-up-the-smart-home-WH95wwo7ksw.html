Alexa devices this year and the newest
is right here an eye catching a LexA
powered lamp from GE called saw the
price 200 bucks
now a GE really did here was to take the
familiar blue light ring from the top of
the Amazon echo and echo dot and then
expanded into this full-size kind of
ostentatious looking desk lamp you can
adjust the brightness of the lamp by
using these touch controls on the base
or you can open up the C by GE app on
your Android or iOS device and also
adjust the color temperature or turn on
this clock display that lights up with
the red and blue light to tell you what
time it is so right now it's about a
quarter past twelve aside from that it
works just like an Amazon echo you wake
it up by saying Alexa then you give it a
question or command it's the same Alexa
with all the same smart skills and music
plus an extra trick or two my favorite
is that it'll give you a visual
countdown whenever you set a timer
Sall can't call other Alexa devices
though for that you'll need to use the
Alexa app or one of Amazon's own
speakers the echo the echo dot or the
echo show there's a better call Saul
joke to be made there but I can't think
of it another limitation it doesn't
include Amazon's ESP feature which makes
it so that only the Alexa device that's
closest to you responds to your command
Amazon seems to be keeping that feature
to itself and not sharing it with third
party devices like these that's a shame
because ESP is super important if you
want to put Alexa in every room of your
house I also wish the design were a
little bit more refined it's a good
looking lamp but it feels a bit
plasticky to me a more premium build
would have gone a long way towards
justifying that steep $200 price tag all
of that said I really can't help but
like this thing and I like the GE took a
risk with an eyebrow raising design if
you're looking for an extra Alexa gadget
for your office or for your bedroom and
you're willing to splurge on something
unique Saul certainly fits the bill</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
