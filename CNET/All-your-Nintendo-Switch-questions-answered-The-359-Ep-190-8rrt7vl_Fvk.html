seventh it's time for an earlier edition
of the 359 podcast episode 190 and today
we have Alfred Inge and Roger Cheng and
I'm fired oh man nice that's right I'm
pretty forgettable I get it good sorry
guys I got distracted first interesting
is what happens when we start early I
know throws everything off all 20
minutes Ivan copy either so we've got a
great show it is all about the Nintendo
switch today we've got our special guest
Scott Steiner a lot of time what the
switch is gonna give us in his
impressions thoughts whether or not the
thing is even worth buying so I'll just
get it going if you have any questions
leave in the comments section and Scott
will answer them all yeah we yes
anything in about three minutes 59
seconds and ask anything okay that's
scary ama AMA we're just asking for
trouble yeah I know ok now I i I'm is
serious i've been playing this thing for
like two weeks so yeah and i played a
lot of nintendo hardware to show you
heard scott bring it on bring it on here
we go we're gonna get this podcast
recorded put your comments and questions
and trolling and all you want in the
chat we'll be back in three minutes and
59 seconds from 32
welcome to the 359 when we talk about
the top tech news of the day and all the
little crap with wanna throw in I'm
Roger Cheng I'm Alfred Aang and what
does his special guest Scott Stein who
spent an extensive number amount of time
with a Nintendo switch yes before that
Alfred you got some numbers on how well
the switch is done yes so Nintendo of
Europe is reporting that it's got the
largest launch weekend ever you know
beating out the wii which was you know a
hit for nintendo sure and then in japan
not so much so so in its first two days
it's sold about a three hundred and
thirteen thousand copies or units of the
switch whereas the we had about 370,000
and it's a first okay still often do see
a start ee you alright so on to the
switch scott is this going to be like
the hot selling wii or it going to be
like the disappointing wii u I'm holy
wood right now and I'm thinking about it
as I hold in my left hand I think it's
in between and clearly it's got a lot
more heat than the wii u people are
really talking about it I on the other
hand I think the we had it was kind of
like avatar Titanic I feel like it was
like it just kept going and going ago
absolutely and z total female yeah you
just kept buying in and buying it and
wii sports kept going so the question
really is is the novelty or the interest
will keep growing through right now it's
a really soft launch i think in terms of
the number of games it's the holiday
when when the mario game arrives when
you've got all that does it does it
become a huge seller do they have enough
in stock i think it's like not till the
end of the year do we really know that
question because like how many people
are in buying consoles in the middle of
the summer right well I mean look for
folks who are interested in buying it
now though like is el de enough to
justify the purchase or is it is the the
breadth of games that's available right
now good enough for you yeah I mean
Zelda is fantastic we all know that and
what if you don't know that it's
fantastic I think it lives up to all of
the accolades I think it's game design I
think it's one most exciting game since
Mario 64 Wow and it's gigantic but you
could also get it for the wii u the
questions do you have a wii u i don't
know if i don't know if you have a wii u
i do not yeah i think odds are you
probably don't but is it worth Spang all
that for it i mean if you get that one
game i look back to like the n64 only
had two games when it came out pilot
wings
and mario 64 really I looked this up
classics damn not too crazy ly two games
um but you know it was mario 64 and it
was great so if you have a game that you
could play for a hundred hours plus okay
maybe that justifies and holds you over
for a long time and there are a couple
other games I still feel like I wouldn't
recommend it to most people it kind of
falls to me and this may sound like a
real drop down I put in the Apple watch
category in the sense that I would know
that you can't wear it though Apple
watch earned its way to I think being
the best smart watch out there right now
of course a lot of others have fallen
off I think it's it it's got a lot of
interesting things that a lot of people
who like them I wouldn't necessarily go
out there and say get an Apple watch
alright so it's not necessary i don't
think the switch is necessary i don't
think it's earned its way yet it's
interesting best and worst thing about
this thing let's switch I think the best
thing is it is the proposition really
works between the the portable and the
console ok you know so that's really
cool worst thing is probably also that
in a way because it sounds weird but
sometimes is everything I've been
thinking out sometimes it feels too big
sometimes it feels too small and I'm
kind of weighing this out like you know
it's it's a really big hand held but
also it's a portable console but as the
console got too many things that don't
really feel as comfortable as a regular
big console like those controllers and
also obviously the game selection which
you want to be bigger it is early days
but I the problem really is to me the
virtual console no no retro games no NES
games and no way to do anything with
your old content other Nintendo consoles
you could get at least take wii games or
something all right oh that's pretty
much all the time we've got that was a
lot that was a lot to process bottom
line yes or no would you buy this thing
would you tell someone bite this thing i
would buy it right now because i was by
a new tech but if you're really curious
about it you could wait alright for more
of these stories you cuz i dont seen it
I'm Roger Tsien I'm Alfred hang I'm
Scott Stein thanks for listening
alright we have some good questions
brewing up in the channel right all
right and uh get ready Scott because
they're all coming out for a night I
just gonna go Chum the corner here we go
that's not a weird some coffee some
french roast with no sugar okay I'll
cool story it's bitter like a switch
cartridge oh oh nice what you did there
yeah all right Matthew wants to know
like a teabag no oh my god we should mix
which T switch to make some delicious
which team cartridge you want to switch
might be the only know that were a good
drink for the belong forgotten sadly for
gun open tap show oh my god that's good
wearing we make switched into this which
tr1 worry makes which T Matthew in the
chat once entered no he said I heard a
rumor at that the screen on the switch
scratches easily any truth to that are
we going to need screen protectors and
cases for the switch really good
question i have not done stretch testing
on the unit here now that's because i've
been trying to hold it delicately and
we've been wanting to do photos and
other things with it it concerns me that
the case that was sent along with the
switch review unit head screen
protectors so you know also there was no
mention of Gorilla Glass or anything
like that I mean not that nintendo's
initially going to say that but usually
if something really nice is in a feature
set for a system you'd mention it yeah
I'd be concerned about it definitely
it's a big screen and it feels more
fragile than any other Nintendo hardware
i can remember because the old systems
even his route to reaches for it I'm
like careful with it um yes he drops it
face down but it's uh yeah it's a big
expansive glass it is the others you can
fold up and then the days of the gameboy
and stuff who care those are like little
I don't know I didn't care about that
back then why didn't we care about I'd
scratch stream on ice cracking ice cream
yeah okay yeah we can I was also he too
young to care about the sort of thing
like really care about it i like when it
happened to be i got was sad but yeah
like I wasn't too concerned it adds
character if anything Oh God alright
next how annoying is the charging port
it's us bc i'd say oh us bc
I think it's great that as USBC however
I've noticed that it doesn't really
charge that rapidly even with the
included charger it's a bit of a slow
charger especially reviews to a phone
you know you have to charge it for
almost I feel like it feels like you
have to charge it for like I'm totally
guessing here is that into a full charge
test but you know it's it doesn't it
feels like you have the charger for
almost like half to two-thirds as long
as you were playing it plus when you're
playing it and keeping it plugged in
it's not really charging up that much
and there have been reports and we're
still testing this that if you use USB
see depending on the weather it's a USBC
or a USBC and on the other end it does
weird things sometimes it might charge
slowly sometimes the other device might
use it is a battery there were reports
about macbooks in it like the macbook
sucking up the switches battery because
the USBC can always do a little vampire
umbilical cord thing so um yeah it's
going to require some experimentation
but it's great that you just Nintendo is
that proprietary cables so yeah that's
awesome you just pick up another between
that and nes classic now we just maybe
need to refine the USBC technology yeah
I'm hoping it also means that they come
up with something that doesn't need a
doc like why don't could you just get a
cable with a splitter mm-hmm that
actually needs a dog well it has a doc
that comes with it but there's no like
but I'm not plugging regular yet I
didn't see the tear downs and may I just
being oblivious but they said there's no
real Hardware in there I wonder if the
doc is even necessary could you just
make a travel cable yeah or like Apple
really has kind of situation yeah cuz
it's us bc i mean you're just outputting
to hdmi and and then an extra USB and
extra USB ports now i've heard some
difficulties with charging like if
you're in gameplay and the unit might
not charge completely during that time
like it might peek out of like seventy
nine eighty percent is there any merit
to that i didn't see that okay but i
don't I find what I'm looking as I'm
playing right now I'm at half battery
life I tend to find the battery
throughout the days i'm charging or
trying to play into other things is not
in a fully charged state so it's
interesting question yeah I feel like
it's one of those batteries that I'm
kind of having to like babysit a bit
sure you know I'm not like oh great it's
fully charged awesome
it's a more like even if I'm putting in
the dock for a while I might take it out
and be like oh it's it feels like it's
about two-thirds do you think there's
ever going to be any aspect of like a
extra charge pack battery pack kind of
thing travel pack yeah I mean I hope
there are official ones that may be
attached a little bit easier or charged
in a better way I think it'll be a ton
of those because I don't think Nintendo
is really there's no I don't think
there's a licensing program I mean I
think just us bc things are going to
start emerging they're already a lot of
weird accessories for the switch this
might be one of the the largest
collections of weird accessory things
we've ever had for a game system because
between us bc and the number of ways to
play that you're a lot of people selling
stands and extra things and cases and
cables it's like an accessory sellers
dream um sure that's part of Nintendo's
master plan all right we got more than a
few people that want to hear what your
perspective is on the build how do you
feel about the actual build and how
solid it is good question and I want to
throw something that I don't have
consent someone's going to ask me but
I'm just going to put it in there that
is interesting to know and it relates to
build it feels solid the funny thing
about this with the joy cons connecting
here is that I'm not gonna say it feels
flimsy but you can feel a little bit of
like you'll give little give hmm this is
a little weird I think it's solid though
because there are metal rails on the
side but it kind of freaks me out on the
other hand it is nice that as far as a
replace ability thing when you realize
that these are slide-out replaceable
control things compare that to a veto or
3ds it means right that you could wear
these down and get new ones sure those
controls are pretty expensive right
they're expensive but the fact that you
could do that is a kind of repairability
thing which is nice you know we know the
pros roll it like what seventy eighty
dollars right the pro controller yeah
what does it take for replacement joy
cons or actually it's easy for both yes
we won okay yes it's expensive you don't
want to do it and some games that are
coming out like hair of your stuff kids
I know and get ready because games like
arms we don't have a lot of multiplayer
yep at arms the Robo boxing game yeah
once you have a second and one has each
other so have a second pair of joy cons
yeah that's when you go shopping for the
dollar ad on perhaps that's a lot of
money yeah but now no but it's a lot
money there's nobody well okay can I
also say yeah go ahead no just you know
you told me yesterday you've let your
son try this out yeah he's tried this
and he's tried to Nintendo classic and
it serves a surprising yes illusion
right what can I get to have one set
because I want to build quality a bit
more all right all right you gonna say
okay build quality I'll get to it for
one here of second because I'm just
gonna say it at some point kickstand
sucks but we I think if you've tried it
you know that it listen it listen it's a
it's it's fine most consoles don't have
kickstands right that's nice those
consoles you don't do em right where
listen and that's it's nice and a lot of
cases are going to have them however it
doesn't have adjustable angles that's
kind of annoying yet to have really flat
surface in a short amount of time
somebody's going to develop a open a
dress on yet or kickstand version like
the company yeah somebody's going to
come up with a better idea like a
resting box that is adjustable and all
that that'll come in this case here
actually is a kickstand there you go so
air is a stand is it so a lot of them
are gonna have just come with a case is
that no accessory or what's that you
have to buy it so yeah twenty bucks I'm
just going just out there no one's ever
gonna live up to the gamecube lunchbox
handle I know I don't wait I don't like
that the cartridge door is one of those
pull out doors with plastic I feel like
that's gonna fall off at some point and
while you're there we've got people in
the chat who want to see a cartridge
show us that tasty little nugget yeah
can I say one more thing about build
that you didn't know there's a vent at
the top this is the one thing that
freaks me out there's a big vent you
been what's a little weird is when
you're playing games on the handheld the
fan turns on and you can feel a little
hot air come out a little little little
warm breeze if you put your face close
don't be nice during the summer to never
seeing that actually it will actually be
nice in the winter yeah I've never seen
any and all the nose I'm not used to
Vince Oh God um imagine if it was made
by microsoft and they had the xbox fan
in there well it reminds me the surface
tablet where I'm where the surface had
the very subtle vent that winged the
surface pro and you could hear the fan
kick in so is that the cartridge that's
the cartridge really small and it is
looks like an SD card don't don't taste
it don't taste it many people house
officers put their tongue on that now I
know me too me oh okay just me Alfred
all over it Oh No non-tax I'm not a
monster it tastes bitter taste look it's
not like it's gonna burn your tongue off
it just go but it's gonna make your kids
spit it out dijanna garbage already
actually I'm not sure about that cuz I
just put my tongue on it and it's not
like it went oh my tongue burned up I'm
dead it is I just hate it I go oh I
think you've got enough journal taste
after like I just drank really bitter
 yeah I'm old right my tongue I've
got old tongue so all right let's slam
through a couple more questions Oh while
we're at it how what is the storage
capacity on one of those um don't drop
it on the coffee um storage capacity I
actually I don't know but I think it's
pretty high these are multi gig um I
mean Zelda's on there so I mean more
people saying that was about thirteen
gig or something like they didn't get
128 gigs on what car this size nowadays
so I can't that's the thing it's not
that exciting is 16 gigs is on an
assumption it's a fancy SD card and it
won't be long until somebody figures out
how to pirate one of those I don't know
the exact amount but this is basically
like yeah I think it's in the SD card
it's so funny that we've gone back to
cartridges that was at am I alone in
that yeah after we've been in discs for
so long antenna have been doing that for
a while with our handhelds nobody like
you said with like the 64 like that was
the last real cartridge system and but
the handheld's did it so it's like if
you're a 3 D CIR it depends on which way
you're coming exactly but like right if
you're a 3ds vida person you're like oh
this looks like a veto card in fact it
looks exactly like a veto card just
thicker but yes if you're a console
person you're like what we're back what
is this postage stamp victim now also
you could really obviously lose this so
don't you know keep those keep those
sixty dollars i need a handy bag like
that i mean a shocking they don't have
more local storage honest with you
it's yeah it has micro SD so at least
but it's like 32 gig on board which will
get filled up i think i have 25 gigs
free right now you know really weird and
I haven't experiment enough with this
are the stories and and in the element
with the switch which is that a local
storage for games for game saves that
it's on your switch once again it looks
like Nintendo has not made transfer of
that to other switches possible or or
you know family sharing like what
happens what happens when you buy a
second switch because I'm yeah I'm
traveling it's my handheld now my son
doesn't have a console he's gonna get
second wouldn't sure once your switch
breaks down and you can't transfer your
game saves well they have the same they
have the problem with the 3d I swear
it's like call Nintendo and they can
help it sounds like it'd be kind of a
mess but we I got to ring you back in
because going to run out of time surely
uh my son I was going to talk about to
but we can we do that for one sec well I
sure go ahead yeah or unless you another
but what was like at home yeah it was
like no I felt like I'd to be careful
with it around him it's not easy to
attach the controllers and attach that
stuff he actually really loved one to
switch and it made me rethink how I
talked about that because I think it is
a fun kids game it's silly I don't think
it's called a staying power but he liked
that he loved fast rmx racing was great
snipper clips a lot of good multiplayer
games but the funny thing is we also got
the NES classic yeah and he loves it and
when his friend came over they I said
which do you want to play he's at nes
classic and all he did was play megaman
2 they played castlevania to the
elastics man yeah and ER and i said why
did you pick that one he's like because
it's great and it's got a lot of great
games and so any amino right piece about
this so keeping out for it but any is
classic one and one my eight-year-old
over so a if you can get one still but
that's why I say it's okay to wait on
the switch so we got to talk about dead
pixels before we go recurring in the
chat yes yeah the glitch right no coming
full circle with the durability looks
like we're gonna have to give this thing
a torture test Nintendo's call someone
to get you some give some such a torture
test but the you know I dead pixels yeah
Nintendo is apparently said and gonna
fall put them away in here back but
about what the support is for that you
were saying that they're not
going to support placing over that dead
pixels are normal um those reports
coming out but I'm nice right like I
need to investigate this as well what
I'm noticing on I don't have dead pixels
on the unit i have i do have it's it's
not really crisp off angle you know i
think you get a was it edge lighting you
get um yeah it's not it's it's ok screen
it's not the greatest screen and my
expectations for screens it's not as
good as the screen on the vita even the
the non oled one on the vita slim it's
not as good as that one it's fine it's
um maybe you want better than fine um
and that yeah that goes back to other
concerns I mean I've I've concerns about
all that what happens with the with the
controllers and some people are having
problems with the left droidcon which I
didn't have but my Wi-Fi isn't up and
good on the switch yeah my range is I
only get about one bar on the on the
switch downstairs I have my router all
the way upstairs which is stupid but
none none of that's where the you know
that's what runs in but nothing else
downstairs has had problems and the
switch is showing very cut local reports
of that to that Wi-Fi is an issue for
some units and I that no will it have a
browser someday I don't think Nintendo
is interested in that stuff when when
alpha and I talked to them they
repeatedly said that that's not their
interesting games first it might also be
a duck as far as maybe how much the
system can push without feeling taxed
all right it's highly likely that
they're gonna have some kind of netflix
app on it though or some kind of
streaming thing but streaming they're
pursuing nothing so much yeah all right
before we go they should do at least kid
you know educational apps or if they've
some developers who can work on that but
that's a nap not just a standard browser
yeah your browser before we go what does
everybody think would be the answer like
what are the other console manufacturers
going to respond to this with we already
know that we're getting mega like tanks
on to the next PlayStation and Xbox
coming down the line but are there going
to be psp vita revivals are we going to
see another kind of wave of court
abilities taken I feel like there's the
markets
bifurcating and nintendo's have got this
mr. of niche that they're going after
nostalgia Millennials whatever Microsoft
and Sony have a lock on sore the gamer
market that's absolutely doubling down
on more powerful systems better graphics
the full home experience but do you
think this will reinvigorate the
portability I don't think so now
partially because most people already
play games it is red pyramid their phone
yeah right and that's a problem they're
going after a market that's already come
out there I think the people who live
and breathe right hendo Microsoft and
Sony I think they understand like going
into that mobile side things I mean it's
tough for it's a much tougher market now
than it was in Gears past room because
we spent so much time our phones on the
go right there's very little competition
Nintendo's trying something that's
unique I don't actually know if it'll
it'll all pan out if it goes beyond the
hardcore Nintendo fans but yeah it's
admirable that they're trying they're
acknowledging that like there needs to
be more of a mobile experience here but
I don't know if people actually call for
that or into that it's got yeah I think
you're right Roger I think it's a
question of like the veto often felt too
big to taking my bag on trips and it
sounded ridiculous but I remember I was
like I love the games on Vita I was a
big big fan of the games on Vita I
thought the indie stuff is great but
then it's like one more thing to carry
and it's like the kindle or anything
else I feel like they're looking at a
kindle or a surface tablet type
philosophy somewhere in the middle with
what the switch is and then indie
developers interesting that they're
getting on board or I think have feet in
both mobile and console doing middle
range games there's an interesting
market for that that it's hard you can
get them on pc but you it's not easy to
get them other places so and he's done a
great job on playstation with those
maybe that could be a market for this
but it might be too thin sliced yeah
like I think Microsoft may be pursuing
that with just through the surface
channel like oh yeah you know that they
may eventually they want everything to
be working on Windows 10 they say
everything is a Windows 10 device
including xbox so in some ways Microsoft
might be going there Apple might weirdly
be exploring that with the ipad down the
road I feel like they already kind of
our but like you had
extra controllers and you know and you
could connect and be kind of there I
don't know if they're going to do it but
it could but I feel like PlayStation
doesn't have yeah i don't i don't see it
happening and i don't think i think the
big consoles have a lot more horsepower
and they're also pursuing VR which
Nintendo can't do I don't know vieras
going to take off as much as we thought
but it's still going to be there and be
a maid na are 2 and B be factors Alfred
well I don't think it's fair to compare
to the switch to the Vita especially
since I think this which is slightly
more powerful and the Veda is and in the
same science Nintendo's kind of going
for both a home console and mobile
console whereas the Vita doesn't really
have that docking kind of capability I
think that's what Sony might be moving
toward in a way you know we're gonna
have these these consoles that you can
you know play games on your TV and play
games with your friends and things like
that while you're going on the move I do
think Nintendo you know I think people
will be buying into into the switch to
be honest just because of that ability
to play with your friends on the move
and then playing like at home like with
the dock right right yeah Nintendo one
thing to keep an eye on is in 10 doh
does often have its finger on hardware
trends and ideas they do a really good
job with that when the we came out
everyone went to Motion oh yeah and we
you came out as much of a failure was
they understood the idea of second
screen yes which became a factor through
tons of stuff over those years they saw
something and we're on to that so I
think our something in the air with this
their problem with that second screen
concept is like we already have those
second screens right yes our tablets our
phones all right we're ready I got we
have we got one more just because I've
been unintentionally ignoring this and
they're being very adamant about it do
how do you think developers will take
advantage of the power of the switch as
brief esha can because we're at it yeah
no I think that I think they could I
thought I said what Alfred said this
thing can go all the way up to console
level so it means that you could go
handheld console not worry about it kind
of like pcs I think it's almost like a
pc thing where you could Oh play game
from you bought on steam on a laptop
take it with you I think this is
exploring that for console and I think
that's a huge development and will be
good for developers
I can't wait to see more peripherals
come out on the unit make it look a
steering wheel oh and multiplayer is
that gauge if you know him as a game
developer was really excited about that
on Twitter and I was thinking that's a
sign that people are thinking about
those controls local multiplayer might
start evolving in different ways alright
we gotta wrap things up there if you
