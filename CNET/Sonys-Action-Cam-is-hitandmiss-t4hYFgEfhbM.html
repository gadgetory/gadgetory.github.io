a look at sony's first crack at making a
tiny pov camera the appropriately named
action cam as you can see it's a pretty
small device and it's very lightweight
and pretty slippery unfortunately but on
back you have a door with a big record
button and that slides open to reveal
the removable battery and memory card
slot and then on the bottom you have
various Jack's including one for an
external mic and one that lets you pop
the camera into a cradle with a 2.7 inch
screen so you can shoot with it like a
regular camcorder however because of the
curved body there's no way to stand the
camera up on its own and you'll need to
put it into its waterproof case to use
it with a tripod or one of the two
adhesive mounts that come with the
camera the front of the case is
removable perhaps a little too easily
removable and can be replaced with a
flat lens door for diving or one with
two holes in front for the stereo mics
the door it comes with blocks those mics
since it's waterproof and you really
can't use it without the door or I'll
just fall out and you can't start and
stop recording zeiler without pushing it
in basically for everything that's good
about the design there's something not
to like and the same can be said about
the video quality in general it's good
to very good but lens flare and fringing
and some significant artifacting with
complex scenes or fast movement make it
best for viewing at small sizes lastly
there are two versions one with Wi-Fi
and one without the Wi-Fi lets you
connect to smart devices not only for
transfers and uploads but for
controlling the camera too which is
worth the extra money all in all not a
bad first go at the category for Sony
but there's definitely room for
improvement I'm Josh Goldman and that's
the Sony action cam
