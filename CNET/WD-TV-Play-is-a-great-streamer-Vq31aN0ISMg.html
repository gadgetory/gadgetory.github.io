review of the WD TV play if you're like
me you're looking for a media player
that will read from your library of
music and videos as well as stream from
services such as Netflix and Spotify
while boxes such as the Roku HD and
Apple TV are great they are both limited
in their own ways if I was buying a new
stream today I would probably get this
new WD TV this is a $70 set-top player
about the size of your wallet and it
includes an impressive number of
connections including HDMI USB Ethernet
and wireless optical digital and an AV
out the play offers a simplified user
interface from previous players in the
line doing away with the confusing
colored buttons and upgrading to a
better remote at the same time the
interface is very configurable with my
favorites page which lets you choose
which of the 30 apps you want shortcuts
to even the remote shortcuts can be
changed as well the play is more
versatile than most other players in its
field due to a large number of supported
download formats in addition to its
streaming services the Slingbox act also
comes in handy whether I was using DLNA
or streaming Netflix I encountered no
problems at all and playback was smooth
and I also found it easy to navigate my
media while the competing neo TV offers
a laptop mirroring feature you need a
recent Intel laptop to take advantage of
it plus the player isn't as good for the
price there isn't another player that
can do the number of things the WD TV
play can do and also do them quite as
well this is ty Pendlebury for cnet.com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
