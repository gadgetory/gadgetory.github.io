upgrade over the surface RT however from
a strictly physical sense those
differences may be hard to spot it now
comes in silver or at least the backside
is silver and the body is ever so
slightly thinner and a wee bit lighter
it still feels as sturdy and well built
as surface RT however Microsoft went a
step further with its refinements
removing the screw heads in the space
under the kickstand and lowering the
microSD storage slot making it easier to
access speaking of the kickstand the
surface 2 has a second lower kickstand
angle making it easier to balance on
your lap both the new touch and type
covers are still sold separately but now
include backlighting and aren't as thick
when using them as covers type cover
keys are quieter when struck which is a
plus but the touchpad isn't as
comfortable as the original type cover
in my opinion of course the surface 2 is
running the 8.1 version of Windows RT
Windows RT still does not do legacy
Windows programs but it does come with a
free copy of office 2013 there are a ton
of new Archy features from a better
design settings menu to easier screen
customization and navigation a
redesigned Windows Store and the return
of the Start menu however for more
details check out our Windows 8.1
first look although things have improved
with the Windows Store in terms of app
availability you still won't find as
many apps as you will on Amazon Google
or Apple app stores the screen
resolution is now 1920 by 1080 up from
1366 by 768 both the front and back
cameras have seen significant upgrades
and sharpness and aperture but most
significant are the photo editing tools
which go impressively deep the Tegra 4
inside surface 2 delivers great gaming
performance not quite Nvidia shield
level but a noticeable step up from last
year Wi-Fi performance as well is
noticeably faster surface 2 goes for 449
dollars for 30
to a gigabytes of storage and five
hundred and forty nine dollars for 64
gigabytes type cover - and touch cover
to retail for 130 and $120 respectively
surface RT is still available for three
hundred and forty nine dollars and if
you're trying to choose between the old
one or the new one the new one is
definitely worth the upgrade however
whether surface 2 is right for you
is another question it's still the best
productivity tablet thanks to its
keyboards and inclusion of office and
well Xbox music and video are both
pretty satisfying full-featured media
apps app support in general
unfortunately still falls short compared
to Apple Google and Amazon check out my
full review heceta comm for more
information and my final recommendation
I'm Eric Franklin and this has been a
first look at the Microsoft Surface 2</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
