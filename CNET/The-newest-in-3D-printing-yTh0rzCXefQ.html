2013 this is the three systems cube 3d
printer this is a new version of the 3d
printer they announced last year this
one comes with a brand new plate design
so the previous version ran hot in order
to keep the object adhered to the plate
this one's cool which me is actually a
little safer for kids there's a new
design of the platform as well that
means you don't have to level it anymore
there's no things going on here so this
is where the plastic filament goes in as
a cartridge goes down through this
extruder here and it prints out the
object that you have sent to it from a
computer so where the older model used
just ABS plastic this one can use abs
and PLA different kind of material it
gives us a nice flexibility of heading
on what you want to make the new model
is also a little bit quieter when it
prints and it's also faster and more
accurate the three systems has some
other cool stuff going on here they have
a new recycling program in place where
you can send both the filament and the
cartridge back and they were recycle
both those parts it's actually address
is kind of an ongoing concern the 3d
printers and that you're making plastic
you're putting a lot of new kind of junk
out in the world so it's nice to be able
to address that and for your system
seems to have done that so this unit
will cost $12.99 each cartridge cost
about 50 bucks three system says it's
taking orders right now and it's going
to ship out January 21st
Thermage Brown this is a 3d systems cube
3d printer
