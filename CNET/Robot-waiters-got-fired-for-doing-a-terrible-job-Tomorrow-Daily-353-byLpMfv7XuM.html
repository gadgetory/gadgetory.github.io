welcome to tomorrow daily the best feet
talk show in the universe I'm Ashley
together I'm Jeff kanata its headlines
time we joke a lot about the robot
uprising where they will all become our
overlords but in order to get to there
they have to serve us first right
according to workers daily a Chinese
newspaper to gwangju restaurants that
replaced all their human workers with
robots are closing up shop because the
robots were terrible at their jobs
the robots you're watching now aren't
the waiters in question but are similar
to the ones that were fired one employee
said quote the robots weren't able to
carry soup or other food steady and
would frequently break down unquote the
cost of upkeep combined with the novelty
of robotic waiters wearing off means
future restaurant owners might think
twice about getting rid of their human
employees had one job robots don't spill
the soup how hard is that and you can't
even file a complaint with human
resources because you are not human
robot resource base Oh terrible that's
not good no I mean good for us I guess I
guess slightly good for us if you guys
are super bored when you brush your
teeth maybe adding a video game to your
tooth brushing will help you get it done
gunplay is a Japanese device that snaps
onto the end of any toothbrush and sinks
to a nap there are three different
options for you to choose from at that
point including mouth band which lets
you play an instrument of your choice as
you brush mouth news which delivers
three minutes of customized news and
mouth monster which is a game where you
defend your mouth against evil bacteria
as you brush it's on sale but it's only
in Japan for now and it's about 5,000
yen so it's about 45 US dollars if you
want to get in on that mouth band mouth
bands like rock band yeah with your
mouth you choose an instrument and then
like it will play a little song oh you
play along with it and as you brush the
tempo goes up or down it's it's really
weird you guys what should we talk about
Thursday maybe you're both good choices
yeah I mean it's good that the robots
aren't able to up rise because of
they're not good at things but this
stuff about this toothbrush I
come on I do think there is a larger
conversation we had on whether or not
everything needs to be smart
do we need smart toothbrushes to help us
get to three minutes of brushing like is
that necessary
not everything needs to be motivated by
games I mean I love games yeah I might
disagree I might disagree we need to
talk about this so if you want to get in
on that conversation tell us what you
think does everything need to be smart
or not just like this lovely gum play
toothbrush uh
use the hashtag hey TD yeah Twitter if
you if you use that hashtag will
incorporate your comments into our
discussion then it'll be this cool
three-way discussion between you guys us
that's the coolest way to do that it
will be the best yeah and on that note
now that we're done with headlines I'll
check out our phone talker for the day
today's phone charting for the day is
Animesh who took this photo with his
Moto G 3 turbo he writes hi guys
big high-five from India Anglo Bengal or
I really like your show and is really
useful for me to keep up-to-date with
tech happenings around the world thank
you for all your hard work the team puts
up for lazy viewers like me I'm
attaching a pic of Japanese peace pagoda
darjeeling india he visited last year it
is a sweet hill city in the Himalayas
and the pic was taken early morning amid
fog hope it fine hope you find it worthy
for your show
worthy that's awesome plus 100 to
worthiness this is a gorgeous picture
it's mysterious it is indeed it feels
like I could run into this in maybe a
plane Raider yeah like a Tomb Raider or
I do feel like I could run into this in
a video game it's so beautiful though so
beautiful I love all the detail it's
just I mean it's really stunning so if
you want to be like Animesh and you want
to send in your phone tog Rafi work this
