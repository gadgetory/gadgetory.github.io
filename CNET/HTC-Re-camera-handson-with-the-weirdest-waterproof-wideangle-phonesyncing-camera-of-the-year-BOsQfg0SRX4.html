has made a camera the HP Siri is a GoPro
competitor this little waterproof camera
kind of looks like an inhaler or a
periscope or an alien gun but it's
actually a video camera that has a
wide-angle lens that allows you to shoot
video slow-mo or pictures 16 megapixels
and this thing is waterproof you could
drop this into a meter of water for 30
minutes and it would work just fine
without a case this actually is also
meant to be a phone accessory so you can
record and look at everything remotely
via an app that's available for Android
and iOS
now the growing amount of action cameras
that are on the market theory is meant
to be something that you can put onto a
bike but also maybe wear on your head on
a helmet put into your pocket hold on
your hand or stand on a table if you
want to do time lapse there's a micro SD
card so you can add up to 128 gigs of
storage and it's cute comes in four
different colors it costs $1.99 in the
US and it's gonna be available at a
variety of retailers the really looks
like a stocking stuffer feels like an
alien space weapon but it's actually an
action sports camera maybe four people
have never tried him before
I'm Scott Stein here in New York with a
look at the HTC Reef
