your first look at the Nokia Lumia 820
for AT&amp;amp;T this is one of a trio of the
820 series this one only costs fifty
dollars that is a really great deal
remember that the Lumia is 822 for
verizon and Lumia 810 for tmobile costs
more than this phone does but they do
pretty much the same thing this one
comes with a 4.3 inch AMOLED screen it's
got the clear black display technology
on top so that means it's going to cut
down glare outdoors really nice screen
to look at this phone runs Windows Phone
8 operating system and it does support
4G LTE nokia has added this really high
sensitivity so you can actually navigate
with your fingernail or with a gloved
hand that's pretty neat the design is
definitely more of a block form we've
got these reversible covers right here
this one's a black I find it really
slippery kind of uncomfortably slippery
I've dropped the phone a couple times
the phone is extremely heavy it is five
point six ounces that's even heavier
than the Lumia 810 for tmobile you can
pry off the back cover and change it to
other colors you can also swap in a
wireless charging pad so that you can
drop this down and charge without a cord
pulling off the cover is a bit of a
trick that's something that I don't like
about the phone but I figured out how to
do it kind of squeeze the phone and peel
it off you'll see that quite a large
piece of this panel comes off and if you
pry out this battery you find that you
can get to the micro SD card slot and
also to the sim card slot there's an
eight megapixel camera on the back using
the carl zeiss optics technology also
dual LED flash and a front-facing camera
I thought that pictures were pretty good
overall there was sort of a greenish
tint to some of them and some colors
were overblown the phone also supports
1080p HD video and 720p HD video will
default to 720 so you got to change it
to 1080 if you want the higher
resolution fifty dollars is an amazing
price with the new to your service
agreement especially for a phone of this
caliber with so many features now the
phone is heavily subsidized so I think
that you should take advantage of this
if you're looking to pay not too much
for a phone of this quality however if
you don't mind paying fifty dollars more
I /
we still prefer the Nokia Lumia 920 more
advanced and I like the design better
I'm Jessica tall court for cnet this is
the nokia lumia 820 for eighteen t you
