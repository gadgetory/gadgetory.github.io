I'm cnet's cars you boy joined by senior
writer Casey Newton and Casey everyone
is talking about the google app with the
newly added voice search that's right so
yesterday Google dropped an update on
its main google app for iOS and the big
new feature is voice search so but it's
not any ordinary voice search this is
voice search that understands natural
language so whereas in the past we've
always been able to hit the little
microphone and say golden gate bridge
and get google results now you can ask
it a question and say how long is the
Golden Gate Bridge Google understands
and will tell you the answer and feet
and will even use a voice to say it out
loud well how long is the Golden Gate
Bridge let's look it up let's do it
right now so I'll just open up the app
here hit the microphone how long is the
Golden Gate Bridge there you go that
came up instantaneously it does and it's
really interesting when you ask it the
question as you're talking out loud
Google will show you your words so you
can kind of watch Google understanding
you in real time I love it I feel like
it builds confidence in the app I love
seeing my words show up right on the
screen yeah that it understands you
don't have to you know stop it start it
all over again which of course just
takes up valuable time all right let's
ask another question okay let's see what
is 9 times 50 that's pretty good if you
need a split a check with a friend in a
restaurant or whatever absolutely very
cool so obviously we can't talk about
this without bringing up ms siri who
already lives in your iphone what do you
think this is going to do to siri in her
voice skills well it definitely gives
other people an alternative and i think
that most people who run the same sorts
of searches on Cirie and google voice
search will find that google voice
search is faster and more accurate so if
nothing else it's going to put more
pressure on Apple to get Siri right
Syria's been out for more than a year
now there have been promises that it's
going to get a lot better frankly it
hasn't really yet still of those Syria
does have a lot of advantages over an
applet google voice search right
it's baked right into the system
software it's able to do things that the
google voice app will never be able to
do for example make a restaurant
reservation right through Siri and a
bunch of other cool tricks like that
yeah like integrating with your calendar
or by creating reminders for yourself
the google app is just very standalone
for search that's right and it's cool
that it goes to show that you can't have
both on one device so both have their
purposes maybe yeah absolutely and
there's nothing to stop you from putting
the google app right on your home screen
and using it whenever you want to ask my
question very nice thank you so much
