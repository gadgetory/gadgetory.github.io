here and I gotta say the number one
question a lot of you guys and gals
asked me specifically about the Apple
watch is how do I play podcasts on my
Apple watch and the answer isn't as easy
as you think
Apple yeah they have their own podcast
app through iOS or you know you can get
podcasts through the iTunes app but
there's no way to directly get them onto
your Apple watch because Apple doesn't
have a podcast app for the Apple watch
believe that yeah it's true so we've
seen a few apps out there I met they're
limited because of apples restrictions
on third-party developers but really the
one that just dropped and is really
worth checking out is called outcast now
it's $0.99 and really what makes it
special is that you can use your Apple
watch Series three LTE or Wi-Fi
connection either one and directly
download podcasts to this watch so let's
just kind of take a look at the app
again it's only $0.99 and what's kind of
cool is they give you two audio files
that explain how the app works so you
can always listen to those but let's go
into the search mode you can just here
add an actual podcast type in the name
of it you know I'm a big Warriors fan so
I got a shoal of lawyers plus - I see
you athletic alright but we check this
out we go in you can search for any
podcast it pulls from a database then
you can directly download it to your
watch here's another tip disconnect or
turn off the Bluetooth on your phone
because it actually will download faster
directly through LTE or Wi-Fi otherwise
if your phone is paired to it it's gonna
do a Bluetooth transfer which is
extremely slow so that's just something
you should be aware about it now after
that point all you have to do is you
cannot play the podcast directly through
the watch you actually have to use
headphones so whether there are air pods
or Fitness headphones sync them get them
paired and that's how you listen to the
actual podcast one of the caveats I
talked about is how Apple restricts
third-party app developers from having
full access to everything on the Apple
watch so this might seem a little wonky
it's not that bad but it's the only way
to go around this once you play a
podcast you'll need to go to the now
plane or the music player here and to
change the volume level you can only do
it from here you can see I'm changing
the volume level the podcast is getting
louder in my ear this is the only place
you can do it you'll see like a majorly
our song here in the cute it has nothing
to do with this you just need to focus
on the volume control here and then you
can go back to outcast and there you go
if you're someone who likes to listen
these things on the go when you're
working out it's a great app to check
out you can change the colors the look
you can even skip around the podcast by
five-second durations one minute and
thirty you can jump around and this is
really the best podcast app solely
dedicated for your Apple watch and you
guys gotta check it out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
