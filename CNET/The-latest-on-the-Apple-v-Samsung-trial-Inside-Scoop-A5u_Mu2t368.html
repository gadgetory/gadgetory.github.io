I'm here in San Jose which has become
ground zero of the legal case between
Apple and Samsung it's been going on for
about three weeks I've been here every
day and phone along with it I hope you
have too but if not I'm here to catch
you up on a couple of things that have
been going on we are in the last stages
this whole trial was expected to last
about a month we're a couple days shy of
that just a few more days to go we
really have both sides kind of wrapping
up their arguments next week we really
look forward to closing arguments from
either company which is two hours where
they really get to pitch their case to
the jury
after that the jury gets to deliberate
so we have that to look forward to but
the judge is worried that the jury is
not going to be able to make a decision
she thinks the case is too broad so she
told both sides today to kind of narrow
things down figure out what they really
want to go after basically choose their
battles but before that even happened
she told both the CEOs from Apple and
Samsung to actually call each other and
try and sort this out this already
happened didn't quite work out that's
why we're here in the trial but it also
makes the next couple days a little bit
interesting to watch last but not least
the judge says that she's absolutely
overwhelmed by the amount of paperwork
from both companies
she told both them to stop filing so
much stuff and really picked their
battles the same way that you would tell
your kids not to leave stuff all over
the house
she says her staff is totally inundated
and that there's legions of lawyers on
both sides that are just pushing too
much paper so plenty of fireworks
lots more to look forward to be sure to
tune in to CNN for more i'm josh
lonesome thanks for joining me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
