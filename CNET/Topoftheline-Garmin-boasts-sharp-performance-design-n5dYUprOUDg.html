along with the design that's also so
sharp you might cut yourself on it I'm
Antoine Goodwin and this is the flagship
Garmin Nuvi 3597 LMT HD it's the top of
the line model in their lineup and this
is your first look but first let's take
a look at how you're going to connect it
to your car I've got the cradle right
here and it's actually kind of cool got
your regular suction cup mount here for
connecting to glass but instead of Clips
it's got a magnetic ring right here that
circles some data and power connections
right here that are going to pull
traffic data from the power cable that
integrates an HD radio receiver that's
gonna get you a lifetime of free traffic
and infinite data simply take your
Garmin Nuvi and slap it on and it brings
to life almost instantaneously that's
because this thing actually never goes
to complete power off mode unless you
hold the power button down usually it's
just in a suspend mode ready to go one
of the first thing that you'll notice is
this kept its big 5 inch capacitive
touchscreen with a glass display it's
800 by 480 pixels which isn't super
sharp by smartphone standards but it's
way sharper than most standalone GPS
devices that I've ever tested being
capacitive you've got the ability to
swipe and pinch to zoom just like you
would on a smartphone and it's super
responsive I've also found that the
traffic data that's supplied by the HD
radio receiver is also pretty accurate I
went searching after some of the traffic
gyms that it reported and much to my
disappointment they actually were there
fortunately the nudies algorithms will
route you around that traffic when you
start getting close it'll pop up
something on display and say hey would
you like me to reroute I like that one
of the other things that I really like
about this is Garmin's move to a search
based destination input system so you've
still got your standard sort of py
searches and the ability to enter an
address but at the top of the screen
you'll see that there's now a search box
you can put anything in this box either
in address or the name of a business or
a category of destination and when you
hit search the new vo figure out what
you like I really like that you don't
have to
punching down into separate menus it's
very smart phone googly way of looking
at things that's very cool but then you
also don't even actually have to touch
the screen to input destinations and to
control your Nuvi got a really good
voice command system that is truly
hands-free the tiny microphone right
here is always listening for a spoken
command in this case it's voice command
and you simply say that in the Nuvi will
spring to life and be ready to listen to
your responses it's actually pretty good
at not picking up the words in the flow
of a conversation you kind of have to
specifically speak them so if I just say
voice command in a sentence it won't
come to life but if I stop and go voice
command then it springs to life
now on the screen you've got visual
prompts right here that lets you know
the sort of things that you can say to
the Nuvi one of the things that I really
like is that you can input an address in
one fell swoop without having to stop
for a separate prompts for street name
for the number and fitty and all of that
find address two three five seconds
three San Francisco California
and it's going to simulate the route
because we're indoors but we're just
like that you're on your route I also
like that you can speak business names
to it and it'll figure those out as well
find place Five Guys Burgers and Fries
it takes it a second but it actually did
figure out that very complicated name
and it showed me exactly what I'm
looking for now I can either tap this
and start going or I can continue
through the voice command system it's
also got some cool features such as
Bluetooth hands-free calling and when
you're paired with a smart phone you can
install an app that gives you some
interesting connectivity features but to
find out more about those you'll want to

cnet.com until then I've been Antoine
Goodwin and this has been your first
look at the Garmin Nuvi 3597 LMT
