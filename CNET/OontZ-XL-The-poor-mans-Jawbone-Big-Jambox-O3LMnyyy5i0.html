cnet.com and I'm here with another
Bluetooth speaker this one is a little
bit bigger it is the un's
XL from Cambridge sound works Cambridge
sound Works has been making some smaller
speakers that are very good values and
this large one is also a good value it's
got a nice understated design as a soft
to the touch finish and it has the
requisite buttons on top it allows you
to control playback it also has a
built-in speakerphone as well as USB
charging capabilities you can charge
another device using the internal
battery on the un's
XL this does get about 10 hours of
battery life you can do better if you
don't play your music that loud but this
is really kind of a poor man's big
jambox
and $100 it competes with some decent
smaller speakers such as the JBL flip
however this sound on the speaker is
bigger it does offer more bass what I do
want to emphasize is this doesn't sound
great it sounds good
it just doesn't measure up with a
speaker that cost 250 or 300 dollars
such as the jawbone big Jambox or the
Bose Soundlink Wireless those speakers
are better sounding speakers they offer
more clarity and they're just better
speakers however if you do want to get
better sound than some of these small
speakers the un's
XL definitely has better sound I'm David
Carr know and that's the ins XL from
Cambridge sound works thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
