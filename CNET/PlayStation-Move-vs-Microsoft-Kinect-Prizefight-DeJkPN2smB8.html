and this is another prizefight that you
the people been asking for gamers get
ready it's a prize five foot shout
between the PlayStation Move and
Microsoft Connect our judges for this
fight are associate editor Jeff back
that thing up Bakalar senior associate
editor scott the bottom line Stein and
myself Brian Hong Kong Tom hey yeah now
we'll take all three judges scores and
ABS the mouse the nearest tenth each
round the final prize fight score be an
average of all rounds using the same
decimal system who will be the motion
control master first round design the
PlayStation Move is a multi piece system
its PlayStation Eye camera has remained
the same since 2007 and it could really
be sleeker the move controller is sleek
and sturdy but it could either be a wand
with a glowing ping-pong ball or an
adult toy not that I know it's
navigation controller isn't required but
there are a lot of pieces to the puzzle
here now the Kinect sensor is a
one-and-done it's not the smallest piece
of hardware and it might be difficult to
find a convenient flat space to position
it but it wins style points for its
sleek design that reminds us a little of
wall-e Microsoft's Kinect takes around
one with the four and Sony's move gets a
three next round is set up if you think
these systems are just plug-and-play
it's not that easy with the PlayStation
Move you just have to plug in the camera
and sync the controllers to the system
it's actually relatively easy to set up
but calibrating the controllers in
between games can be annoying lighting
will be important here but space isn't
that big of an issue now the connects
initial setup can be tedious and take
almost up to 10 minutes but once
calibrated it's good to go
you also need decent lighting but the
biggest challenge here is space so get
ready to move some furniture if you
don't have at least six to ten feet of
playing space well this might not be
worth getting the move takes around two
with 3.7 and the Kinect gets a three
scepter averaging two rounds Microsoft
leads by Jeff
one-tenth of a point round three is
interphase and control these are two
totally different experiences the move
is really like we HD it's a motion
controller with a high level of accuracy
and the navigation controller has analog
sticks that caters to a more hardcore
audience well you'll notice here the
most is its precision especially with
shooters the Kinect is unlike any gaming
experience we've seen you can use your
hand to navigate menus like Minority
Report or control functions with your
voice with Kinect your hands arms and
legs and even your booty are part of the
gameplay but there can be a subtle delay
from your movements and what's
translated on-screen it all depends on
what you're looking for but between our
three judges Kinect it gets the edge
with a four and the move gets a three
point seven next round of software
support we're still waiting for more
move titles that showcase what the
technology is capable of Killzone 3 is
the first evidence that motion and
precision can go together but many other
games just have move support tacked on
the current batch of dedicated move
exclusive games feels like the same
things we've seen on the Wii
only with better graphics now
Microsoft's Kinect has games that are
made just for the platform and there are
several that really make the technology
shine Kinect Adventures is a great party
game you can't deny the cuteness and
interactivity of kinectimals and dance
central is the killer app you'll be
getting friends who never dance to shake
their groove thing even if you don't
want them to Microsoft takes another
round with the four and Sony gets a
three doctor averaging four rounds with
neck leads by four tenths of a point the
final round that decides at all is value
all right let's break down the move cost
the PlayStation is 40 bucks move
controller is 50 bucks and for advanced
games the navigation controller is an
additional $30 Sony offers a $99 bundle
with the eye a move controller and a
game but for two people you'll still
need an extra controller so you're
really talking about a $150 minimum for
a set up with two people now the Kinect
is $150 it's about half the price of a
console but it's still pretty much
around the same price as a move set
and you don't need any additional
hardware just the Kinect sensor the
final round ends in a tie at three point
three points apiece
so let's average out all five rounds and
in a battle that was close early the
Kinect started to pull away taking this
battle three point seven the three point
three and is your prize five winner now
the winner for you might depend on what
kind of gamer you are but ultimately
it's up to the software developers to
showcase both of these technologies well
you know what I can't wait to get home
and play kinectimals I'm Brian Tom
thanks for watching we'll catch you guys
next time another prize spot
