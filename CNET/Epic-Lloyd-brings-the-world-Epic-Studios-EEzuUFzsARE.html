otherwise known as lloyd ahlquist he's
got a brand new show called epic studios
you might seem familiar to you we do a
little show
epic Rap Battles have a grab battle of
history yes no I so want to tell us a
little bit about this new show from what
I saw it's about a guy whose name is
also Lloyd you know it's a stretch the
character is a stretch but yes his name
is Lloyd he inherits a debunked
recording studio from his Rockstar
drug-addicted
father and when his father gets eaten by
a lion it's up in Toronto so he inherits
that and then he just has to try to keep
it afloat so that he doesn't lose the
whole play and release about four
episodes already and you're gonna be
releasing all what kind of schedule
released for today and then every
Wednesday for the next four weeks we're
gonna release three until we get to 13
so 13 episodes altogether
I was lucky enough to watch couple the
episodes and I was wondering if we're
gonna see a lot more animal maulings
towards the end of the show or is that
just the beginning of the show well I
can't tell you that it's a spoiler
warning this like soil that so there's
lots of yeah that's good there's some
debt there's a lot a few deaths I mean
you gotta kill somebody you know or else
it's not fun enough to watch how long
was this idea rattling around your head
this is a scripted show about seven or
eight minutes an episode a little bit
longer than some of the stuff you've
been doing what did this come about I
have two very dear friends of mine
Aaron Krebs and Jill bass lucky is his
wife and they've been friends with me
forever and they saw the success of rat
battles and and some of the music that I
do and we work together on I own the
comedy club in Santa Monica California
Westside comedy so they were like what
if we tried to come up with an idea that
was more like a TV show or a story show
so they pitched me this idea that yeah
that's great I love that we went up to
Montreal to the Just for Laughs comedy
festival there and pitched in a pitch
contest and then he got the attention of
some Canadian producers and then that
last May we shot it up in Toronto for
six weeks
and then we just released it this week
so it's been a long process of creation
but it's been enjoyable
anyway the main antagonist is Kevin
McDonald or played by Kevin Macdonald
yeah kids in the hall when I saw them
like I know this is awesome what was
that like work with him well he crushed
my head several times he's been going
around doing that yeah just everywhere
he was great he was like super
professional and super excited to be
there and one of those guys we just
turned the camera on and you're like
yeah that was funny yeah that was good
yeah that was fine we just do that again
great so we have to talk about rap
battles and it's been doing that for a
very long time
mm-hmm now I wanted to ask you do you
have any favorite that you try to make
work that you just just have to get rid
of you got to reject it what's your
favorite rejected the Bratva
we did Heather the eighth versus Hillary
Clinton once and it just didn't make it
in terms of it was our fault it wasn't
anybody else's we just couldn't we
didn't shoot it right and all the pieces
didn't come together right so we could
just you just couldn't get the quality
where it needed to be so that's like one
that never made it off the shelf so that
would be what I would say and I gotta
ask the selection process because
watching was Ash Ketchum versus Darwin
girls Darwin and I'm like do you have
like two giant wheels you know what was
he throwing darts
how are you picking those the audience
it's always at the end of every video
who's the one who's next so the audience
submits all the suggestions of what they
want to pick it that's you guys then we
just go through and see which ones
resonate with us and which ones are
liked the most and which ones everybody
in the world wants to see and then if
there's like some character that like
the election for example is obviously
something we're going to do or meet we
did Deadpool right around the time the
Deadpool movie he's been a popular
character for a while the timing made
sense so we kind of look at it from a
strategic and also popularity that was
Deadpool vs Boba Fett right and I was
killing yeah hilarious yeah because it
would you mind doing a freestyle yeah
but let's find a choice for you so
inside this helmet okay you've got some
gameboy games okay if you pick one of
the games maybe that's the topic but for
two of the games whatever you want all
right I'll just you got a mic over here
I'll just make I'll just pull them out
as I go how about that sounds like a
plan
Brian you can drop that beat dawg oh
yeah
that's a sweet beat are we gonna go yeah
as epiclloyd scenic they said do a
freestyle set you bet
so let me go over to this helmet and rap
about some of these things in it I've
been rapping since Arsenio days so let
me spit a little bit about this video
game yo
this one's Yoshi I used to be with that
bear named yogi yogi man with the
sandwiches yo I got mad hand witches
this one I think is from a Game Boy that
was a very expensive toy so I never
really got one I got grounded and but
this video games got some pounding cuz
it was just the a.m. to be and I be the
Freestyle MC gbic Double L OID got no
hair and I rap about this game sitting
on this chair let me do one more
this is hokey mom yeah I'm hokey mom
this is straight up the bomb yo my mom
never played no pokey mom but my brother
and my dad they were like yo come on we
all sat down and we played all day and
now what do these things in these words
that I sprayed one more game yo I think
this one is home box just what calls
punks
man I ain't got no box what even rhymes
with bongs like Tom a Patong Patong is
the truck Tonka truck yo Bellanca truck
I don't know I gotta keep going to fit
up top this guy's got a meat phone in
his hand and that little dude here's my
man he looks like a little caveman with
a bird feet he's not a type of do I want
to be but I put sin and I play for about
an hour I got all kind of points lots of
power-ups I don't get though yo I want
to go through when I get some truck so
here's my last game just one this Mario
baseball I wanna get all up in your face
y'all and I hit the single maybe double
and get the third then you're gonna be
in trouble
oh this wraps in fun but like this very
your game I got a hit at home one I do
