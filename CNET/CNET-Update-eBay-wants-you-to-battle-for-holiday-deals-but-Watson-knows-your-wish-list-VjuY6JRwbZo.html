phone and IBM's Watson knows what's on
your wish list this year hi I'm Bridget
Carey this is your cnet update when it
comes to holiday shopping we're all
tired of fighting the store crowds so
more people are shopping online during
black friday weekend and Google is doing
a few things to make shopping on your
phone a smoother experience the google
search shopping section has been
redesigned to help you narrow down
options better and if you know what you
want like tricycles for kids you can
break down the search by features brand
and price and once you find the exact
item you can dive deeper and see reviews
google also can help find which stores
near you carry the item this is not a
nap it's all inside the browser and of
course Google rather have you spending
more time inside Google search because
that's where it makes the most money
from advertisements but even if you want
to avoid in store fights eBay is putting
a virtual twist on the Black Friday
battle beginning at four pm eastern on
thanksgiving day ebay is making people
vote on which of two items they'd rather
see a sale for in the next hour and the
item with the most votes wins so at 6pm
would you rather get twenty-five percent
off a gopro hero4 or eighteen percent
off the low end Apple watch the deal
unlocks an hour later and this voting
process continues throughout the night
with different pairings of products it's
called the wish bigger wishbone like a
turkey wishbone you pulled two ways but
only one who cracks off the bigger piece
gets their wish to come true if you're
still trying to figure out what your
loved ones are wishing for just ask
Watson ibm's watson supercomputer has
figured out what the hottest holiday
gifts are going to be this year and it's
all searchable in a new ios app called
watson trend the watson computer combed
through 10,000 posts of social media
sites blogs comments ratings and reviews
to pick out hot gifts and it can
understand context and tone in our
language to decipher our desires the app
has Apple watch as a top tech gift
followed by televisions and in the toy
section Star Wars and Legos are also hot
I don't think you need to be a
supercomputer to figure out apple and
star wars are going to be hot this year
but if you want to pay for
those holiday gifts at the register with
your smartphone there are more options
than ever before with Apple pay and
repay and Samsung pay soon LG is going
to be part of the mix with LG pay the
company announced it plans to launch an
LG pay service which will likely let you
pay by waiving your phone at a terminal
now I don't expect it to be popular when
you have Apple and Google already doing
their own service with many established
partners but so far LG has partnered
with two large Korean credit card
companies and this week Apple pay
continues to expand to more countries
you can now use Apple pay in Canada and
Australia but only if you have an
American Express card that's it for this
tech news update and there's more at
cnet com from our studios in New York
