going to talk about cell phone carriers
how to choose one that's right for you
maybe you already have a carrier that
you like or maybe you're shopping around
either way I'm here to give you a quick
education on what you need to know the
major carriers in the US include AT&amp;amp;T
Verizon t-mobile and Sprint each of them
owns their own physical Network the
towers satellites and cables that are
used to transmit your call around the
country there are also smaller carriers
out there like virgin mobile or boost
mobile but they actually lease their
network from the big guys so if you hate
the idea of a big telco getting your
money you'll just have to try messenger
pigeons or postcards so you have the
four major networks two of them Verizon
and Sprint use a cellular standard
called cdma the other two AT&amp;amp;T and
t-mobile use a standard called gsm you
can think of this like diesel vs
gasoline both of them get the job done
but you can't run a diesel car on
regular gas the same goes for phones you
can't take a cdma phone that you bought
on sprint and go use on 18 tsg sm
network or vice versa there are a few
phones like the iPhone or some of the
more popular Android smartphones that
every carrier has a version of but if
you want to avoid some heartbreak it can
be helpful to choose a carrier before
you shop around for that perfect phone
but the most important thing you should
consider when choosing a carrier is what
kind of reception are going to get in
your area like I said each carrier has
the own unique network so the coverage
varies between each one check out the
carrier's coverage map to make sure
you're going to have reception where
you're likely to use your phone for more
cell phone buying advice including how
to pick the right phone and how to
understand your cell phone plan check
