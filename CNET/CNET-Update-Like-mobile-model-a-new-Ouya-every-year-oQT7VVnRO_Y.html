phone ring I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your cnet update this is going to be one
competitive year for smartphones in
October consumers will have another
choice besides apple android windows and
blackberry the new player is called
ubuntu and it's currently an open source
operating system for computers but now
it's being redone for the smaller screen
and the company CEO told The Wall Street
Journal that smartphones running ubuntu
will be out in October and app
developers get access to tinker with it
later this month it wasn't revealed
which carriers or handset makers would
be working with who boon to and it
wasn't even confirmed if North America
will be getting it first this system
would be unique because apps that are
programmed to run on a desktop PC also
will work on the phone so you can just
make one app for multiple devices when
docked this phone can also be used as a
PC but it's likely that this is going to
be something that interests corporate IT
departments more than the average
consumer here's another fun product to
say hooyah the android based game
console will be updated with a new
version every year at least that's the
game plan the company's CEO told The
Verge that's starting next year and
every year going forward the Ouya system
will be refreshed with the best
performing ships possible for its
hundred dollar price point usually you
don't see an upgrade with a game console
in several years that we you came out
six years after the wii the council is
expected to be available every tailors
in june and players can make pre-orders
now Microsoft is picking on Google again
with the marketing campaign titled don't
get scroogled by Gmail Microsoft is
drawing attention to how Google scans
users emails to determine which ads to
show alongside the email and thereby
it's urgent people to switch to the free
outlook.com email but Google maintains
that it's automated scans do not invade
privacy because no humans read user
emails or account information right now
Yahoo is the top free email provider in
the US with Google at a close second
hotmail is a distant third and will be
phased out for the rebranded outlook com
and speaking of email a new iPhone app
is getting lots of buzz is called
mailbox and it's a third-party gmail
client that just hit the App Store
mailbox is designed to make it easier to
manage emails because you can do things
like snooze and email to put off
answering an email until later and we'll
give you a reminder to check it again
for the time you want but you can't just
download it you have to wait in line to
get an activation code so you might
download this now and wait four days to
even use it clearly people are desperate
for a better way to manage the email
Beast that's your tech news update you

studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
