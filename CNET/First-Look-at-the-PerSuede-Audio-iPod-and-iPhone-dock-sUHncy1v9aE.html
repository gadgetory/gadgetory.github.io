I'm going to talk to Brad Pfeiffer who's
showing us these speakers he has made
not available yet tell us what you've
made here what they are and why you're
building speakers well we have here is a
two point one single point source mfi
speaker product that produces surround
sound in the environment that is place
it could be your kitchen it could be
your office it could be your living room
and it's designed to produce extremely
high fidelity sound in a very fashion
forward right okay you're talking specs
but what drove drew me to them was how
they look isn't that the sale here I
mean isn't that the pitch yes yes it's
actually both it's it's the look is very
important we recognize that we want to
do something different but at the same
time that's not the only thing going
this and a lot of companies talk about
high quality audio but ours truly is
extremely high quality and I'm a
musician and engineer as well so when we
develop these we held no expense to make
the best product that we could at a most
affordable price point which is very low
now so I've been walking around CES
there's a ton of audio ton of speakers
lots made for the iphone as these are
for iphones or ipods what is in this
crowded market yes it is but we felt
that there still was room for the
combination of the high fashion and the
high performance because to our
interpretation of what we see out there
nobody's really done this fusion of the
two technologies
okay tell me about the fabric the fabric
is a week all fashion slate and it's a
we can produce it in many different
colors and the solid colors it has very
high chroma so it really stands out as
we say with pops you know it really has
a nice chroma to it but we also have our
new animal print series which is we
found it very popular and zebra and
cheetah and another different patterns
hold on popular aren't you here trying
to get distribution deals these are not
yet available right no they're not these
we wanted to be here for the show for
CES these will be in production ready
for sale in second quarter 2005 and how
much are they going to be the target
price is 599 and given the performance
level the product we feel that's a very
very competitive price point with the
level quality in the wrong thanks
I'm Paul Sloan with cnet be talking to
Brad Pfeiffer of persuade audio</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
