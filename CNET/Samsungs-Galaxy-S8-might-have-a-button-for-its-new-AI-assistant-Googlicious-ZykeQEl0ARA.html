google issues for everything google
we're talking about now you won't need a
car stereo to get the android auto
experience anymore that's because the
android auto app just received an update
that now let you use your phone instead
of having to buy an in-car dash unit for
your car now all you really need is a
car mount the interface simplifies apps
and blows them up in size to make them
safer to use it in a car the app is
rolling out on the Play Store over the
next few days and I'm getting excited to
give it a spin get it Android auto car
spin over now in more updates new
security updates are now available for
Nexus and pixel phones running android
seven point 0 or 7.1 the pixel phone
also gets bluetooth fixes and improve
performance for the daydream view vr
headset before its launch november the
tent and how is nougat even doing it's
not really readily available on most
phones but it made the slightest of
dense with a 0.3 adoption rate yes
that's three it's not even one percent
now android marshmallow debuted with the
same percentage but when you look at the
breakdown Android KitKat and lollipop
are still the most widely used flavors
of Android and this is just the nature
of the android OS and the google home
has debuted to solid reviews it's not a
game changer right now but it excels in
being a slightly smarter home assistant
overall thanks to the power of the
google engine and the ability to ask
follow-up questions out of context
sensitive play some pop music it still
doesn't know everything and
significantly lacks in third-party apps
and smart home support Bohemian Rhapsody
by panic at the disco
Alexis stop Alexis stop it's not even
close to the echo which has a two-year
lead and really that's one of its great
strengths bottom line if you want to try
out the home AI space the Google home is
a great start if you never had one
before and you're in the Google
ecosystem but if you own an echo right
now there's really no reason to switch
over to a Google home because the echo
just does more now the real story here
is in a year or two how does Google day
I get even smarter because you know it
will and does it really amp up its
third-party support because if it can
that's what might win the long run but
again we'll see how this all plays out
okay Samsung's in the AI game as well
with the recent acquisition of viv the
team behind the original Serie A I that
Apple uses but viv is the next evolution
and a whole lot smarter a Reuter report
says Samsung now plans to integrate the
AI platform into its Galaxy smartphones
and is even looking to take it further
to add voice assistant services to its
home appliances and even its wearables
now a Wall Street Journal report says
Samsung is also considering a hardware
revamp for its next phone and could add
a dedicated button for their new AI
assistant the latest internal prototypes
of the galaxy s 8 include a button on
the side edge of the smartphone that
would be used to prompt it now Samsung
is also looking to delay the
announcement of the new s8 until after
the Mobile World Congress show in late
februari and it could come even as late
as april 2017 in a little quick fit
youtube is adding support for HDR videos
that's the buzz word you've heard that
stands for high dynamic range it really
brings better contrast deeper blacks and
a wider color gamut that I can only
describe as making HD look even more HD
like once you see it you'll know the
chromecast ultra will be the first
device to support this and after that
samsung s you HD and UHD TVs will get
support for it later this year and
before we go google's deepmind project
wants to get even smarter it already was
able to conquer the world champion in go
and it now has its sights set on
starcraft 2 now deep mine is partnering
with blizzard to create an open research
environment that will allow a eyes and
machine learning systems to interact and
better understand one of the greatest
games of all time like Starcraft was my
jam during my college days shout out to
the Zerg but if deep Mayan is able to
this off it will just show you how
powerful this AI really is and what
could be next for deep mine first it's a
game of go then starcraft 2 and finally
the world like i'm not scared about that
at all alright that's going to do for
this week's show you can always email me
at google licious at cnet com or tweet
me at brian Tong thanks so much for
watching we'll catch y'all next time for
some more of that Google issue</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
