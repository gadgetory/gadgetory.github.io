speaker at the top of its class in bass
response loudness durability and battery
life this box has you covered
I'm Justin new for CNET and this is a
first look at the Deemer box big bang so
the idea for this speaker came from
James Deemer who was working as a sound
mixer at the time and needed a portable
sound system for shoots on location he
had the idea to build the Bluetooth
wireless boom box into the lid of a
Pelican case and went to Kickstarter to
get the initial funding for production
well fast forward a few years and
several prototypes later and the deeper
box is shipping around the world but
they're all still made locally in
Portland Maine so if you're not familiar
with Pelican cases here's what you need
to know
they were favorite accessory for
military law enforcement photographers
and anyone else transporting delicate
items because they're super tough the
copolymer propylene is built to
withstand hard impact water dust dirt
and basically anything else you could
throw at it the two speakers and the
circuit board are built into the lid
alone so you still get plenty of room
inside to store whatever you want I
usually put cables and the wall charger
inside but you can put whatever else you
want in there to the battery life for
this speaker is really incredible - the
website says it can last up to 40 hours
on a single charge and in my testing I
found that to be accurate I brought it
to a camping trip for a weekend and we
played it all day and night for three
days and it lasted the entire time
conveniently enough there's also an open
USB port inside the lid as well that you
can use to recharge your smartphone or
other devices on the other hand one
downside to that is there's no way to
tell how much juice you have remaining
in the battery so you know how most
bluetooth speakers sound okay when you
turn up the volume half way and get
worse eventually as you turn it up well
that doesn't happen with the Big Bang
the 2 8 ohm speakers on the front gets
super loud but more importantly there's
no base distortion or a blown out middle
section at full volume and part of the
reason for that might be because of the
empty cavern inside there's a base port
on the front too that when exposed
emulates the design of a subwoofer and
allows air pressure to release out of it
the base hits so hard that you can
actually feel a kick of air coming out
with
Beate it's really impressive for a
wireless speaker and it sounds a lot
better than competing Bluetooth speakers
in this price range so you can check out
more details about this in my full
review on CNET but that's gonna do it
for this video you just took a first
look at the Deemer box big bangs with
speaker thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
