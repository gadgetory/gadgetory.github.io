from e3 2013 at the company's press
conference Sony decided to kick
Microsoft while it was down coming off a
really bad month of PR and announced
that the PlayStation 4 will in fact
support used games across the board
you'll be allowed to sell them at retail
you'll be allowed to sell them to a
friend or lend them to a friend and
there's absolutely no restrictions on
that whatsoever
you'll also not have to check in on a
console every 24 hours so there's no
reason to worry about an always-on
connection Sony also took the chance to
undercut the Xbox one which is priced at
five hundred dollars by announcing that
the PlayStation 4 will be sold for $400
when it comes out later this year all of
this of course was highlighted by the
actual debut of the console which
looking at it is significantly smaller
in size compared to Xbox one Sony gave
us an update on some of the titles that
they announced at the February event in
New York and we got a chance to check in
and see how those titles are doing we
got to see the Killzone game the
infamous game a game called knack and
drive Club now in terms of the new
exclusives that we're gonna see for
PlayStation 4 we found out that
developer ready at dawn is busy at work
on a game called the order 1886
was also a great press conference for
independent developers Sony really
wanted to advertise the fact that they
have a solid relationship with
independent developers by showing off a
handful of titles a lot of these titles
are going to be featured in the
PlayStation Plus free game deal where
members of the service will get a free
game each month as long as they're a
member of PlayStation Plus and just like
Xbox gold PlayStation Plus will carry
over from generation to generation
if you're currently a member now a lot
of the game demos we did see weren't
necessarily exclusive titles to
PlayStation 4 but these titles were
going to get exclusive content now a lot
of the other game demos we did see dealt
with titles that are multi-platform but
will feature some sort of PlayStation 4
exclusive content that includes
watchdogs and destiny
that about wraps it up here at the Sony
e3 2013 press conference keep it here at
Cena calm for the latest from e3 I'm
