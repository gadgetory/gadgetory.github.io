and among the many upgrades are gloves
that work with touchscreens and you know
what that means
space selfies NASA's new suits are also
more comfortable to wear for keeping you
alive in the vast emptiness of space the
new blue ensemble is lighter and more
flexible
weighing in at 20 pounds that's 10
pounds lighter than the old garb the
helmet advisor is attached and part of
the suit
there are also vents in the fabric to
keep the astronaut cool letting water
vapor from sweat leave the suit but keep
air inside so it can be pressurized the
smart screen friendly suits are designed
for those heading into orbit aboard the
Boeing Starliner spacecraft and
astronauts have been testing how it is
to move around the suits by sitting
inside a mock-up of the Starliner the
plan is for the craft to take four
astronauts to the space station on a
regular basis with test flights
scheduled to begin next year it's all
part of NASA's Commercial Crew
development program it's an effort to
broaden space travel beyond government
led missions so when space tourism
becomes a thing maybe we'll all be
wearing these outfits on our space
vacations I'm Bridget Carey you can
always stay updated on the biggest tech
news from our galaxy as seen accom</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
