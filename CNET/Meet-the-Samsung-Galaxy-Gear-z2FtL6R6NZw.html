your jeans every time it rings is way
too much trouble what you need is a mini
screen on your wrist to let you take
calls and send texts with a minimum of
physical exertion enter then the Samsung
Galaxy gear the long-awaited SmartWatch
from the people who brought you the
galaxy s4 the gear is an android-powered
watch that hooks up to your phone oh the
bluetooth shows incoming calls which you
can answer using the built-in microphone
it shows texts to you that you can reply
to you using something's s voice control
software you can place a call or send a
new text to just by telling the watch
who to text then reading at the message
scroll through the simple tiled
interface and you'll find tools to
control your media a pedometer to count
your steps and the 1.9 megapixel camera
housed on the strap to take extremely
quick snaps third-party apps are
available to download although they're
extremely thin on the ground for now the
most helpful a moment is the Evernote
app that lets you save photos and voice
messages to your Evernote account that
will then sync across all your devices
instantly it'll also let you read recent
note on the watch which will come in
very handy if you're following the
shopping list it's a brilliant idea in
theory but the gear does have a few
problems chiefly it only currently works
as the new Galaxy Note 3 as Samsung
reckons it will be updated to it with
the s4 and note 2 but if you're an on
samsung android user don't get your
hopes up secondly the notifications it
can give are limited to calls and texts
social networks messaging services like
whatsapp or Google Hangouts and most
importantly emails won't give you any
notifications at all if more apps are
written for the watch to bring these
functions it will become considerably
more useful physically it's quite a
good-looking piece of kit it's much more
compact than I imagined it would be and
I found it very comfortable to wear it's
available in a host of different colors
too if you're particularly first about
it matching your outfit the 1.6 3 inch
screen is bright and sharp enough to
make small text easily readable there's
a bunch of what traders to choose from
to or you can head to the dedicated app
store to snag some fancy-looking third
party ones
it's a fun little device and those of
you who've always wanted to talk into
your watch like a Power Ranger will
likely find it an exciting novelty by
the time of shooting this video however
it's really very expensive particularly
for the limited number of functions it
can actually perform as a concept the
SmartWatch is certainly interesting but
the galaxy gear it needs to make some
key additions in order to be truly
useful I'm Andrew coil for cnet and this
is the Samsung Galaxy gear</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
