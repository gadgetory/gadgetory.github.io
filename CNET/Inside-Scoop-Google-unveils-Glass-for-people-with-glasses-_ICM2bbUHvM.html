Sumi das and joining me as Seth
Rosenblatt senior writer for cnet Seth
thanks for being with us thank you sue
me okay so not too long ago we heard
about these contact lenses that Google
has developed that are supposed to
monitor glucose levels intended for
diabetics and then we have this new news
from google which may make optometrists
worried tell us the new news sure so
Google is launching prescription lenses
for a google glass for people who have
the Explorer editions okay so that means
that you don't have to wear Google glass
on top of your regular prescription
glasses we're gonna avoid that geeky
situation yes that was good for nobody
okay right so I mean we don't even know
when the regular Google glass is gonna
be available right we don't have a
shipping date no they're making all
these other kind of promises and offers
and mm-hmm absolutely so one of the
things that they're doing is they're now
making it so that prescription lenses
are available for google glass um the
way it's going to work is that google
glass ships with a particular frame sort
of its default frame right and that's
called the explorer edition huh and
that's a $1,500 entry fee only only I
know I keep that in my couch give me two
and for another two hundred and
twenty-five dollars you can buy one of
the new four frames that they're
releasing okay uh and these frames we
have some choice there you do have some
choice a little bit of style and these
frames are designed to hold prescription
lenses they ship with non prescription
lenses okay last one get this felt so
and then you can take them to go get
them filled the benefit of this is that
they don't look quite as weird as the
original google glass frame which just
sort of hangs there and sits on your
head and floats and feels a little
awkward the idea that google has is that
people who wear glasses or who want to
look like they wear glasses are more
likely to wear glass if it comes with
something that's more natural and since
as a society we've been using glasses
for 500 years or more this is not so
unusual and they think people will take
to google glass more comfortably and not
just the wearer's but also people around
them
you wear prescription glasses I do you
got your hands on these glasses did the
new version so tell us what it feels
like does it look any different is it
kind of what you would expect that sort
of like chip of yeah so you've got that
that plastic thing that's still there
right but because of the way that the
frames are designed are made of out of
titanium okay so they're they're very
lightweight there there's a little bit
of extra weight on the right side as
you'd expect because that's where the
computer and the glass hardware is but
it's not terrible and I actually got
used to it i would say in under 10
minutes it was I'm very sensitive about
extra weight on my glasses I have these
very lightweight frames and those frames
were only a little bit heavier okay any
additional functionality or is it just
Google s and a pair of prescription
glasses Google glass and a pair of
prescription glasses they do have a deal
with vsp the American I carriage my next
question does my health plan cover this
it might okay so the answer to that is
maybe you get your glass you get your
prescription frames you take them to an
eye care professional you get your
prescription filled vsp might cover the
lenses and they might even cover part or
the full cost of the frames so although
it's 225 + whatever you have to pay for
your prescription it may actually be
covered depending on what your insurance
plan is and do we know when these will
be available yes these are currently
available to any current google glass
explorer but not to the general public
not to the general public do we know
when Google glass is gonna be available
to the general public that's the other
burn information sometime this year
there are rumors google i/o there are
rumors that there will be an
announcement at Google i/o okay which is
in May or June May or June um beyond
that I would be surprised if they were
available in there in June but i would
expect an announcement by then alright
well Seth thank you for keeping any time
and I all right oh that hurt oh alright
the four inside scoop I'm Stevie does
thanks for watching
