the HTC One m8 with one of our favorite
phones of last year and now it's time
for its replacement meet the flagship
HTC One m9 one of the headline features
of this phone is still the design and of
course maintains the full metal body
that we previously seen on the m8 and
the previous m7 however on the m9 the
rounded corners of the m8 have been
sharpened up a little to make it a
little more easier to hold now difficult
to tell in this light but the phone has
been given a slight two-tone effect with
the edging of the phone slightly more
dark gold than the back panel now it's
also available in a gun metal gray and
the lighter silver version each with
slightly different colored side panels
it feels really nice to hold and I think
it looks everybody is sexy as a previous
models and you'll still see classic HTC
things like these lines at the top and
the bottom and the power buttons on the
side on the front of the phone you'll
see the boomsound speakers which is
something we've come to expect on a lot
of HTC's current phones now the
speaker's themselves are quite big but
more importantly when you're watching a
video on the screen the sound is being
fired towards you rather than away
meaning it won't get muffled if you put
the phone down on the surface at five
inches the m9 screen is exactly the same
size as the m8 screen and it also has a
1080p resolution so in terms of clarity
we shouldn't be any difference to my
eyes it looks fairly bright as well
although under this light it's kind of
difficult to tell it's running the
latest Android 5.0 lollipop software and
HTC has also released the latest version
of its scent software which is sense 7
now sense 7 makes a few changes but most
notably is the fact that you can
customize the interface a lot more than
you could with previous models it's
running on call comes latest Snapdragon
810 processor which should be plenty
enough to keep this running smoothly HTC
has taken the four ultrapixel camera
found on the back of the One m8 and has
actually put that on the front of the m9
now how difference that makes for your
selfies remains to be seen when we put
them both side by side but we are
expecting them to look a little crisper
particularly in low light on the back of
the phone though is a 20 megapixel
camera rather than ultrapixels although
again we'll really have to wait for the
full review
to see how that fares HTC hasn't said
exactly how much this phone is going to
cost but given its top-end specs and its
metal design you can bet it won't come
cheap due to go on sale towards the end
of march though global eat so we should
expect to hear more prices somewhere in
the next couple of weeks I'm Andrew
Foyle cnet and this is the HTC One m9</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
