incorporate the NVIDIA GTX 1050 TI GPU
arjun pcs eon 15 s is more
budget-friendly than one of its usual
custom-built systems starting at $9.99 i
really think you'll want to spend at
least a couple hundred more for
satisfactory performance though there
didn't seem to be any unusual or endemic
performance or gameplay problems at
least none that can't be solved by
throwing money at them if they bother
you too much
once I had at least semi optimised
settings for a game the first-person
shooter experience was great a couple of
lost weekends and some missed deadlines
can attest to that much and several
qualities elevate the EON 15s above the
rest of the 1050 Ti crowd like some
competitors it incorporates a
sufficiently matte IPS display but the
origins looks better a lot better in
some cases it also has two two mini
DisplayPort connectors one that's
directly attached to the GPU bus and
therefore capable of driving a g-sync
compatible monitor that makes possible a
total of three external displays with
the third on HDMI plus there's a
removable battery that's not only a
rarity these days but especially rare
for its price class of course given the
measly 4.3 hour battery life it
delivered on our streaming video test
you may want to stock up on them you can
bling up the lid matte red or glossy
white a custom paint job or a logo and
the keyboard back lights ports up to
three preset color zones and the usual
rainbow of color animation options the
full-size membrane keyboard doesn't have
the clicky feel of a mechanical but it's
surprisingly good with decent feedback
and a reasonable layout that shouldn't
get in your way all it's not perfect
though the touchpad isn't great and it's
selectively responsive and the general
utility doesn't allow for a lot of
control over the fan which can get loud
or other settings
