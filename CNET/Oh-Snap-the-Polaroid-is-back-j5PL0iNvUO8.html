of Polaroid is using new technology to
make its most popular product of all
time seem fresh again hoping the
nostalgic in all of us will take the
bait the company has been trying to make
instant print school again
ever since the launch of the zip printer
which connects to your phone and uses
thermal technology to wirelessly print a
photo from your camera roll in seconds
knowing needed the problem was you
needed to have the printer in your purse
or pocket to have a print it's two new
cameras use this same technology except
no phone needed it's all in one much
like the original the newest is the
Polaroid pop a boxy digital camera with
an LED viewfinder screen that prints
photos in the old-fashioned three by
four dimensions except in this case it's
special sync paper which is thinner than
the old Polaroid print paper and the
camera itself is significantly higher
quality as well with a 20 megapixel
sensor with full HD video micro SD card
slot and USB port for charging the snap
touch is polar its other throwback
product which is more of an evolution of
the snap that we saw last year it looks
more like a regular digital camera on
the outside now with a touch screen
display that prints images in two by
three sticky sync paper that you can
attach anywhere the sensor is 13
megapixels with video in up to 1080p and
a tiny selfie mirror next to the flash
both cameras allow you to customize your
photo post-production and add some
stickers filters and borders before you
print or you could also pair it with
your phone to print directly from your
camera roll the snap touch is already
available for purchase for a hundred and
eighty dollars and you can expect the
pop to launch before the holiday
shopping season this year in q3 for
about a hundred and ninety nine dollars
