this is a first look at the toshiba
excite pure tablet toshiba launched
three tablets in the summer of 2013 and
the toshiba excite pure is the budget of
the bunch at three hundred dollars the
10-inch device has a polycarbonate body
with a silver champagne colored textured
back panel it's then enough to hold
comfortably in your hand and thick
enough to stand up to rough handling so
you don't have to be afraid to hand it
to your kids along the left side of the
tablet there's a headphone jack the
volume rocker USB charging port there's
also a cover that he√≠s a micro-hdmi
port and a micro SD card slot so that
you can add more space to the tablets
built-in 16 gigabytes of storage on the
top edge there's a power button and two
microphones on the bottom left and right
sides you'll find the external speakers
would produce strong and clear audio
that's loud enough to hear over
background noise there's a 1.2 megapixel
camera on the front bezel the camera
quality is poor but it'll get the job
done if you need to do a video chat the
biggest knife against the Excite pier is
its 10.1 inch 1280 x 800 resolution LCD
screen that resolution is outdated for a
tablet of this size since the iPad for
the Nexus 10 another modern tablets have
much better screens the display is also
more reflective than many other tablets
we've tested which makes it tough to see
what's on the screen in broad daylight
or if there's any light behind you the
tablet gets its name because it's
running a pure version of Android jelly
bean 421 meaning there are hardly any
modifications to the operating system
from Toshiba inside the excite pure has
a 1.2 gigahertz Tegra 3 processor a
12-core nvidia graphics processor and
one gigabyte of ram the older Tegra 3
processor can make the tablet laggy at
times when opening apps are playing
performance taxing games but navigating
around the tablet is still snappy HD
video plays easily on the tablet but the
lackluster screen means video won't look
as sharp as expected toshiba added a few
features to improve video and audio
quality and they're worth playing around
with to find your ideal settings
the excite pure solid plastic build and
three hundred dollar price tag make it
ideal for kids and families you can read
