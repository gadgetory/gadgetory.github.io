welcome to tomorrow daily the best
speech talk show in the known universe
I'm Ashley sceva
Jeff kanata is out of town and we'll be
back tomorrow so for now let's hit the
headlines you may have seen fly boards
interesting water powered device but now
fly board is taking to the skies the
PATA
dropped a video this weekend showing off
a test of fly board air a board that
appears to be turbine powered the end of
the video claims the flight time was 3
minutes and 55 seconds and the board
reached speeds of up to 55 kilometers an
hour but sapota says this fly board can
actually fly for up to 10 minutes and
hit speeds shy of a hundred and 50
kilometers an hour it can also reach an
altitude of 10,000 feet max we'll see
how this pans out as they continue
testing and they also say they have a
mission 1 coming soon but it looks
really really cool and I really really
want to write it more transportation
news as the volocopter took its first
manned flight the volocopter has been in
development for six years and it finally
took its maiden flight last week with a
human pilot on board previous flights
have been unmanned for safety reasons
but this first manned voyage goes
relatively smoothly in the video so
those unmanned tests seem to have paid
off right now volocopter can't fly too
far since it's an electric vehicle but
the company is working hard on increased
flight duration which of course would be
the one thing that you would want if
you're flying a single-person drone
basically electric drone I think that we
should talk about fly board on
Thursday's show because obviously
everybody wants true hoverboards this is
turbine powered it's pretty cool we can
talk about jetpacks as well because
there's some other turbine jetpack
things that are happening in the space
if you guys want to get in on the
conversation use hashtag hey TD and talk
to us about it on Twitter and if we like
the tweets we'll use them in Thursday's
show isn't that being said let's check
out our phone tog refer the day
our phone tog refers a date today is
Jason who took this picture of a
landmark which is our April theme with
his Galaxy s7 edge Jason writes to us
and says hey Geoff Ashley Logan bonny
Chris Viva and all the good humans I see
Jason has been reading our credits at
the end of the show
it's Jason from North Alabama and here's
a picture of the space &amp;amp; Rocket Center
in Huntsville Alabama can you say Space
Camp I was driving home from work and
thought this was a perfect landmark for
this month's theme so I whipped out my
Samsung Galaxy s7 edge DoubleTap that
home button and within a second I took
this amazing picture I'm truly impressed
with their dual pixel technology what do
you all think well Jason I think is a
really good picture and honestly it
makes me want to run out of this studio
right now and go straight to Space Camp
straight to Space Camp also you were you
were selling us real hard on that s7
edge I'm just gonna tell you were really
impressed the old pixels you got a
double tap the home button for a picture
really great stuff you guys want to
submit your font ography the challenge
this month is landmarks points of
interest and monuments we would love to
see your photos please email us tomorrow
at cnet.com and do what Jason did give
us permission to use the photo tell us a
story about it and tell us what device
you use to take the picture you can also
find us all over social media and if you
