june 1 plus is releasing the 1 plus 5t a
follow-up to it's already great flagship
the changes are incremental but here are
the five differences you need a note
with thinner top and bottom bezels the
five to six inch screen is bigger than
before it's 1080p resolution is the same
though and it's just as sharp as the
five but with the bump in size its
aspect ratio change from sixteen by nine
to a longer 18 by 9
thinner bezels also mean you have no
choice but to have on screen
navigational buttons but the fingerprint
sensor which used to sit below the
display is now on the back oneplus made
some interesting changes to its dual
camera setup there's still a 16
megapixel main camera but what used to
be a 20 megapixel telephoto lens now is
a secondary lens with the same focal
length you can still capture bouquet
style portrait photos though and
one-plus widen the aperture on the
second lend so nighttime and low-light
photos look a lot more detail the
downside though is that there's no
telephoto or quote-unquote optical zoom
the zooming will actually be all digital
as we're software updates the 1+5 team
now has face unlock the feature only
works for unlocking the screen though
and it doesn't authorize purchases
through the Google Play Store or Android
pay or anything like that additional
software updates include parallel apps
which you can use when you have
different accounts on the same platform
like Twitter and Instagram you can also
view your photos and gallery by location
other than those changes however the
phone remains relatively the same it
still runs Android new get out of the
box and it has the same processor and
battery in the US the 5 T starts at 499
dollars which is 20 dollars more than
the 5 that jumps the price a little bit
but overall the phone is more affordable
compared to the top-tier flagships out
now if you have the 1 plus 5 don't fret
you're not missing out on much but the 5
T still brings in some welcomed albeit
incremental changes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
