the apple pie for all the good and bad
inside the world of Apple now things
have been pretty calm without any major
product releases right now that's why
you haven't seen me throw many bad
apples lately but there's plenty of i
watch talks starting with the report
from the New York Times that says Apple
is exploring a variety of different
charging methods for the iWatch
including induction charging that's
wireless and other options include solar
charging and movement bass charging as
well now the iWatch is still expected to
have a curved glass screen like many
have reported and the solar charging
layer in the screen could be similar to
the laptop patent we talked about last
week but that concept could be years
away now battery life continues to be
the sticking point according to the
report an apple already has a patent
application for a flexible battery shape
but the goal is still to have a watch
that last several days between charges
and we've seen a lot of different iwatch
concept but this guys could really be
the best one yet and really the only one
that i'd be willing to wear right now
check this i watch mock-up from todd
hamilton that looks like a hybrid
between Nike's FuelBand design and an
iphone he created an animated video that
really made me wet my pants and there
are plenty of still images to show how
some of these apps could be designed now
this looks amazing and now all they have
to do is work on making one out of
platinum or gold and bling it out just
call it the I bangle and yes I know what
a bangle is without having to look it up
and I think I'll just revoke my man card
right now I'll write in more I watch
news rumors Apple has also hired a sleep
expert from Philips research it's
another indication that biometrics will
be a main focus for the big a after
several recent hires in the medical and
fitness fields the Fitbit jawbone up and
third-party apps are already designed to
measure and track your sleep but it
makes sense to integrate that feature on
to their own wearable but that was the
biggest issue to me I don't want to wear
anything when I sleep now it helped me
to focus for the Cupertino Fruit Company
9to5 mac reports that apple plans to
release the next version of iOS with
health and finish tracking integration
as its headline feature their sources
say the iWatch is well into development
but Apple plans for iOS 82
an app code named health book that will
monitor in sort Fitness that such as
steps taken calories burned and miles
walk thanks to the dedicated m7 chip the
app is also said to manage and track
weight loss even though you can't stand
on your phone yet vital signs like blood
pressure hydration levels and heart rate
and other related data points like
glucose levels are expected to be a part
of it as well now some of these data
points pretty much depend on some sort
of wearable to track them like and I
watchin unless you can feel your
heartbeat in your pants so we'll just
have to wait and see how this all comes
together in this year now Apple is also
pushing hard to launch its new sapphire
plant in mesa arizona by februari for a
critical new sub component for use in
apple's consumer electronics according
to documents obtained by 9to5 mac apple
currently uses sapphire to protect the
iphone's camera lens as well as the
touch ID home button but documents make
it clear it's for a new part and that's
why Apple has an aggressive go live
timeline for the plan now earlier in the
week Taiwan's Apple Daily reported that
Foxconn had started a 100 unit run of an
iphone with a sapphire glass display and
a new patent application for an apple
device with the sapphire display was
revealed just a few weeks ago so how
sturdy is the sapphire display it's not
invincible but this arrow gear test
tries to show how durable it is when a
concrete brick is dragged over the top
and yes this isn't a drop or a shatter
but it's an example that it's going to
be able to take some of the general
punishment pretty well but really
without a close shot of the damage the
evidence still isn't very concrete and
in your iphone 6 rumors of the week
chinese website aitee 168 a site that I
know all of you go to says their sources
claim the next iPhone will have at least
a 10 megapixel camera with an aperture
of f 1.8 and improvement over the
current iphone 5s it contradicts an
earlier report from the china post that
says they'll be using the same camera
but that's why we call these rumors all
right let's check out the quick bytes
iOS 7.1 beta 5 has been released to
developers with a few new tweaks one
feature changes the keyboard to show if
the shift key and cap locks were active
iTunes radio now includes a by album
next to the individual song purchase
calendar brings a boulder event list
view button an apple continues to issue
patches for all you of Asian
jailbreakers also a BG our report says
we can expect to see iOS 7.1 to the
general consumer in the next few weeks
an apple releases new renderings this
time is their new massive proposed San
Francisco union square store that will
feature two forty four foot high sliding
glass panel doors allowing the building
to be opened up to the street now Apple
hasn't announced when they plan to open
the store that depends on a full review
and approval by the city the store will
also have regular glass doors when the
big doors are closed so think of them is
doggie doors for humans alright guys
that's going to do it for this week's
show email us at the apple bite at cnet
com or tweet me at brian Tong and i'll
get to as many as i can i'm brian Tong
thanks for watching and we'll catch you
guys next week for another bite of the
Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
