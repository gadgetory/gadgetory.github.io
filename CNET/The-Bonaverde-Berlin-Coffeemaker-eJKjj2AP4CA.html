food but it also applies to coffee this
is the bond of a table in an all-in-one
roaster grinder and coffee maker the
went gangbusters on crowdfunding
platforms to use the machine you need to
buy green coffee beans that come inside
this special pouch a sticker with an
RFID tag tells the Machine how to roast
them fill up the water reservoir adjust
the grind with this wheel then put the
beans in the top tray depending on the
beans the roasting process can take
around eight minutes and all up your
coffee should be ready in fifteen to
twenty minutes and because this is a
video you can't smell what's going on
but trust me it's strong there is a
replaceable HEPA filter that does dampen
part of the odor this is the first time
that I've had freshly roasted and ground
coffee beans I can definitely taste the
difference from a regular cup of coffee
it is more fragrant and it feels a lot
smoother to drink but there are some
caveats the first is price which is set
by the coffee grower that's in the range
of 1 to 5 dollars per pouch which gets
you around 6 to 10 small cups of coffee
in the future there will be the capacity
to use your own beans and an app to tell
the Machine how to roast them then
there's availability the company is
shipping beta units this year to backers
in Germany and Europe but if you're in
the US you'll need to put down a $20
reservation to hold a machine they're
expecting to ship them in December 2017
or January 2018 for $1,000
