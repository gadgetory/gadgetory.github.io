latest top camera it's not so much about
the image quality as it is about
becoming better more convenient end to
end actor device I mean the video
quality is still some of the best in the
category but for the hero4 black
upgraders out there you'll want it with
all the new features and the new design
the waterproof housing is now optional
since the body itself is waterproof so
now you don't have to worry about snow
rain or taking it for a swim you get a
touchscreen for controlling it or for
those times when you can't use your
hands you can just shout commands at the
camera to change modes capture photos
and video or tag highlights and yes that
repeats a motion another addition is GPS
and that collects data that can be used
for overlays and videos so you can show
how far how high and how fast you went
there's also electronic image
stabilization that does a fine job of
taking some shake out but it isn't
available in 4k resolution or above
sixty frames per second and if you're
not a fan of the camera's wide-angle
distortion you can switch to a new
linear field of view to straighten out
the picture there stereo audio and
improve the wind reduction raw and wide
dynamic range photo capture and it'll
even send your shots automatically to
the GoPro plus cloud service when you
plug into charge
video uploads to the service are done at
a max resolution of 1080p and there's a
$5 a month fee but it's Gophers way of
making sure your clips don't end up
trapped on a card and making it easier
to view edit
anyway battery life is about the only
thing that hasn't gotten noticeably
better though using the e is GPS and
even the built-in Wi-Fi still gets you
about an hour and a half of recording
basically this time around instead of
just offering the highest resolution in
the black it's now got everything making
it a truly top-of-the-line care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
