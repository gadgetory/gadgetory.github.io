tries to emulate a DSLR with that
blurred background effect in portraits
portrait mode on the iPhone can produce
great shots but does it come close to a
standalone camera we took out the iPhone
10 and a DSLR to take some portraits now
bear in mind this is not a comparison
these are two completely different tools
we're just having some fun so which one
do you like all these photos are
untouched on the iPhone we use the
default app in portrait mode and on the
DSLR a 50 millimeter lens if you chose
the image on the left
you picked the DSLR the one on the right
is the iPhone 10 both cameras generate
the blur in very different ways the DSLR
is all about the lens and the aperture
the size of the sensor also plays a part
in the characteristics of the blur the
iPhone on the other hand is software
based it makes a depth map of the image
using the two cameras to identify the
subject then blurs out the background
which is why it can sometimes get
confused let's get a bit closer to look
at the details this is at the same
magnification on both images if you
shoot in the default app the iPhone does
all the processing for you if you shoot
on the DSLR you have more control in
really low light the iPhone can't even
activate portrait mode as you might
expect the DSLR is able to take shots
regardless in ideal conditions the phone
mimics the effect well but it has a lot
of limitations because it's not just a
camera with the DSLR you can make the
image look exactly how you want it but
let's be honest you're gonna look like a
fool trying to take a selfie with a DSLR
so which one did you like more see you
Salah or iPhone 10 let us know in the
comments below and vote in a poll to let
us know which phone you want to see next
Galaxy Note 8 or Google pixel - so
moment of truth which one did you like
this DSLR in no contest okay miss DSLR
girl I would probably still choose the
iPhone 10 just because I can fit it in
my pocket and I would
all we have it with me in the moments
where I want to take the pictures yeah
but I can put the DSLR my very very very
big pocket yeah it was your fanny pack</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
