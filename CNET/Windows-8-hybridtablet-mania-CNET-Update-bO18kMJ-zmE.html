hybrid tablets I'm Bridget Carey and
this is your cnet update next time you
buy a computer it's time to consider a
hybrid tablet it's a tablet that comes
with a full keyboard that you could just
snap on and off and it's exploding
category this year with the release of
Windows 8 just this week alone there's
been several new models announced from
all the big laptop brands in the last
show I brought up the sony vaio duo 11
but there's also Dells XPS duo 12 that
swivels to hide the keyboard and the
dell XPS 10 it attaches from the
keyboard HP Envy x2 tablet includes a
full keyboard as well that you can
detach and Samsung's got the new series
5 and 7 slates and because Windows 8 is
all about working with a touchscreen
you'll also see full laptops with
touchscreens like the HP spectre xt
touchsmart although that might not be
very practical you see you gotta stretch
out your hand that touchscreen just kind
of moves back but we'll see so the
President of the United States was on
reddit don't know if you heard about it
it only took over Twitter all Wednesday
afternoon and crashed the reddit servers
with record traffic he participated in
an ask me anything session where anyone
can log on and writing questions and he
answered 10 of them but it wasn't so
much about the answers he gave it was
Obama showing he's in touch with
technology and Internet culture by using
reddit as a promotion tool at the end of
the questions he even referenced his own
meme saying that reddit is not bad so
Amazon made a big announcement that it
sold out of the kindle fire oh really
they sold out exactly one week before
the press conference when they will
announce the new version of the fire
ain't that funny how it works out hey
amazon we're not stupid sony announced a
cheaper version of its music streaming
service instead of the ten-dollar
monthly all you can listen to your music
service there's now a five dollar a
month option but it doesn't work on
mobile devices no mobile I don't know if
that's going to be a good seller lexmark
will no longer be making inkjet printers
it will focus more on laser printing and
office products a tomtom navigation app
is coming to android in october no price
info yeah
however the Apple version costs around
fifty dollars and also in the mapping
world Google Maps is making news first
Android users will now be able to get
turn-by-turn directions for bicycles in
the latest upgrade and for those of you
that use Google's map maker to tweak
your own maps you can share your maps
with your circles on the Google+ network
