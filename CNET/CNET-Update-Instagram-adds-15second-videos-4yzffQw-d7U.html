Instagram video I'm Bridget Carey and
this is your cnet of this lots of news
to talk about regarding Samsung and
Instagram but let's get to the biggest
story first Microsoft it backtracked on
its controversial Xbox one used game
policy Microsoft listen to complaints
from fans and it announced that buying
games for the xbox one will be the same
simple experience as buying games for
the 360 microsoft is also removing the
requirement to be always connected to
the internet to play your games you see
when the new xbox one console was first
announced Microsoft was going to put
some restrictions on plane used games if
you wanted to loan a game to a friend
you could only do it once and if you
wanted to play a used game you'd have to
pay some sort of activation fee first
and of course the only way from
Microsoft to monitor all this was to
require you to connect to the internet
every day it was confusing and people
were angry well all that complication is
gone now one of the biggest differences
between PlayStation 4 and the Xbox one
is the price the ps4 is one hundred
dollars cheaper Instagram just added the
ability to share 15-second videos
instagram which is owned by Facebook
updated its apps with videos that have
filters and you could start and stop a
video several times before you hit that
15-second limit it only plays once it
doesn't loop and you can choose your
cover thumbnail before sharing many
folks have been saying ooh this is
Instagram taking on Twitter's vine app
well vine is a six second looping video
Instagram is doing something more like
the tau app but regardless of what
service you like better prepare for a
wave of more videos in your social media
feed and Samsung announced several new
products include a new camera the Galaxy
NX is Samsung's most ambitious camera
yet it has an interchangeable lens and
runs Android 4.2 so you can quickly post
your photos wirelessly to any social
network or app samsung also showed off
its galaxy s4 spin-off smartphones
there's the galaxy s4 mini it has a 4.3
inch screen there's the s4 active which
is water-resistant and the s4 zoom which
has a 10x zoom lens attached to it
there's also a new line of Windows PCs
and tablets you see Samsung uses the
galaxy Branford's
android products but it has a new term
for Windows products called ative
spelled ativ I'm sure everyone's going
to mispronounce this but you could just
remember that it sounds like you're
trying to hold in a sneeze ought to one
of the more interesting ones is the
octave Q which changes between a windows
laptop and Android tablet you'll also
find the octave book 9 laptops the
octave tab 3 it's a tablet powered by
Windows 8 and there's the all-in-one
desktop called the octave 15 style
