today we're taking a first look at the
Samsung any five eight F 9 7 1 0 WS 5.8
cubic foot electric range with a price
point of $23.99 this range definitely
sits towards the top of its category but
Samsung has included a lot of features
to give it a lot of bang for your buck
one of the first things we noticed about
this model and have been really
impressed with since we've played around
with it is the combination of the
controls dials are used to control the
smooth top stove and this touchscreen
controls the oven you may wonder why
Samsung did this it seems a bit of an
odd choice but it's not when we're
unhappy about I really like the
confidence that that big heavy dial
instills when turning on the stove and
then turning it back off again as far as
the smooth top is concerned it's fairly
standard but Samsung has added again a
couple of nice features one it's got a
fifth burner that's used for warming and
it also connects the two medium burners
to form a bridge this bridge is really
great for things like griddles because
it keeps continuous even heat along the
bottom rather than a cold spot in the
middle of the two burners other than
that the stovetop is pretty standard the
oven is where Samsung has really loaded
a lot of interesting elements what
you're looking at right now is Samsung's
flex duo oven technology we're really
excited about this because in most
ranges where two ovens are created in
the space where one would traditionally
be housed the ovens are separate and you
lose the drawer on the bottom
Samsung has seen this as a problem and
has come up with a solution and giving
you this divider that is made of the
same material as the walls of the oven
which when placed in the right position
sensors activate and it recognizes that
you are now using two ovens that Samsung
claims will operate independently of one
another at two completely different
temperatures we're really excited to
test that fully and see if it lives up
to the hype but if you don't want to use
the Flex duo divider Samsung has
included your traditional sliding rack
so that you can use the oven as one
complete entity a trend we're seeing now
with ranges is using the drawer on the
bottom for greater utility some ranges
use it for baking or broiling what
Samsung has done is give a warming
drawer that has three different
temperature settings low medium and high
we could see this being a really great
feature particularly around the holidays
if you have a lot of casserole dishes or
a couple of pies that you want to keep
warm but not take up any space in the
oven as we said earlier the oven is
controlled through this touch screen
it's pretty responsive from what we can
tell and seems to work well but we'll be
sure to put this range through a full
battery of tests to really see how it
stands up and whether it is in fact
worth that $23.99 price point stay tuned
for our full review of the Samsung ne5 8
F 9 7 1 0 WS 5.8 cubic foot electric
range but until next time I'm Katie toll
