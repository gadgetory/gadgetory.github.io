there from companies like Samsung LG
Fitbit and jawbone but one device flies
under the radar and offers even better
tracking than the rest I'm dan Graziano
and I'm here with the life track Zone C
410 this little device can track your
steps distance traveled and calories
burned it features a built-in heart rate
monitor and has one year of battery life
thanks to a user replaceable coin
battery it's also waterproof up to 90
feet meaning you can wear it in the
shower or even go swimming with it
similar to others fitness trackers the
zone C 410 is able to track your sleep
but unlike the rest you don't have to
enter a special sleep mode to do this
the watch can automatically detect when
you are sleeping although I found this
feature can be fooled when you are
sitting still or if you take the watch
off the zone C for 10 syncs with Android
and iOS devices to a special life track
app it's also compatible with
third-party apps like Argos and
MapMyFitness that gives you a single
location to view all of your data from
the past day week month or even year in
it you can easily customize your profile
with your height weight age and sex
while also setting goals for your steps
distance calories and sleep another
unique feature is being able to
calibrate the watch for even better
results there are three calibration
settings in the app default option a and
option B option a increases the
sensitivity of the pedometer while
option B decreases the sensitivity you
can also choose to manually program your
own calibration settings but even on a
default option
I found a watch to be one of the most
accurate activity trackers out there the
life track Zone C 410 is available now
in the US Europe and Australia be sure
to check out the full review of the Zone
C 410 for more information I'm Dan
Grazia reverse Annette and that was a
first look at the life track Zone C 410
