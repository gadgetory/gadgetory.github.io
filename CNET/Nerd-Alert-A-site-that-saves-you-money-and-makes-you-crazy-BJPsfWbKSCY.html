at amazon com and prices on their
conflux shoe eight sometimes a little
sometimes a lot but there were a bunch
of times when I'd manually check prices
day in day out and I'd still buy
something and a few days later the price
would drop and I just hate everything
anyway a while ago someone told me about
camel camel camel and it's basically a
website with a most terrible name ever
but it tracks prices for amazon products
and you can see like the items history
and the lowest highest and average price
and you can get alerts when it hits the
price you want and it's just totally
useful the thing is though that this
site has turned me into some kind of
weirdly intense amazon shopper I mean
I'm not involved in any stocks or
investments but the way I news camel
that's kind of how I imagined strung out
stock brokers to be even with mundane
stuff I buy like toilet paper or shampoo
my internal monologue goes something
like this the lowest price the shampoos
ever been was five dollars four months
ago now it's ten dollars but the average
is eight dollars so he'll know I'm not
going to buy it but I got to wait until
the supply the man pushes it back down
to eight dollar market price so then
maybe I'll buy it okay maybe at seven
then I'll buy it then only one at seven
I'll by then sell buy sell buy and in
the end all this tracking of like
dishwashing soap and glade plugins saved
me like what six dollars but I don't
really care because I feel like one of
those smart consumers everyone keeps
talking about well I feel both smart and
also embarrassingly cheap but you know I
can handle that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
