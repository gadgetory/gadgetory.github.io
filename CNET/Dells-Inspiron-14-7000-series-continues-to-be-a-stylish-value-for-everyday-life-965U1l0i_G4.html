people care more about value and
performance than they do about looks or
how thin and light a system is but if
you care about both you'll probably want
to check out the dell inspiron 14 7000
series
I'm Josh Goldman with CNET and this
laptop offers very good performance in
battery life in a slim light aluminum
body that is sturdy enough to handle a
daily commute last time we looked at
this series even the 850 dollar entry
model had a full HD screen and a backlit
keyboard but Dell dropped the price to
$800 and dropped the screen resolution
along with it so you'll have to pay a
thousand dollars to get one with a 1080p
screen but you'll also get an updated
dual core Core i7 processor instead of a
Core i5 and two gigs of additional
memory for a total of eight gigs all of
the configurations come with a 500 gig
hard drive but if you want to spend 50
bucks more you'll get a 32 gig mSATA SSD
- that's what we tested and it performed
very well it's no powerhouse nor is it
meant to be but for general office work
in entertainment and light photo and
video editing it's plenty battery life
on our video drain test came in at just
less than 8 hours which is great you can
read the full review on cnet.com but
while the entry model isn't quite the
bargain it used to be this series
continues to be a nice balance of value
in style
I'm Josh Coleman and that's a quick look
at the Dell Inspiron 14 7000 series</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
