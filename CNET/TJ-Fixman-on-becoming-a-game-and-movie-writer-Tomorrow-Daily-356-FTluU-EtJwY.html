toothbrushes and whether or not they are
really necessary racing drones with the
power of your mind and a plant sphere
that will probably kill us all then
special guest TJ Fixman stops by to tell
us about writing for videogames and
movies it's fun we also have a very
special package about drone racing the
drone racing league is here it is really
cool and producer Logan got to check it
out so you do not want to miss that
don't miss it daily tommorrow daily the
best eat rocks on their own universe I'm
Ashley Scott and I'm Jeff Kanata
oh my gosh it's not part of the week
it's my favorite part of the week we can
do dive I wish we could do an hour every
day but it's really hard to book guests
you guys Wiig Angus would have to be our
guest three out of four days of the week
and he is not very talkative so I don't
think that would work out but we got a
lot to cover it's episode got a lot of
really cool stuff definitely a hundred
percent stick around for all the things
we have in store what's at the headlines
okay and break it down Ashley let's
discuss gunplay young play turning your
mouth into a playground isn't that is
that not what they call themselves that
should be the tagline if it's not they
can you guys have it ok smiling he's
brushing his teeth he's playing an
instrument is that the weirdest way to
hold him toothbrush I mean I have never
seen anybody hold a toothbrush like that
but okay so this is an attachment a
smart attachment internet-of-things
attachment that you stick on to the end
of a toothbrush any toothbrush that will
fit the attachment it looks pretty
standard there it is right there so easy
and then you sync it up to an app and
the app has three different things on it
up and mouth news now the monster so
mouth band you play a little musical
instrument like kind of cool as though
yeah I'm gonna play the drums and that's
like as you're brushing yeah he really
is not even look like he's pushing down
that hard and then there's mouth news
where it's like three minutes of
customize news and then there
is mouth monster which is one where you
like fight against your cavities and
your plaque the question here is and
this was you guys had a lot to say about
this honestly I think some most the
maybe the most feedback we've ever
gotten about a story in a long time it's
it's it's a lot using that hashtag TV
yes what are some of the comments well
we we asked the question in the episode
on Monday does everything need to be
smart yeah and wow you guys really
adamant about your answers our sin I
don't you adamant about my answer maybe
yeah we're gonna get into that we Jeff
might actually go on a rant so stick our
sin wrote in and said smart toothbrush
seems like it'll target children users
and parents it'll make daily brushing
fun for the children
okay I don't disagree with that I don't
disagree I think anyway you can get kids
to actually sit there and brush their
teeth good thing
Derek wrote and said I want to play Star
Wars dental front there you go shooting
up evil imperial plaque troopers and
facing down Darth dentists Dark Lord of
the drills that Plex too powerful for
blasters it's true
I like John's answer he said gunplay
could be a great way to get my
four-year-old to brush see similar idea
on America's greatest makers use the
floss Luke come on Gavin wrote in and
said not everything should be smart who
will want smart toilet paper nobody
I want my toilet paper to be as dumb as
possible yeah I think so and then bed
jam wrote and said I definitely don't
think everything should be smart there's
something about using your own brain
that just makes you feel human and I
thought that was interesting not not
makes you feel right makes you feel it
human like I really like that choice of
words so good point there so the idea
here is that we are not willing to brush
our teeth unless there's some sort of
game or entertainment or beautifying it
by again gamification is like a big
thing there's like the art life RPG
right where you can do your whole oh
your habit and I get that I like games
I'm a big fan of games I like game of
fine stuff and turning things into games
but by the way could they not get a
single person that knows how to hold the
toothbrush and their toothbrush in Japan
maybe that's how they teach you I don't
know might be of course I'm a cultural
divine guy sending your phone
agra fee and show us how you hold your
toothbrush this month's theme brushing
your sake right now no we're not are you
in favor of this actually are you are
you are you Pro toothbrush games okay
I'm gonna say this I am Pro toothbrush
games because I think people don't
realize how long you have to brush your
teeth for like if you actually sit down
and put a timer on like brushing your
teeth and you have it over timed it
you're probably not brushing for as long
as you need to
it's true um but but I I have a real
problem with wanting to connect
everything because it's so cranky like
it's if you're gonna do it I mean I know
that we have to go through all this
awkward phase of internet of things not
all communicating with each other but
it's like if you're gonna do it it needs
I I don't know I I do like that it's
sort of an attachment so it's like you
don't want to use anything you just take
it off it's fine but I say no like I
don't don't make everything smart like
because then it'll just make us dumb
like I don't want to do that don't make
us dumber it's because if you enable
people to not take care of themselves
like if they rely on a machine to take
care of themselves like it's just that
is a slippery slope it ends badly I
think yeah can I have like two minutes
of my life where I'm just doing the one
thing I don't have to meet multitasking
that's yeah exactly it's like man it's
like listen I get it like sometimes I
like to you know read while I am eating
or like but just focus I don't know I
mean I like the idea of motivating kids
to brush their teeth longer but you know
what else motivates kids to brush your
teeth longer brush your teeth longer
feedings
Tasers morale improves yeah I mean I'm
just there's certain things about
self-discipline I have to you know like
night yeah we just like people right
exactly there's there is a self
discipline aspect here that is very
important and I think that not
everything's fun
yeah not life is hard this is the most
important thing we're gonna teach you on
tomorrow dailies that life is not always
fun sometimes life is hard I mean listen
we get to have fun here 45 minutes but
the rest of our lives are terrible what
a lot of work and hard hard work that is
not necessarily like
in a traditional sense goes into making
this part of the show 45 minutes of
doing the show literally every other
minute of our lives is just brushing our
teeth yes all we do you think it's easy
to get on camera and not have brushed
your teeth for 17 straight hours that's
all we do every person you've ever seen
on television brushes their teeth the
majority of their day all the time but
yeah I mean I think that's that's what
that's all I can say to you guys that's
all I can say to you sometimes life
isn't fun and you have to learn that
through things like brushing your teeth
and being bored out of your skull also
tonight tomorrow tonight when I brush my
teeth I'm gonna hold it very beautifully
it does look very delicate it doesn't
very delicate okay really quickly let's
touch on racing drones with your mind I
was not here I was filming tabletop
that's right I'm a guest on tabletop
season four very excited about that
played codenames was very exciting game
but you got to you got to talk about
this which is really cool this is a
whole bunch of students that were able
to race drones with the power of their
mind with their brainwaves yeah so how
cool is that
these focus on making it go forward and
it goes forward and yeah okay so they're
looking at this little object on a
screen yep and then basically it's like
okay focus on making the object go
forward and then they sort of animate it
moving forward as you're thinking about
it and the software recognizes what
parts of your brain are firing while
you're thinking of that idea and that's
how it they use it to control the drones
yeah and this is all these kids are this
is the Ender's Game all these kids are
then they didn't realize they were
actually fighting in the real
intergalactic war oh I just spoiled a 30
year old spoiler alert ya know I thought
this was really cool that they're
developing this I know that there were a
couple people who just briefly like
looked at the headline and it was like
well that's dumb like racing drones with
your brain seems really stupid but the
goal is and this is the important part
if they can get people to be able to
control things like drones with their
brainwaves they can also get people to
control things like prosthetics
toothbrushes toothbrushes wheelchairs
robots holding toothbrushes to brush
your teeth with
ya know that it actually could be a very
powerful tool for people with
disabilities which I think all this sort
of expanding it out getting large
datasets getting P lots of different
people to wear these things and try them
out now this it's funny how this relates
to the first story that we talked about
because this is a way to use fun as a
method to sort of gather large data
samples get people to do with a thing
you know sitting there and concentrating
on a thing on a screen is not fun but if
you make it fun now all of a sudden
you're incentivizing so maybe we're
backtracking a little bit on not
everything should be fun cuz this
actually seems like it should be fun at
first toothbrushes it really is raah
groans brush drone tooth brushing it
really does um I like that we're tying
this all together and becoming
hypocrites in the process so our last
story that we wanted to talk about is is
sort of ecology in urban areas yes
through whoredom machina b which i think
is amazing thank you this is this is a
bunch of architecture students and they
basically created this it's kind of
cybernetic it's a plant ball geodesic
sphere which if you it looks like it
looks like playground equipment
which it is I mean it's judy's you see
those at playgrounds and then inside it
has these panels that have plants on
them and then yeah you can see it all
expands and stuff and then it's like if
the plants can go to the edge or it can
it can it can retract all the way in and
so it can move
it's got actuators in it that chain is
not gonna scare anybody I mean it sort
of reminds me of for some reason as I
was watching this did you ever see the
movie rubber the tire that kills people
you won't ever see a rubber what okay
terrifying
I saw a giant ball of plant roaming
around on its own this is what this
needs
okay it needs a microphone and a speaker
inside it to where the person
controlling it can be like hey what's up
man yeah or like I need Missy more yeah
exactly I mean I would love it if we
played music like beautiful relaxing
music as it rolled around town I could I
want I actually think this is a really
cool concept and an idea of making
making
taking the idea of Technology and
organics and kind of fusing them
together into something really new I
think it's cool the end result is a
little terrifying and weird what's
really big things that that's a thing
but I like the idea of nature moving
around in the city just like people like
you that's sort of context yeah because
the thing is if I'm in a city usually
there's like some gardens that you could
go see or like there are places you
could go to see plant life or ecology or
something green to relax remind you of
being in the outdoors but I like this
because at any given moment in your day
you could be pleasantly surprised
crushed by a rolling garden no you'll go
right through it because there's holes
I'll roll right on you just Laden it'll
just go just have like leaves in your
hair I was just in a wonderful way by a
plant and now what that is if it's cut
Amar'e Damacy it is it's like a cat it's
like a plant Katamari love it I love it
um fear us wrote in use hash hash tag
hey TD and said not sure who's gonna
take over humans first robots are giant
plant balls man I don't trust the giant
plant balls
I don't know I don't I don't know how
first they come for our toothbrushes
it's true then they come for our brain
powered drones then they come then they
come for everyone but I just saw they
were just all like inside the plants you
know no we become the plants that's the
end of the Twilight Zone episode we're
gonna write you I think are the plant
ball I think we just wrote an episode of
The Twilight Zone we did and pretty
person is called balls of plants plant
balls
plant balls we're not good at title
maybe somebody can think of a good title
that would be great
by the way breaking news Alicia vikander
is gonna play Lara Croft oh I see a bike
and ER I think it should be a TV show I
agree with that but I mean they like the
movies and it's a really big franchise
it's a really big franchise but it feels
someone is I love the idea of like
episodic adventures that Lara wasn't
going on I agree I I did I'm kind of
shocked I thought Daisy Ridley was a
lock for it so Alicia vikander she was
in Elysium I can was
in it right she played oh wow Eva she's
Eva Eva I was like yeah that one yeah um
yeah great stuff so that is it for our
headlines we will be there's a tweet
that I was looking for that I
he didn't tag it hey TV and both of us
and I said I'm gonna save this for
Thursday show and I'm so sorry that be a
lesson to you person who I promised your
tweet would be on a show I don't know
where it is there's no hate eat eat at
hashtag you may as well have just been
rolled up in a plant ball and rolled
down the street and we don't find it and
rolled off the edge of the earth because
they're gonna find it it goes flat yeah
exactly
um so that is that is headlines I really
enjoyed that that's great tonight we
will be right back
we have TJ Fixman ah he's gonna come in
and he has written Ratchet and Clank
games he's writing the new Popeye movie
he's got a whole bunch of stuff going on
guys a whole bunch of static around and
he's going to talk to you about writing
videogames and movies so yes as jeff
says sick rant welcome back to the show
our guest today is a real-life paid
Hollywood writer not just some Rando in
a coffee shop working on his magnum opus
uh you might know him from such games as
Ratchet and Clank and he's also a
creative consultant for Hasbro we are
excited to welcome TJ Fixman thanks for
being here man don't you have me so good
um so okay a lot of people out there
first of all love videogames
many many people love video games love
Rochon klinken you you've written
Ratchet and Clank games how many of them
oh god yeah you know I have to go to
IMDB to be sure but I think it's either
7 or 9 it's it's up there it's up there
how great is it that Ratchet and Clank
is back at the top of the charts again
with an amazing installment I mean I
think people that are playing really
good
well even alive when the first one came
out I think I mean they're I think the
first one came out in 2002 so yeah this
is and this one is a sort of reimagining
of that first game so it's very cool
it's phenomenal I mean I am loving it I
just got my job back
oh nice jet pack on gas bar um so they
have a film and there's a film yeah
great
are big and backhand ready this weekend
the movie comes out um but I wanna a lot
of people really wonder what it takes to
be a video game writer because I think
that's sort of a job that like has a lot
of mysteries because in early days of
gaming there was just sort of like well
let's just have our producers kind of
come up with something we'll have some
bear coat you know our programmers come
up with something let's have sort of a
basic thing and then you ended up with
you know the end of ghosts and goblins
where where is this or you don't get to
the end of ghosting that's true nobody
ever did that um but now we are seeing
very much so in the last you know 10 or
15 years of video games we've seen
really screenwriters people who are
actually invested in story structure
format you know things like that coming
into gaming you got into video game
writing kind of in a really weird way
and it's one of my favorite stories of
starting in that industry and I like can
you tell our viewers because I think
they'll enjoy it as much as I did yeah
sure I mean I came out to I came out to
Los Angeles with a degree in computer
animation and hopes of writing and and
the the degree of animation was very
much my safety fallback because I knew
the odds of becoming working with plan B
so I ended up out here simultaneously
like writing and trying to develop like
a 3d animated show by myself one person
in the room which is well I said because
it's impossible I'm saying it's
impossible to do after like two years
I've done almost nothing done and I was
I was working at insomniac games as a QA
tester and this was on back in the
resistance fall of man days back with a
ps3 I just come out and my contract was
wrapping up I'd sort of finished the
game and I was ready to leave and I
didn't have any job lined up afterwards
I you know I had an agent I've been
taking meetings I've been trying to get
my scripts out but like nothing was
hitting so like I was looking at my bank
account I'd $250 left of my bank account
I had no backup plan I think a lot of
people don't realize as a QA tester that
in gaming like you don't stay at the
company usually when you're done testing
that particular game like you're on a
contract and when that game is done
being tested you are also done yeah it's
a contract job you know that going in
and so so like it's so like I finished
the game it was very much time to say
okay you know so long and thanks for all
the fish and sure and I'm at and I was I
was packing up my desk and I did I was
unaware of the time but right
that was on wrench and flank tools
destruction at the time for whatever
reason it wasn't working out between him
and insomniac so they're gonna part ways
but he had somehow read some of my
scripts and like we've talked in the
hospital but I didn't show him anything
I guess just the scripts sort of get
around in this town Wow I mean he's like
I'm sorry that I didn't work out but
actually I've read that guy stuff and
it's really good you sure like film spec
scripts unit spectrums that I'd written
and apparently he he'd read some woman
he recommended me so as I'm packing up
my stuff pH our director came out to me
and asked if I would come back on Monday
an interview for the job as a writer Wow
so I spent that entire weekend
unemployed you know two inches nuzzle my
bank account like talking to my parents
but how I'm going to be able to
basically have to move home and figure
out my new jersey I couldn't afford the
move so I wasn't sure how I was how to
get yeah yeah and Monday I came in
interviewed for it and they gave me the
job and I think I started like on
Wednesday so that was that's incredible
and you know a working writer ever since
yes yes yes ever since oh yeah and I
stayed in something for a good long time
I think was like seven or eight years
and then I moved on in 2013 now I've
been sort of contract mostly doing
feature work but doing of course the
Hasbro stuff as well so what is the
difference between writing for
interactive entertainment as opposed to
writing for films and TV I mean it's
it's it's a totally different ball wax
and it's super interesting I always tell
like writers who are coming in like if
you ever want to sort of see what you're
made of like boot camp is like video
game writing is boot camp essentially
because imagine hiring everybody at once
the director the actors the production
team without a script ready and just
saying everybody go right I'll catch up
exactly selling down the track space
leaves the train is coming through Wow
so it teaches you to be agile teaches
you not to be too precious which is a
big like it's tough for a lot of writers
today's the idea that you know just
submit a script and it's just right you
know like sighs I never finished but I
think it's more it's more so video games
where nothing like you can write the
perfect third-act twist and this is the
example it was usually wait the perfect
third-act twist the designer can come up
to you like but I'm so sorry we just cut
that level yeah how can you just make it
work yeah sure a lot of this right never
seen oh no we don't have any more any
more time for scenes just make it work
just find some way of sort of tying it
together my question to you about that
because as a player you you feel that
right and I wonder if you
feel like games need to get to a place
where that is more valued like the
narrative experience is more valued and
and there's a shift in of priority as as
far as well video games are made right
today like this is a great script let's
make it into a game like this is a great
game script or great you know sort of
synopsis or log line for a game like
let's make it that I think I think there
are I think nowadays there are studios
that are getting more and more story
conscious like if you look at a rational
with like kind of you know whatever
Bioshock if you look at what a behenna
did with the Uncharted series there are
more and more students who are adopting
that philosophy yeah but production is
always against us like there's always
gonna be something this happens in
features to them to a smaller degree
except it starts with misses the story
but like with with videogames it's
always going to start with the tech so
if a video game studio finds that they
can do zero-g really well well guess
what kind of game you're ready that's so
interesting to me about it's like well
we have this really great we developed
this really great technology like let's
craft a game around it and it's like I
said it's a mechanic something that
we've developed and it's like man we
have to use this in a game like let's
make that work well look so interesting
look at portal like like portal is the
best example that portal had one
mechanic right which is this week and it
was amazing Academy they built this
amazing story around it was like all set
in one location with like one and it was
amazing so I feel so like you know it
sounds when you lay it out doesn't sound
like the ideal way to work but it's very
much the way that the entire industry
operates into a small and a great
features and you just learn to deal the
end and it that's what you need to learn
as a writer regardless of a night you
going to video games whatever you have
to learn not to be precious well I like
your work with Hasbro is probably from
the same vein because you start with an
IP right you start on send and you have
to build a world around that exactly
that's the thing that I love doing the
most I got like when people ask me if
I'm a writer I always sort of say yes
I'm weird a bit also a world builder
because there's something fun about not
just building a building or like a
three-act story but saying here's how
the world works here's how the
characters interact with each other
that's really really fun so to get to go
into Hasbro who has all these amazing IP
like transformers and GI Joe and
micronauts and like and get to sort of
play around with that fear
have a little connect like that that's
that's really cool I feel like I feel
kind of Tom Hanks and Big Boy's its game
it all together yeah it's cool and you
know they give me lots of toys which is
always a plus and you know yeah now you
mister zircon is I think one of my
favorite Oh evil robots HK 47 I mean I
just really love them in gaming and so
mr. zircon also a favorite but it can be
really difficult I remember we're
talking about this the other day it's
really difficult to continue to come up
with one-liners he has to constantly
have these you know quips in the game as
you summon him and it's like they have
they can't be too repetitive yeah so
over the course of however many seven to
nine Ratchet and Clank games like how
many lines
mr. zircon would you say you've written
usually 500 easily but and probably
closer to a thousand under start
thinking like what probably what made it
into the game right and the funny thing
with like mr. zircon was that like when
we first started him he was just like a
little bot that would sort of fly around
you and he didn't look he didn't look
like he did now he looked what we call a
consumer Bob just one of the bots that
sort of flyer in the levels they did
snack with the ranch and I have to
credit to Brian Allgaier for this was
Brian elegant my creative director was
like you know something like we can give
personality to this thing so let's give
it a name it's called mr. zircon we're
gonna overhaul its looks and there's
what would you do with it and I was like
what if he just thought everything was
stupid what if we talked to the third
person and he trash-talk but it was just
in the most like obvious like sort of
Chuck Norris style yeah or like mr.
zerkin doesn't need nanotech to survive
in the face with bullets like I mean
yeah he will give you a concerto of
suffering it's like that way to write it
it looks dumb and when you recording
like that sounds dumb but let's someone
when you get in the game you're like
that's actually just words but it's
really funny I became like this fan
favorite ever since so so I you know I I
take it as a source of a great pride
that it's become this big you know a
weapon in the game that I don't think
they would do a red flag in but that one
now it's kind of the groove at right now
the people yeah people just expect it
associated with the characters yeah yeah
personality so you you came into the
industry in such a roundabout way what
would you say is your advice to people
who want to get in starting QA and then
just hang around
I just secretly drop scripts next to the
writer well the thing that people do
incorrectly is they they go to school
for I can get like a degree in game
writing and they apply for it and they
look for game writing jobs game writing
jobs really aren't advertised online
maybe that will change and like I've
seen a couple pop up here and there but
really that like they gain studiously
their hire from within or they'll
they'll reach out to people who have
representation of an agent or have done
a lot of samples but either way the
trick is to have lots of samples ready
to get a degree or some sort of
experience inside a game studio or a
computer animation agree let's say or
like a design degree because it you know
I think one of the reasons why game
studios lean in towards producers or
people who have game experience or
animation experiences because they
understand what the other departments
are up to you understand that process
yeah and it's a very complicated like
process with tons different departments
all working you know 60 70 hour weeks to
get this game so like I think when
people just sort of get a degree in
writing and just expect to go in there
and pitch a game idea them all that that
doesn't do anything for against you
because kids do this or not it wants a
lot like they've got plenty of their
ideas and you can find people who can
read stuff but what they need is
somebody who understands the different
departments so if you've got a design
degree if you've have even an art degree
or an animation degree you're gonna be
ahead of where just a you know I was
somebody with a writing background if I
if I was had just been a writer and
didn't have the background in in
computer animation I don't think I would
have gotten a job because while I was
doing resistance fall of man they needed
somebody who from QA who could handle
collision or who could handle what they
call nav machine which is a sort of
mapping out where enemies can walk I
think they've got programmers that can
do this automatically now but back in
the day yeah you have somebody yeah sit
in an office until I four in the morning
actual work yeah so like I think while I
was doing that it was sort of proving to
the people who I worked with like okay
like he's not just a writer but he also
understands yeah he understands what the
other departments are up against so
you're not just sort of coming down from
your ivory tower saying here is my
script yeah maybe so
understanding of like when your as
you're writing you can think of you can
keep other departments in consideration
where you say like if I'm writing
something like how are they ever going
to program this like this is not
realistic you can actually edit that
down in a way that a writer not
experienced in the games industry would
not be able to do absolutely that's
animation as well because there's
there's there's things that like I'm
dealing with like on pop by now because
I'm gonna pop out for certain animation
where if you know what's an intensive
animation scene of what's not the
production team will love you for it
like I know that I can't write all crowd
scenes because it's tough it's expensive
it's time intensive and a pisses
animators often if you can just say hey
reaction shot well something happens
off-camera it's like people will see
like okay like you understand that you
can't just flow from your the people you
work with in a narrative way which I
think a lot of people don't really a lot
of people don't grab onto that as much
as I think they like you see things or
people go well why didn't they just
write a scene like this like you know
you see all these like yeah it's like
they see armchair quarterbacks on line
they go well they should have written
this scene then it's like we have to
consider all of the different
departments that would have had to have
contributed to that scene and how
expensive it would have been and you
know and is that part of the budget and
is it this and it's like there's usually
a good reason for why something didn't
exist oh yeah I mean like we live with
these games for you know anyways between
one years and three years so we with
every we've had many many meetings about
every single possible iteration of a
scene that can possibly be but you know
like I remember seeing one common where
someone's like why aren't like you know
Ratchet and Clank sequence is more like
a final fantasy I'm like Final Fantasy
will have a 500 person team we're like
everything that was done that insomniac
was done in-house which is which is very
rare yeah you know like so it yes like
there are certain things who want that
we wanted to but it's always about
picking your battles and saying okay
like what is this story really about is
is there something that we're putting in
just for the sake of flash or is there
something that that we think we're
saying really matters yeah yeah I'm
excited for a great I mean I haven't
seen it's ever since the Robin Williams
when I've been like one of them what am
I gonna
made it pop oh yeah I'm excited about
that well we'll wrap things up we'll let
you go I'm sure you you are very busy
man be on this show for like two months
I have so many meetings I'm sorry I'm so
busy I can't huh but we're really
excited you can check out Ratchet and
Clank the movie drops in theaters this
weekend which which is cool you wrote
the first draft for that
and and then also you can of course
check out wretch and click the game
which Jeff and I have been greatly
enjoying it is really and if you've
never met mister zircon well just let me
tell you you're a treat and and then you
can follow TJ on Twitter just add two to
Fixman TJ Fixman and thank you so much
for coming on the show we'll be right
back with an amazing package about drone
racing and that producer Logan put
together so stick around it's tomorrow
daily welcome back friends the TJ
fellows were pretty fun what a delight
yeah he's like a big old bowl of ice
cream looks so great so we had the
enormous pleasure and honor of attending
drone racing I'm so jealous I didn't get
to go to this Logan and I went to the
drone racing leagues second I believes a
third qualifying match a race in Los
Angeles called LA pocalypse and producer
Logan put together this just spectacular
piece so take a second and watch the
drone racing these piece that he did
FPV drone racing is already a huge hit
amongst RC hobbyists and at the sport
continues to grow in popularity so do
pro circuits the drone racing league or
DRL is trying to take the sport to the
next level with awesome looking race
track designs innovative tech and some
of the coolest broadcast equipment we've
ever seen this is Dr Al's first official
season and we got to go to their second
qualifying event level 2 la pocalypse
set in a real abandoned shopping mall
near Los Angeles PRL CEO and founder
Nicolas Corbett Chesky gave us a walking
tour of the enormous post-apocalyptic
track this is a very cool setting for a
drone race because it allows us to use
the full three-dimensional elements of
racing so the drones go up they go down
they come around and those drones aren't
just flying up down and through simple
hoops DRL worked with Hollywood special
effects company legacy effects to create
a one-of-a-kind environment their
experience working on films like
Jurassic world Ironman and Pacific Rim
really shows in this elaborate course
design not only does DRL have to
consider how pilots from all over the
world will fly through a track but also
how spectators would be able to see the
drones which travel up to 80 miles an
hour at times do this they borrow cable
system called the bat cam which follows
long and even gets ahead of the action
so the back cam is a cable cam that runs
over the length of the course it can go
a hundred miles an hour you got a 100
mile an hour camera chasing an 80 mile
an hour zone so it's a it's pretty
exciting when they're both going full
speed since racers require our constant
video signal from the drones fpv camera
to see where their quadcopter is going
at all times
DRL had to create a lot of the tech they
use the drum racing league has designed
and built our own radio frequency
equipment from the ground up and it
allows us to put on rage courses on a
scale it's never been seen before each
drone is also built from the ground up
by DRL this is our second model drone
it's called the racer - it's all carbon
fiber and it's designed for speed and
maneuverability but also for visibility
for the audience you'll see it's covered
in these LED lights that when they're on
are brightly lit and each in a different
colors you know which pilot is flying
which drone DRL provides its own drones
for pilots because of that racers can
push the limits of their quadcopter and
compete on true pilot skill as opposed
to technical enhancements ro is taking
chances we want to go as fast as we can
and you know get that adrenaline rush up
so you need to do so as we live for as
pilots we often say to the pilots if
you're not crashing you're not racing
part about watching drone races feels
like you're in a science-fiction film
and if the race comes to your area get a
ticket you won't be disappointed I wish
that I'd been part of that I really we
didn't know it when you guys got invited
to this we were all like yeah that looks
awesome the way the broadcast cameras I
mean they really are gunning for a super
high quality experience and I think that
they've achieved it I I can't wait for
the day where they're unfortunately
because of laws that dictate you know
drone flying us up they have to be
indoors yeah so I think that there's got
to be the one thing I wish I had like I
love that it's indoor I agree we loved
the abandonment it's a real abandon
mom's amazing we have to walk around in
it
I think that the one thing they really
need and cuz they do have the glasses
that you can sort of check out and then
you put them on and you can watch from
the drones point of view which is really
cool but I think they need some kind of
like Jumbotron or a big screen to sort
of like switch we need somebody live
switching those qualifying matches to
get the crowds really pumped about it
and not so much you know because they're
kind of watching and then it's like you
can kind of see some stuff going on I do
have a scream it it's like it's not the
same I kind of want this to take off and
become a bigger thing I think people
would I super skeptical when I first
heard about it but it really looks like
a fun spectator sport it's way more
exciting than I thought too we got there
and I was just super I was really
shocked at how excited I was and how
much I was into watching the drones race
really brilliant of DRL to put a special
LED lights of every color for each pilot
yeah for sure
it's really really cool so thank you to
the drone racing league for letting us
go do that I really appreciate it and we
can't wait to check out what the finals
are before that I think they did their
first qualifier was inside an abandoned
nuclear plant oh my god okay I think
upstate New York they had said there was
one in Miami and that was very like
slick and futuristic and colorful and
stuff and then they did la apocalypse
they'll have I believe they said six
races this year so if they end up coming
to a town near you you should definitely
check out what they have going on uh so
that is just about it for the show do
you want to talk about into it though
let's do it
Jeff what are you into I'm into a movie
this week I mean we are on the precipice
ladies and gentlemen of the summer
blockbuster season yes
civil war looms as the official kickoff
I would call that the official kickoff
of the summer blockbuster I think so I
think so but before you get excited
about that and you should be excited
about that there is a small movie that I
think you should watch now this is a
very rated are very violent very intense
movie but if you are a person that likes
those kinds of things I cannot recommend
green room higher this is from the same
director that did blue ruin this is if I
told you Ashley what if Quentin
Tarantino got to write a die hard movie
I'm excited about that I be into that
this is kind of like that basically it's
the idea of these these kids that are
part of this punk band and they get a
gig at a neo-nazi club like this
underground neo-nazi club and then
things go real bad real fast and there
as they tend to do at neo-nazi cool yes
and they're kind of trapped there and
it's like what do they do how do they
get out what's gonna happen to them it
is absolutely a Patrick Stewart isn't it
he plays a neo-nazi you've never seen
Patrick Stewart card play a villain like
this it is one of the most intense one
of the most thrilling one of the coolest
movies I've seen all year
I'm certain it will be in my top 10 at
the end of the year it is that good Wow
I was on the edge of my seat exclaiming
at some of the things that would happen
the violence comes out of nowhere is
intense and awesome and the coolest
thing about this movie and the my
favorite thing about movies that are
kind of like die hard is the characters
are smart they handle things in a very
smart way and you love that when you
feel like you're in this situation with
these characters you're like oh my gosh
what would I do there and they'll always
want to feel like that was a really
smart thing that they did yeah yeah
great great movie wow I'm getting sort
of Walter White vibes off of like
Patrick Stewart yeah yeah yeah yeah hey
Walter I'd say Heisenberg like later
seasons again like
and Berg vibes off of Patrick Stewart in
this so yeah that looks really good it's
awesome I'm gonna do a video game this
week oh so as as we all know I love
indie video games love small video games
little anecdote before I tell you what
game it is but when I got my PlayStation
4 it was at launch and and there wasn't
a whole lot of launch titles I was super
interested in but there was one game on
PlayStation 4 PlayStation Plus that was
free and it was resogun oh great game
and and my PlayStation 4 was
legitimately a resogun machine for about
4 months
housemarque the developer who made
resogun made the game I'm into this week
it's called alienation mm-hmm I don't
know if you've seen anyone yes I just
got a review code last night I asked I
beg I was like please just give me a
code I didn't even I was like I'm
begging you please it kinda reminds me
of Diablo high reminds me of Helldivers
and that sort of it's a dual stick
shooter it's guys like that 3/4 top-down
look to it but it's so colorful which is
unlike a lot of the top-down shooters
we've seen like Helldivers very d
saturated the habló desaturate this is
full color craziness I mean unbelievable
action going on you can play with your
friends it's online co-op you can do all
the things um I just dug into it last
night but I'm really really into it
right now I can't wait to play more I
will be I'll be splitting my time
between that and a certain major triple
AAA game that will be dropping on May
10th that Shall Not Be Named be talking
about yet but yes that might rhyme with
like one blurted yeah that smarted but I
I wouldn't be splitting my time because
this game looks super fun and I I have
been I did a tutorial and the first area
last night and I really really liked it
and I'm really into it so housemarque so
far so good really looking forward to
playing more and digging deep into
alienation and it's I think it's like
like 15 or 20 bucks I'm very very cool
those are some good into it's to keep
you excited over the weekend keep you
keep you tied it over until Civil War
next weekend then you're gonna see that
over and over and over
ok we're all gonna be doing together
alright so as is tradition on tomorrow
daily how does a tradition so weird
let's start
better front agra for the day this is
where we do our regular ritual our phone
target of the day today is Andrew our
very last of monuments places of
interest landmarks took shot this on his
iPhone 6s and said this is my photo at
Capilano Park in Vancouver BC thank you
for having your talk show and seen it by
the way I took this photo on my iPhone
6s camera you have permission to use it
um he did he did all the right things
gorgeous picture and and the reason why
I picked this is because I felt this was
a great argument for vertical photos oh
I was just gonna say that I wish that he
had done it landscape no but I think the
verticality of the trees really lends
itself to a vertical photo and that's
why sometimes a vertical picture is
better ah is so good I think the framing
of this is so good the bottom third has
the river then you got the middle thirds
trees top third is the sky it's great
photography this is I'm not going to
argue that that's not a great feature
and I'm really pleased that he sent it
in but team landscape and Rio until I
die high fives for me I say in landscape
unless you can get a better more
beautiful ratioed picture and that was
are these cases it's a lovely picture
and you can have your picture on our
show as our phone talker for all you
have to do is send it to tomorrow at
cnet.com yes and make sure you do these
great things tell us how to pronounce
your name if it's a difficult name which
most names are for us assume we're not
bright is what we already otherwise just
say tell us just how to pronounce you
secondly give us permission he's your
picture on the show cuz we need that
also tell us a nice little story about
your picture even if you made it up we
just like stories it could be fiction
we're not we're not saying it has to be
true and then the last one is of course
tell us what device you took it on
because it is phone tog refer the day
and we want to know what phone you took
it on or little things you got to do
also next month's theme we decided is
spring spring so any springy pictures
you want to spring on us we don't
appreciate ya and interestingly enough
