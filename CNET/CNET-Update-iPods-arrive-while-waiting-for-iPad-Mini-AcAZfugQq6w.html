I'm Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update the new ipod touch and ipod nano
are now shipping the touch starts at
three hundred dollars for 32 gigs of
memory it has a larger screen and works
with siri just like its iphone cousin
and for the first time it comes in a few
colors it's coated in tropical shades of
pink yellow and blue as well as light
grey slate and red for the product red
foundation the Nano is one hundred fifty
dollars and comes in even more colors
adding green and purple to the rainbow
and the evolve music player has a design
that looks like a super shrunk down
iphone with a center home button under
the 2.5 inch touchscreen aside from the
new ipods the hype just continues to
grow around the next ipad mini a
researcher at 9to5 mac posted photos on
Twitter that appeared to be real photos
of the back of the ipad mini showing the
thin body and the smaller lightning port
connector at the bottom now pricing will
be interesting if the ipod touch starts
at three hundred dollars you gotta
wonder will this new ipad model also be
around 300 maybe even a little more the
competitive price point in the 7-inch
category is two hundred dollars but
Apple may not care to compete closely on
price if there are high-end features
while apple's tablet gets smaller
google's tablet is getting larger i have
here the google nexus 7 tablet but
google is working on a 10 inch version
of this according to an analyst at NPD
DisplaySearch this would be a high-end
device made by samsung facebook wants to
be more like pinterest it just added a
feature called collections or you can
mark products you like into a wish list
first a retail has to create something
called the collection on their Facebook
page only seven stores are doing this
including Pottery Barn and victoria's
secret users can collect those products
posted to their wall and file it to a
category I found it to be pretty buggy
when I tried it out and I couldn't find
all the items I collected in one place
so on Facebook irons this out you'll
probably see this at more retailers
today's appt to watch is one that could
be handy if you've been procrastinating
on ordering prints of your digital
photos it's called free prints right now
it's only for Apple mobile devices but
it'll be on Android by the end of the
year what makes free prints interesting
is that one menu it pulls in all the
photos you have on your device as well
as social networks like Facebook Flickr
Instagram and Picasa just check off the
images you want the sizes you want and
get the glossies mailed to you it's
called free prints but it's not
completely free you still have to pay
for shipping and it costs about the same
as you would pay for an online service
like snapfish that your tech news update
for today but we got links to all these
stories at the blog sina com / update
from our studios in New York I'm Bridget
