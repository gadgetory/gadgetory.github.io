the buzz report the show about the tech
news that everyone is talking about this
week it is Christmas we are on vacation
and of course gearing up for CES in
January but the year would not be
complete without our annual best of the
buzz compilation the cheap shots the
dirty jokes and occasionally even the
cogent analysis or something like that
enjoy a new segment that I'm calling the
balls on China late last week it was
discovered that five fake apple stores
were operating in the chinese city of
kunming and now pc magazine reports that
another fake store has been photographed
in chengdu now they look exactly like
apple stores even down to the employee
lanyards and t-shirt in fact some
employees said they thought they were
working at a real apple store anonymous
says that Facebook needs to be destroyed
because it's turning over personal
information to the government and spying
on us which I know I mean I guess that's
bad but what about my spine I need
facebook to find out if that one chick
went to that one party and flirted with
that one guy I like and I need to know
who got fat from high school and what
about my scrabble games anonymous and
where am I gonna post pictures of my
food Molly you think that's bad November
fifth is my birthday how is anyone going
to know dude that's my birthday too
happy birthday yeah score one for Apple
and the great Apple Samsung pissing
contest of 2011 a judge in Germany says
Samsung cannot keep selling the galaxy
tab 10.1 anywhere in Europe well except
the Netherlands for some reason and now
for a new segment here on the buzz
report you people are turning research
in the UK found that one in six mobile
phones were tainted with e-coli bacteria
which is typically found in fecal matter
yep you have poop on your phone I guess
the good news is that five out of six of
you are not filthy Pink's let me break
it down for you stop doing your business
while using your phone and for God's
sake wash your hands although best part
of all look how easy it is to install
that is amazing let's watch that again
in slow mo uh-huh have your electrician
on speed dial for that one other than
that it's actually pretty awesome for a
thermostat and another Apple related
news it's time for my favorite segment
the balls on China Chinese police shut
down a smuggling operation that was
sneaking iPads and iPhones across the
border from Hong Kong how well this is
the balls part allow me to demonstrate
first the smuggler shot a crossbow from
Hong Kong into shenzhen province then
they zip-lined bags with apple stuff
across the border so they wouldn't have
to pay import taxes Houston Nia I think
I final fight regulation is to listen to
CD 54 in touch phiyega saga makula
visitas i'm stunned oh hey she's all her
hair and now for the news facebook held
a press event this week to announce
something awesome and here it is a short
tutorial on the meaning of exponential
growth if you plot it out the amount of
stuff that people are sharing it's
growing at this exponential rate you
know one of our investors always tells
me that humans are really bad at
understanding exponential growth but you
don't tend to look at them like this
because they just go off the chart too
quickly so you tend to look at them in
what we call a log normalized graph
right so that way if you look at the y
axis here it's on it's skewed right so
it's not going up linearly what I really
find amazing though is that Google
apparently agreed to take its wallet
feature out of its flagship here
android phone that was supposed to get
mobile NFC payments off the ground and
give us a japan-style mobile phone
payment system for the future grow a
pair of Google in its earning report
this week sensitive little netflix says
it just hates to upset its customers
with that jagan dis rate hike and it
understands that this decision will
cause some of you to quit the service
and Netflix is just really sorry
although netflix says most of you won't
quit and the extra money that netflix
rakes in from the hike will let it reach
the magical goal of 1 billion dollars in
revenue during a single quarter it was
ridiculous at one point coo Tim Cook
said we were selling so fast we think we
might have accidentally sold a couple
newtons in other news this week i would
like to thank cameron and tyler
winklevoss for providing me with a
steady stream of news i can't believe
the winder boss boys as you recall were
denied their grudge match against
facebook for the third time last month
but despite three federal appeals courts
telling them they have no case the
mockery of millions and the fact that
their settlement is now worth about a
hundred million dollars the whiner
boss's plan to take this case all the
way to the US Supreme Court I mean why
not the Supreme Court has nothing better
to do than indulge a couple of rich
white boys who had that one good idea
that one time and apparently haven't
ever had a good one since and that's it
for this week everyone thank you for
watching and we'll see you next year
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
