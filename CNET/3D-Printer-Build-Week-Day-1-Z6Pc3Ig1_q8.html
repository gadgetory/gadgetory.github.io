fitzgerald and welcome to cnet's 3d
printer build weed so Matt what are we
doing here again today one of the bowels
of the cnet lab and we're going to be
taking a look at 3d printers 3d printers
were shown at CES this year they seem to
catch a lot of people's attention and
today we're going to attempt to assemble
long ourselves so our goal is kind of
the educator so hopefully educate you
and to that end we got in touch with the
people at Maker gear not MakerBot it's a
different company but the maker gear
folks were nice enough to provide us
with this DIY kit so we don't really
know what's in this box at all we
haven't opened it yet so Matt do we know
what's involved with that process at all
no and since we like challenges instead
of buying one assembled we figured we
would attempt to assemble it ourselves
but we're being told by them that it can
be about eight hours to put it together
although we've read from other locations
that it can be as much as 16 hours to
put it together so let's see what we're
in for alright alright so we've got like
a parts list we do we have a nice
identified parts list right Oh lots of
good stuff good stuff so do we have the
like kids at Christmas here power
supplies it's like a pretty
straightforward oh yeah they're USB
cable electronic assembly with with
included USB cables this is part of the
balsa wood assembly on the outside of
the printer and as you can see from the
burn marks it's actually laser-cut that
means it's accurate but because it's
also it's also pretty cheap so that
helps keep the price down to a lot of
things that makes these ready for
consumers this is the build platform
where the acts the final 50 piece will
sit on the top of so we've got another
part of the balsa wood assembly here
it's all part of the framework of the
chassis of the unit the electric motor
assembly that will drive
the chapter of the extruder head is also
in the bag that is the part that
actually injects the liquid melted
plastic to form the item that you're
printing so this is the Z rail motor
assembly so Z refers to the axis so it's
a 23 objects and that means you have
three axes to worry about x y and z so
there's a motor that drives the extruder
head along those three axes and that's
what this is this is the z axis model
the calibration of this is what's very
critical to make in the end to making
sure that the object comes out exactly
as desired I'm for the Y rail yes sir
probably looks a lot like 20 I'll get
controls or the other directions yep
yeah so this is the filament this is the
the consumable this is the ink for the
printer essential so make your gear was
nice to throw in a sample spool and this
is translucent it comes in all kinds of
different colors though I don't know as
far as how much volume of the spool is
but one thing that we can say this
particular model that we're assembling
has a 5 inch by 5 inch by 5 inch build
platform so in theory any object that
can fit within a 5 inch cube that's how
large we could print with this
particular model so here's everything in
the box here the instructions we print
it out earlier they even provide you
with all the tools you need to get it
all settled so that's great let's get
started alright let's go
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
