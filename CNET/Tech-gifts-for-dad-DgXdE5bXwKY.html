but I Z bottom basically live in a time
museum in the back of his closet along
with the slippers in the monogram
bathrobe he never wears this year
surprised the guy was something
different gadgets I'm Donald Bell and
this top 5 i'm counting down some of the
top gift picks for dads selected by
cnet's team of experts starting off in
number 5 get him a new car it's wishful
thinking I know but since we review a
lot of cars here at cnet I figured we'd
throw one in this year the cure to dad's
midlife crisis is a 2014 chevy corvette
stingray fifty two thousand dollars get
some a smoking car with a lot of tech to
fiddle with now unless you won the
lottery you're probably not getting him
this but I had to mention it just for
his sake with something a little more
practical try number for a new phone if
the old guys still walking around as
antique blackberry on his hip show them
what real phones are like these days
samsung galaxy s5 for the maximum bells
and whistles HTC One m8 for style or
galaxy note 3 if he has an inferiority
complex or reads books and large print
coming in at number three a tablet
you're tired of him taking your tablet
into the bathroom get him his own tablet
the ipad air is gonna have the most show
off power whether he uses it or not if
he's more of an android guy go with the
nexus 10 if he's 90 give him a slab of
granite and chisel seriously he'll
probably get a kick out of that and
number two upgrade his home theater tech
he's more of a couch potato you can go
with a roku 3 or a roku stick if he
fancies himself more of a music snob you
could try the sonos play one AKA that
some of those people can actually afford
two hundred dollars and it comes fully
compatible with your dad's weird taste
in music finally a slam-dunk pick for
the number one gift for dad bigger TV if
he's a stickler for picture quality go
with the Samsung pmf 8500 series the
last of the great plasmas or for extra
big screen bang for your buck try the
sharp le 650 you series both aren't an
investment but as you already know once
dad falls asleep on the couch you can
change the channel and pretend it's
yours so there you go five solid tech
gifts for dad that will leave the old
guy feeling appreciated for more ideas
including the best games for dad
computers cameras and more head over to
Dad's cnet com Donald Bell thanks for
