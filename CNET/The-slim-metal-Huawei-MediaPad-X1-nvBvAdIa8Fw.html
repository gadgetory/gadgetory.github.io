the hallway media pad x1 a 7-inch
Android tablet with a full HD display
the quad core processor and 4G LTE that
means that this slate is arguably more
phone than it is tablets the slate is
clad in a cool blue metal shell which
apart from making it feel nice and
sturdy also looks pretty good too
that's helped by its skinny body and
narrow bezels around the screen which
make it look like a much more premium
luxurious device there's a speaker at
the top on the face and a microphone in
the bottom which means you can make
calls send text or use 4G LTE data just
like any other phone it's only at sheer
size that means it's probably not going
to be suitable as a phone for everyday
use the display has a full HD resolution
which makes icons and text looks
satisfyingly crisp it's bright - and
have good colors and viewing angles
making it well-suited for watching
Netflix shows or just browsing the web
running on the disappointingly old
Android 4.2 jellybean has its core but
who are away his its emotion
interface over the top with no apps
right it takes a bit of getting used to
from regular Android but it's wide
selection of themes that change app
icons and color schemes at least makes
it a bit fun inside it's running on a
1.6 gigahertz quad-core processor which
has plenty of juice video streaming or a
bit of gaming the hallways software
doesn't seem to make good use of the
power hand navigating around the
interface can be very sluggish in
January and there's often a delay of a
couple of seconds between hitting the
home button in an app and actually
seeing the icon on your home screen
although I like the customization
options of Huawei's custom interface it
comes at the cost of seriously limiting
the protesters power making it at times
very frustrating to use I would love to
see a version of this tablet with stock
Android on board around the back is a 13
megapixel camera and as a capacious five
thousand and milliamp hour battery
inside although it's let down slightly
by its old Android software and its
clunky interface the x1 7-inch display 3
petal body and into
the LTE connectivity they get a good
option to consider if you're struggling
to decide whether to splash out on a new
phone or a new tablet
