ass in almost every way except for the
most important one
this bosch 300 series dishwasher is a
disappointment but it's a really good
cleaner $800 not cheap for a dishwasher
and yes it's pretty quiet at 44 decibels
but this thing doesn't really have any
features to speak of though third rack
no unique cycles not even a touch panel
four controls who uses buttons anymore
it doesn't even have an Express cycle or
a countdown timer yes the display
estimates how long a cycle will take
when you're picking between the options
you do have but that estimates usually
way off then when it comes time to load
the dishes you have to tangle with these
racks which are arranged in such a way
as to be almost completely inflexible
only two sets of tines fold down a lot
of the times are really close together
if you have large or oddly shaped dishes
good luck finding a spot to put them the
upper rack does change positions ever so
slightly but jerkily suck whatever I
loaded this thing I wanted to throw it
out a window fortunately there are no
windows in the dish lab because once
this thing was done let's just say that
whatever dirt you throw into this
dishwasher it'll be able to handle my
goodness can this thing clean dishes
there was a little redeposit here a
missed spot there but we're really tough
on our dishwashers and this $800 box
scored over a 90% on our cleaning tests
that's amazing and the best result we've
seen including some $1200 machines so
yeah it almost pains me to say it
because I find it so frustrating to use
but if you're willing to put up with a
few headaches for a dishwasher that's a
masterful cleaner I absolutely recommend
this $800 Bosch dishwasher
