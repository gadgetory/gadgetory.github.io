Scott Stein I'm sure and we have been
here for two hours plus we've gotten to
try a our demos we've learned a lot we
have a lot of thoughts let's go with our
top ten takeaways from the show
it was all about software no hardware
whatsoever we saw a lot of updates to
iOS all all of Apple's various operating
systems got updates to a our kid there
was a lot of AR discussion a
particularly multiplayer something a
Google had discussed at i/o here and the
idea is then anyone maybe up the
thousands of people could start playing
in the cloud or locally and that's a
pretty big development plus there's a
common platform file type that's that's
going to be developed with Pixar that
could open up air in all sorts of places
apples made new software to help us kind
of put our devices down instead of
checking them all the time
this will let parents monitor what their
kids are doing you could set up alerts
to tell yourself hey you've been using
Facebook too long basically to kind of
help us combat this phone addiction that
we all seem to have there were a lot of
watch OS updates but not necessarily the
ones that I was looking for particularly
no watchface store and no sleep tracking
although there is a walkie-talkie mode
which seems pretty useful and there are
some new fitness modes and there was a
new pride watch face and there's a lot
of little incremental things but but for
Apple watch it was kind of a little bit
of a quieter note one of the really big
announcements is they reiterated again
iOS and Mac OS is not merging they're
gonna stay separate but starting next
year
iOS apps so iPhone iPad apps will be
able to run on Macs
we already saw that with a few apps that
are going to be coming later this year
the news app stocks you know various
things that they've already made of
their own that were just on your phone
just on your iPad now you can get it on
your computer there's a series shirt
cuts which is seems to be apples way of
trying to have Siri do more things fast
for apps so basically apps have to hook
into this and you have to knit that in
and then once you have a shortcut
you could use these shortcuts app to
bundle a bunch of those and be able to
create all sorts of other ways you could
access stuff with Siri and create your
own little vocal cues so a lot of the
features this year were more about
performance more about kind of like
little nitpicky things as opposed to
huge massive changes this is good news
for people who have old iPhones Apple
spent a lot of time trying to make sure
that your iPhone 5s or whatever older
device you have is still going to be
able to work really well with iOS 12 and
you know work even better than it did
with iOS 11 Apple TV you know the big
announcement maybe was dolby atmos
support to set that up with your
speakers at home
as far as cable boxes they were still
promising the idea that it could replace
cable boxes but for very few cable
providers at this point only one in the
US and I think two overseas and there is
going to be a zero sign in way of
automatically recognizing your broadband
and connecting but that again which
providers are going to have that you're
the one signing also took a while to
catch on another thing that you'll see
is with an emoji you'll be able to stick
out your tongue which apparently is a
big deal and you can also make me emojis
so it's little little animated heads
cartoons emojis of yourself we saw this
with Samsung with the new Galaxy S 9
they came out with a are emoji those
were really criticized because a lot of
people felt it didn't look like them so
we'll see what the Apple ones look like
and the ones we saw you look more
cartoonish but there's a lot more ways
to customize them Mac OS did have a
bunch of updates even though it seemed
like there wasn't necessarily gonna be
all that much a few of those Mac OS
Mojave is going to have a dark mode
which actually sounds like something
that would be great to have on iOS but
doesn't exist and a way to take all that
stuff on your desktop all the clutter
and apparently organize it and find some
sort of logic to the clutter and and
then also that you know the future of
support like you say with iOS but and
then a couple of key apps that are gonna
make their way over there to voice memo
new stocks stocks has
so then like it's like a news with in
stock so stocks and news news and stocks
I don't think that's all all of the big
stuff Oh
face time yeah you'll now be able to
chata have groups of up to 32 people in
a FaceTime chat at the same time yeah
FaceTime was one of the weirdest demos
on stage because it was a mix of not
just people but also people with um with
an emoji heads and and a mix of avatars
so suddenly you had like people with
realistic looking avatars and people
with animated ones and there was they
had an emoji or me emoji Tim Cook so
it's pretty hallucinatory maybe the
future blend of PR and reality where we
will not know the difference or
something so that was what we saw at
Apple's WWDC this year no new devices
here lots of software we're gonna see
more this fall yeah hopefully a lot of
devices we're expecting iPads and Macs
and iPhones and watches so stay tuned
also the public beta hitting at some
point the summer great thanks so much
for tuning in thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
