cybersecurity is waging between Silicon
Valley and law enforcement I'm Bridget
Carey this is your scene at Update
the future of your privacy and the
security of all software now rests in
the fate of a legal battle between Apple
and the FBI on the surface the issue may
sound simple Apple has been ordered by a
judge to help the government break into
a locked iphone for an investigation and
Apple is refusing but before you jump to
conclusions here's a quick breakdown of
what exactly the government is asking
for and how encryption works the Federal
Bureau of Investigation is trying to
access the locked iphone 5c that
belonged to Syed Farook he's a shooter
in the San Bernardino terrorist attack
from December that killed 14 people but
there's a passcode on the iPhone and if
the FBI guess is the wrong passcode 10
times everything on the iPhone is white
so the FBI makes a request to a judge
please order Apple to write a new piece
of software to load into the phone so
that the FBI can try an unlimited number
of pass codes to get into the phone
without the data being all erased a
California federal magistrate judge then
makes the order for Apple to comply
essentially asking Apple to cut a
security hole into its iPhone software
but Apple is refusing and appealing the
decision CEO Tim Cook issued a statement
arguing that this would undermine the
security of all future iPhones so why
won't a police make an exception for
this one terrorism case well security
experts all say the same thing if such a
backdoor exists if software to hack an
iPhone exists then it can be used again
and again by the government for anything
and more importantly software can be
easily copied and sold then anyone can
use it to hack into your phone security
then becomes pointless for all of us
going forward and that is why this is so
controversial if you want to stop a
terrorist you break all means to protect
everyone from any type of hacker as well
this is not just an Apple issue other
tech companies want customers to trust
their data to be protected the head of
Google products sundar Pichai offers
somewhat tame words of support to Apple
saying on Twitter that forcing companies
to an able hacking could compromise
users privacy so what happens now Apple
says it's gonna fight this legally it
could go as high as that you
Supreme Court but in the meantime a
judge could in theory punish Apple and
hold the company in contempt and impose
fines or even throws someone like Tim
Cook in jail but that sort of drama
seems unlikely that's it for this tech
