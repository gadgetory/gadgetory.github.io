children and everyone at Apple I'd like
to thank you for honoring Steve with the
trustees grammy award steve was a
visionary a mentor and a very close
friend I had the incredible honor of
working with him for the last 15 years

told us that music shaped his life it
made him who he was everyone that knows
Steve knows the profound impact that
