nitty gritty details of Android Nucky's
lumia 630 maybe the phone for you it's
extremely affordable has a vibrant
interchangeable covers and it runs the
latest Windows Phone 8.1 software nokia
loves slapping bold colors on its lumia
range and the 630 is no exception
this yellow back is almost too bright to
look directly at rather like an eclipse
and the orange and green options are
similarly garish coloured casings are
removable allowing you to swap them out
when you fancy a change or just when
your current one starts looking a bit
battered the display has a disappointing
854 by 480 pixel resolution which falls
below the 720p screen on the similarity

Android a little confusing the new

like a pull down notification menu and
the ability to set your own photos as a
background nokia has thrown in some of
its own app - like the GPS satellite
navigation tool here drive and mix radio
which lets you stream free music
playlists - good job nakiye included own
stuff as Windows Phone still suffers
from the lack of apps you will find a
lot of the big names in there like
Netflix and Skype but it almost never
gets new after the same time as iOS or
Android software runs on a 1.2 gigahertz
quad-core processor which seems more
than capable of handling most tasks
you're likely to do around the back
you'll find a 5 megapixel camera it
captured some acceptable shots although
you will want to try shooting a manual
mode as the auto white balance wasn't
great there's no flash over so you can
forget about taking pictures in the dark
if it's cheap price colourful body and
easy to use software the Lumia 630 is a
decent option for those of you looking
to take your first smartphone steps the
ones that avoid the often complicated
way Android like to do things bear in

less and as an Android phone you'll have
considerably more choice of apps fewer
