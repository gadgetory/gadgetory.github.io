are at CES 2014 and if you don't know
already wearable technology is
completely blowing up the show there are
a lot of smaller companies who are
actually innovators in the space one of
them is a company called Martian now
they've announced a new product called
the Martian notifier which if you look
at it it just looks like a normal watch
it has an analog face very elegant very
you know very premium look to it but you
know just tapping here and you'll see it
has a little thin OLED that will display
notifications and they will be pushed
over Bluetooth from your iPhone or your
Android device you can receive emails
texts caller ID and as a matter fact you
can also look at it discreetly without
bothering anyone or even looking at your
at your wrist you can just get a
vibration alert that you set up using an
app which is called the Martian notifier
app where you can have say you know four
different buzzes you can have it set up
so that you can know what's happening
without even touching your wrist or you
know interacting with the watch at all
so one of the very interesting and
compelling things about the Martian
notifier watch is that it has a very low
price point it costs 129 which is
actually very agreeable considering that
the first original pebble costs 149
dollars so you get a lot of this 21st
century messaging and alerts for a
pretty agreeable price point
you get a lot of this classic analog
style know as well so that's a very nice
thing and you know hopefully we'll get
to see this watch very soon if you want
to buy one you'll have to wait until the
mid 2014 perhaps a spring to get your
hands on one I'm Brian Bennett for
cnet.com and you've just taken a first
look at the Martian notifier wash</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
