this week's episode of welcome to
android Atlas weekly episode 92 the
final adventure I don't know I should
have come up with a better subhead there
for now we are now we're not here final
frontier that's taken why not all right
we'll just rip stuff off yeah is that
owned by CBS that's cool right yeah yeah
only it's not ours yeah fair use
excellent yeah so as you have heard last
week and other places around the
internets this will be let's just say
we're going on hiatus until the year
2020 probably I think we're going to
restart after CES in January 2020 yeah
I'm like a lamp that work for your
schedule I don't know about that you
know they'll have to like look that up
but ok well we will send you a media
invited to get back to us yeah january
twenty twenty so until then rather than
sort of leave you with a bunch of old
news we wanted to give you a show that
you could basically hold on to until
then and just listen to over and over
every week and we are going to predict
what is going to happen in the Android
ecosystem drink between now and 2020
yeah sound good sure work for you
alright we're going to do this in the
style of previous prediction shows such
as the one we did in i guess like
december of 2011 so this is this only
eight years away 2020 sounds crazy like
crazy here but that's eight years right
not very far not very hard be 21 do we
have child labor here is this Foxconn or
something alright so we're gonna do a
little round robin we're going to start
with jmr he's going to tell us what he
thinks and then we're going to point and
laugh all right my first prediction is
that Google Play Movies we
bre rebranded as YouTube Google Play
Movies re rebranded as YouTube yes that
is right now there's a disconnect
between YouTube yeah yeah Google movies
whatever it's called what about the rest
of Google Play google play about google
play music perhaps the whole thing will
be re rebranded as just the google
market I think don't the movies already
play in the YouTube player on the web I
think because I bought I bought net
bought I rented reservoir dogs and then
how do you do that oh wait you can't
play Google Play Movies on your phone if
it's rooted and so they said well just
go on to youtube and watch it there i
still haven't done it oh did you think
about a quarter cuz i did ya ready or
four quarter but then something about
seeing the YouTube icon in the corner
just turns on that two-minute attention
span and I'm like I can't sit through a
whole movie with that YouTube icon in
the corner well if you can't now you
certainly will be by the year twenty
twenty I like this i think this is good
yeah i buy it I think it's a good
rebranding alright I'll go next I am
saying that Motorola I think you're just
safe i'll just say yours you have a safe
bet there yeah i'm going out a little
limb motorola will cease to exist as a
separate entity and it just gonna be
part of google no one will say motor oil
anymore it'll be google phones hmm I
that firewall did that silly it's not
going to happen what if they would if
it's the other way around what if google
just says there's more Keshi motorola
and so we want to change all of our
mobile initiatives to motorola play
youtube it could be let me mow to roll
of that up for you yep I think really
like you know you call it roll in like
I'm at a role that search real quick see
how it works out they have they have a
longer history right you know didn't
they have like some of their products
we're on the moon landings and stuff
like that yeah they mean they've been
around for as long as the radio has
haven't they um you can sure I'll say
yes that might be a stretch well I mean
that is not the radio but they've been
around since the days of radio
communication I think then they get
their start in like you know like walkie
talkies or something
hey it sounds right it did I don't buy
that I'm making these things up well
that's what we do here I'm gonna I'm
gonna mark what you saw you that well
yeah what do you hear I was gonna roll
that and she if there was actually a
fact it's gonna catch on trust me okay
let's we'll keep working on that but
when I give us your that your prediction
I'll start with a serious one if serious
as it gets those android custom skins
that I hate so much since you I TouchWiz
whatever else they'll eventually grow
out of control and the OEMs want to
seize more control of things and they'll
eventually morph into offshoot branches
and OSS OSS OS is in and of themselves
they'll probably start building their
own app stores their own sort of music
distribution services to get around
Google's rules for saying if you want to
have the android google play market on
your device you have to do this and in
much like how we see different
distributions of linux like for example
ubuntu which is basically linux but it's
something else we'll start seeing right
phones that are based on android but not
powered by android so this is basically
what amazon is done yes for it will see
you see what amazon you've done is gonna
I mean the question is if at that point
apps will be interoperable it probably
will which you probably would have to
say for example if you buy an HTC phone
you wouldn't be able to just pop on the
Play market you'd have to pop on to the
HTC market play market interesting I
could see that seems potentially
possible but well feel like we already
saw evidence of this last week two weeks
ago at this point when HTC is rumored to
be purchasing mog there is a
distribution service that could be a
step towards hey we want our own music
distribution and we want to step outside
of the umbrella of google play because
google wants everything to look like ice
cream sandwich and we want things to
look all since Ian we want rain widgets
and we're you looking simply put in a
real sense a today so I guess is the
underlying question here
that the openness of Android will breed
Oh future fragmentation we will finally
live up to the the promise that all of
all the doom and gloom that we've been
uh that we've been forecasting well that
is teary on a lighter note yeah what do
you got next day bar um you know it kind
of dovetails pretty well I think with
what Antoine said I think android will
be available as a standalone desktop OS
and it will come loaded with chrome
browser similar to the way windows comes
with ie and I think that might mean that
you know desktop OEMs you know my might
add their own skins and and an
installable saw are not an installable
software software that you cannot get
off just say crap where crap where so
Android to this is basically taking what
Motorola has done with the laptop not
laptop but what do they call them went
top yeah exactly and actually saying
this isn't just a novelty now this is
your actual OS it's all in one thing
yeah the eighth asus had the thing and
the thing and the thing yeah I'm duckin
of you mean like I had a phone top yeah
3 user goes phone outlet that becomes
the laptop I mean like art tablets
already doing that I mean it seems like
we're instead of starting from I
understand what I think that's actually
a good point but I think instead of
starting from a phone standpoint it'll
be like oh yeah instead of I think it I
think maybe tablets will just take over
the phone market I mean the laptop
market in general I will start seeing
more of that where if people will you
know maybe have like some sort of a all
of their stuff will be stored on the
cloud maybe they'll have a keyboard they
hook up to it every now and then for
working but then you know maybe it just
doesn't even matter what OS running cuz
it's you're really just running the
webos not the webos but I see what you
did there the web bonus I like it I you
know i'll give you i'm already starting
to see people just like oh yeah i have a
tablet I don't even have a laptop
anything I need to do that it can't do
my tablet I'll just borrow someone
okay your salon see here or go sit down
at the office and do it I know people
who do that I mean I'm gonna reserve
this one but I think you're certainly
going to see this my question is is that
the majority or is that the minority of
sort of how people use it I feel like
eventually that will be the majority I
mean as you start making this simpler
many people's needs for computing are
pretty basic right I just need to get on
the internet most of the time and then
rush you're there I mean maybe a browser
does about its own how far off are we
closer than you think yeah I mean
everything's already in the cloud right
I'd say within the next 50 threat you
heard it here first all right hi this is
probably my most realistic of all
predictions you ready for it iOS will
just be a skin on top of Android ah I
don't never have it ow what no this
makes total sense like why develop your
own OS when you can just skin it it'll
be great Melissa will it be great well
it'll be great for android users I guess
we will fall out I want to into my hand
on either okay to miss they will never
bow down this would save apples so much
money they can I mean they're all about
building great you eyes they can still
do that but they don't have to worry
about the guts and the colonel and the
talking to that Hardware blah blah blah
but they need that they need the guts in
the colonel in the talking to the
hardware in order to control how people
use their stuff yeah and they want to do
is control it they're not going to give
that up they will never suckle from the
teat of the Android well I think they
will but let me just preface this with
they would never admit it so although
i'll probably be right there'll be no
way to prove you probably be ready
there's you know that they will never
admit this you will see down in seat
rails they'll say linux write something
like that if they say anything at all so
i'm pretty sure i'm probably already
right on this way it's impossible to
prove right um 2020 yeah it's actually
very possible to prove
haha no way impossible what do you got
next am i next um what am i next oh I
think that Google will begin to tighten
more control to tighten the reins and
try to gain more control back over the
look and feel of the android open source
project they've already kind of done
this with style guides and with rules
for apps that can and can't be in the
market as far as like you know what your
app has to look like and what parts of
the interface you can change and what
not and I think that we're going to
start seeing over the next couple years
more head-butting between Google and
those OEMs which will probably be the
reason for my previous pretty good
Google will you know start going like
all right look it's been the Wild West
for a while but if we want to be serious
about taking on Apple we gotta stick to
some standards than HTC and Samsung and
LG are and among other Williams are just
going to eventually go yeah we can't do
that we need some sort of way to
differentiate a product see prediction
one this is quite a well thought-out
argument here it makes Lamar own eyes
look pretty silly actually I did it like
five minutes before the show oh my
finger on that pole tu marker I think
well I think this is slightly likey
likely but would be a really good thing
and then I definitely now your previous
prediction makes a lot more sense to me
mm-hmm there's a theme here ose yeah it
would be slightly likely more than
slightly like I think it's a little more
than slightly likely what's what's more
than slightly what's it better likely
like early likely fairly like me all
right fairly likely i'll say it's likely
back to gmr what do you got okay i think
the android at home initiative will be
in full swing and we will see lights
appliances security systems etc all
powered by Android I mean it sounds
futuristic and far off but I think it's
coming 20 20 by 2022 toasters yeah and I
think we're going to embed NFC chips
into our skin so that when we walk into
the
boom settings all done that'll be great
I can't wait for that day I would have
taken into the last two to four point oh
in my skin you look bluetooth oh yeah
low power and all yeah all right my
prediction for the last two years by the
way has been that there would be an
android-powered toaster but I powered I
mean I guess since it's been 20 years
before we actually sit down and talk
about it both ways twenty twelve years
eight years what year is it it's 2012
okay um since it'll be a while before we
actually talk about this again like what
do you mean by powered like what's true
we do not talk about the show we will be
able to yeah you can control it it's
gonna the logic will be controlled by an
OS which is Android you'll be able to
use your phone to set the exact Browning
of your she's already going to go over
to the toaster to put the parade in it
so this is like come with a bread
magazine that you load up in arguing in
the wii or android powered android will
put the bread in your toaster for you
what do you need your deck for it what
do you need the phone your toaster will
track it'll track trends in your
toasting habits things like that right
I'm actually a guy stuck on machine let
me like magazine loaded toaster like now
I'm envisioning a toaster that you just
put a clip of bread in just start
shooting toes touch people it'll be the
best thing since sliced bread knife or
toaster I see what you did there haha
alright my next one so the the final
alphabetic release of Android will be
out actually did some math on this and I
think I'm about right on if they keep at
the same pace so the final release
zucchini bread will be released for the
new phone the Sony sung nexus quasar
because obviously sony and samsung up
you know join forces at this point yes
what are we gonna do after z you're just
gonna like switch over to kanji chinese
characters roman numerals her double a
the aardvark phone they just goes badly
and then switch to a different naming
convention via theme different thing I
think it's gonna be
canine animals cuz you know apples got
the you've got the cats this XP oh
they'll be the dogs yeah the dogs um you
want with zucchini bread yummy bread I
was racking my brains laughs yeah what
else do you got I got a sub zabaione
which is an Italian dessert or the other
one i have is zeppeli which is another
Italian dessert and I've got nothing
else for you zotz candy Zotz oh yeah a
bubble thing to get in it I was actually
a comic book to that but not a dessert
no ah Zhu kini bread zucchini bread
that's that's the most common one I
don't know that you in a desert like it
doesn't tell Marie tastes sweet it's
sweet it's a lot of sugary yeah it is
all right we don't need a doctor yeah we
need to talk about my next prediction
would he got which is somebody will
finally build an android-powered iphone
killer I mean you know how it's gonna be
it's gonna be Apple me and that faced
with the veet Apple revert to full-time
patent trolling uh okay I think we're on
the same page there yeah yeah pretty
much the same guess yeah is there
something going on behind me JT that's a
tease dancing around oh I mean here to
ask some questions sure yeah definitely
uh all right what are we back to we're
back anymore my chart okay this one's
serious listen serious okay let me
straighten my shirt and I'm pretty sure
this is going to happen by 2020 android
will become self-aware at which point it
will send an austrian bodybuilder back
in time to preemptively and any hope for
a human rebellion this body builder will
of course be wearing android-powered
sunglasses awesome I need your clothes
your boots I'll motorcycle here you go
that he will take care of edward furlong
i buy that so the sunglasses will be
hooked into skynet wait Skynet's the day
ha position so what I'll be a bit it's
kind of notice kinda is what the van't
the cybernetic the
games the machines are powered by in the
futures in this analogy Skynet is
Android yeah and we're talking
Terminator part 1 so Android is powered
by its canada or Skynet is
android-powered that's correct oh but
then in the second movie it turns out
that like the technology behind Android
is the reason that humans could actually
create android in the first place
thereby making Android its own
grandfather I think he's right whoa hey
this is already coming true cuz google
just recently hired the head of DARPA
Regina I forget her name here here it is
Regina Dugan she runs DARPA and that is
Skynet basically yeah that's not very
happy that is just a look very face that
will end mankind no but he looks like
very nice lady I'm sure hahaha let's
just up there okay I'm just saying it's
coming true good I think you're right
mm-hmm I got it I got another one you
ready for it Google TV will be 20 times
better than it is today but still no
one's going to use it mm-hmm I think
they're not giving up on this thing you
know I think this goes this goes kind of
with your first prediction that Motorola
will cease to exist as a separate entity
maybe by that time cable boxes will be
google-branded they're gonna Reaper and
Google Play Movies as Google TV no I
think they'll call them google youtube
TV tube danimal yeah I mean why wouldn't
they call it that just YouTube TV here's
your YouTube box people will be like
yeah let me get some of that youtube box
I want two of them they should get on
that um all right why don't people use a
Google TV I know I know I don't you why
don't ya why don't use google TV oh
because i have an xbox why don't you use
google TV because i have an xbox hahaha
i have a wii I just don't use it cuz
it's not very good and why isn't it very
good um cuz it's not 20 times better
than it is today do people use Apple TV
cuz I don't know anyone knows one of
those either
I just leaped you I think they've
thought about four million I think once
they come out with the apps it'll be a
lot better Google TV it's okay it just I
don't want a computer I don't my TV to
be a computer I just want to watch
videos yeah that's that's kind of what
I'm thinking is like Google TV apps mean
nothing to me like I'm not gonna play
Angry Birds on my TV it's just not gonna
happen but content is kind of what I
care about yeah and I think maybe the
reason Apple TV works for people is
because they're already invested in the
night un's in itunes yeah right and Roku
actually is pretty successful as well
because they have a lot of content and
it's easy and it's super cheap I mean
Google TV came out with at a pretty high
price point so they've had a lot of
stumbling blocks but maybe someday when
people start adopting Google Play maybe
those leather binding YouTube YouTube
Google Play to YouTube YouTube play all
right aunt ID and Android it's actually
Antoine play now all right and tube uh
it's actually the best mispronunciation
of my name ever let's see Google's
self-driving cars which they've already
been working on and are actually legal
in two states right now will eventually
evolved into an ad-supported
android-powered Google cab service
you'll be able to call a robo cab with
your android phone and have it come
automatically pick you up and take you
to your location you'll just have to
watch a couple video inter steel ads on
your way that would be the best thing
ever would it really of course I get
like so far without the crappy drivers
among you I don't know much about no not
me self-driving cars though I mean are
they you know oh there was an accident
it was one accident but there was
actually it turned out a dude ran into
it or chick ran into it someone ran into
it so it wasn't the cars false and
ethics and mathematically I think the
cars are safer than people at this point
key factor in all of the trips people
making and all the accidents they get to
Google's cars honk and flip people off
and no they just have like giant robo
backpacks and arrays on them since
they're raised can I go in the carpool
lane I don't know they actually can't
even drive in most states I think what
some some southwestern southeastern
southwestern state arizona and the ones
they can drive us always like a driver
they're ready and so unhappy over in the
passenger seat other hand on the mercy
break like my mom did when i was
learning how to drive um alright well I
for one want this to happen you're
scared of it I'm a little scared I'm
scared of people yes I am too that's why
this needs to happen people can't they
can't especially not the puter learn how
to drive people the weird thing is like
those car sharing services is that
they're usually populated by people who
don't normally drive and so I think Stu
what I call weekend driver yeah they're
the worst driver so if I see like a
zipcar logo on a Prius coming up on me I
get the hell out of the way I like river
I like take an alternate route and all
right this is completely off the subject
all right jmar talk about it on quite us
with your last prediction has particular
t20 in 2020 instagram will still be
coming very soon to android they're very
very soon very is there now coming very
soon but somebody 20 very very just to
make it even closer you soons relatively
Reno's relatively speaking on the scale
of the entirety of civilization right
though like geologically years we've
been waiting is some blink yeah but a
wrinkle and a billions and billions of
years we've been around it that we have
about relative to how long the earth has
been around yeah back to the take the
scale all the way back to the Big Bang
let me just add that when it does come
out it'll still be in beta 2 i'm 2020
but it's gonna be way better than iOS
version oh yeah that was a very weird
thing that that sort of assertion right
oh yeah it's in some ways better than
the iOS version in that it doesn't exist
yet so okay um all right good one to my
last one I'll say is more realistic and
more boring as a result
most android phones will have lytro
cameras built-in very interesting mmm
have you played with electro camera I
have and aren't they like the shape of a
candy like the size of a candy bar a
physical lytro camera will be built in
yeah it will be like a long light
telescope coming up no they might row
technology will be built it is really
what I'm getting it it's a good minute
arises yes the audience that doesn't
know what light rose may be light field
camera so basically captures every sort
of angle of light and correct me if I'm
wrong here so that after the fact you
can actually focus the camera on
whatever you wanted to so if you take a
shot of Jim are here I could say oh I
actually wanted to focus on the wall and
not on Jay Mars face happens all the
time yes and I can do that after the
fact in the their software so I think
this would be great for camera phones
where you're just like get it out quick
and you don't necessarily have time to
focus it very well when you take a
picture and yeah we're looking at some
letters that the gallery brine calling
in it taking pictures of himself yeah
watch this is the one of my drone so
yeah we'll click here in the boom yeah
whoa I didn't even see that guy back
there so let's focus on the stuff in the
back it's right there it's pretty cool I
think it's definitely still a little
early stage with it but uh you know
it'll be perfected and in all of our
phones hmm what they need is like an
automatic like screen cleaner because i
find that like every time I maybe it's
just me I'm obsessive about keeping the
lens on my phone clean but this there's
always like crud in there and before I
take any picture of wipe the lens off
with my shirt tation you're talking
about windshield wipers yeah like sort
of nano or oleophobic technology than
the right word oh like oh yeah a little
bit well it is for the nothing I may
have missed yeah yeah that would like
that on like the the lens I think that
your robot will just take care of that
for you don't worry about it give us
your next prediction my left prediction
since I wrote them out of order uh a
singularity will have happened by
20 20 and we will actually be powered by
Android through some weird synthesis of
the organic and technologic you know
that or the world to end on black friday
this year and we want to worry about it
anymore I'm so likely or what's what's
even more than likely more really likely
extremely likely that's what I'm gonna
say extremely okay okay I'm gonna go
with insane happen and then you know I
so I heard so I think that is our
predictions I heard Stephen had one big
prediction oh yeah I have a really very
generic prediction that I will own an
Android device in the year by the year
twenty twenty that's my prediction I'm
gonna have to invoke the the jason
howell rule and that you can't make a
prediction that you have control over
that's true he did predict that he was
gonna get a new android phone in the
nitrogen is not a new phone now will
your device via phone probably wore a
toaster it's probably most likely gonna
be I think it'll be a toaster I think it
should go get your range and earrings
yeah android-powered earring hey Doc
destroyed monocle like a look like a it
is very only the very rich man had
repaired pocket watch though just under
on his chain pocket protector how does
that work it just means they take a
rocket I got their phone okay hahaha
I'll go with this cat a screen on it
it's a flexible OLED screen um alright
do we have anything else any other
lingering prediction Joanna may I have a
real quick note about what we're talking
about early about nokia no idea was
actually founded in the year 1865 when
i'm up it was incorporated awake where
we talking sorry about that hang on i
say i was gonna roll them roll it real
quick I just rolled it motorola was
rolled in September fifth 1928 1928 yes
Wow
19-20 for anyone that's interested in
nokia was eighteen sixty five that's
gold yeah they started in Chicago
Illinois as the Galvin Manufacturing
Corporation and she said she didn't know
that who and they were one of the roller
nokia motorola I were one of the first
two commercially make the first
commercially successful car radios see
ya I knew something that's Linda that
was a completely being that I was
invented to run they've been around for
as long as the radio has I didn't
specify car radio but when to the radio
radios before 1928 the radio and Silva
yeah but they had personally I'm feeling
them first commercially in cars okay and
then they changed their name to Motorola
in nineteen thirty see you learned
something here I think that is our show
today we actually have to go the apple
store and get iphone so we gotta run I'm
glad I I actually predict that I in 2020
I'll still have to sunder for buying is
your contract you sound like any inside
red 13 year contract but you get a great
price the devil great price that's why
verizon's logos rid um so the show is
going away until as we said january
twenty twenty but soon and then we are
not so we'll just be here in the studio
