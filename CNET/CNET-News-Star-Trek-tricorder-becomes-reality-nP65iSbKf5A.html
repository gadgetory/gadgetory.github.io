the medical tricorder that could scan
your body for vital signs has gone from
science fiction to science fact you're
very much alive this small device called
the scanadu along with an accompanying
smartphone app can read your vitals in
10 seconds with what the company says is
95% accuracy 98 perfect perfect health
we have like a whole range of things
that you could actually measure but the
most important are the vital signs and
so these are temperature or blood
pressure respiratory rate oxygenation
and operate the scanner D works by
holding the device up to your temple we
form an electrical circuit in the body
you have the pulse you have the heart
rate you have here the temperature and
everything happens in this movement the
device goes over 10 times it's not in 10
second it has to wait it goes over there
every second and then actually takes
like the best readings it can have
creator Walter de Brouwer came up with
the idea after an accident put his son
in the hospital for a year he initially
intended for the device to help other
parents but the applications could be
far-reaching especially if the device
gets FDA approval and can be used by
doctors in his entirety the tricorder
should be a complete Hospital you know
very small device scanadu is also
developing disposable urine tests that
could detect a variety of conditions
including abnormal glucose levels liver
and kidney problems and even track your
pregnancy de Brouwer hopes by putting
some medical information literally in
the hands of patients it will improve
the quality and availability of health
care and the doctor-patient relationship
the most underused resource in medicine
is the patient I think then we are on
the right path if we have like a real
conversation with our doctors where we
keep all the information and give it to
them and give it to them in in in an
actionable format it's been a sort of
dream come true for this Star Trek fan
who recently met with a son of start
to creator Gene Roddenberry they never
had thought that a prop out of a science
fiction series with one day probably
disrupt a complete healthcare system
currently you can only pre-order the
device for 199 dollars through the
company's IndieGoGo fundraising campaign
the device is set to ship in March 2014
