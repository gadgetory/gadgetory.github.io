go where would I don't know what I'm
looking for the number okay go
everybody's welcome to the show we are
here for the new 2017 made by Google
event in the house here at Cena live
joining me mr. Patrick Hall in hello
hello across from me the lovely Vanessa
Han morning guys and the man run in the
show mr. Stephen bucho alright everybody
so this is we're going to get into
Google's keynote we will be actually
showing the livestream so you all can
check it out
do we have a shot inside right now all
right we just want to give you a look
inside this is the San Francisco jazz
center just a few blocks away from our
headquarters here in San Francisco
California so it looks like a shot uh I
don't know if they're on the bleachers
or there's little risers in the back but
that's kind of where everyone is
gathering right now in anticipation for
the event that will start at 9:00 a.m.
Pacific time 9:00 a.m. Pacific time so
about 20 minutes out or so we got a
little late start we also want to let
you know if you want to get your calls
in just before this show the phone
number to call is eight four four eight
one one nine five six one we have this
new system if you want to make a friend
today you can call us we're gonna talk
about what we expect to see here and
obviously there's been a lot of rumors
and things leaked but let's get to it
I'm gonna we'll leave that number up so
you guys and gals can all call in if
you'd like to be a part of this show
well let me open it up here to the floor
obviously the big thing that we are
expecting to see here one of the things
are the new pixel to phones oh and oh
yeah see I like how you shake your head
there because I agree I thought the
pixel to are sorry the original pixel
last year was actually although I do
have an iPhone as my daily driver it was
my favorite front of the year because it
did things unique and different that
that phone hadn't before it had the best
camera and it had the voice assistant so
that's what stood out to me that made it
a special phone and you've got to do
that in today's day and age with phones
I just want to open up to you guys oh
what are you what are your what do you
feel about these phones the problem with
the pixel last years you couldn't get it
because of the production issues that
they had
I got it oh you ha was it that hard to
get was yeah the excel definitely want
that exhale well and then well no where
I was totally immune to that problems
with production at first and I think
Google because of those production
problems missed the boat because you
know the note was exploding everybody
wanted the pixel and nobody could get it
that's so funny I honestly no no it
wasn't because I was special I just
pre-ordered it literally the day it came
out yeah I think I mean it definitely
was an unexpected hit for Google I mean
I think they were expecting it to be a
hit but I mean to not have phones even a
few months ago they were ya know the
Excel I don't you know that's like
ramping down for ya what we're gonna see
today or not but the phone was a it's a
great phone it takes great photos I
really like the daydream VR stuff on
there I never really got into VR before
and I found myself using that all the
time yeah I think that people that watch
this they'll be like well you do the
Apple bite I'm not saying that an iPhone
is not a great phone either I just
thought it was the most unique and
special phone of the of you of last year
in in my mind now that's so funny I was
so immune to the fact that these were
hard to get I I just figured oh I got
that cell doh and I just throw it in my
bag no but you talk about that like that
like it I think that what's cool is is
not only running like that beautiful
pure clean version of Android yes that's
the best part about it and but at the
same time there's the phone itself this
has like this delightful like soul and
quality so it's not just specs and gloss
it's there's just something about that
you want to pick it up
is it the sexiest phone heck no no it's
not in design wise no per especially I
don't like the back the half glass half
metal and I don't even feel that
I broke the black in the back glass on
the on the phone was testing that's why
I like the idea I thought it just it's
just a different like if you look at
everything about this phone was
different than what was out there at the
time we know that phones have evolved
come you know literally just from over a
year it's all about everyone is obsessed
with the bezel this phones now today but
um you know
we wanted to bring up the pixel but I'm
also want to talk about the pixels that
we were expecting to see here today
we've seen leaked images a Beecham if
you have a chance to go to the stories
that we have droid life really leaked
about like 90 80 to 90 percent of what
we're expecting to see you we are still
expecting to see some surprises here
with the pixel phones but um there
really is no surprise if you type in the
term um you know you've probably looked
yourself they're going to be here from
what we know the biggest thing and we'll
see how they sell this feature is the
fact that this year's camera where all
the top-line cameras now have dual lens
and I know both of you have jumped into
just the photography aspects of the
phones does what will they need to do to
convince you that it's still a great
camera without dual lens and is dual
lens really necessary I'll start with
you Vanessa
well I I particularly like the dual lens
setup on the iPhone and the note just
because I have a child and a puppy so
portraits are big for me not for a lot
of people the original pixel was great
at photography in general it was amazing
at low-light it even out out
photographed the iPhone last year so I I
don't think the dual camera is a must if
they're able to perfect their soft work
which is kind of what made their their
photos so great last year and in
low-light particularly so I think they
can still beat out the note and the
iPhone if they really refine some of the
features in the camera in their main
camera Patrick well it's funny because
we talking about like beating out phones
and specs and stuff like that and I
think we're getting to a place in the
camera industry and the phone industry
that is actually camera industry really
mm-hmm that you actually can start using
phones depending on stuff like looks
like sometimes if you're doing a
photography you might get a Canon
because it's a little bit warmer in
color you like the way the lenses are
and it's not saying that that brand of
camera shoots better than some like a
Nikon but I feel like the pixel created
beautiful photos but then the videos
were kind of like yeah we're sorry we
forgot about that a little bit so I'm
hoping that we hear a little little bit
more about what they're gonna do for
that even though if it has dual lenses I
think it's kind of fun because of
mean zooming I think is so underrated
yes we all love portrait mode portrait
mode okay great black rounds bring it on
but I would take one camera that shoots
really good photos and really good video
over a dual camera system yeah
even though because you don't have
babies and puppies I know things like
portrait portrait mode is cool the other
thing is that the general population
hasn't been exposed to having the
portrait feature that much it it's still
you know in the tech world it's like
this is hot when you've used it it is
hot you don't use it all the time unless
you have babies or dogs but quite
honestly if you talk about that to your
general user they're not getting a phone
because of portrait mode to the general
general user really they're like it's a
hot don't get me wrong I love it yeah
but it's not something that is gonna be
used for the most part every day on all
your photos so remember like like four
or five years ago and filters started
like being like oh my god you can put a
filter on this really easily and that
was like then everyone used filters I
think this it's gonna be like portrait
mode everything's gonna be buried
background for a few years and it's like
oh wait it doesn't always have to be
blurry Instagram feed sheet she portrait
modes everything everybody she takes
shout out to Sharon love you but yeah
she portrait modes pretty much not just
puppies and babies but her food books
items you're right it could be the the
next filter or even it is yeah it's just
that people aren't exposed to it yeah
and something you saw this summer at the
Google's developer conference was they
talked about this thing called Google
lense which is just like machine
learning and AI and stuff so I'd like to
see if they're gonna bring that to this
this pixel that we might see announced
today and how it how it works because as
much as the hardware hat matters like a
single camera dual camera is that
processing we just saw Apple launched a
slew of new phones and all of them I
would dare say the underrated feature is
all this analysis that's doing on your
video and your photos to make them look
better it just shoots HDR mode full time
like the pixel did last year and they
photos and videos look really good
especially in low light but it's using a
lot of computer processing to make it
look good versus just hey we'll put a
better lens or we put two cameras it's
it's it's the underrated thing that
isn't isn't talked about like you said
the guts inside that is driving
all of this technology so what we have
right now is we have a call directly
from Alexi ceviches inside inside that's
a jazz Sena what's up Lexy welcome maybe
about 20 minutes ago with sitting down
are you able to sail around in it
are you able to swivel around to get us
kind of a look of what the whole
building looks like right now from my
feet right now inside the auditorium at
the Jag Center in San Francisco Red
Badge seating which is press and media
we've got like three curved screen and
guys take a look at this we've got two
DJ's with jamming and rocking out there
up in the corner it looks like totally
doing that thing oblivious to the
effects of the crowd here just grooving
on out we we've talked we've talked a
lot about the pixel so we don't want to
bother you with that question but I did
want to get your thoughts maybe
specifically on rumors we've heard of a
Google home Mini and maybe a Mac's
coming but I just wanted to talk about
the Google home platform in general for
you well what do you want them what do
you want them or what do they kind of
need to do we know really the battles
between them and Amazon right now but
what are you hoping for them to show off
here today to make a jump up okay huge
sake in the market they have around 70%
of the market according to some of the
latest stats and so it has a lot to do
when it comes to making some products
that are kind of gonna make people jump
into the into the google agree system
that haven't necessarily got a smart
training device and you know amazon has
so many different devices on the market
they've got the show they've got the
little alarm clock that they just
debuted last week or so so there's a lot
of I mean I guess you maybe you could
call it a fragmentation in the echo
market there's so many devices to choose
from but it's quite smart because
they're making a product
pretty much everyone who might be
interested in a voice assistant Google
at the moment only has the home we know
that there anyway there may be a couple
of other devices announced today
including a mini which looks to be a
competitor to the dot so that will get
Google especially from the lower price
point range because at the moment the
Horry me is you know one hundred and
twenty nine dollars around n sorry still
an investment and so if you like Amazon
has you know a $49 or even sometimes a
$29 dot like why would I go all the way
like full-blown and get that one or $29
Google home when it offers pretty much
the same functionality so at least
you're making offer something at a lower
price point maybe they'll get some more
people interested in the specific crowd
and Google assistant it's really you
know really useful it's got a lot of
things that it can do you know Elektra
and really closely into your Google
account so that's really useful like
booking flights things that you can do
directly rather than say like the Alexa
where you have to use and a dog skills
company so is there anything that you're
hoping to see the most here just for you
personally Lexi yeah to see what they're
gonna do if the room is a true having no
I really want to know like how they
going to address that you know is there
going to be if they're gonna be
something on the market like to make
people aware that like yeah you gonna
have to use like you know you know Apple
have to airports I don't know if Google
is going to do something similar you're
just gonna have to wait and see I'm
saying as you can see hey Lexi before we
go like are you a little disappointed
they're not playing jazz at the jazz
center is that like a controversy that
we needed to talk about all right Lexi
hey thanks so much we'll be looking for
your coverage out there and we
appreciate it so uh enjoy the show as it
gets ramped up pretty soon all right
thanks guys bye all right we'll see ya
we told her to check under her seat for
a pixel goody bags so here we go guys
and gals up we're about ten minutes out
we're gonna start hitting through the
phone lines because all of you have been
waiting so patiently while we have been
jibber jabbering so if you guys want to
talk about the stuff that has been
leaked out or any questions about the
event coming up we will get you let's
start off with here our friend Jason
Jason wants to talk about the pixel to
the XL is that correct that's right
what's up welcome to the show yeah I
think what's up man I think you know
it's going to be in a matter of who has
the sexiest product to you the pixel up
to excel is gonna even though it sounds
like it's gonna be a delay
just like the iPhone X or 10 is that
someone's gonna you know we're gonna see
who's gonna be out first with a sexiest
model we're you know that's who's gonna
win this war for the next model so I
think what do you think well I think
that depending on who you are whether
the model with whether the iPhone I love
how you say X cuz everyone calls it X we
all know that but whether the iPhone X
or the pixel XL comes out first I still
think it's gonna be tied to ecosystem
loyalty these days right there are
there's a small group of people that are
going to might choose which phone comes
out first but I still think the majority
of people are locked into that ecosystem
and that's really gonna determine what
they want there's still plenty of
Android users that want the best pure
Android experience and we know there are
plenty of users that are on iOS and
they're not gonna get any other phone
other than an iOS phone that that's
where that's where I think but I don't
know what you guys think yeah and I
think I also like going back to kind of
wiping came from with Lexie like you
know with all their home environment
stuff like that and how everything is
starting to interconnect and near buying
a phone it's not even we're buying in an
ecosystem now we'll get I always think
about that I'd like my son to be phone
to be shiny and bright I wanted to ask a
bigger question if the iPhone X is 10
with the pixel X I'll be 40 the pixel 40
would that be right Roman numerals this
is a really important question Jason you
were gonna say something real quick well
I think Google's is making
ecosystem and I think their system is
getting stronger with the home with this
Holmes puck whatever is going to call it
and was I think one thing that that I
think everybody's really excited about
in the Google ecosystem is that lens you
guys talked about if they can actually
make a software or a feature that
actually is worth gets people always do
Google searches there even on iPhones
and and this Google lens I think is
gonna be really transformative because
you can take a picture we're using our
phones for cameras you take a picture of
what you want to see and actually it's
gonna be good for schools gonna be good
for kids but it's good I think that's a
really game change a piece of software
that's going to be coming out that
Google is really gonna have to show that
it works and I think you have a point
there because a lot even iOS users still
have a gmail account you still have some
kind of share in the Google ecosystem
and maybe what you were saying some of
these features some of these products
may convince them to go Google all the
way I know I kind of you know dabble in
the Google ecosystem even though I'm
predominantly iOS just because my
Gmail's I have my gmail account and I
use that for everything and I still I
mean I still have a stake in the Google
in the Google ecosystem so maybe maybe
there is a feature that would sway me to
move over it's great fun to see it I
think the next couple years we're gonna
see who's gonna be stronger whether iOS
or Google and there's gonna be the best
out there hand it were finally seeing
the fruits of it but I wish sometimes
they'd wait maybe a generation for a new
phone I know they were in for it for the
money I mean Google brought HTC's or
some of HTC stuff but they're if an
opponent every year it becomes boring
that making befoe maybe every you know
16 months or some like that that
actually is transformative might make
people seem more of a better device yeah
Jason thanks so much for calling man we
really appreciate and we can tell you
you read your stuff we know dropping the
HTC knowledge on its he's lying he's
like Wonder Woman just dropped so hey
Jason thank you so much I think he makes
a great point it's just all so hard in
kind of keeping up with the Joneses
if every main memory major manufacturers
releasing a phone every year and their
users typically whether they're on a
one-year or two-year upgrade cycle get
that phone you kind of got to play along
you don't now these days you don't have
a choice in really it was it was kind of
Apple who started this year trend they
were the ones that first came out with
the phone every year and then Samsung
started doing it and then everyone else
started doing it there was a time where
it was like a phone every two years it
used to be I'm like you are like on the
S cycle of the NHANES cycle right yeah
but then also think it's kind of
starting to bite you know bite a little
bit because anyone you have a lot of
Christmas and we had with Apple last
year with seven and not necessarily the
seven pluses they were kind of the same
phone dismally iterated and same with
the eight yeah and the thing is like had
they taken you know that time I don't
think it could happen in the industry
but yeah what kind of and more
innovations are we gonna see are there
gonna be more things like the iPhone 10
or what Samsung's doing which is pretty
exciting too I think with the s8 and
definitely been no date this year well
and I think something we haven't talked
about which gives Google an edge could
be that price point because this year we
had a lot of great phones from Samsung
and Apple with the iPhone 10x but we
haven't talked about the price point
these are really expensive phones I mean
the note starts at $900 and the eye for
the iPhone I mean at least the one you
really want right let's be honest starts
at $1000 so Google might have the edge
for that that consumer that still wants
the cutting edge but is not doesn't want
to pay that premium for a phone that you
know it'll it'll still be a lot though I
mean Excel estimations starting are like
eight forty nine ish so a forty nine
nine forty nine hundred dollars cheaper
ish but still not like $200 cheaper
right which would make a difference tell
me you said like gonna we're like I'm a
cyclist seventy a lot of people you know
if you're not buying your phone outright
you're just paying that little
subsidized fee or you're paying that
financing to a carrier and hey I'm
paying you know 70 bucks or 80 bucks or
a month and I'm gonna keep on doing that
and I'll get my phone when it's time to
upgrade so I think for a lot of people
that's not they just hey what phones are
out there when it's my my contract is up
and it's gotta be contracts nowadays I'm
done paying my financing on my whatever
phone I have do I want to get a pixel do
I want to get an s8 there's so many good
phone
the other part is we talk about these
release cycles and here we are in fall
and we've had four major phones fall in
the last last month boom all right let's
uh let's jump into the lines cuz there's
plenty of people that want to talk to us
before the keynote starts at 9:00 we're
gonna go to our friend Karl Karl is 16
calling about the Google pixel vent Karl
what's up welcome to scene alive
hello guys thank you for I've been
waiting for a while Karl are you really
sick sided Karl are you really 16 or is
actually our our system said you were 16
but you're not actually 16 yeah because
I've been waiting for a chance to switch
to Android for a while now I've been
almost bought the BlackBerry t1 I was
like this is amazing
I'm just waiting to have a chance to
like go on the Android board but they
haven't whitewall me for a while now so
I'm just really excited for the pixel to
we'll see what they do $1,000 for the
iPhone it's pretty a lot and I'm just
waiting to see what candy do why me the
wild factor for Google I have a 6s
broken screen I'm not on a contract so
yeah you're ready to roll oh yeah you're
ready roll you're ready roll so does let
me ask you this question because there's
a lot of hype around bezel as bezel as
bezel is it doesn't look like that the
Google pixel 2 is gonna be a bezel this
phone does that bother you you care you
want really are more concerned about the
features it has it's more about the
features I don't really care so much I
mean it's a gorgeous screen first for
sure but it's just about the future
because it like you said we just talked
on the ecosystem so I was like okay how
can I I really hate enjoy but I don't
like how can I give it a chance
kind of thing so you just want to get
you just want to give Android a chance
yeah open mind open mind we
like that so you gotta you gotta begin
when you're in detect yes it doesn't
thank you thank you very much if only
everyone thought that way and was 16 all
right hey thanks so much for calling
buddy thank you all right see ya
the Google keynote is still expect to
start at 9:00 is we're gonna we're gonna
jump we will jump into it once they
actually start but I'm gonna try and
take one more call because people are
waiting patiently brian mchenry in the
house what's up Brian McHenry thanks for
waiting so long just curious if you
thought the pixel two would be exclusive
to Verizon if I decided to get through a
carrier I just honestly we just this
morning it had been leaked out that
Verizon will be the exclusive carrier of
the Google pixel to that that's the
story that I saw just earlier right
before we started this show so I would
say yes unless unless that changes that
it's not an official official word but
that's what has been leaked out but if
it's like last year - that doesn't mean
you can't get the phone through another
retailer or something like that and it's
still fine right buddy ID Verizon right
okay am i right okay hey thanks Brian
we're gonna jump to the keynote everyone
here will do the show will do post show
afterwards all right thanks so much as
we were preparing for this event we were
all devastated by the news coming out of
Las Vegas as I'm sure all of you were
and that's coming off a challenging past
few weeks with hurricanes Harvey
Irma and Maria and other events around
the world it's been hard to see the
suffering but I've been moved and
inspired by everyday heroism people
opening up their homes and to first
responders literally risking their lives
to save other people our hearts and
prayers are with the victims and
families impacted by these terrible
events we are working closely with many
relief agencies in affected areas and we
are committed to doing our part it's a
true privilege to be a des of jazz
center
it's a great
American institution for jazz
performance and education and it's
really good to see familiar faces in the
audience as always I want to give a
shout out to people joining us on the
live stream globally from around the
world since last year and since Google
i/o we've been working hard continuing
our shift from a mobile first to an AI
first world we are rethinking all our
core products and working hard to solve
use of problems by applying machine
learning and AI let me give you an
example recently I visited Lagos in
Nigeria it's a city of 21 million people
it's an incredibly dynamic vibrant and
ever growing city
many people are coming online for the
first time so it's very exciting unless
you happen to be in the Google Maps team
and you have to map the city and it is
so it is changing so fast and normally
we map a place by using Street View and
doing a lot of stuff automatically but
it's difficult to do that in a place
like Legos because the city is changing
you can't always see the signage clearly
and there are variable address
conventions things are in sequential so
for example take that house there if you
squint hard you can see the street
number there it is number 3 to the left
of the gate that was relatively easy on
to harder problem now that house you
know that's what we see from Street View
I think as humans it's probably pretty
hard maybe one or two of you can spot it
out but our computer vision systems
thanks to machine learning can pick it
out identify the street number and start
mapping mapping the house so we approach
Lagos completely differently we deployed
machine learning from the ground up and
just in five months the team was able to
map five thousand kilometres of new
roads fifty thousand new addresses and
hundred thousand businesses and it's
something which makes a real difference
for millions of users there
as Google Maps is popular and we think
this approach is broadly applicable
let's come closer to home in a parking
in San Francisco I don't even try it
anymore but for those of you who try it
we again use machine learning we
understand location data we try to
understand patterns our car circling
around and the color shows the density
of parking and we can analyze it
throughout the day and predict parking
difficulty and in Google Maps give you
options a simple example but it's the
kind of everyday use case for which we
are using machine learning to make a
difference the best example I can think
of what we've talked before is Google
Translation I literally remember many
years ago
adding translation in Chrome and making
it automatic so that if you land in a
page different from your language we do
that for you fast forward to today with
the power of machine learning on our
neural machine translation we serve over
2 billion translations in many many
languages every single day to me shows
the power of staying at a problem
constantly using computer science to
make it better and seeing users respond
to it at scale this is why we are
excited about the shift from a mobile
first to a AI first world it is not just
about applying machine learning in inner
products but it's radically rethinking
how computing should work at a higher
level in an AI first world I believe
computers should adapt to how people
live their lives rather than people
having to adapt to computers and so we
think about four core attributes as part
of this experience first people should
be able to interact with computing in a
natural and seamless way mobile took us
a step in this direction with
multi-touch but increasingly it needs to
be conversational sensory we need to be
able to use her voice gestures and
vision to make the experience much more
seamless second
it is going to be ambient computing is
going to evolve beyond the phone be
there in many screens around you when
you need it working for you
third we think it needs to be
thoughtfully contextual mobile gave us
limited context you know with identity
your location we were able to improve
the experience significantly an AI first
world we can have a lot more context and
apply it thoughtfully for example if
you're into fitness and you land in a
new city we can suggest running routes
maybe gyms nearby and healthy eating
options and in my case being a
vegetarian and having a weakness for
deserts maybe suggest the right
restaurants for me finally and probably
the most important of it all in a
computing needs to learn and adapt
constantly over time it just doesn't
work that way today in Mobile you know
developers write software and constantly
ship updates but you know let me give a
small example I use Google Calendar all
the time on Sundays I try to get a
weekly view of how my week looks like
but once the work week starts say on a
Monday or a Tuesday I'm trying to get a
view into what the next few hours looks
like I have to constantly toggle toggle
back and forth
Google Calendar should automatically
understand my context and show me the
right view it's a very simple example
but software needs to fundamentally
change how it works
it needs to learn and adapt and that
applies to important things like
security and privacy as well today a lot
of us deal with security and privacy by
putting the onus back on users we give
them many settings and toggles to
improve those but you know AI first well
we can learn and adapt and do it
thoughtfully for our users for example
if it's a notification for your doctor's
appointment we need to treat it
sensitively and differently than just
telling you when you need to start
driving to work so we're really excited
by the shift and that's why we are here
today we've been working on software and
hardware together because
that's the best way to drive the shifts
in computing forward but we think we had
a unique moment in time where we can
bring the combination of AI and software
and hardware to bring the different
perspective to solving problems for
users and we're very confident about our
approach here because we are at the
forefront of driving the shifts with AI
three months ago at Google i/o our
Google AI teams announced a new approach
called Auto mo
although Emmel is just our machines
automatically generating machine
learning models today these are
handcrafted by machine learning
scientists and literally only a few
thousands of scientists around the world
can do this design the number of layers
weight and connect the neurons
appropriately it's very hard to do we
want to democratize this we want to
bring this to more people you want to
enable hundreds of thousands of
developers to be able to do it so we've
been working on this technology called
Auto Mo and just in the past month for a
standard tasks like image classification
understanding images our auto ml models
are now not only more accurate than the
best human generated models but they are
more resource efficient so it's pretty
amazing to see we are now taking it a
step further let me talk about another
use case object direction when we say
object direction just a fancy name for
computers trying to delineate and
understand images being able to draw
bounding boxes and distinguish between
all the way vehicles their scooters
mopeds motorcycles and even pick out the
bike in front it has a lot of practical
use cases the Street View example for
Legos works based on object detection
google lense which you'll hear about
later as well as our photography in
pixel use this object direction this is
really hard to do the best human
generated models we have only have a 39
percent accuracy
but our Auto ml models as of the past
couple of weeks have have reached around
forty three percent accuracy they're
constantly getting better so the rate at
which we are seeing progress with AI is
amazing which is why we are really
excited about combining it with our
software and hardware to bring it
together for our users let me give you a
concrete example
I was recently very inspired by the
street from a journalist who was uh
turning the Little League World Series
as you can see there are two little
leaguers here one from Dominican
Republic and the other from South Dakota
and they are talking to each other using
Google Translate it's a great example
but I looked at it and I feel like we
could do a whole lot better computing
needs to evolve where this happens in a
more natural seamless and a
conversational way and later today
you'll get an early glimpse of how we
can push this experience further by
thinking about AI software and hardware
together I couldn't be more excited by
the direction our Hardware team is
taking and approaching their work here
so to give you a lot more insights let
me welcome Rick onto the stage thank you
hi everyone I want to welcome everyone
here today Google fans the media in the
front row we have some of our top sales
reps from Verizon and other partners
it's great to have you all here yes
welcome welcome
we've got a lot to show you today
including a few surprises so I thought I
would quickly set the scene and explain
what we've been working toward and just
how it ties into the vision that send
our outlined a year ago we stood on a
slightly smaller stage and introduce the
world to Google pixel home and Wi-Fi
chromecast ultra and daydream view this
is the first generation of hardware made
by Google so much has happened since
then and we've made tremendous progress
in our first year for starters our team
is getting a lot bigger we're bringing
on 2,000 very talented engineers from
HTC along with some important IP it's an
amazing team that's created a series of
industry first innovations and by
working more closely together we'll be
able to better integrate Google hardware
and software and our products have built
up a lot of momentum going into our
second year let's take a look ok Google
ok Google ok Google Play the soundtrack
to spaghetti for Pepe we will set to
hold a product event at San Francisco
there are a ton of new announcements
Google
a new virtual reality camera show me a
video of a kangaroo in my book there I
said it
my mom now can save every picture
unlimited space mama got a new time it
can recognize each voice enter Google
assistant let me see what else my guru
assistant can do hey Google call Karen
what you look sweaty football that's
your question I want to blow your mind
okay Google what's next we're still in
the early days of our hardware line but
we're off to a great start we're
thrilled to announce that they're now 55
million chromecast devices around the
world Google Wi-Fi is the number one
selling mesh router since its launch in
the US and Canada and in the last 12
months alone the assistant has gotten a
lot smarter thanks to Google we've added
more than a hundred million new unique
featured snippets from the web video
results from YouTube and new local
places in Google Maps and a lot more and
Pixel had a great year I just wish we
had a few more of them to go around
but user satisfaction among pixel owners
is among the highest of any Google
product ever industry analysts and the
media gave pixel rave reviews to our
performance scores led the industry and
pixel had the best and top rated
smartphone camera
we're really proud of how well the pixel
did for our first generation smartphone
in such a competitive space well you all
know this better than anyone but the
playing field for hardware components is
leveling off and I don't envy those of
you who have to write reviews for a
bunch of smart phones with very similar
specs megapixels in the camera processor
speed modem throughput battery life
display quality these core features are
table stakes now Moore's law and Dennard
scaling are ideas from the past to be
honest it's going to be tougher and
tougher for people to develop new
exciting products each year because
that's no longer the timetable for big
leaps forward in Hardware alone and
that's why we're taking a very different
approach at Google as I said last year
the next big innovation will happen at
the intersection of AI software and
hardware smartphones might be reaching
parity on their specs but as we just
heard from sundar we're seeing huge
breakthroughs and the kinds of
experiences were able to deliver to
users and it all starts with reimagining
hardware from the inside out AI and
machine learning have helped us to do
this across our products for one pixel
completely revolutionized the end-to-end
photo experience for users and removes
all the hassles machine learning works
throughout the experience to make your
pixel photos more vibrant to smooth out
your videos and to make all those
thousands of memories easy to find on
any of your devices we did the same
thing with home networks Google Wi-Fi
uses machine learning not only to keep
your signal strong but to reduce Wi-Fi
congestion while you're moving
throughout the house your router is
intelligently transitioning your devices
to the best Wi-Fi point and placing you
on the right channel when you're using
the assistant on Google home you'll
notice it can pick up your voice even in
a noisy room our deep learning
capabilities and neural beamforming
help Google home locate
the source of sound and here you
accurately so we can do with just two
microphones what others normally need
six or eight to do and this is what it
means to design hardware from the inside
out it's this combination of AI software
and hardware working together that
provides a helpful experience for our
users and that's where the big leaps
forward are gonna happen in the next 10
years we're still in the early days for
our hardware line but we know what it
takes to build great products in a
crowded field we were at first with many
of our most successful products Gmail
Chrome Android and even search but in
each case we succeeded by doing what
we're best at reimagining the experience
to make it radically helpful for the
user and as you'll hear today our next
generation of devices is radically
helpful - they're fast they're there
when you need them they're simple to use
and they anticipate your needs
everything is designed for you to keep
the tech in the background and out of
your way
interact with your devices naturally
through your voice or by touching them
and by building Hardware around our AI
and software we're creating products
that get even better over time they're
constantly getting faster and more
helpful the more you interact with them
thanks to machine learning as a family
made by Google products represent the
ultimate Google experience today we're
going to show you how we're creating a
family of products that are there when
you need them at work at school and on
the go but we're gonna start with the
most important place your home so let's
hear next from Rishi Chandra who leads
our home team over to you Rishi
thank you Rick it's been a really
exciting year for us Google home was the
first product to bring the Google
assistant to the home and we've been
constantly learning from our users so
that we can make the assistant radically
helpful for you
for example as Rick mentioned in the
last year we can answer over 100 million
new questions and the best part is you
know the talk like a computer or teach
Google home any new skills it just works
now we're really happy with a positive
feedback thus far we know this is a
journey so been working hard to bring
Google home to more people and more
countries this year we launched in five
new countries and we're happy to
announce that we launching in Japan
later this week
now bringing the assistant of people all
around the world is no easy task we had
to make sure we can understand people of
different age groups genders and accents
so we trained the assistant at a scale
that only Google could with over 50
million voice samples from hundreds of
different ambient environments we've
been investing in voice search for over
a decade which is why we have the best
voice recognition in the world now
earlier this year we had a major
breakthrough with the ability to
recognize your voice we call it voice
match with your permission we built a
model of your voice by looking at dozens
of different voice characteristics like
vocal constructs pitch and tone this is
a really big deal Google Homes great for
the whole family but doesn't mean only
get the same answer to every question an
assistant can only be truly useful if it
knows who you are
and with voice match or the only
assistant that can bring personal help
to each individual member of your
household so he asked a question we
match your voice and we respond with
your calendar your commute and your
personal reminders now voice matches
already become one of the most popular
features on Google home today over half
of all queries are from people who've
trained the assistant to recognize their
voice and starting today we're rolling
out voice match to all seven countries
Google
we'll be available now another popular
feature is hands-free calling you can
use your Google home to call any
landline or mobile number in the US or
Canada for free without any additional
apps or accessories it just works and
I'm happy announce they'll be bringing
hands-free calling to the UK later this
year and starting today you could call
out with your own personal mobile number
so whatever you're calling will know
it's you
you just need to verify your number
through the Google home app and of
course with voice match we can recognize
your voice to make sure we call your
contact with your personal number a
hands-free calling also has the
intelligence of Google built right in
just say hey Google call the bakery on
24th Street okay
calling Noe Valley bakery we do the hard
work to figure out which business you
want to call thanks to Google's deep
expertise in local search making a call
has never been easier now we have a lot
of great news to share with you today so
to kick things off I like to welcome
Isabelle Lee designer for Home Hardware
Thank You Rishi I'm thrilled to share
with you how we think design is
redefining technology in the home you
heard Rick mention earlier today that
everything in a hardware line is
designed to fit into your life the home
is the special intimate place and people
are very selective about what they
welcome into it you don't want to fill
it with black plastic complicated
buttons and random blinking lights our
vision is to build simple helpful
solutions that work in the background
helping you when you need it and staying
out of the way when you don't so here's
what that means to us we design for the
spaces are products live in and we take
inspiration from the materials and
colors that people already use to make
their home more warm and inviting second
when designing for real hopes form and
sites really matters for creating
something that actually fits into any
room or on any surface and lastly the
way you interact with our products has
to be so intuitive you never even have
to think about it and so simple that the
entire household can use it with that we
are introducing mini the newest member
of the Google home family the first
thing you might notice is the striking
simplicity of the design it's sleek and
smooth with no corners or edges and it's
small enough to be placed in anywhere in
your home
it makes Google home more accessible to
more people in more rooms and as you can
see almost the entire enclosure is made
out of fabric and it's not just about
aesthetics its core to the product
experience that is why we created this
material from scratch right down to the
yarn it needed to be durable soft but
also transparent enough to let through
both light and sound this perfect
balance allows for all of mehness
technology to be thoughtfully tucked
away underneath the clean simple
enclosure so the four LED lights under
the fabric are there when you need them
lighting up to show you that it hears
you or it's thinking and you can control
it by touch give the fabric a quick tap
to pause your music adjust the volume or
talk to your assistant we thought a lot
about how to get great sound with such a
small product - we embrace mini circular
shape to project 360 degrees sound so
it's really crisp no matter where you
stand in the room you'll be surprised
how amazing the quality is and if you
want bigger sound you can easily connect
mini to any chromecast built-in speaker
wirelessly we created mini in three
beautiful colors quarrel chalk and
charcoal color really matters in the
home this is the place where we choose
our drapes and
bits and pink colors have been so much
care we brought that same level of care
for Minnie for the chalk color alone
it took us 157 tries before we found the
perfect shade of gray so that's Google
home Minnie with all the power of the
Google assistant you can make it your
sous chef in the kitchen
your white noise machine in their
nursery your voice remote for your TV in
the living room or your alarm clock in
the bedroom or all of the above
Minnie will retail for just $49 in the
US and it's and it's gonna be available
for pre-order online starting today and
in stores starting October 19th from
major retailers we're also really happy
to announce that Minnie is coming to all
seven Google home countries so with that
let's take a look at this ad that will
launch later this week with this little
thing well it's a little mini you put it
in your house and control it with your
voice hey Google Play my fun playlist
okay playing now it's also a remote
control an alarm clock and a sous chef
let it cool for 10 minutes they can play
this on TV or that on the internet it
can tell you the weather or if your
flights delayed because of the weather
and it knows the difference between you
I
so if you go hey Google call Alex it
won't call your husband's friend Alex
it'll call your friend Alex calling Alex
hey how are you okay gotta go girl
anyway it's made by the same people who
help you find stuff on the internet so
you know no biggie it's smaller than a
doughnut and weighs less than a
full-grown chipmunk put out the nuts
it's powered by the Google assistant so
it has Google Maps Google Calendar it
gets through to all your music lots of
your favorite shows all of YouTube and
lots and lots and lots of other stuff
you love all good less than 50 bucks
yeah if Google Hill mini a little help
at home like only Google can thanks
Isabel we can't wait for you to try out
mini we also want to share how the
Google assistant continues to get better
over time from the start we've been
helping everyone people with their
everyday routines for example one of my
favorite features is my day which gives
me a personalized briefing of my
important events of the day and with
voice match each member of the house can
get their own unique start to the
morning routine well soon we're gonna be
extending routines in two important ways
first we're adding more routines to help
you with those everyday moments like
getting ready to leave for work coming
home in the evening or turning in for
the night
second we're adding additional actions
to the routines so now when I say good
morning I not only get my personal
briefing but I also can turn on the
lights start the coffeemaker and even
play my favorite morning playlist this
kind of help is exactly what I need to
get my day started
now another ritual for me in the morning
is I'm always looking for iPhone before
heading to work well the Google
assistant can help there to just say hey
Google find my phone and will
automatically ring your Android phone
even if it's on silent mode and for
iPhone users we just give you a call
it's good it saves me 5 to 10 minutes
every morning
yes now we're also working to make the
smart home work better for you the
Google assistant can now voice control
over a thousand different smart home
products from over a hundred brands and
even more importantly we brought our
deep expertise of natural language
processing to make it easier to voice
control in a more conversational way so
for example if I want to change the
temperature
I shouldn't have to remember the current
thermostat setting I should do it'll say
hey Google make it warmer okay warming
up the living room your system knows
what warmer means and we'll just take
care of it for you now voice control is
just a start we believe the next
evolution of the smart home is to bring
real intelligence to the home so it can
behave in a more thoughtful way your
home should smartly adjust to you not
the other way around so Google and nest
are working together to reimagine the
smart home to tell you more I like to
welcome Yogi CTO of Nest
Thank You Ricci a nest we like to talk
about the thoughtful helm one that takes
care of the people inside it and the
world around it we recently took a big
step forward in achieving that goal by
doubling our portfolio by shipping six
new hardware products what I love about
nest growing ecosystem is that we
combine the best-in-class hardware and
machine learning to help make people's
life easier and your nest experience
reaches a whole new level when it's
combined with Google products let me
show you three examples of how we can
provide you with even more help help
with nest cam Google home and chromecast
we can help keep you keep an eye on your
home just with your voice so if you hear
some unexpected sound and by the front
door
and I'm in the back with the family room
without my phone I can just say ok
Google show me the entryway ok streaming
the entryway and then I realize it's not
an intruder but my pet pig
cayenne and she's found the leftover
lunch in my son's backpack sadly this
has happened more than once and if I
want to keep it for later for my kids I
can simply say ok Google save me this
clip to show them why we don't leave
food in our backpacks with our new video
doorbell nest hello we can also start to
solve some of our common pain points
through Google and nest integrated
computer Tecna computer vision
technologies of course most of us want
to know who's at the door before we get
off the couch through a feature called
familiar faces nest hello we'll be able
to recognize the people that you asked
it to remember so when their doorbell
rings and nests hello recognizes the
person at the door it will automatically
broadcast that information to Google
home devices in the house
aunty Susie is at the front door and you
don't even have to ask
and if Nestle doesn't know who's at the
door you can just say ok Google show me
who's at the front door and we will
stream your camera feed right to your TV
this is another great example of what
Google and Ness can do together and this
last one is my favorite your home can
soon get ready for the night just with a
simple command as Rishi mentioned you
can personalize your routine to include
actions for nest products so all I have
to say is hey Google good night ok let's
get ready for bed
I've armed your security system your
first calendar event is tomorrow at 9:00
a.m. your alarm is set for 7:00 a.m.
sleep well in the background my
assistants my assistant is also turning
my security camera on adjusting the
thermostat and turning off the lights
this really simplifies my life and gives
me the peace of mind that I cannot get
any other way
together nesting Google deliver an
ecosystem a product that makes your home
more secure and energy-efficient more
connected and entertaining with the best
home assistant experience our close
collaboration make this product work
seamlessly together and help us get one
step closer to a truly thoughtful home
on that new to tell you more about
Google system let me welcome
Rishi back onstage Thank You yogi you
know making it more thoughtful home it's
just one way to help make our joyfully
hectic family lives a little easier you
know the Google assistant already
provides a lot of help from using your
voice to order more diapers playing a
lullaby in the nursery checking the
traffic those piano lessons or easily
giving grandma call now if you're like
me make me hard to gather the household
together for those family moments like
dinner time or movie night well the help
we're launching a new feature called
broadcast it's really easy just say hey
Google broadcast it's time to leave for
school got it broadcasting now the
assistant will broadcast some message to
all the other Google home devices in my
house it's really great parents are
gonna love this feature kids kids are
gonna hate this feature but that's what
makes it useful speaking of kids we
think Google home has a lot of potential
with to help kids and families voice
interactions so simple and easy to use
kids are naturally drawn to it so we
want to be thoughtful about what it
would take to deliver a great kids
experience we conducted research with
hundreds of parents and kids from across
the country from different backgrounds
so first we're announcing support for
family link accounts on Google home
these are Google accounts that parents
can create for children under 13 they
can manage it within the family link app
and as we all know kids have their own
unique way of speaking some
times it can be a little hard to
understand even for us parents well
fortunately we've improved our voice
recognition accuracy for kids so the
assistant can understand them too and
finally we're introducing over 50 new
experiences with the Google assistant to
help kids learn something new explore
new interests imagine with story time or
just share laughs with the whole family
so let me show you how my kids and their
friends had some fun this weekend ready
to see musical champion which was the
first planet to be discovered using a
telescope
hey Google can you tell me a story one
day I was hanging out at home with my
dad banded to sweet-tempered girl whose
name is Senora I can tell you as a
parent it's great to see the kids
without their screens and sharing
experiences together it's easy to get
started just say hey Google let's learn
to play science quizzes or talk to an
astronaut or try hey Google let's play a
game to play musical chairs or tackle a
riddle
and finally hey Google tell me a story
to hear classics like Snow White or
original stories like the chef to love
potatoes now to bring this to life we've
partnered with Disney will be bringing
exclusive experiences to Google home
featuring Mickey Mouse Lightning McQueen
and Star Wars we're creating many other
top brands in the family space including
Warner Brothers and Sports Illustrated
kids and starting today we're opening up
the actions on Google platform for
developers to create experiences
specifically for families and kids all
these new family features will be
rolling out later this month across all
Google home devices ok finally I have
one more exciting addition to share
that's coming to the Google home family
you
the ones who don't
say hello to max our biggest and best
sound at Google home ever
just like the pixel reimagine the camera
will do the same with sound with a
combination of great hardware and
software powered by Google's machine
learning capabilities now it starts with
a strong foundation of great hardware
the first thing you'll notice is how we
obsessed over the base it's to 4.5 inch
woofers have 22 millimeters of excursion
an extremely high range for their size
that means these woofers can move a lot
of air allowing max to really hit those
low frequencies and max can play loud
really loud it's one of 20 times more
powerful than Google home so they'll
fill any room in your house with amazing
audio now great hardware alone isn't
sufficient for great sound the challenge
of speakers today is that they're tuned
for ideal acoustic conditions but they
fall short in the real world that's why
it always sounds different in the store
than in your home to sound great the
speaker needs to adjust to you and your
home so today we're announcing smart
sound a new audio experience powered by
Google's AI it allows max to adapt to
you your environment your context your
preferences so for example if you set up
a speaker near wall on a shelf in a
corner fairly common places it could
dramatically change the sound balance of
the speaker and make the music sound
muddy and the vocals lose clarity well
with smart sound we automatically tune
the speaker to correct for this effect
using a machine learning model trained
with thousands of different room
configurations what's really cool this
is all done dynamically so if you decide
to move max a few feet it'll compensate
within seconds and overtime smart sound
will automatically adapt the sound to
fit your context lowering the volume in
the morning raising the volume when the
dishwasher is running or just adjusting
the tuning basis the type of meter
you're listening to whether it be music
podcasts or news
it's about delivering a consistent crisp
thoughtful sound experience one that's
tailored to your home and your moments
now great sound only matters you can
play a lot of great content well YouTube
music you'll have access to the world's
broadest catalog of songs remixes and
covers and we also support all free and
paid Spotify users along with other top
music services just use your voice to
start playing your favorite tunes max
also supports cast Bluetooth and stereo
aux input so you could play anything
from your phone or plug in that record
player to breathe new life into that
vinyl collection and of course max has a
Google assistant built right in we made
your assistant can hear you even when
the music is blasting using our unique
microphone placement and Google's neural
beamforming technology and with voice
match the assistant can become your own
personal DJ we recognize your voice and
we can play playlists and music stations
personalized to you and Google home max
is designed to be incredibly versatile
and fit naturally in your home you can
stand it up vertically place it
horizontally whatever it's makes sense
for your space its base magnetically
pops into place so when you change Max's
orientation there aren't any rubber feet
where they don't need to be we thought
through every detail and finally max
works seamlessly with the Google home
family and hundreds of chromecast
built-in speakers so you can use
multi-room to sync every room in your
house with immersive sound Google home
max will be available starting December
for $399 and will come in two colors
chalk and charcoal now will initially
launched in the US with more countries
coming early next year and make sure you
have an amazing sound experience out of
the box we're providing a free 12 month
subscription to YouTube red which
includes YouTube music ad free we think
you're going to really love the newest
members of the Google home family along
with the updates to the Google assistant
they represent a big leap forward and
type of helpfulness fun and sound you
can expect from Google in the home and
the clothes we gave max to a music lover
to get their thoughts let's take a look
I'm a producer in a DJs I'm not
classically trained but I'm obsessed
with music I listen to music all day
long I'm constantly being critical of my
little music of music that I hear what's
this hey Google Play particular by Major
Lazer sure particular by Major Lazer &amp;amp;
DJ here it is on YouTube
turn it up hey Google play the song that
goes rhythms like bend it all right
no no better by Major Lazer here it is
on YouTube
the speaker can find the periphery of
walls and where it is located in a room
have that technology to understand where
it is and to adjust appropriately is
amazing that sounds great
that's if people could actually hear
what we're giving them from when it
leaves our studio that would be amazing
that's what any producer or artist would
love hey Google turn it all the way up
so you know No
as you just saw there's so much amazing
innovation happening in the home space
and at the same time our phones have
evolved become the most trusted devices
in our lives but you ever wondered why
the laptop experience has been basically
the same for the past 20 years so while
the laptop experience hasn't changed all
that much how we use technology in our
lives
definitely has we live online we create
and collaborate more than ever we use
tons of apps every day and we're
constantly jumping between our phone
tablet and laptop to get things done and
have fun shouldn't we be able to do
whatever we want on whatever device is
in front of us we think so
we worked hard to combine the most
helpful parts of a laptop a tablet and a
smartphone to fit how we use technology
today meet Google pixel book the
high-performance Chromebook
pixel of reimagines laptop experience by
marrying the best of premium performance
hardware the speed simplicity and
security of Chrome OS the smarts of the
Google assistant and all your favorite
apps pixel book is the perfect example
of how we combine the best of hardware
and software with AI at the center we'll
start with a stunning versatile design
pixel book is the thinnest lightest
laptop we've ever made at just around 10
millimeters thin and a kilogram light in
fact it's so light I find myself
constantly checking my bag to make sure
I haven't forgotten it pixel book easily
adapts with a 4 in 1 design so it's
built for the many ways you want to use
it when you're at your most productive
it's an incredible laptop fold the
keyboard underneath and easily watch
videos or play your favorite games use
pixel book as a tablet to catch up on
the latest news or read a book it's the
first convertible laptop that actually
feels natural to use as a tablet prop it
up into tent mode to share your screen
or fall along with the recipe in the
kitchen use it however you want
because pixel book adapts to fit the
office the classroom movie night or even
a long flight pixel phone fans will
appreciate our signature glass inlay on
the lid giving it not only a refined
look but improved wireless performance
the twelve point three inch touchscreen
display is gorgeously higher resolution
with vibrant colors deep blacks and
enough brightness to use outside even on
a sunny day we developed an extremely
thin keyboard that's comfortable to use
with soft touch keys and a backlit
design that helps you work from anywhere
and pixel books trackpad uses touch
processing algorithms that improve
accuracy and palm rejection with Intel
Core i5 and i7 processors pixel book
packs a punch
it offers plenty of RAM to handle your
multitasking needs and gives you up to
512 gigs of storage the long-lasting
battery provides up to 10 hours of use
from a single charge and plugging in for
just 15 minutes gives you 2 hours of
battery life you can even use your pixel
book charger with your pixel phone
giving you one less thing to carry
around and in moments when you don't
have access to Wi-Fi pixel book is smart
enough to automatically connect through
your pixel phone we call this instant
tethering it's so much simpler than
setting up a hotspot on my phone and
then manually connecting to it on my
laptop now let's take a further look at
the software experience inside pixel
book this laptop is fast it starts up in
seconds
stays fast throughout the day and won't
slow down over its lifetime Chrome OS
provides a more secure computing
experience with multiple layers of
security and automatic updates no need
to worry about manual downloads or
annoying security patches to keep your
machine safe and your most important
files are available on your local Drive
and securely backed up with Google Drive
so you can access them from anywhere
online or offline we're also excited
ounce that pixel book is the first
laptop with the Google assistant
built-in making it radically helpful
just like you can with your other
devices you can check the weather before
heading out for the day control your
smart home set reminders check if my
Packers on your assistant is there for
you no matter what you're doing and
we've made it easy to interact with the
assistant in all the ways you use pixel
book when it's intent or entertainment
mode and the keyboard is tucked away
simply say ok Google Play future me
and that exact music video I had in mind
starts playing on YouTube other times
though it's not the right moment or
place to talk to your computer like if
you're sitting at a coffee shop or out
in the audience right now so pixel book
has a key that puts the power of the
assistant right at your fingertips
letting you type your request and when
you're using your pixel book as a tablet
it's easiest to show your assistant what
you need help with on your screen that's
why we created the new pixel book pen a
smart responsive companion for your
pixel book just hold the Pens button and
circle an image or text on the screen
and the assistant will take action when
you're browsing through a blog and
discover a new musician you can circle
their photo and the assistant will give
you more information about them from
there you can check out their Instagram
page go to their YouTube channel get a
list of their songs and more or if
you're doing homework
the assistant can help with your
research like if you get stuck on a
really unfamiliar concept just circle
the word and the assistant will give you
everything you need to know the pen is
also handy for moments when it feels
more natural to write draw or take notes
like when you're using your pixel book
as a tablet the experience using a pen
should be like writing on paper to bring
that experience to life we partnered
with the engineers at Wacom and together
we build the fastest most responsive
stylus experience ever
with just 10 milliseconds of latency 60
degrees of angular awareness and 2000
levels of pressure sensitivity pixel
pixel book pen uses machine learning for
handwriting recognition and demonstrates
how performance Hardware combined with
our expertise and machine learning
delivers a user experience that just
works better and shouldn't the apps you
know and love on your phone also be
available on your laptop with pick
look they are pixels look fully supports
Google Play so popular smartphone apps
are now available on a laptop in fact
it's never been easier to put the final
touches on your favorite photos in Adobe
Lightroom and then post them straight to
Instagram you can listen to music from
Spotify or download netflix shows and
movies reviewing on the go pixel book is
also perfect for creativity apps like
Evernote AutoCAD and more snapchat is
already one of the most popular apps
among early users and we're thrilled to
announce that the snap team is working
with us to bring an amazing snapchat
experience to the larger screen on pixel
book in addition to these amazing pixel
book experiences you've seen so far
there are many more developers building
for the larger screen now let's take a
look at how pixel book will fit into
your life ok Google Play discover weekly
on Spotify ok
so that's a first look at pixel book a
radically helpful laptop that combines
the best of Google's AI software and
hardware we think you'll love the
beautiful versatile design high
performance hardware and software new
ways to access the assistant and all
your favorite apps it's available in
three configurations so you can choose
the performance memory and storage
that's right for you
pixel book starts at $9.99 and the pixel
book pen is $99 both products will be
available in the US Canada and the UK on
the Google store had over a thousand
retail locations including Best Buy
pre-orders start today and they'll be in
stores beginning October 31st we can't
wait to see how you use pixel book to
work play and create next mario is going
to come out and talk about our pixel
phones
at Google we believe in questioning a
status quo asking more from the world
around us is in our nature after all
Google was built on a single question
what if all the information in the world
was available to everyone everywhere a
big question for us is what if
smartphones got smarter and simpler we
set out to design of phone ourselves
because we believed we could make the
smart phone experience better the first
pixel phone delivered a clean and fast
UI put the Google assistant in your
pocket and brushed it brought you the
best camera ever in a smart phone and we
didn't stop asking big questions or
working to solve big challenges for
users today we're proud to introduce the
Google pixel to designed for you with
the best of Google built in we've
created the new pixel in two sizes a 5
inch and the 6 inch XL with thoughtful
design elements and improvements to the
UI throughout we're bringing you more
Google assistant capabilities we've
added new smart experiences to the
camera and will continue to deliver the
best photography plus we're introducing
some innovative new products to
complement your pixel experience we do
all this by bringing together the best
of hardware software and AI let's begin
with the design we've evolved the pixels
iconic look to be even bolder the all
aluminium body with a premium hybrid
coating gives it a sleek and clean
profile the soft sculpted back with a
distinct side band feels comfortable and
secure in your hand the refined visor is
made of sturdy gently curved colored
glass and transitions seamlessly into
the metal body we've placed the
fingerprint sensor where your finger
naturally Falls it's extremely accurate
secure and in unlocks faster than
the other smartphone we also added a
small pop of color on the power button
for a bit of playfulness over on the
front pixel two's front-facing stereo
speakers are precision tuned to deliver
the perfect balance of volume clarity
and frequency response we placed them so
you can comfortably watch videos in
landscape mode without muffling the
audio with your hand if you prefer
headphones use your existing analog
headphones with the included adapter or
your digital USBC headphones for the
highest resolution audio all the way to
your ears or avoid cables altogether
with your upgraded Bluetooth 5.0 support
and high five codecs the smaller 5-inch
pixel too features a full HD OLED
display and it's as smart as it is
beautiful the display intelligently
selects which specific pixels to turn on
leaving the others perfectly dark for a
100,000 to 1 contrast ratio that's twice
the resolution and more than ten times
the contrast ratio of phones in its
category with LCD displays pixel two
comes in three colors kind of blue just
black and clearly white we love taking
the color names so let's talk about the
display on the XL the six-inch pixel to
XL was designed with innovative P OLED
display technology we elegantly curved
the glass to bring the display to the
edges for a full screen immersive
viewing experience the screen supports
18 by 9 q HD plus resolution with over
4.1 million pixels which equals 538
pixels per inch for amazing detail we
tune the display to take advantage of
the wide color gamut for vivid and
realistic colors we've integrated a
circular polarizer which lets you enjoy
the screen even while wearing sunglasses
and we've optimized the displays on both
phones for virtual reality they're both
daydream ready the pixel 2 XL comes in
two colors
just black and the stylish ly simple
black and white feel free to choose
whichever size pixel you prefer because
you'll get the same great experience on
both we don't set-aside better features
for the larger device both devices both
devices are ip67 water and dust
resistant and have an all-day battery
the charge is super fast you get up to
seven hours of charge in just 15 minutes
now Sabrina from the pixel product team
is going to take us through the new
pixel 2 UI and some cool and useful
features thanks Mario we're constantly
working to make the smartphone
experience easier and more helpful and
you'll see improvements throughout the
pixel twos UI that helpfulness starts
before you've even unlocked the phone
let me show you the pixel twos new
always-on display you can see important
information like the time date email and
text notifications and reminders all
without pushing any buttons or unlocking
the device and there's more than just
notifications on your always-on display
have you ever heard a song you loved and
wondered what it was called with now
playing you can just glance down to see
the song name an artist on your phone
what makes this feature so special is
that the music is identified without
your pixel to sending any information to
Google on device machine-learning
detects when music is playing and
matches it to a database of tens of
thousands of song patterns on your phone
in this example you can see that pics
will recognize the song perfect places
by Lorde
from here I can tap on the song title
and I'm taken to this Google assistant I
can add the song to my library in my
favorite music service like google play
music or Spotify search the web for the
song or even watch the video on YouTube
this features brought me some delightful
moments over the past few months and I'm
finally learning who sings my favorite
songs ok so let's go to a live demo here
we are on the new pixel to home screen
you can see here I've selected one of
our live wallpapers this is from our new
collection called the living universe
and if you look closely you'll notice
subtle movements like the waves crashing
on the beach 11th at the top of the
screen there's a space called at a
glance where you can easily see the
latest updates on your day we're
starting with calendar events today with
traffic flight status and more coming
soon in this case I can see that I've
got a mysterious meeting coming up not
sure what that's about we've placed the
Google quick search box at the bottom of
the home screen which we found that it's
easier to reach and we're making it even
more powerful it stays with you as you
swipe across your screens of apps and
widgets a quick tap into the search box
can help me find anything that I need as
I start typing
I can see web search results at the top
but also contacts and apps from my phone
I can even drag an app from here and
drop it right on my home screen we've
also made it faster and easier to get to
the Google assistant on pixel 2 with a
new feature called active edge just give
your pixel a quick squeeze where your
hand naturally holds the phone and ask
for whatever you need here's a quick
demo
I just I just squeeze the phone take a
selfie one hand no buttons help me out
front row
our research team investigated dozens of
ways to trigger the assistant but
squeezing the phone felt the most
natural satisfying and efficient after a
lot of work and machine learning we're
able to accurately identify an
intentional squeeze we're really proud
of how it turned out and it even works
when your phone is in a case so your
assistant is just a quick squeeze away
making lots of common tasks on your
phone fast and easy from calling and
texting friends to controlling your
smart home to enjoying your favorite
music and videos and having the same
assistant at home and on your phone
means the experience is connected across
devices for example I can say to my
phone ok Google broadcast hey I'm almost
home with the pizza so get ready for
dinner
and my voice message is shared with my
family through the Google home in our
kitchen the routines Rishi mentioned are
coming to the phone as well and we've
also customized routines specifically
from when you're on the go the one I use
most is when I'm on my commute I jump in
my car drop my phone in the cupholder
and say ok Google let's go home sure
let's go your commute home is currently
27 minutes with heavy traffic if you
take US 101 south you have one unread
text message it's from mom it says we'll
bring dessert to dinner tonight here's
where you left off in fresh air have a
safe drive I'm Terry Gross with fresh
air super useful all from one quick
command I love how it resumed my podcast
right from right where I left off my
assistant even adjusts the volume so I
can hear clearly on the road and
automatically sends a message to my
husband letting him know I'm on my way
like all the new routines that the
assistant will support you can custom
this one based on your preferences so
with a quick squeeze useful routines
on-the-go and an assistant that keeps
getting smarter pixel continues to be
the most helpful phone around pixel to
will launch with pure Android Oreo with
features like notification dots
picture-in-picture and many more if you
already have a pixel you recently
received the Android Oreo update and we
hope you're enjoying all the
improvements as a pixel user you'll
always be the first to get OS and
security updates without having to do
anything your phone becomes faster more
capable and more secure all the time
next up like Aparna is going to share
some smart helpful new ways to use your
pixel to
have you ever asked yourself what kind
of puppy is that or I want pillows with
that pattern our phones can help us in
many ways
but sometimes the questions we have are
difficult to describe into a search box
as you heard sooner talk about we
believe that as computers can understand
what you see it unleashes a whole new
kind of assistance that's why we started
working on Google Lenz a way to do more
with what you see you're super excited
to bring a preview of Lenz to pixel
phones this year so let's see it in
action say you see this flyer for piano
lessons as a guilty mum I've done this
as you know the email addresses on them
are always so long my best music teacher
sf 2001 at gmail.com now you can simply
tap on the lens icon grab the right
information and fire off that email this
also works for phone numbers websites
and addresses here's another example
you're at your friend's place at a party
you see this nice print and you wonder
who's the artist now you can just lens
it you can also follow up with what else
did he paint you can use lens to answer
many more questions like is this movie
worth watching
it totally is how good is this book from
Zadie Smith tell me all about this album
that my music hip friend Rishi cent
screenshots of what was the tempo from
our trip five years ago look across all
these examples there are a lot of things
happening under the hood that are all
coming together so I'm gonna geek out
for a moment and call out a few things
the computer vision systems we've had
some major breakthroughs in deep
learning and now they go from pixels in
the photo to things in the scene the
power of Google search helps us train
these algorithms with millions and
millions of images across the entire web
the power of
Google's knowledge graph with its
billions of facts about people places
things we put it all together and now
you know this Buddhist temple in Kyoto
was built in the year 1230 680 who have
known now this has to work in the
noisiest of conditions you know these
photos can be taken at different angles
different times of the day different
weather conditions out-of-focus pictures
shaking hands you get the picture
to be clear sometimes computers do trip
up especially when things kind of look
similar like this let's take a moment is
this a muffin or is this a chihuahua you
tell me it's early days for Lance but
you know this is a familiar journey for
us when Google started our search index
contain about 25 million pages now it's
in the trillions when we started working
on wise recognition our algorithms
couldn't always catch what you were
saying especially with an accent like
mine
now we have an accuracy rate of more
than 95% that's as good as humans we're
just getting started
with helping you do more with what you
see be the photo from five years ago or
something right in front of you in time
we want to bring lens everywhere but
super excited to bring a preview of lens
to pixel users first so you'll start to
see this icon appear in Google photos
and soon Google assistant we just talked
about how the phone can help you
understand the world but it can also
help you place things into the world
that's right
that's augmented reality we see it as a
powerful way to bring the physical and
the digital together that's why we
started working on a our core our
augmented reality SDK for Android and we
see that developers are already using it
to create some amazing experiences I
want to show you a few examples here so
let's take house they're bringing the
show room into your living room using a
our with League of Legends you can watch
one of the most popular eSport games
on an AR map built by grab games and
with Lego my favorite you can build
virtual models with characters that
really come to life all the fun no LEGO
pieces to step on we at Google are also
making some fun things and our teams
have been working hard to create this
new experience we call it a are stickers
it's built right into the camera and
it's exclusive to pixel with a are
stickers you can express yourself with
playful emojis like this one food
characters here there's lots to choose
from and more will be added over time
our partners are also making some fun
stickers here and I want to show some of
them to you right now so let's start
with the Netflix origin over my favorite
show stranger things can wait for season
2 ready to see it
ok time to set the mood lights please
okay here's Lea using the pixel camera
we're looking at the a are stickers
we're in the stranger things collection
yes
okay so let's pick a character let's
pick Demi Gorgon and place him right
next to me okay you need to have a cup
of coffee do you notice how the
creatures not just sitting around where
you put it and it's not a dead sticker
it's moving it's reacting to what's
around it it's alive we really pay
attention to the motion in the physics
the lighting we want to make it feel
like it's actually here is it
but let's have some fun this is a great
photo or video by the way fees but let's
have some fun here Lia can be dropped 11
into this alright okay this is getting
interesting now we have two characters
in the scene and notice how they're not
just reacting to you the environment
around them they're reacting to each
other right they know each other's
presence that's a big reaction these
interactions make some really
interesting moments here Thank You Leah
now you can be the director of all kinds
of stories and share we share these with
your friends you have more AR stickers
to play with your favorite characters
from SNL YouTube the NBA and just in
time for episode 8 Star Wars I've been
playing with these stickers are so easy
to use and they look great and this is
because the pixel camera is specially
calibrated for augmented reality it
allows robust tracking even in low-light
conditions
it also supports 60 frames per second
rendering of AR content you saw how the
camera can help us do more with what we
see with google lens you saw how the
camera can bridge the physical and
digital with AR but the pixel camera
also takes awesome photos so to tell you
all about it you'll have Mario back on
stage
thanks Aparna we hear every day from
users of the first pixel phone that the
camera is one of their favorite features
you can see why in the amazing photos
that people post with the team pixel
hashtag last year pixel received a DxO
score of 89 that was the highest rating
that DxO mark an ever issued to a
smartphone with pixel - we have
reimagined smartphone photography
through great Hardware and unparalleled
imaging software tuned by our engineers
and researchers today we're proud to
announce that DxO mark has issued pixel
to an unprecedented score of 98 that's
the highest score of any smartphone
camera let's talk about how we achieve
that and it starts with great hardware
the pixel 2 has a 12 megapixel F 1.8
aperture rear camera with optical image
stabilization we've integrated these
components with our HDR + computational
photography for every photo we take a
burst of shots with short exposure times
to avoid blowing out the highlights
within a line and combine each pixel
algorithmically for optimal color and
contrast all of this happens instantly
with zero shutter lag the results are
stunning with high dynamic range even in
challenging low-light conditions this
year we've increased the dynamic range
and improved texture and sharpness and
combined with a new autofocus mechanism
an optical image stabilization to reduce
blur from shaky hands you get amazing
shots every time like this and this
pixel - also brings you portrait mode
but we're implementing it a little bit
differently we're applying Google's
unmatched computational photography and
machine learning portrait mode lets you
take professional-looking shots with a
blurred background to make the
foreground pop
like what you might capture with an SLR
camera other smartphones do this by
combining the images from two cameras
pixel to does portrait mode with just
one camera and machine learning what's
unique about pixel 2 is that it can
generate a true depth map with a single
lens so you get beautiful portrait shots
without needing a second camera the way
this works is that the pixel to camera
includes a dual pixel sensor technology
this means that each pixel in an image
contains a right and a left view the
difference in perspective from those
pixels combined with machine learning
models trained on almost a million
photos means that this works on really
hard cases like a busy colorful
background and yes this does work with
objects too and there's more portrait
mode doesn't just work on the main
camera because of the quality of
Google's computational photography with
a single camera you can also take
portrait selfies through the front
camera on both the pixel 2 and the pixel
2 XL the pixel 2 takes amazing videos -
we're applying optical image
stabilization simultaneously with video
stabilization at the same time other
smartphones do optical or digital we do
but don't do both at the same time
during video recording on a pixel - the
OIS Hardware actively corrects shake
artifacts while at the same time the
software based video stabilization uses
intelligent frame look ahead to
stabilize the overall video we call this
fused video stabilization and it's
another example of Google's hardware +
software + AI working together the
result is less motion blur even in
low-light your videos look smooth and
professional the pixel 2 camera also
supports a feature called motion photos
the photos you take with your in for the
photos you take your pixel captures up
to 3 seconds of video behind the scenes
removing uninteresting motion and
applying our unique fuse video
stabilization technology - the result
but of course the proof is in the photos
and videos so we invited some
photographers and producers to test
drive the new camera and they were
stunned but what they can do with the
pixel - Timmy McGurk
better known as 13th witness in on
Instagram and filmmaker Zac McTeague
documented a recent trip to New Orleans
using just the pixel - the film you're
about to see uses no attachments fancy
rigs or lighting all of the video
footage and stills were captured on
pixel - phones without any image
enhancements or color Corrections
again each photo and video and what you
just saw was shot using only pixel two
phones no image enhancements or color
Corrections now the pixel to camera is
simple enough and smart enough that your
photos and videos can look just as good
so the pixel choose photo experience
doesn't end when you take a photo or
shoot a video we want users to be able
to easily find them and store them
securely without having to worry about
running out of storage after all simple
storage and search is part of what makes
us Google so we're happy to announce
that pixel to users will continue to get
free unlimited storage for all of the
photos and videos they capture in the
highest resolution including 4k videos
and motion photos this is a big deal
this is a big deal pixel users take
twice as many photos as typical iPhone
users and store an average of 23
gigabytes of photos and videos per year
in Google's cloud if you had to use
iCloud you'd reach your free limit in
less than three months with pixel you
can safely and effortless effortlessly
store all of your memories for free with
your permission Google photos
automatically tags and categorizes those
thousands of photos and videos will take
with your pixel too you can search for
photos of your friends of a specific
location of dogs all without the hassle
of manually tagging or sorting finding
your photo the photo you're looking for
is our problem and not yours we're
delighted by what we've been able to
achieve with pixel 2 in terms of
photography and are so excited by all
the moments that you're going to capture
so to recap the smart and simple pixel 2
has everything you'd expect from a
smartphone and some things you might not
a gorgeous display that brings your apps
photos and videos to life an all-day
battery that charge is super fast plus
water resistance and security features

with some sharks and blast into space
with pixel twos new front firing stereo
speakers these movies sound as amazing
as they look and now you can even cast
the experience to the TV so your friends
and family can see what you're seeing
the new Google daydream view is the best
mobile VR headset on the market and will
be available for $99 today we're also
announcing a smart new audio accessory
that works perfectly with pixel - our
first pair of premium wireless
headphones they're called they're called
Google pixel buds our team designed
pixel buds for great sound delivering
clear highs and deep bass so whether
it's jazz house or a symphony it all
sounds incredible with pixel buds
controlling your music is super simple
because all of the controls are built
into the right earbud you simply tap to
start and stop your music or swipe
forwards and backwards to change the
volume now what's amazing is when you
pair your pixel buds with your pixel two
you get instant access to the Google
assistant we optimized the experience to
be quick and easy just touch and hold
the earbud and ask your assistant to
play music send a text or give walking
directions all while keeping your phone
in your pocket it can also alert you to
new notifications and read your messages
pixel buds work great with pixel they
even give you access to a new real-time
translation experience it's an
incredible application of Google
Translate powered by machine learning
that's like having a personal translator
by your side to show you how easy this
experience is I'd like to invite Isabel
back on stage for a conversation in her
native language Swedish so Isabel is
going to speak Swedish into her pixel
buds and all hear the English
translation out of pixel twos front
speakers and then I'll respond in
English and she'll hear the Swedish
translation in her pixel buns to
illustrate this today you'll hear both
sides of the conversation okay
hey Isabelle how's it going hey Lisa
been here I like it here okay pack what
do you think of these cool new
headphones what you can do under my
cooler near her LaDonna mitten the sign
mother on sale Tacoma can scare Cola so
while you're up here what color should I
get me on the one hand we can fight the
Evalia hmm a Throwdown sky blue or
scalloped ass today
all right truly a brown-eyed people came
in no Sienna roughly and I thank you as
a bell
so with pixel buds I can use real-time
Google Translate to have a natural
conversation in 40 languages we're
letting you connect with the world
around you in a more natural way by
rethinking how a headphone should work
connecting it to cloud-based machine
learning and giving you access with the
touch of a finger
Google pixel buds come in a pocket-sized
charging case that provide up to five
hours of listening time with just one
charge and the case holds multiple
charges so you get up to 24 hours of
listening time when you're on the go
pixel buds are available in clearly
white kind of blue and just black -
beautifully compliment your pixel - and
they'll feel available in November for
$159 and pre-orders begin today
we have one more product to show you
it's about photography now we all love
photos a lot of our photos let us step
back into a moment with friends with
family some of our favorites are the
candid ones like this they capture the
essence of a moment but the problem is
to get those photos someone needs to be
the photographer on duty waiting to
press the shutter button at just the
right moment and we were thinking how do
you capture those fleeting spontaneous
moments while letting yourself be part
of the moment so we've been working on
that and I'm really excited to share an
entirely new type of camera that works
with your pixel we call it Google clips
and this first edition is specifically
designed with parents and pet owners in
mind so you'll capture more of those
spontaneous smiles first steps and first
tricks now clips has all the things you
would expect from a great camera a high
performance lens a powerful image sensor
it has a shutter button but that's not
what this camera is all about we
reimagine this camera from the inside
out
starting with the software and applying
machine learning to build a camera that
takes photos for you so you can enjoy
the moment and instantly get shots you
couldn't get before thank you how does
all that work it starts with an AI
engine at the core of the camera let's
talk about what that engine does when
you're behind a camera you look for
people you care about you look for
smiles you look for that moment your dog
starts chasing her tail clips does all
of that for you turn it on and it
captures the moment so you can be in the
moment and because the software is at
the core of the camera it's going to get
smarter
over time we also reimagine what camera
hardware should do for you
clips is tiny it weighs almost nothing
so you can easily toss it into your
pocket and it's a hands-free camera so
you can get these amazing new
perspectives on your experience and get
yourself in the shot by attaching clips
to almost anything or setting it down
now from the beginning we knew privacy
and control really matter and we've been
thoughtful about this for Clips users
their family and their friends let's
start with the basics it looks like a
camera and it has an indicator light so
everyone knows what the device does next
it looks for stable clear shots of
people you know and you help the camera
learn who's important to you and finally
all of the machine learning happens on
the device itself so just like any
point-and-shoot nothing leaves your
device until you decide to save and
share it this approach to designing and
engineering clips required some
significant technical breakthroughs to
miniaturize the type of powerful machine
learning that only a few years ago
needed a supercomputer let's take a look
at what Clips actually captures so
here's some clips I've captured with my
family at home now as you can see it's
not just photos that clips is taking
taking little snippets that capture the
whole moment we call those of course
clips you can save them as a motion
photo or choose any frame to save as a
high-resolution still it's like having
my own photographer shooting and
choosing the best moments for me and I
just have to swipe to save to Google
photos which can automatically make
movies out of your clips in seconds so
that's the new Google clips a new type
of camera that brings together at the
best of Google AI software and hardware
tell people more easily capture genuine
candid moments of family
and pets clips ibly coming soon and
selling for $249 take a look at some of
these great clips from our earliest
users enjoy hello again everyone what
you just saw in pixel buds and clips
blends AI with the best of Google
software and high performance hardware
to create new radically helpful
experiences for users this is our
strategy for the Google hardware team
and you've seen it come to life in all
of our new products the two newest
members of the Google home family the
beautiful new pixel phones and our
premium pixel book laptop and of course
the Google assistant is the primary way
we bring a eye to our users your
personal Google is ready to get you the
help you need when you need it
talk to it type show what you see or
just give your phone a squeeze it's the
simplest way to get things done and it
just works so here it is this year is
made by Google family
we've created them as a single set of
products that are designed for you with
familiar elements from soft materials to
curved lines and simple stylish colors
they look great together and they also
work great together and perfectly
demonstrate our approach of reimagining
hardware from the inside out
thanks so much for joining us today
whew live stream viewers take a closer
look at our new products at a redesigned
Google store for everyone here in SF
jazz you'll get to see everything up
close in our demo area outside thank you
so much and enjoy your day
how can I help
don't forget your umbrella
all right we are back we are grooving I
gotta say those DJs we're hot house like
I was like doing all like the chest
stuff and everything so what we have
here guys and gals Patrick Holland and
myself are still in the house
Stephen Beecham is running the show
we're gonna take your calls we're gonna
let you talk about it we're gonna talk
about it with you so many things to talk
about but let's just get to the number
that you guys and gals can call him
we're sorry we had to drop the calls
during the keynote it just it was like
two hours so the phone number that you
could call is
yeah I don't even have to use it you can
tell it's a better product literally off
the bat and you could no it looks
amazing - I mean I think the design is
beautiful but when he just did like hey
what's that song that goes like wow yeah
it's like that's me like every day that
is like me every day for most of my life
and now something's that are someone's
gonna bill to reply to me and actually
play the music that my gibberish songs
and mouths make but I think that's just
impressive the technology but also the
way they're presenting it this very like
consumer-friendly it's very fun we're
not getting kind of bogged down in spec
Specter at the beginning one of the one
of the Google execs I said you know what
all phones we're at like a hardware like
still me you know everything is kind of
like stagnant with that and all that
innovation is come in at Google
assistance coming in there there are
Google lense and all these AI things
that they've been working on for years
and machine learning
it's so exciting yeah I just you know
there's there's subtle things that
happen at this keynote where it's
literally all driven by software and
machine learning and Google just they
just pepper these things you're like oh
damn and you're like no one has this and
that's what that's what gets us excited
about tech so the phone lines are
completely filled we go ten deep so what
we're gonna do is we're gonna spend the
next half hour so you're just grinding
down through this you know some people
want to talk about what they love some
people want to talk about what they
don't like this is all about you all so
let's start off I don't have the name
here in their screener but let's start
off with our first call I guess the
number area code is a little 202 they
want to talk about though what's up oh
there is hold on one second guys guys
and gals give me a second hold on yes it
was get that way I would still bump into
that DJ yeah okay is it gone now okay so
we have it is if you had that new pick
so sweet about it
this is what I'm learning oh here that
was another one okay is it gone now okay
sorry guys you know I'm watching the
keynote okay
your buddy our buddy or our gal from the
202 first caller in here that want to
talk about the lack of information about
I'm not sure exactly about a service but
welcome to the show seen that live here
what's up what up right yeah what to
talk about
the lack of info on Google Phi the
cellular services that Google has
attached to the pixel you know like
we've we've seen it obviously available
and they've kind of catered towards
pixel users I haven't they typically
don't talk about Google Phi at the
keynotes quite honestly because they
really try to make it a little bit more
product focused but yeah we didn't we
didn't hear anything I don't know what's
what's the latest with it quite honestly
but yeah we didn't hear anything from it
were you looking here is only specific
if it was like any improvements on it
cuz like right now I'm calling on the
the old pixel with Google fire and it's
just this the big seller about it was
the fact that it switches between
t-mobile US Cellular and Sprint network
and in Wi-Fi that's open so you can save
a lot on your bill and all that so
beyond just the other major the other
major thing would be obviously the free
storage but the Google 5 service is
actually a game changer when you think
about it but they never really go too
heavy into it I think in a weird way and
this this sounds bad but sometimes I
think in it's not that they don't think
that we're smart enough to get it but
sometimes when when they it might take
the energy out of the room when they
want to show like sexy eye candy and
then talk about Google you know that
that that's would be probably their main
reason for it but yeah you're absolutely
right about this service I mean look it
for example look at what they did at the
end of the keynote with Google clips
that just sucked all the energy and
excitement out of the room that appeals
to probably like 1% of its user base I
mean I'm not trying to hate on it just
wasn't something it didn't align with
everything else that you're like yeah
yeah yeah and so I feel like if they did
this whole five minute spiel about
Google vibe it might have some similar
kind of let down a feeling not that it's
not a great product right so that's why
I don't think that we might have seen as
much in it but what do you think about
the pixel - I mean you're a pixel owner
so obviously you have an experience with
a platform all right ok well it's ok we
I thought I thought it was I thought
great I mean I think the pixel two is a
special phone again well we'll have to
see how the availability of it comes
through Verizon exclusive from what we
have heard up to this point but like you
said it's like this I mean it's very
similar to how they brought the picture
last year but yeah will this will they
actually have the phones to sell and and
make it affected with that but also like
the features they have like it doesn't
also make the last year's pixel obsolete
like sometimes I feel like brands will
go other way to show you this amazing
new phone and you're like man this
iPhone 7 I guess this sucks now that's a
great point that's a great point I think
get that vibe from Google yeah yeah I
mean they're rolling out all the
software into the new pixel other than
obviously the advancements of the camera
which we'll talk about a little bit what
we're showing you footage right now is
actually from this is raw like on the
fly but this is live in the demo room of
Google's event over at the SF jazz
center so while we talk about these
things will kind of cut in between there
are actually getting shots for our first
looks but we wanted it kind of at least
when they're using it give you some
shots of it inside the live room we're
gonna keep on going through our phone
lines we're sorry about that ray but we
got nothing but love for you we have
another call here name is not identified
but we're coming to us from the five
five nine talking about the show just
now what's going on welcome to see that
live yeah what's up Allen thanks for
calling man great I found out with
amusing yeah absolutely and I think that
that hamachi that they rent coffee huh
funny you know they had to come up there
once they said that they were there
would be no actual headphone jack on
this phone it was clear to us that they
had to have some sort of a solution
quite honestly we knew about it but we
can't always say everything like that
we unless it was leaked we don't want to
talk about you know we knew about it
before the keynote but we didn't want to
just spoil it for anyone because that's
kind of
but man to actually see that translation
in action I thought that was a that was
pretty special
yeah that's pretty special it's not a
feature you would use um yeah I would
you know traveling a lot easier when you
go to foreign country I mean it would be
a feature that I would have to use just
even with people that speak English
sometimes I mean they need to work on in
English to English translator for me
sometimes people are like what are you
saying Tong it's at least ten years out
my friends know we're working on it but
I liked it and I thought that you were
universe noting that the price point was
very similar to the air pots as well
it's not exactly the same yeah I mean a
lot more functionality you know actual
functionality with multiple types of
controls the Google assistant prompt and
translation that's that's pretty awesome
so now that was a you know I know people
are gonna say oh it has a wire on it so
what they're still Wireless they don't
look bad yeah they look good I can't I
like that they have the colors that
match the phones as well yeah I like
details like that matter yeah absolutely
so hey Alan thanks so much for calling
we're gonna keep on cranking through the
lines but we appreciate you all right no
problem all right all the way from
Barbados man oh yeah we dig it he's got
he's got his priorities right they'll
call in like that that's what I would do
if I was in Barbados so a lot of people
um if I don't get to your actual name
it's just because you didn't say it in
our screening program but that's okay
I'm gonna just kind of do the best I can
to prompt you just let us know once we
get you we're gonna take a call here
let's see if I can get this super we're
gonna take a call here from our friend
from the seven one eight welcome to see
net live what's going on who's this
what's up Alex would you like to talk
about today turns out to be very useful
I guess cuz I mixed really excited about
Google buts because I like to trouble a
lot and it just generally yeah was there
anything else that stuck out to you in
the keynote that it was really stuck out
to me too
useful in a way how in the your but
incorporating the lena phone and they
just you know actually look into the
phone and then just speak for you
so it was really nice and you know yeah
are you a pixel owner at all right now
no I'm not a persona I'm a gap CS owners
so is that something that would
encourage you to switch over because it
has the pure the the thing that people
we know we're so used to the idea of it
it's a pixel phone but it's a pure
Android experience pure Android I can't
understate how nice that is
alright hey thanks so much for calling
us out we appreciate it
alright we're gonna keep on cranking
through this we're gonna go here to our
buddy Darrell Evans just give it a
second Jarrell welcome to seeing that
live hey how's it going good good talk
to us man what would you like to see
once again the most amazing thing with
the the live Google Translate but I also
had a question about YouTube music it
said YouTube music for 12 months for a
while they were packaging what were the
Google music service and the YouTube
service into one do you know if that
would include both of them they didn't
make that clear so you know
unfortunately we just saw the keynote
same time as you we don't always have
all the details but did you catch
anything about they didn't mention it
but I know these referring to because
before they do we get that it be a
package in there so they didn't really
publicize that very well even before but
I was I'd be curious about that too I
think you would have to but we don't
know the details we shouldn't speculate
so hope I hope so
is it is it Jarell or is it Jarrell I'm
sorry it's Joe but we trust me we had
secrets before the key no but we
couldn't talk about him like if you
wanted me to spoil about the pixel buds
we could have but we were kind of told
hey unless it gets leaked don't talk
about it and look don't you want
surprises when you watch these keynotes
like your favorite or do your favorite
thing was actually the translate from
the pixel buds if I told you that
you would you would still think it was
cool but just not as cool
so I'm looking out for you Tyrell I'm
looking out for you my man the secrets
are out all right hey thanks so much for
calling good all right take it easy all
right we will go and jump over here for
a moment let's go check out and again
the number that the phone lines you guys
are beast they keep on just filling up
Beach if you can leave that phone line
up we will continue to answer calls for
probably out the next 10 or 15 minutes
we're going to go to our friend over
here in the seven-one-seven that wants
to talk about I believe the pixel book
what's up welcome to see that live hey
it's an honor wait your name is it's an
honor it's an honor an honor your honor
I said in the screening process uh-uh
anyway no tell us I went back there you
go Zack Doland yeah I don't know maybe
it didn't catch that
ya know I'm a long time long time
watcher first time caller yeah I wanted
to talk about the pig for the book let's
talk about it what did you what did you
like what did you maybe not like well I
love the design I love that it charges
with USB type-c which is something that
I've been looking for in a laptop for
awhile without you know sacrificing
power but the problem is is Zack - Zack
are you there oh man
it looks like it looks like the call
broke up let's talk about the pixel book
for a quick second I loved everything
feature-wise on that you know quite
honestly the biggest the thing about it
comes down to that's the biggest
obstacle as it's running a Chrome OS and
so you have to talk about support for
full fledged apps right they did show
Adobe Lightroom but there's gonna you're
living in the Google ecosystem
it I just need to throw the way that I
use machines there I do need some
higher-end graphics applications but for
most people that was that 999 started
yeah that's ridiculous for a
multifunction pen stylus based dude you
circle someone's face and it like pulls
up information about them
I don't know tablet hybrid - yeah it's a
total convertible tablet hybrid the
coolest thing I thought I saw about that
whole presentation was the pairing with
your phone being able to use the Wi-Fi
from your phone on the table maze and it
running the bus home it looks sick it
looks so beautiful with the the back of
that display I mean looks obviously just
like the phones which is the roaches
right kind of a continuity across the
problem and that's what I was getting at
earlier I didn't think that's so
thoughtful but it I just I was so scared
about that price and I'm like $9.99 Yeah
right it's so perfect we were talking
maybe it's we were thinking 12 49 or
higher when they were watching and we're
like $9.99 and again it's different
levels it whether you're starting with a
core it comes with an Intel Core i5 or
i7 a configuration I think up to 512
gigs of RAM up to sorry
storage space up to 16 gigs of ram so
this is not a weak machine by any means
and I'd like to other integrating you
know that's obviously literally
straddling the line between a tablet and
a laptop but like you know bringing
snapchat on that's gonna definitely mate
sway some users I saw Instagram flashed
up there too during the presentation but
you're just like yeah that's smart
it's smart and there are power users who
go to need like video and stuff like
that and at big editing tools but
something like Lightroom is not a very
light tool as well and that was shown on
there but man that just it looks so good
and the use and then there's the pixel
book pen yes Wow I the thing that I you
know stuck out to us the most is look
every company has their own direction of
what they will they believe the laptop
or whatever it is is going to be we now
have Microsoft who has killed it with
the surface I see plenty of surfaces in
the wild being used professionally when
I'm flying you know and traveling around
I mean people are using
product a lot we have apples philosophy
of no touchscreen whatsoever no OS to
support it it Apple came out with the
touch bar guys like that's a it's a it's
a mediocre interface at best everyone
that uses it only honoree with you and
only on its high-end laptop so what
we're looking at is we're seeing a
laptop that's not it looks high-end but
it's priced for a more of an entry-level
laptop but it has all the features you
want he has the touch screen it has the
support of an amazing stylist made by
Wacom which is an amazing tablet company
and then on top of that you have that
Google assistant on there yeah I think
is gonna be a big I mean compared to
Siri yes and it doesn't seem like it's
gonna be sandbagged for it like there's
not gonna be able to do things because
it's on a tablet or on the pixel book I
think a lot of people that don't care
about it assistant on a machine hat most
people that say oh I don't care about
that serious good enough all I have to
tell you is try using Google's assistant
just a little bit and you'll instantly
be able to be like it's smarter it's
faster it understands me better across
the board it's it's just really
impressive and we didn't even we didn't
bring up a little quick mention the
actual pixel book pen has the lowest
latency out of any pen so right now with
the iPad pro and the Apple pencil they
have a 20 millisecond least latency the
pixel book pen has a 10 millisecond
latency which is as close as pen to
paper as you're going to get and that's
so even faster than I think the
Microsoft Surface pens right yeah yeah
yeah so I think the surface pen might be
around 20 also maybe a little higher if
I recall I have to look it up we but a
10 yeah it just it really if you've
stacked up Apple's flagship laptop
versus all these other flagship laptops
from companies it feels like what their
vision of and their innovation using the
touch bar it they they're missed they're
missing it I mean I don't know about you
guys but I am used to the idea of just
touching screens now and what it'll be
funny give it maybe two three years then
Apple comes out with some sort of level
of a touch screen type laptop which
they've been so resistant to
it's here already in multiple formations
we have the Lenovo yoga line and surface
and pixel book now and plenty others
when this goes our show if you make it
you not only add that feature but you do
it well and I think that's the other
thing that you know it we didn't always
see Microsoft Surface is it they take a
while to figure it out it didn't pass a
coffee shop test but now you go in a
coffee shop and you see people on
surfaces and I think it's exciting
because you know there's always been
that little bit of a stigma around like
a Chromebook to write that like it
doesn't can't do all these things but it
just they they show that you can and it
looks nice and it's gonna be a great
experience I'm excited to try it out
yeah I just oh man that that was what I
think for me that next to the the
translation was probably the most
exciting part very cool all right we're
gonna keep on taking a few more calls I
know that the lines are completely
filled so just stick with us sometimes
the names have popped up in our in our
screeners software but we will bear with
us so let's go talk to our friend from
the five seven one come on let's go baby
it's taking a moment so just bear with
me hello there welcome hello we're here
welcome to seen alive what's your name
alright and what you want to talk about
what do you say I'm not sure we want to
repeat what he said very exciting it's a
very exciting idea but maybe not for our
lovely livestream podcast I just
realized it after it took a moment a
process and understanding that you had
yourself a little bit of latency there
welcome to the show
six one three welcome what's your name
it's Carl we're back Oh Carl we are back
yes sir yes you came back for more man
I'm oh you are so low on life I've been
waiting on the the bud first of all and
just for externality of the go free
storage bro I know a cool like iPhone
I've been dying for the past couple of
months
keep them recharged
and like we switching store it anyways
buds are amazing because I'm playing on
traveling soon and having that
translation all the time make it easy to
approach girls too
bro you need to do a video bro hold up
hold up bro
I'll do a video but there's gonna be a
point in time where if your relationship
advances with these ladies you're gonna
still be wearing those buds you're still
gonna be wearing those buns son if you
know what I mean
teach you how you know I mean I'm just
saying you don't want to wear the buds
if you know very cool was there any
other any other things that stuck out
you that you know might have surprised
you or that you liked as well
everyone loves like the butt on the
translation I actually have two two
things yeah I did been mentioned you
actually get a Google meaning with the
phone if you pre-order that's correct if
for a limited time you'll get a Google
Mini 4 so a $49 kind of throw in with
that as well yes sir okay because I mean
I'm I'm in Canada so I don't know how I
believe one traced right here called how
to pre-order the new phones now and get
your what does it call Google me Google
yeah the Google home any yes yeah I
believe I swear Canada was one of the
countries that was part of it definitely
Australia I think - yes sir Normandy and
and my second thing is I'm still not
convinced on the Google
pixel I'm like the software is I don't
know I'm more kind of like a light gamer
so I'm like I want to have that power to
push have to be able to gain especially
overwatch but as long as you got
overwatch
I'm good you're like just get me get me
my overwatch all right hey Carl thanks
so much for calling again all right no
problem all right take it easy we will
jump over to our next caller let's try
and talk to Phillip Phillip Saunders is
that correct no it kit up oh it's you
know what I'm just gonna ignore this
Auto scream fake name stuff
makes up I apologize welcome to the show
oh no no problem yeah I was actually
really impressed with with this press
conference and it's really interesting
that on how Google is really starting to
get the mind share of hey you know we're
advancing technology forward and I
really love the fact that even you know
with the Google Translate with the buds
they're really trying to compete with
Apple on on a higher level and saying
hey we can compete directly against you
and I honestly feel sorry for the other
ahead handset manufacturers you know
even including the Samsung that now
Google is taking approach to saying hey
you know we're tired of you all bubbling
our reputation for Android and now
finally we are taking over and we're
going to do what Apple is doing to
provide the consumer the best experience
and and and now with the pixel with the
camera oh my goodness that for it to get
that kind of rating is absolutely
awesome yeah yeah absolutely sorry keep
on going sir keep on going yeah and and
and and the fact is is that you know
with the with the keynote that you know
it I feel that it is it was more
exciting what what Apple presented and
even with you know iPhone 10 it's going
to be interesting with those two phones
really kind of competing against each
other and what people are going to
actually gonna you know go for but again
you know that with Google presenting hey
you know pre-order you get so many you
know the whole mini
which is now starting to get people in
the mindset of like okay well let me
talk to my jump talk to my you know
speaker but it also gives a way of
Google really infiltrating the home to
really start the home automation and
really make that a priority and you know
within the mainstream yeah you know when
Google first released the home as a
competitor to the Amazon echo what it
really came down to at the beginning and
we all kind of foresaw this Amazon echo
has great relationships with all the
third-party manufacturers they also
really opened up their API so almost
anyone could pretty much submit and make
apps and it started to build this great
like kind of community around it the
Google assistant and
technology behind it is smarter than the
Amazon echo platform but it was trailing
behind you now you're starting to see
all the support from more devices more
smart home devices and that we knew that
gap was going to close but now like you
say it's part of an ecosystem with the
phone with everything that you can do
with it
to the chromecast to this and that so
using it to dial out from your actual
phone number that that was something
that was pretty cool like just great
knowing knowing that that connection is
there so their continued to to just kind
of build and build and to your point
about the pixel phone look I have nieces
and nephews and even they say that
Google is cooler to them than Apple like
they know that Apple is they like Apple
but they think that the pixel is more
exciting and I don't indoctrinate them
at all I just you know they know that I
love tech but they're like oh let me
when we go on trips bring your quick
pixel we want to use your pixel and so I
think that some of these little hooks
and bells and whistles that they're
showing us is changing that mind share
you're seeing it and also you know with
we don't know how these are gonna sell
quite honestly let's be real right the
iPhone is gonna sell more than the pixel
but when Google decided to go we're
gonna control our own software and
hardware at the same time much like
Apple this is going to enable us to do
things we haven't done with our phones
and make them special in our in our
vision that was a big deal and I don't I
don't I think they made the pixel the
original pixel they were they didn't
necessarily care if it was a success in
the market but if it was a critical
success that was what was important
right actually having a quality product
that didn't bomb to the critics and
users whether or not it sold a lot of
units initially I think going back to
the presentation to I think we saw a lot
more discipline from Google because
we've they've always had great ideas and
some crazy products that have completely
failed but then on the flip side we saw
there's a lot more refinement to what we
saw on the products a lot more
thoughtfulness both in the design and
carrying that over from one product to
the other but also just that integration
and so now we're sitting there looking
at this not only as like a Google home
and a Google assistant we're looking at
a laptop we're looking at phones we're
looking at earbuds even
though I didn't like that Google Clips
camera it's still integrated into with
their overall thing and I think that's
actually a little more of a flashback of
old Google like a couple years ago like
hey we got the school thing and we're
gonna throw it out there it's like no
like do nobody wants that it's so good
you stayed on the track and then you got
off they didn't need to do that at all
but that's what I think I'm excited
about is we're just seeing a very mature
Google step forward and just own it and
this and yet that we had some it threw
some sand through some shaded Apple
about filters features on both phones
not separating that and that's fun and
stuff but on the flip side I think they
don't even though they are competing
with Amazon they're competing with Apple
for a long time they've been kind of
competing with themselves just to be
that disciplined like concise company
and it was just so exciting to see that
flow happen and others products man I'd
except for the clips that will poop on
the clips and then the I'd say I'm not
trying to poop on the clips but say I'm
excited to try all them out just to see
how they work together - yeah
sokar so uh Philip any any other things
that you wanted to bring up before we
let you go like are you going to which
product are you most likely looking to
purchase out of what you saw today
don't take google clips okay so it's
kideth bad Apple bad apple an apple
person yeah and I'm completely into the
Apple ecosystem and you know I'm looking
forward to the home pod but I also own a
Google home and then also an Amazon echo
yeah my mom was going off like what the
product I'm really interested in it is
the max yeah and it's really interesting
that their pricing is higher than
Apple's home pod and I'm because I'm a
very like I love you know sound I love
music just like how dippel's talked
about listening
took all the time here and for me I'm I
get excited about well they're talking
about the sound quality well I got here
it a person you know what I'm afraid of
though is that if I'm gonna hear it at a
retailer like Best Buy whoever I might
not be able to get the best sound
quality I mean it may be a good
demonstration but you know how those
places they don't really let you you
know really play anything out loud the
way that you want but it's going to be
interesting on how you know I might go
ahead and buy that product more than
anything else because even like with the
the laptop the pixel book well I got an
iPad pro and I do everything on iPad pro
it does all my productivity the only
thing I can't do is develop on it but
the but the pixel book is good but the
challenge is like you all said before
how our developers going to you know
create apps for specifically for Chrome
OS and that is going to be a challenge
because using a mobile app you know
because it connects your Google Play and
whatnot is going to require develops to
rethink their apps so that can't be
compatible with that device as well I
was so good but the Google home acts I'm
totally excited about that yeah I mean I
was fired up about right when we saw it
and they started breaking it down I'm
like this is this is better than the
home pod this I I just it's clearly
better so we'll see how we'll see how it
shakes out yep I think it's kind of like
buying a mattress to like you gotta like
just have it and live on a mattress for
a while there really no I mean this like
that's why we got returns baby but yeah
yeah all right Kenneth I got you this
time man thank you so much for calling
great talking and a love your insight
and obviously we can tell you're a tech
fan you know you're in the different
ecosystem so that's really great so we
appreciate that man
here cool no problem all right let's
keep on going we're gonna take I guess
we'll take like a few we'll take three
more calls sorry for everyone that I I
may not get to but we will talk about
they're still checking out the Google
pick
on site I looks like I have Daniel
hopefully are you there from the five
five nine yeah I'm here
welcome to the show welcome to seen it
live what did you want to talk about
today I just wanted to talk about the
fact that the screen of the pixel and
the pixel Dexter doesn't support HDR I
didn't hear them talking about HDR
supports since YouTube was so fortunate
year I'm surprised the apps pools which
is the pixel and the pixel at XL isn't
true it's not supports in HDR I'm just
surprised yeah they didn't say that I
haven't looked at the official specs
that would have probably been something
they would have touted people that are
listening or can let us know but yeah
you're right I didn't I didn't see HDR I
didn't hear to mention that and that is
like one of those little things that
it's those little things right like
eight here which I wouldn't say it's a
little thing but it's something that
you're not gonna buy you're not gonna go
I'm gonna switch this for that but it's
nice to have it and when you see a
screen that has it and you go back to
its gonna dozen oh man what a difference
and it's - it's interesting because the
faux the photographer for the photo the
camera I believe they did say it has
built in HDR capture right yeah it's
like like the pixel assist is always
capturing HD correct so your plus I
think is what they call correct so
although they didn't what's interesting
is although they didn't mention it and
again sorry that we you know we just got
out of the keynote may be the it to me
if you have a camera that captures HDR
these days you want to screen that can
display that as well so what you're
saying is I should buy the pixel tool to
take the picture and then put it on my
iPhone haha yes there you go we've got a
show up top gotta show love to everyone
so sorry we couldn't get that straight
answer at the moment but we appreciate
you calling in Daniel right okay all
right thank you thank you very much okay
let's take another one here and another
one look I'm gonna give some love back
to Ray because I think this is the Ray
where the call dropped off ray are you
there my man yeah yeah it's me I'm back
so the pixel you are asking you wanna
ask me if
if I were by the new pixel but I don't
think it's enough of an upgrade from the
first pixel to tell you the truth I'll
probably uh probably just end up buying
the the iPhone 10 I mean I got an iPhone
and a pixel right now so I press update
my iPhone you know what that's a great
point because what we need to do another
year what we talked about is the fact
that pretty much all the software
rolling out is going to be just fine on
the pixel so you're not really losing
those features other than the actual
camera hardware
you know you'll the and they you know
what they didn't I don't believe they
talked about the processor but early
rumors had said that they were using the
same processor I believe was the
Snapdragon 835 it was a 35 year right
there I think there were Instagram that
it was yeah it was using the same one so
that if that was the case again sorry we
don't have this all confirmed cuz we
just got to the keynote that would
completely support your point of like
you know what I'll just hold on for this
pixel and maybe wait for the next one
unless you really want the you know the
bigger badder screen on the pixel XL and
you haven't been and you didn't get that
but feature wise it's pretty baller you
just don't want a headphone jack I mean
that's like yeah phone jack but it's
someone they're going to translate a
little bit to the Google Translate um
because I use that a lot over this last
year the the pixel bugs could you do the
same thing with any wireless headsets
besides just swipe when you said swipe
did you mean could you use the translate
feature with any other phone is that
what you're trying to say just any other
any any other set of wireless head
headphones
could you use the translate feature I
mean it exactly yeah because like right
now you can just pull up you can pull
out your phone and go into conversation
mode and you just talk in English say
you're translating in Spanish and you'll
automatically do that it's been doing
that for a year already correct from
what I gather they wouldn't have shown
it off like that unless it was specific
to the buds yeah and the way the way was
real-time like and the other thing that
you know that she had the phone in her
hand too just to indicate that you had
it can't just be separated like that but
yeah I'm that's a good question it is is
it it is a good question yeah could you
could you do with
any headphones yeah I don't I don't know
we don't know we don't know we don't
know yeah we know here we know we don't
know what you don't know so alright ray
thanks so much for calling buddy
appreciate we got you back you know when
it drops like that yeah we got you back
so alright have a great day
cool preciate it you thank you thank you
okay let's go with one um let's go one
more call I think these are I think
these are my boys
Calvin Anthony are you all there these
are the brother brothers that like they
they want to buy teach I'm telling you
guys I don't know why you aren't doing a
podcast yet I'm waiting for it I'm
waiting for that's what I'm talking
about I'm serious man I got nothing but
love for you guys what do you guys want
to talk about today
Thank You Man you know what xyd I was
going to touch on the Google Translate
as well as as my man just said wondering
if you know you could either which is
those or some other headphones but it
looks like guys it touched on that but
other than that was gonna say the Google
home max is man a lot more impressive as
you guys know I'm a word Apple fan but
man bad that blows the little home part
out he was that's what I'm saying like I
you know I was although the home part is
higher than I'd want I was excited to
try it and when I saw that Google home
max I'm like dude that's the one to get
yeah that's how I thought now I'm
wondering if it's so nose is gonna
chronically because you know just that
it would Alexa into their products and I
love the way so no speaker sound but it
would be interesting to see this go up
against Ted and what's on also you know
doing the teacher to try to incorporate
you know assistance into their speakers
as well yeah yeah you know well well
obviously what makes this all fun as all
these companies are putting out their
products that go head-to-head we will
you know will Matt will match him up
boys it was that Calvin talking was that
Anthony talking no : okay Anthony want
to say something or you're just gonna
own this call you know what I understand
that understand that work Brian time
one of us talks a lot anyways that's
cool is there any other stuff that you
liked oh you know what um wasn't I like
the picture book the picture book was
good Anthony really liked to fix the
book um the the pixels the phone I
wasn't too impressed with but other than
that everything else was just Connor
seems good do you know develop be
concerned with some of it though I mean
that's something that's what the whole
recognizing like you're adorable and
everything in it recognizing who comes
up and stuff like that does that does
that require the Google accounts for you
to store the information and odor so
what's interesting is that nest right
Google owns nest or alphabet artist
formerly known as Google owns nest they
released all those products but that
facial recognition is actually more
built-in with nest I just think that
they've added whether you have a Google
phone or not but I think they've just
added those hooks because it's Google
and nests together or maybe it pulls
tighter from your actual contact list on
your phone instead of just living on its
own separate app a nest app with faces
on it so I don't you know again we don't
know exactly I took but that has to be
they just kind of built that specific
hook because they both are run by the
same parent company and that brings I
mean the privacy thing is something they
had a little throwaway moment earlier
there wasn't specifically with an S but
with the actual pixel to phone and
they're saying oh it will listen and you
can basically do you hear the music and
identify the song but they were saying
it does it all on device and they
emphasize they said the P word privacy
and I would he had gone more into that
because I'm one because that's always
been the concern with the Google stuff
is hey they have everything about me
they have my pictures they have now a
camera that's filming me constantly they
have my phone and now that that pixel
book and then you combine that with all
the nest products it is they have a lot
of information about you there and and
our good friends at Apple always tout it
the other way where all that stuff left
on defy seeing the way that's encrypted
and stuff but that's something I would
have liked it here
we'll talk a bit more about especially
since we're getting a lot of video and
photos of our faces their loved ones
well you know that and look at what
their google lens platform can already
do and you know that it's weird because
with google right you you choose to buy
into their system know almost knowing
that they know more about me than almost
any other company yeah like am I gonna
be like hold up and take a picture of
you that have like your LinkedIn account
pop up and like your baggage your
criminal record yeah like I already do
but still that's like I think that's
that's insane cuz we are entering
Minority Report and a bit like that
future that's exciting when you saw it
on the the Buddhist temple that was
really that was really quick then you're
sitting there like man and my goodness
be a hold up like a picture of this
house and be like you don't want to live
here there was a murder here it's like
okay
I will I will I will confess I do have a
jaywalking violation but it was actually
for riding my bicycle on the freeway to
go to the comic book store when I was in
eighth grade to retrieve my comics they
didn't have an actual violation for us
so they gave us a jaywalking one I live
to see the next day my parents are
really mad that I did that but I did it
I'm Tom a rebel yo I'm a rebel Google
has a long rap sheet on you Abed yeah
yeah so you know I it's to your point
about the privacy thing I don't know how
much they typically they like just drop
two sentences in the keynote about like
this is private or this is only on when
blank blank blank and then they just
kind of leave it at that
and that's like they said that there was
an indicator light so you know it's on
but I mean people can hack that I'm sure
turn that indicator light off so Kevin
what phone are you on right now so dude
we're gonna agree oh you're gonna go tan
tan tan yeah we'll see we'll see who
wins out that pre-order pre-order
contest like I think it's gonna be a
beast mode Anthony Appiah season I don't
get my own to be sick
well then Anthony can take over then
Anthony can call in and you can be in
the background
exactly well the question is what color
are you getting I'm gonna get the space
whatever variation of black they charted
whatever the black color is whatever
that whatever fun name they put on it so
all right hey boys I just want to say
thanks for calling we appreciate it all
right thank you
all right cool take it easy we'll talk
to you guys soon I think let's just wrap
things up here because we've got we've
got actual work other work to do and so
we appreciate everyone that came to hang
out with us I'm sorry we couldn't get
out all the phone lines but you guys and
gals are awesome for hanging with us so
remember you can stick with us on
cnet.com we will have other follow-ups
first looks in-depth reviews write-ups
opinion pieces you name it we got it
so he owes yes patrick thanks for
hanging buddy mr. Beecham running the
show like a champ with all eight arms
yeah that's gonna do it for this show oh
who knows there might be another Apple
event by the end of the year there might
and they haven't actually dropped the
home Bob but they should be shaking in
their boots after they saw that Google
home max they they just it's just the
way it is so all right we'll see you
