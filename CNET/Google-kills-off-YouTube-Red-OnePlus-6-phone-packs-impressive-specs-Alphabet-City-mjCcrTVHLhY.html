city this is the show that covers all
things Google Android way Moe and
anything else alphabet touches and a
flick that touches lots of things since
it owns Google I'm your guide Aya's
Akhtar today's stories include my field
trip to Google i/o their new oneplus
phone and what on earth is going on with
you to read first stop YouTube Union
YouTube red is dead
replacing it will be some confusion but
that's why you and I are gonna sort this
out bring up the chart from Google there
are two services rising from the ashes
of red one is YouTube premium which
gives you ad free videos originals and
the ability to download media that will
cost $11 and 99 cents per month which is
2 bucks more than read if you are
already a YouTube red member you get
YouTube premium at the old $9.99 price
then there's a new version of YouTube
music which is refocused on music
because when you think of YouTube you
think audio there's a free ad-supported
tier and a paid version that cost around
$10 per month if you pay for YouTube's
premium you get the ad free version of
YouTube music as well YouTube music also
gets a redesigned mobile app and a
desktop player next stop music Memorial
Drive
Google's new music scheme will lead to
the end of Google Play Music in a
briefing with CNET's Joan salesman
Google says it will work on closing the
gaps between Google Play Music and
YouTube music and then Google will place
a pillow over the face of play music
while quietly saying next up Android
Avenue you can't turn around on Android
Avenue without someone trying to sell
you a new phone say hello to the 1 plus
6 in my head it's really called the 7
because math if you've never heard of
one plus you're lying I've mentioned it
twice already let's look at the 1 plus
11 minus 5 and it has a 6 point 2 8 inch
screen with a knot on the top if you can
get past that inside is the
top-of-the-line Snapdragon 845 processor
the main camera on the rear has optical
image stabilization the big hook of
oneplus phones is high-end specs with an
affordable price tag the 1 minus 6 times
negative one starts at 500 $30 for the
64 gigabyte model for comparison the
galaxy s 9 starts at seven hundred and
twenty dollars one downside of the 14/2
is that it's splash proof but not fully
water resistant if you want to run
Android P beta on the three and a half
times two you can check out the full
review of the one plus six over at CNET
last stop Mountain View I got to check
out Google i/o this year for the first
time here's what happened
would you mind going on the seesaw with
me you got to think about this you can't
keep telling me that you don't have a
drinking problem you know why do they
call it artificial intelligence anyway I
mean it's not really hard official just
because you aren't real are you real
three of the Rx I need at least one Oreo
