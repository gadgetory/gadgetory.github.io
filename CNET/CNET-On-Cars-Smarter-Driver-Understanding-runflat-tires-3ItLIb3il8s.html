they can be driven under inflated or
uninflated at up to freeway speeds 55
miles an hour or so is recommended up to
200 miles in some cases depending on the
tire how they do that's interesting
here's a conventional tire and if I get
on the sidewalls here I can deflect them
you I'll be done this with an old tire
laying around even on a swing when you
were a kid come over here to a run flat
though try and deflect that sidewall
you'll break your thumb trying to do it
extremely strong sidewall structure this
way as well as laterally this thing has
sidewalls of Steel quite literally and
can support the weight of the car
without any air inside helping out
that's what makes it work Road side when
you get a flat with a run flat tire you
won't be out there on the side of the
road trying to change a wheel which you
may have never done before the side of
the highway is no place to learn a new
mechanical skill blow outs run flats are
pretty much immune to sudden pressure
loss even without air they pretty much
maintain their shape
in fact the first indication anything is
wrong may come from the tire pressure
alert on the dash not the feel of the
steering wheels
space and wait run-flats allow car
makers to use the space formerly taken
by the spare for something better like
the battery in the case of this BMW and
loses the weight of that spare wheel
tire and jack
now the cons run flat tires tend to cost
more and way more to things you don't
want an entire first of all the cost
easily twenty twenty five percent more
than a conventional tire about the same
size I'm ballparking there but that's
not unusual that's a big price
difference
secondly the weight you can't feel this
but if I pick up this run flat it's
really dense this similar tire that is
conventional and about the same size is
actually dramatically lighter and that
will change the dynamics of how your
vehicle handles and rides less weight is
always better in any part of your wheels
brakes tires or suspension arms harder
to find you may not find a run flat in
your size sitting on the Shelf when you
need one so while the run flat may get
you to the nearest service station
easily you might spend a long time
waiting there the scenic car tech team
has reservations about being stuck with
the limited tire selection when you have
run flats Hondas and Acuras that came
with michelin packs run flats for
example can only use those tires unless
you do a complete change that could
include wheels tires and tire pressure
sensors and a recent JD Power survey
found that owners of performance
oriented cars with run flats are only
half as likely to recommend their tire
brand to someone else the weight and
feel tend to deaden the cars handling
Honda was an early user of run flat
tires but they used a different system
than this something called the michelin
packs technology it was a hard plastic
shell that lived inside the tire and
supported it same basic idea but they
bailed out in 2009 don't put those on
cars anymore
that leaves BMW mini and some Corvettes
as the main users today of the stiff
sidewall technology like I've showed you
that actually is not enough to make an
industry-wide revolution what did
replace the run flatter keep it from
really gain to fruition we're better
technologies for traditional spares
which we've covered actually to go look
at
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
