Indiana taking a look at the new crupp's
ei 9,000 fully automatic espresso
machine this compact get it does quite a
bit for its compact size it actually
will take beans grind them turn them
into espresso as well as make espresso
drinks by foaming milk automatically you
don't have to touch anything except for
a few buttons on top of the Krupps 9000
is its bean hopper which holds close to
eight and a half ounces of whole beans
it has a burr grinder in there that will
adjust the grind size depending on the
type of drink that you select over here
is the LCD screen that enables you to
select what drinks you want will that be
a milk based drink or a espresso drink
that's purely dark coffee you should be
able to make about 17 different drinks
from this machine with just pressing one
or two keys
another really wild feature about this
machine is that it has a steaming one
which is motorized it actually comes up
and out and down into your cup processor
milk and then it goes back in and cleans
itself so you don't even have to touch
it in addition to convenience crupp's
claims right here that this machine
delivers restaurant caliber drinks
that's why we came to Quill's coffee
which won the America's best coffee
house in 2015 in Chicago so we wanted to
do some blind taste test with this
machine and run it past some of the
really highly trained baristas here at
Quill's coffee to see what they think
this first one's got a very full body
it's very very rich Wow I these are
actually both very similar shots of
espresso the second one was sweeter and
so I would guess this came off of our
machine so this is this was off the
crips Wow I mean $2,500 is a lot of
money obviously but to get this kind of
espresso just by pressing the button
that's very impressive as far as a super
automated machine where you're making
the espresso at a press of a button
that's definitely the best super
automatic shot of espresso I've ever had
before so what have we learned today it
cools coffee well for one thing the
corrupts ea 9000 definitely makes shots
that are pretty damn good they're good
enough to please some of the very
discerning baristas here at quills so if
you want to duplicate the barista style
experience at home and have no qualms
about dropping $2,500 then this machine
is right up your alley so we want to say
thank you to Michael and everyone here
at quills for letting us do these tests
