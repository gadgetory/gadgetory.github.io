watching an educational show called the
Apple buy for all the good and bad
inside the world of Apple lots of news
plus we'll announce our design by humans
giveaway winners now there's still no
news right now for any upcoming spring
Apple event but we know the next-gen
iPads are coming and check out these two
new clean pictures from nowhere else FR
that show off what's believed to be the
front bezel
of the ipad 5 that takes design cues
with the thinner side bezels of the iPad
Mini so why do we think it's the
full-size iPad because if it isn't that
person has child sized hands now we're
still expecting the same a 6 X processor
in the next gen iPad 5 right now but
development for the next a7 chip looks
to be different after a priya x report
this is the new chip will debut in the
first half of 2014
development is currently underway and
Samsung is said to not be a part of that
process at all and instead Apple has
gone with Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Company production of
Apple's custom chips have been handled
entirely by Samsung in the past rumors
continue to point to Apple shifting away
from Samsung even though the current
models still have chips from Samsung
inside now we've got iPhone news and
rumors for you
Japanese blog Mac o Takara says
according to their trusted source
the iPhone 5s will hit store shelves in
three colorways adding one more color on
top of the standard black and white so
what color do you think they're going to
go with I'm guessing razzmatazz that's
right it's not only my favorite drink at
Jamba Juice it's an actual red pink
color invented by Crayola in 1993 and
similar to ROS ok keep watching the show
because you'll learn something here
every week and topeka capital markets is
really trying to make sure no one takes
them seriously after their latest
prediction that Apple will offer the new
iPhone in at least two and possibly
three screen sizes no way we'll see
three and this is the same group that
predicted that I ring last week all
right seeing its own sister site ZDNet
and Mary Jo fully revealed Microsoft's
roadmap from their trusted source for
both the Mac and iOS versions of office
recently get ready to wait a little
longer the new version of Office for the
Mac will arrive in April of 2014 while
the rumored office for iOS and Android
will arrive next autumn in October 2014
now Foley's contact says this roadmap
was accurate up to the start of 2013 and
Microsoft officials have declined to
comment we also know iOS already has
Twitter and Facebook integrated into the
system but the Wall Street Journal
claims Yahoo's is looking to expand
their partnership now we know iOS
already pulls Yahoo data for their
finance weather and sports results but
according to the story data from Yahoo
News and other web properties could be
pre-loaded onto iOS for better Siri
functionality it's also a sign that
Apple could possibly be looking to move
away even further from Google
integration in iOS and yeah we saw how
well that worked out for them with maps
all right let's take a break with our
App of the week brought to you by a
special guest of mine
hey guys Jamie here and are you a fan of
Temple Run subway surf mega run or
better yet running games then pug run is
the game for you the game starts out in
black and white and Bogart the Pug is
determined to come to life to return
back to his owners arms if you don't run
fast enough your world starts closing in
you swipe to jump slide or tap for turbo
mode and watch out for those darn cats
and bushes pick up pencils to get a coin
magnet and a red balloon to fly
collecting coins also lets you purchase
items at the pet shop like a revive - a
rocket ship that gives you a head start
Oh sick
you can't deny the cute graphics and
music it's 99 cents at the app store so
check it out and have fun with bug run
like me alright thanks for that Jamie
and I can tell that that's a great game
for kids and adults all right to the
quick fights we've talked about Apple's
new campus and it's a futuristic
spaceship design Bloomberg recently
reported that Apple's new campus project
has ballooned from less than three
billion dollars to nearly 5 billion now
that's even more than the 3.9 billion
new World Trade Center complex now lead
architect Foster and partners are trying
to cut 1 billion dollars from the budget
before moving forward and a new report
from marketing magazine says Apple is
also working with the company on new
projects like revamping its retail
stores the rumor is that Tim Cook would
be able to teleport the stores his
liking from the mothership and let's
also show you a fun little quick tip
that's for all you fellas out there and
will impress the ladies now if you use
the Google Maps on iOS and if you're
like me you might hate pinching and
zooming I hate pinching and zooming so
do this instead DoubleTap on your Google
Maps app with a single finger but keep
your finger there and now you can slide
your big old digit up and down with one
finger to zoom in and out of the map
leaving you one free finger so you go up
and this baricza finger here Oh Brian
that is so cool I know it is Madison see
I told you it would impress the ladies
so try it out and let me know how it
works out for you guys all right okay
