day Samsung doesn't think so this is the
Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 edition it has the
same name as last year's Galaxy Note
10.1 but there's a lot that's different
about this tablet for starters take a
look at the design this tablet measures
just 7.9 millimeters and it weighs 535
grams that's down from 600 grams it
definitely feels a lot lighter than the
last model and as well the bezels have
become smaller so even though the screen
is the same size the overall tablet is
smaller and that makes it more portable
spin it around on the back and you'll
see Samsung has ditched the glossy
plastic look in favour of this leather
effect stitching that's the same effect
that you'll get on the new Galaxy Note 3
as well it's not all design changes
though most of the hardware has been
revamped the screen now has a 25 60 x
1600 pixel resolution that's a very high
resolution and indeed on screen icons
and pictures it's all looking very very
sharp the camera has been beefed up as
well on the back this is an 8 megapixel
affair spin around on the front this is
a 2 megapixel front facing camera for
things like video calls the battery is
bigger and you get 3 gigabytes of RAM
this also has Samsung's own brand
eight-core processor which should make
for very fast performance though it's
possible that you'll get a different
processor depending on which country you
live in it's got android 4.3 jelly bean
on board that's a recent version which
is good and it feels very very smooth to
swipe around it really is quite a fun
tablet to use and I'm impressed as well
with how bright the screen is this
tablets going to come in lots of
different versions there'll be a Wi-Fi
3G and LTE variants as well as 16 32 and
64 gigabytes of storage options that
means you should be able to choose the
perfect note 10.1 for you but of course
the fancy of the technology and the more
storage the more you're going to be
paying although it's called the 2014
model this new note is actually coming
out later this year what do you think
