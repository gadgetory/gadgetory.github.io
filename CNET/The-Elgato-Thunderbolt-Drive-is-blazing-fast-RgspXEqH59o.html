new runnable purple drive from el gato
the well thunderball drive plus let me
go straight to the point here this is
the fastest purple drive on the market
period in my testing with Thunderbolt it
offered the sustained will will copy
speed up some 280 megabytes per second
for writing and almost a 310 megabyte
per second for reading by far the
fastest i've seen among drive of the
same type let me show you i have here a
folder of some 56 gigabyte of data and
it texted a few minutes to transfer it
over to the dry note that you have this
kind of performance only if you have a
newer mac such as the new mac pro or
this macbook pro with retina display
right here with odor thunderball max you
can see slightly slow performance though
still very fast now this is the second
purple drive home el gato ever known and
the only difference in Toyotas I is the
newly added support for USB 3.0 the
drive also work with EP 2 point 0 but
you should only use it with computer
that support you speed 3.0 and that's
because in my testing you're also the
fastest you speed through triangle
storage device I've seen it offers some
240 megabyte per second for writing and
some too and 90 megabyte per second for
reading almost triple the speed of other
you speed through playing on purple
drive over all the new al gato drive
here offers performance you usually see
in high-end great storage systems not
from a simple purple drive just to put
things in perspective I was shocked by
how fast it was and I have almost never
been shocked before now that is shocking
the new el gato is buzz power meaning
you just need one cable for both data
and power connections it comes included
with one-third of all cable and one USB
3.0 cable obviously you only use one of
these cables at a time out of the box is
pre formatted for macs but it can easily
reformat it from windows or into expat
for both platforms it doesn't include
any software at all now the price is not
cheap costing some 480 dollars for 256
gigabyte or some nine hundred dollars
for 512 gigabyte but in this case
you truly get what you pay for really
from on the drive check out my phones
with us at calm but basically if you're
looking for something portable and super
fast and you have a computer that
supports either Thunderball or USB 3.0
this is the prime example of money well
spent even almost as well spend at the
time you used to watch this video that's
because I'm don't know and this has been
the first look at the Thunder bone-dry
plus home el gato</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
