CNET's show about what is just around
the corner and beyond I'm your host Eric
Mack and I'm joined in the studio's
there in beautiful San Francisco at cnet
by Jeff Sparkman the man dealing to a
poker table full of ghosts and Stephen
beach him behind the controls there's
Cameron that one and so we're here today
to talk about the year that was the year
that's almost over oh he's 16 you know
recently there's been a lot of ink and
pixels declaring 2016 the year of
humanity's discontent and it's tough to
deny in the realm of geopolitics at
least when we're talking about pre awful
conflicts and places like Syria acts of
terrorism worldwide the discontented
casting votes for brexit and Donald
Trump and others feeling high anxiety
over their victories but look the world
went on and so did some important work
in the areas of science and innovation
in fact if you sweep the ugly parts of
2016 under the rug and then check the
place out I swear it's not too shabby
what really makes 2016 in my view is the
view it overlooks the future which
believe it or not is much more bright
and exciting than it appeared 12 months
ago not everyone there the table
believes agrees with me but today we're
going to talk about some of the events
of 2016 they will have a lasting and
positive impact 5 10 even a hundred
years into the future we'll also discuss
a few other things that we're looking
forward to in 2017 and in fact let's
start right now with the one thing in
2016 that we're actually still looking
forward to which is rogue one a Star
Wars story but first let's say hey to
the guys it's a ship of fools here with
the men behind the controls how's it
going to Stephen Jeff good good hola
yeah we uh we actually had our to our to
regular co-hosts are sick today so
we hope you feel better Kelsey Ambani
this a bummer that you're not here it
isn't that what up the years and they're
just saving up energy for for rogue one
tonight and sorrow pretty sure that and
we also want to say hey to everyone else
who's watching on a live stream or
YouTube we've got the chat rooms open
it's a live stream / Cena / far-sighted
and if you go to youtube / Cena you can
find the farsighted link there if you
want to get into the chat rooms also a
tweet at me at Eric CMAC ericc ma ck
I'll be monitoring that if you got any
questions or comments and we'll try to
get that in but so first let's start
with a rogue one a few people at cnet
have already seen it premieres tonight
but our own rich trenholm over in London
has actually already submitted his
review do we have that to start the
discussion I'm gonna roll it right now a
long time ago in a galaxy far far away
there was a movie called Star Wars
what we didn't know until now is that
around the back of Star Wars chest out
of sight another movie was playing out
that movie was robe one rebels on you
shake the tree
row 1 the first Star Wars spin-off takes
us through a host of new worlds and
introduces us to a bunch of new faces
but it's intertwined with the saga we
know as these previously unknown minor
characters and bit part players do their
bit against the evil empire stealing
your plans to the dreaded Death Star and
we all know how that turned out the
ragtag band of new characters led by
plucky Felicity Jones includes the
hilarious alan tudyk as straight-talking
droid k2s oh and affecting donnie yen as
a warrior monk with a touch of the jedi
about him together they take on Ben
Mendelssohn's ambitious Imperial
bureaucrat in a gritty dust Street tale
that loudly takes place at street level
somewhere around the corner from the
original movies as rogue one rubs up
against their new hope we do meet a few
old faces some of which work better than
others but it's pretty liberating to
watch a blockbuster in which you know
there's no sequels or franchises or
civil wars to come and so you genuinely
don't know which characters are going to
make it but I despite knowing roughly
how it's all going to turn out that are
a lot of thrills to be had director
Gareth Edwards dives into the classic
Star Wars toy box for I puffing pulse
pounding action that dials the plastic
series up to 11 the climax is
electrifying proving you don't need
Skywalker's to tell a spectacular Star
Wars story facing the dark side at
street level rogue one is a force to be
reckoned with
cool all right so there you have it so i
know i'm planning on going tomorrow
night with my family for the first
showing here in New Mexico what do you
guys have planned you're going to go see
it you're excited what's the vibe I'm
definitely going to go see it but
probably not this weekend is this plugin
I'm just going to be too busy but I'm
going to try to see in la actually when
I'm down there next week so I'm excited
but you know what a lot of people are
doing is that they're rewatching a new
hope before they go see rug one because
there's a lot of information in a new
hope that's that comes out in rogue one
so they're kind of like prep you know
they're like just getting a refresher on
the night of hope on the first under
well it's a third episode 3 right so I
would recommend if you're going to watch
rogue one this weekend maybe try
watching a new hope and hopefully you
get an original version not one that
Luke is messed with right what about you
gee I figured it you're gonna go see it
a little to the east there uh yeah I'm
gonna go see it tonight uh at ten are
you excited don't I look excited yeah it
is kind of this weird thing like you
know a couple friends last night we're
like well you know now that um the
Disney's bought the franchise it's like
we're gonna get hammered you know every
year or even more often with like these
new these new movies these new parts of
the franchise and it's like the question
if is that gonna dilute it and you know
degrade the quality or is it awesome and
i gotta say so far I think it's been
pretty awesome episode 7 I was pretty
impressed with and I'm I'm hearing so
far you know really positive reviews of
this one yeah same here I don't think
it's the degraded because since the
first Star Wars came out there's just
been books and TV shows and all signs
it's not like they kept this quiet at
any point yeah yeah totally so I don't I
don't see how you know having more Star
Wars movies gonna be a negative effect
on the franchise I think it's actually
I'm pretty shocked that they got this
one out this soon yeah because the other
one just came out it was this year right
the force awakens moves last year that
was around the end of last year I see
okay okay for some reason that was like
still fresh to me like it happened this
year
but out the new Christmas tradition yeah
yeah yeah Star Wars movie every peasant
worry so so yeah I mean I don't think
it's gonna hurt I think it's just gonna
help people love to write about it and
talk about it so we're here talking
about it yeah I mean I've tried to avoid
I mean other than seeing you know a
trailer here and there I've tried not to
really learn too much about it same here
just so I can go in I don't I like I
don't care about spoilers and stuff like
that all that much um I just figured you
know let's see how much of the movie I
can actually see in the theater rather
than beforehand just you know to see if
I can do it and and I'm hoping that when
force awakens came out there was a meme
or wasn't a mean but it was like a mean
message going around YouTube and other
places which give away the plot I got
that on Twitter last year I got it
unlike a youtube comment yeah and I was
trying to avoid it so thoroughly and I
saw that and he's like stuck in my head
and then when the movie was unfolding I
was like oh that that hole was right Yes
No yeah so let's just hope nothing like
that happens for this film well now i'm
waiting for like countdown to somebody
doing it in the champ I know it'll look
at the chat olga's anything I wouldn't
blame people I like what rich had to say
to about you know it'll be an
interesting experience in this this is
kind of like a side story you know we
don't have the entire like linear
episodes one through seven to where you
gotta kind of okay well now we know
what's going on here it actually is like
almost like a fresh look at the star
wars universe so it'll be interesting to
be able to come at this the entire
universe kind of with fresh eyes instead
of trying to figure out like you know
okay well where does that fit into the
whole thing because I you know Game of
Thrones in the walking dead have melted
my brain enough trying to keep track of
but yeah characters and other things
totally nice to just be introduced
toward a whole new set of characters
that don't necessarily have to worry how
much how they fit into everything even
though there's a little of that yeah
yeah and also um this one's more like I
hear it's a little darker which is cool
you know it's like more war mm-hmm it's
a little heavier I guess compared to the
other ones so I'm kind of looking
forward to that like a grittier one and
or droid carrying information who knows
we don't know right let's review the
theme there is a woman a powerful woman
which is the Star Wars theme so that's
cool you about alan tudyk is one of the
droids right so that's cool as well yeah
yeah totally but you know it but what we
really need after 2016 is something a
little darker right Jeff yeah cuz you
know we haven't had enough darkness yeah
so so for everyone who doesn't know I
mean you've probably seen there's been
tons of stuff around the internet over
the last few weeks don't know what
triggered it but that about how 2016
hasn't been maybe the the best year in
recent memory and Jeff and I have been
going back and forth a little bit on you
know our feelings about 2016 and I
certainly understand you know the
cinnamon about how maybe it hasn't been
the best but you know I'm determined to
see this glass glass half full and maybe
convinced Jeff and another I'm not
really sure where you stand Stephen that
it's that it's better than it then it
appears and so to kick that off we're
going to talk about some of the good
parts of 2016 for the rest of the show
and some stuff we're looking forward to
in 2017 I if you want to talk about some
of the worst parts you might find
something on the internet about that
elsewhere but let's start with uh with
this this video that I've got there
Stephen and this is a I'll set it up
real quick this is just some audio of a
conversation that I had a couple weeks
ago with John Sculley who's the former
CEO of apple and a pepsi before that and
he's the guy who was ahead of Apple like
in between the two Steve Jobs ringing
yeah he's jeff daniels in the movie so
in in like in this millennium he's
basically bit doing like a bunch of
investing into startups that are working
on building a better future in a lot of
ways in particularly in the healthcare
field so we had a long talk recently and
here's just one thing he had to say
about where he thinks the future is
going to take us pretty soon
least in terms of health care I was
talking to good friend of mine Jeffrey
lane from DARPA and I said so kids who
were born today now what can they
reasonably expect their lifespan will be
he said reasonably 125 years and then
these are kids who are already born and
so by 2050 you know they're going to be
in there they're going to be just early
middle aged know and they may be you
know 50 55 years old maybe we won't even
call that middle-aged then who knows and
I think that the good news is that the
possibility of regenerating organs being
able to find ways in which blind people
can see deaf people from here now all of
those types of problems are going to be
increasingly solvable so okay one of the
things that's John's go again one of the
things i want to point out is within
weeks of he and i having that
conversation a group of scientist at the
Salk Institute that using the techniques
techniques he's referring to they
actually did they were able to edit
genes to make a blind animals see again
wow this is this is stuff that's
happening right now and you know that
the thing he said about this generation
of kids being able to comfortably expect
to live 125 I mean I'm kind of a techno
optimist but that seems really
optimistic to me but all three of us
here were all fathers we all have kids
and he's talking about our kids and so
this is stuff that has really kind of
began to come into its own gain some
momentum in the last year so it's okay
it's okay Jeff see i'll give it to you
yeah sure okay i'm doing do we want to
live to be a hundred twenty-five that's
a question that yeah I mean I feel like
I'd actually yeah that was a those
another part of our conversation is so
you know he went he went on to say and a
lot of what he's talking about is
using gene editing techniques and which
called what's called precision medicine
which is basically kind of combining big
data and and health right and using kind
of algorithmic techniques that run a lot
of our life now to get a better sense of
you know how our genes work and there's
something called crisper cast 9 which is
the weird scientific name for it but
it's basically an enzyme that can be
used to edit genes and that's what they
used to be able to make the blind
animals see again and so those are the
kind of techniques he's talking about
these are technologies that are really
coming into their own right now and
using that you know he was saying he
expected cancer to be salt solved in 10
to 15 years and then once cancer falls
that frees up a whole bunch of resources
money resources sign scientists
researchers to then attack other
diseases like Alzheimer's dementia
Parkinson's and that he saw these
maladies just starting to fall like
dominoes and that's where you have kids
today then being able to live much
longer to basically the lifespan of the
human body which like a lot of people
think the body could live to like 125
and then it just like that's really kind
of the edge of it and so but a big part
of the conversations okay well what do
we do with all these people who are
around living for everything yeah in
terms of like that's a lot of people to
manage and kind of a burden on the
society so that's actually something
he's working on I've got a profile of
John Sculley that's coming out in the
next week or two or we'll get into that
a lot more but that's just you know
these genetic techniques and what they
can mean for health and for curing
disease and for having a higher quality
of life health wise you know that's just
one of the things that really began to
move forward in in 2016 something else
that you know we've covered a lot on
Cena is how much further we're going out
into space but and that by suppose
before we get into that we should answer
your question which is do we want to
live completely dogma 125 or not and I
don't know yeah I
I don't think I want to be that old
because I'm gonna be frail and won't be
able to do anything for myself and it's
just gonna be uncomfortable so there's
only so many books to read only you know
so many shows to binge watch I mean
unless like we all have like robotic you
know Bionic bodies that can carry us
around and do maybe like if my brain is
still active like in a jar like that
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles character
you know maybe but it just doesn't seem
like you have much quality of life if
you're 125 years old you know and I'm
saying that as somebody you know at my
age and horribly out of shape so there
is that I mean just like the thing that
I was actually curious about with the
the how they restored vision in mice I'm
wondering if you were to restore vision
to somebody who had not like ever seen
before how does the brain know how to
interpret the information that is now
coming like would they that's true like
you're restoring the vision but is is
there like a way for that to be
processed so they can really see or is
it just going to be kind of just data
that's going into the brain it's a good
question right I mean I mean that
becomes another question perhaps for
technology to solve any and I mean you
know like a lot of a lot of the people
like um you know around Silicon Valley
like everything's kind of an engineering
problem right and and so you know there
must be a way to use technology to you
know like if you have somebody who like
they've had their vision restore but for
the first time and it's like kind of
freaking out some of their the
capabilities of their brain will
probably there's a way to like put some
sort of like a limiter or a transmitter
into the brain that can then interpret
that in a way that is safe and and keeps
them sane so i guess it really comes
down to you know do you have the faith
in technology to actually solve all
these things or is that like a bridge
too far yeah it's yeah it's it's really
it's it's really interesting to think
about like all the problems that would
need to be solved it's not just the one
big problem there's all these ancillary
problems that you'd have to account for
as well yeah is it going to its grill
affect my bart ride home because right
now i can barely get on the part and
like no boy standing all i had to stand
like 45 minutes the other day all for
like an hour ride there's just too many
people on the planet right now if and
not enough infrastructure to everybody's
land longer that just means more jackass
is going to be in front of me on the
train exactly the problem exactly so
fortunately if the planet i think we'd
all agree or you're saying is is getting
pretty crowded but fortunately there's
people this year who made some pretty
big announcements in terms of moving
beyond this planet which you know i
think a lot of people see as the next
step and I know we're talking far out
here but I mean something else that
happened in 2016 several things happen
actually to make kind of the Star Trek
universe and even the star wars universe
although that's a lot more focused on
trade wars but the star trek universe I
mean honestly it suddenly seems a little
less far out after 2016 and I mean
nobody signing up for Starfleet just yet
but our understanding of the universe
actually expanded quite a bit in 2016
and for the we had probably the biggest
highest quality sorry about that what's
that sorry I just screwed up the body I
think keep going keep going okay yeah I
can't hear the audio from the the clips
there ok but yeah so we had you know we
discovered Proxima be this year which is
an exoplanet that's around Proxima
Centauri which is the closest star to
earth so this is literally like the
closest planet beyond our solar system
that could it could exist there's no
other stars closer than this one and on
top of everything there's a chance that
it could be habitable it is in the
habitable zone where liquid water should
be possible so I mean this happened over
the summer and there's already plans to
try to send some really tiny ships there
you know they would actually just be
like a postage shan't the postage
stamp-sized ship that would go like a
fifth the speed of light to take really
close up pictures of it see how
habitable it could really be so that
happened in 2016 and then also speaking
of getting
to a place where humans might actually
be able to get to in our lifetime
there's a guy you may have heard of his
name's Elon Musk who's really serious
about going to Mars dead serious he's
dead serious about it and you've
probably got some of the video of this
you know he wants to send a million
people to Mars by the end of this
century pretty pretty darn ambitious but
he came out in September with a detailed
plan for it how to get a million people
there we'll see if that moves forward
but it sure looks like there's going to
least be some humans landing on Mars
within the next 10 to 20 years for sure
so you know we're moving towards
reducing the overcrowding problem that
you guys are seeing and just one more
thing in terms of space travel and this
is probably the craziest thing of all
but in 2016 we also saw something called
the electromagnetic drive or the atom
drive and this is something that nASA
has been working on we've been hearing
about it for a couple years but it's
kind of been this thing you hear on like
spaceflight forums and it was like kind
of a sketchy story for a while yeah well
this year in 2016 the M drive past peer
review and is headed towards actually
being tested in space and just to give
you some context of what the M drive is
a lot of people think it could lay the
foundation so in other words a first
baby step towards a warp drive like the
actual warp drive from Star Trek so and
again this thing maybe they'll test it
and it won't pass the test and it could
still be a fantasy because it basically
technically defies the laws of physics
like an impossible drive yeah yeah but
hey so a lot either way whether it pans
out or not a lot of progress made
towards getting past or solving our
little overpopulation problem so so so
promising stuff there so if we do live
to 125 you know then maybe we'll
actually have a place to go by then yeah
that's you guys be signing up to go to
Mars at age 10 one you know I would I
mean if they if they prove that it's
there's a safe way to get there I'm
going to survive and I could get there
and come back I don't want to stay there
but if they can prove prove and show
that there's a safe way to get there I
will I would love I want to just take
one of those Jeff Bezos Blue Origin
ships just go to the edge of space and
come back I mean why not like that be a
blast you know other piggybacking off
your space talk we also had this first
SpaceX rocket land itself in the ocean
on the eye on the water drone which I
have a cool video of and also there's a
company called arcs packs who builds
those hoverboards their actual like
electromagnetic hoverboards not like the
cheesy ones that you see with the kids
riding on with the wheels but they have
been working with NASA to build a
tractor beam so that's another thing
that they press release this year that
we didn't really discuss a whole lot but
they've working with NASA to build a
tractor beam that would that would
literally send a signal to like a
satellite or some some object in space
and and grab it and be able to pull it
in or push things out that's another
thing to look at arcs packs they are
there in what do you call it oh here's
the here's actually a headline I believe
they're in their ribs ya los gatos oh
whoa Scott it's okay yeah so they are
working on a tractor beam so I mean all
these things that we see in you know in
sci-fi movies are actually happening
because yeah I mean art dictates life
you know like an artist comes up with an
idea let's make this tractor beam let's
make space time travel well scientists
see that stuff when they say let's try
to make that for real then and 2016
seems like the year that a lot of these
scientists came up with actual concepts
that can do these sort of things you
know so it's 2016 was pretty awesome for
space travel well and I'm glad you
pointed out what blue origin and SpaceX
are doing because you know we hear we've
been hearing about like this kind of
like futuristic stuff i mean frankly
since before we were born right like the
Jetsons have been around for decades and
decades and you're always talking about
it's really futuristic stuff and it
never quite seems to come to pass
because frankly we can't get our own
stuff together on the planet Earth yeah
but but that but SpaceX and blue
really interesting because what you have
there is those are people between musk
and visas that are actually now building
a business model for going to space so
like when you see people who are
actually managing to make this stuff
practical and profitable then it's like
okay this isn't just you know a pipe
dream in a research lab somewhere this
is the people are building a business
off of this and this is actually moving
forward so that's you know just landing
a rocket I know it's really cool I mean
I've just watch this footage I mean it's
like it's incredible just to watch this
thing the little arms come down I mean
they tried this how many times did they
try this before they nailed it like the
fourth or fifth time they got it yeah it
was it was quite a few times we watched
these things explode and then finally in
April they did it motions were awesome
too and the gym yeah and then Jeff Bezos
I remember like ridiculed them like oh
welcome to the club you finally landed a
spaceship right now look I love the
millionaire space rocket trolling yeah
it's a good part of 21st century life
from his cave layer you know like I real
on musk even joked about building his
own secret lair and some volcano
somewhere you know after he landed the
SpaceX ship so I mean this is real this
is real life stuff now and like it this
year all got glossed over a lot by you
know war and terrorism and Donald Trump
and all that stuff so so it's cool that
we're like re reliving all this all
these neat things that happen you know
yeah we're making space great again yes
well what do you think Sparkman you
headed to Mars anytime soon you're gonna
sign up for that one oh sure I mean you
know as long as I've got you know a
spare weekend or two yeah I've always
wanted to like experience weightlessness
just like for like a long period of time
you no longer than like the hill on a
roller coaster um those parabolic
airplanes yeah I mean it just it it's
always intrigued me I'm wondering like
who is would that feel weird being
weightless the entire time you're going
there you know yeah yeah because I
remember there was like an old
uh like were a wonderful world of Disney
thing before we had actually like gone
to space talking about the effects of
you know weightlessness and they refer
to it as like your stomach is like
bracing for an impact that never
actually comes cuz you feel like you're
falling and that always intrigued me and
I'm like I'd kind of make it hard to
concentrate on doing a lot of things
just kind of like being all floaty and
stuff yeah which is the scientific term
for it floating you know and we should
be realistic I mean there's a lot of
stuff to figure out and a lot of
challenges to solve before anyone's
actually gonna live on Mars I mean you
know the radiation dose you get from
there is is insane now there's a lot of
people been working in NASA for a long
time to think Elon Musk is just totally
crazy and that he really can't pull it
off because there's these huge
challenges to solve and that's to say
nothing of the fact that like if you had
a kid on Mars because the gravity is
different there if you had a kid on Mars
never raised on Mars like they could
never come to visit the grandparents on
earth oh yeah because like their spine
would be crushed by the gravity here so
you know there's these challenges to
figure out but you know like our
ancestors came to the US against like
ridiculous odds have lived in like
horrible conditions and I'm even today
immigrants you know you know spend time
like walking across the desert so I mean
you know there's there's there's a no
challenges to be figured out but there's
always seems to be the drive to to move
somewhere because it's just getting too
damn crowded on well yeah I mean there's
a lot of other things that we haven't
taken into account like spreading
disease like we can easily spread
disease to Mars and vice versa that's
more of the world that's like the basic
that's how that that movie ended you
know so there's so many so many things
to think about and it's not going to
happen overnight but if I Elon Musk is
in charge is going to happen pretty soon
it won't be boring if he's in charge ya
know to say nothing else yeah um you
know in speaking of other companies that
are actually kind of trying to make a
business out of the future I swear guys
I think the plank
bars are finally coming in in 2016 you
know leave it to one of the unicorns to
finally bring us flying cars uber
revealed a plan this year for okay wait
for it for commuting so this will solve
your Barbara Barr problem as well for
commuting via self-flying ride-sharing
vertical takeoff and landing vehicles
that's a funny way of saying flying
ubers so they've got a plan where we
could possibly see this rolling out
frankly depending on the regulatory
hurdles we could see this rolling out in
in 10 years or so and these are
literally they're kind of like a cross
between a plane and a helicopter no they
take off like a helicopter and then they
can fly like a plane basically with the
vTOLs they're called and sober wants to
have basically ride-sharing flying ubers
that would take off from kind of points
around the city and then they could fly
out to the suburbs for your commute and
then eventually also making them
basically drones so they would have
pilots at first and then eventually be
basically ride-sharing drones that take
you around your commute that's how
antenna lying to me what's that that
sounds terrifying to me just said
terrible yeah it'll be less expensive
than owning a car I mean this is what
over is saying so I mean what do you
think we've been waiting for flying cars
made since the Jetsons it or even longer
maybe my great-grandmother was waiting
for a flying car to I don't know do you
think this is just bluster do you think
we could actually be flying around for
our commute in 10 years I don't think in
10 years I mean I let's put it this way
I would be surprised if that happened in
10 years I mean I'm all for it I mean
flying cars and public transit that does
not smell like this that would be great
I just don't see that happening in 10
years yeah 10 years seems pretty pretty
fast yes pretty fast but you know what
go for a little bit take away the flying
part because in 2016 we saw just regular
self-driving cars they want to fly
self-driving cars
where before 2015 we were really only
talking about self-driving cars as kind
of this crazy Google side project which
now they've they've outsourced there
they've spun that off but in the
meantime it seems like in 2016 like
everyone jumped on the self-driving car
bandwagon whether it was uber and uber
also I mean it got cars driving around
Pittsburgh right now there's there's
some right down the street some right
down that you know what yeah okay seen
it actually broke this I feel like see
that broke the story because we went to
our Christmas party last Thursday night
and we're walking the the venue where
our Christmas party was just a couple
blocks away we're all walking there we
walked by a big garage and inside this
garage was like 30 self-driving cars
like clearly all marked uber all shiny
polished beautiful and was like what is
going on there and then out front there
was like 20 30 like young guys all like
vaping and like smoking cigarettes and
we're like something is going on and we
started asking I'm like what is going on
here and they're like this is a secret
like uber garage you know and we happen
to be with Dara who writes all uber
stuff for cnet next morning they go
there they stake it out they took some
pictures we broke the story I think I
pretty sure seen that broke the store I
can't come from or deny that the DMV of
California says hey uber you can't do
this you know how permits Hoover's like
whatever we're going to do it then
California shuts them down this all
happened within the last since last
thursday or friday i think is one we
broke the story but yeah there's there
are self-driving cars driving around san
francisco right now and my I almost
wanted to bring my kids to San Francisco
just to take them on a ride like just
like almost like a Disneyland ride you
know like it's the be the first time I
ever written in the self-driving car I
was feeling like I wanted to bring my
kids to have that experience with me
they're like four and two years old you
know I know that's risky but at the same
time this 2016 there's cars driving
around the city by themselves so I think
we're on the right track but the flying
drones that is another that is a whole
other can of worms man I don't know
about that it's like adding it
extra dimension I mean you're you're
basically confined it like sorta I mean
you're obviously it's three dimensions
but mostly too you know yeah you're
going this way you're going that way
yeah with flying you're going up and
just just think about the traffic
control yeah you know the air traffic
control says can you keep people in a
lane yes you know like well if they're
over there autonomous that's one thing
but like if you get some you know person
yeah you're gonna have you're gonna have
a person in a Cessna who's not yeah just
getting a rolling it outside it's like
well screw this I don't want to wait
yeah maybe they you know a lot of Cessna
airplanes don't have all this
sophisticated technology that's going to
be tracking other aircraft like it's all
visual you know like this visual flying
and then there's a just flying using
just your instruments you know there's a
different VFR and ifr i think it is
called so you have to spot these things
and little tiny drones flying around
with people in them that just that seems
you can't even fly over the city
actually yeah in a regular airplane and
a Cessna you have to fly north of the
golden the left tower of the Golden Gate
Bridge oh don't even work in the city
like you this if it was something that
would have to be like almost like rural
areas you know like you can't have
drones flying and picking people up in a
major city it just doesn't seem like
it's going to be possible although
didn't Amazon's start delivering
packages in the UK this week yeah I saw
that and that looked it looked like a
big advertisement to me like oh we
delivered our first package sure they
did they probably did but they also like
produced it and had a camera follow it
and then interviewed the guy who made
the order and it was like all this like
big produced produced commercial and the
fur they actually announced that they're
going to do that three years ago so took
him three years to get to this point
where they're like delivering like I
think they delivered like a fire TV
stick which is a very small thing and
like some books or something but it just
all still seems like a big publicity
stunt to me at this point I don't think
it's like I don't know I just I still
skeptical when the drone drops off your
stuff are you supposed to tip it like
the pizza guy he'll know all this stuff
that we need to find out yeah you know
too I'm not tipping a drone
is the tip is not stealing the drone oh
yeah yes it's it uh-huh but you know I
think I think once again I think it's a
heel on musk and Tesla that's kind of
rolling this out in a way that makes
sense which is you know they actually
they sold our first and then they
basically just sent a software update
over the air that added some self
driving capabilities to the the Tesla
models and so that's kind of that's the
way the kind of makes sense to introduce
it like okay well we're gonna we're
going to add this like through baby
steps and so now your car has self
driving capabilities I mean basically
it's souped-up cruise control while on
the highway although those cars are like
fully self driving you can when you're
on private property you can summon them
and they like drive themselves from the
parking garage to pick you up at the
front door so you know that's probably
the way that this becomes part of the
society is like slowly being introduced
piece by piece and maybe those and maybe
those self-driving goobers to who knows
but there is one one other dimension of
transit that move forward this year and
that's and again it's another you on
musk joint he seems to be involved in a
lot of these and that's the Hyperloop
which you guys remember the Hyperloop
right it's kind of this crazy like a
supersonic monorail thing that you I
must kind of threw a white paper out on
as almost a throw ex he didn't have time
to do it like three years ago and then
suddenly this year they some different
startups started to move forward and I'm
actually tested the technology in Nevada
this year so that also that's another
possible solution to your Bart problem
Steven yes I mean it might still smell
like piss but at least we'll be moving
608 yeah which would at least be a good
reason for it to smell like piss because
you're going so fast you're a little
worried totally here's a pit here's of
video the Hyperloop actually and they
tested in Vegas this year right yeah
this is ubers of summer yeah yeah kind
of a proof of concept i think that that
track is i think only like a quarter
mile long or something but it just shows
how a would conceivably work he was
going traveling like 400 500 miles
hours that what it wasn't I don't I
don't remember I don't think I think it
only got up to a fraction of the speed
that it is designed to go because like I
said they only had like a quarter mile
and he was a half-mile I remember
exactly they didn't have the brakes yet
yeah I had to crash into some sand yeah
but yeah they're actually building a
real test track in Texas I believe oh
right and there's all these teams
getting together and they're
collaborating they're actually working
with the arcs packs people too who are
working on the hover board and the
tractor beam the arcs packs people are
showing off their technology for the
Hyperloop so it'll kind of like hover
through the tunnel and that's going to
be something we're going to see you next
year too so looking for the name
Hyperloop though does anybody else kind
of like imagine a roller coaster with
like a loop on the track or is it just
yeah yeah I mean I know it's not but
every time I hear and I'm like oh
there's no I always picture that movie
running man with Arnold Schwarzenegger
where he's like in that like a toboggan
thing I know like what's a ride a ride
at Disneyland the Matterhorn at her horn
yeah I was like riding that he's like
people are in it getting killed and
stuff you know that's what I always
envisioned when I see that but uh so
yeah so you know there should be
different ways to to get around moving
forward in 2017 and beyond but you know
other kinds of automation also began to
move forward in 2016 I mean you know
frankly uh you know we worry a lot about
the emergence of Skynet you know kind of
the evil robot system from from
terminator but I mean frankly skin is
probably already here you know this year
we fellow some technologies john sculley
when i talk to me talked a lot about a
block chain which is it was what was
used to make to underlie the technology
of Bitcoin but now it's being used to
basically kind of hardened and make the
internet of things more secure I mean
frankly it is Skynet it's like friendly
Skynet well that's why they get jets
friendly at first Yeah right um so you
know you know I think this you know the
Internet of Things this year we saw
implants they're like the size like not
even your fingernail I mean they're
literally like the size of a piece of
dust
that they're in their sensors that can
be implanted in your body and they have
a wireless signal so at this at this
point like everything is in the Internet
of Things your liver could be and other
things and it's sending you know data to
your doctor directly that's awesome well
after a night of the heavy drinking you
know like liver she fix yourself okay
all right I feel better you get a
message you are dead from alcohol
poisoning you're like no it will text
the funeral home yeah a dream just
haven't ready just in case don't have
clip be ready to help you you look like
you're ready to die of alcohol poisoning
do you need you're so salty hey but um
so like kind of but like the the logical
conclusion of all this kind of
combination of everything being
connected and everything kind of being a
part of the Internet of Things is moving
to the point where we can combine
something like block chain which is
basically kind of like a brain for the
internet of things right a communication
system a nervous system and combine that
with some technology that move forward
this year something called atomic nano
cars that they work on at Rice
University so this is basically these
are basically machines that are the size
of an atom and they can be moved around
and can be used to do stuff and this is
a really basic level right now this
isn't at at a consumer level at all but
basically I mean if you think 3d
printers are cool just wait until this
stuff comes of age we're talking the
combination of robotics and
nanotechnology that basically if you
take it to its logical extension could
give us the replicator from Star Trek so
you know it's it's some really exciting
stuff this is really far out but the you
know the building blocks of this kind of
technology that has been like in our
sci-fi dreams forever like it's there so
this is kind of terrifying to me because
I mean an atom is like a little machine
in itself Ryan I mean it's like a
block with and have protons and neutrons
so we're like we're going to build
something that's going to destroy us
cool I mean it's running right that's a
you know I mean you know technologies
tools right and tools can be used for
horrible things oh yeah I guarantee this
is going to be used for prank videos
like as soon as it hits like the show as
soon as some normal person could get
their hands on it there's somebody's
going to stick it in there but make it
launched or something because that's
what you do with technology yeah exactly
launch it out your mouth you're worried
about all this technology bring about
the apocalypse but you need to think of
the viral videos that will they belong
with the apartment the fun pakka lips
okay of it it's coming see it's
everything's going to help but if you
sell it the right way yeah it's all
marketing the fun pakka lips it's all
marketing yep and so you know but before
we get out of here that the final thing
the final technology that we saw
continue to move forward in 2016 it's
the thing that kind of ties us all
together and that's artificial
intelligence and we started the year
with google had not an AI that beat the
human champion at the at the game of go
that's right I have no idea how go works
but i think it's similar to like chess
or othello or something like that yeah
yeah and so yeah it'd be too human for
the first time although then by the end
of the year a human did get it back and
beat it um way to go here we had a big
year i think for artificial intelligence
that kind of ended in an uncertain way
for me with westworld if anyone's
watching west oh the know that that
makes you think a little bit about where
we're going with AI and i can't even I
can't even tell you where we're gonna go
with artificial intelligence because no
it's kind of a matter of the imagination
but beyond that it's a matter of what
would an artificial intelligence would
an artificial imagination come up with
and we don't even know um oh we they
have they have something tough like that
right didn't like they have a cool a
christmas song as they have yeah yeah
yeahs design that occurs not a great
song kerala but you know
and then google also has like this dream
thing that like oh the deep dream where
ya deep dream looks for patterns takes
stuff from the internet and it builds
like nightmares yes not everyone's it's
basically nightmare fuel everyone's
communication on the internet so we kind
of have that stuff how could that
possibly know it's like and then also
was it this year that Microsoft put that
Oh robot on Twitter that game completely
races right away yeah didn't work out as
great as it could oh but you know young
steps learning that's how you learn
things yeah you learn from so ABS that
go wrong we're putting all that stuff
out in the world and seeing what happens
and it just turns into a monster really
cool well 2016 even saw an artificial
intelligence that is actually capable of
predicting the future they showed it
videos and it had to guess what happened
next in the videos and apparently it got
pretty good at it oh wow so yeah by this
point next year we won't even have to do
a year in review or the year looking
forward to 2018 we're just gonna have an
AI do it for oh yeah totally I can't
that's gonna revolutionize my job that's
gonna like type in we gonna make a video
about this and then in like come back to
my desk and the videos produced I love
that there you go I mean we're going to
work we're all gonna be in self-driving
ride-sharing flying ubers on the way to
vacation this time next year i'm pretty
sure it's all just gonna be worked out
are you guys talking to your house yet
are you talking to your house Eric Jeff
like talking to the house like I talked
to Alexa you do have Alexa cool i just
got Alexa too and uh so I'm talking to
my house I just talked to my apartment
there's there's no actual appliances
that that will respond but you know it
gets lonely in that apartment so it's
good practice we can see um hey Alexa
say hi to Steven Alexa state say hi to
Steven hello it looks yeah when I first
got it I immediately tried to play
jeopardy and like a kick I'm terrible
apparently I don't know anything you
know and I got every answer wrong my
wife is like I'll really impressive
great but yeah I mean we're there
like I'm tuck I'm telling it to turn off
turn on the lights play music set alarms
for my kids to go to bed so we're there
my kids are talking to it my kids for
years old he's like Alexa turn off the
lights I'm like wow so that's where we
are now man you know it is so bad we
actually have two of them um I've got it
nice I've got the heck oh here and then
yeah my kid has the tap one you can
carry around you gotta press a button
but yeah we're we're fully embracing the
fun pakka lips and back Ozil well I'm so
maybe to wrap up the show I've talked an
awful lot I think about what i thought
it was good about 2016 what I'm looking
forward to in 2017 and beyond what are
you guys looking forward to coming up
next year for Jeff I oh I know I have
something I'm looking forward to I'm
looking forward to the spider-man movie
that's coming out next year oh that's
right because I saw the trailer for it
and it looked fun and spider-mans even
got his little creepy ass little web
wings that they drew for like I think
like 12 issues at the beginning and then
stopped for like 20 years it's really
interesting to see those yeah it looks
it looks fun I wasn't into the last
spider-man the guy who played spider-man
oh yeah you know I just I don't know it
wasn't like interested but this one
looks like fun you know you didn't like
Tobey Maguire's fight he says no I i
love it i love the Tobey Maguire but the
guy the actor after him yeah I guess and
he's Garfield yeah cuz he he wasn't even
American you know that's a problem for
me now she can make spider-man great
again yep yeah but this guy is like a
more of an unknown kind of actor which
makes for a better superhero movie in my
opinion I hear ya what do I used even
what are you looking forward to for next
year uh I'm looking forward to
self-driving everything you know I would
like self-driving I would like my car to
be a self-driving cars I make trips to
tahoe every once in a while and just you
know drives to LA or whatever I would
love to just be able to sit back and
watch a movie or something oh heck
during that trip you know
looking forward to a I improving i'm
looking forward to alexa improving so i
can ask her more questions and get just
more information and have her do more
things you know so that's that's really
it artificial intelligence is a huge
thing now I talk to my phone I talk to
Siri I want Syria to be better talk to
Syria talk to Alexa and you know that's
what I'm looking forward to you know in
addition to artificial intelligence of
proving I'd like to see real
intelligence improve yes but not but not
sure which one's going to happen first
but yeah I mean hoping look Eric that
was optimistic you happy I was
optimistic I am a ray of sunshine dammit
2016 sucks for me if Jeff isn't happy to
fix now um well I hope it was at least a
decent 2016 for everyone out there and
that you can find some silver linings
maybe you think this was a great year
maybe you think the world is going to be
made great again in the coming months
and I certainly hope so and I think I
think that's it for far aside for the
final one of 2016 happy holidays to
everyone around the world and we really
want to see Kelsey and Bonnie feel
better a big shout out to our editor
Leslie Katz investor family and to
everyone in the cnet family as well
happy holidays and we will see you in
2017 for Steven Beecham and Jeff
Sparkman I'm Eric Mack this has been far
sighted
