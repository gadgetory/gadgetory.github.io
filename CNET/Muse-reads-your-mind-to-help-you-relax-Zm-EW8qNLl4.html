of relaxation you're usually running
away from technology not embracing it
but muse is a brain sensing headband
that can actually help you reach a state
of calm and as little as three minutes
per day the way it works is it's based
on EEG technology so there are seven
sensors total on the headband five on
your forehead and then two behind each
ear then you place it on your head pair
it with your phone via bluetooth and
start your focus attention session they
call it focus attention but really what
we're talking about here is meditation
so you start your session and throughout
the three to twenty minutes what you
want to do is stay focused and relaxed
when you hit those points you'll start
to hear water flowing at the moment you
become distracted you'll hear something
that sounds a lot like white noise the
more you do it the better you get that's
the point of news at the end of each
session you'll get an analysis of how
you did letting you know when you were
distracted and when you were able to
stay focused then as you do this over
time you'll get those long-term analyses
letting you know how you've improved
right now those meditation sessions are
the only things that the muse can do but
there is an open SDK so we can look
forward to things like gaming and other
applications using the muse headband I
had a chance to try out the muse
headband and it is pretty cool I tried
tricking it but it knew every time I was
distracted or thinking about work
although after just a three minute
session I was almost able to forget that
I was actually at CES but you might find
some difficulties finding the perfect
placement firm use depending on your
head shape and size news is already
available for purchase for 299 and comes
in black and white although you can look
forward to more fun colors coming later
