of Twitter I'm Bridget Carey this is
your cnet update twitter is looking for
a new leader the network's chief
executive dick costolo announced he's
stepping down and co-founder and
chairman Jack Dorsey is stepping in as
interim CEO on July first while the
company looks for a permanent
replacement Dorsey will be juggling
double duty as CEO of square the mobile
payments company he founded Costello is
popular among employees but Wall Street
investors have been very critical since
Twitter wasn't growing its monthly
active users fast enough that's because
Twitter can be a little confusing to the
non initiated and even with revenues
doubling year-over-year Twitter was not
turning a profit for the stock and
that's what investors care about so good
luck to whoever comes next pleasing
investors and getting more people on
Twitter will not be an easy task just
please don't turn Twitter into some sort
of watered-down version of Facebook now
rapper Snoop Dogg has put his hat in the
ring to be the next CEO and busters
should be pleased he'll have his mind on
his money and his money on his mind
dropping faves like its hot reat
whistling the retweets but I'm worried
he just let the network go up in smoke
and before the CEO switch up news
twitter did announce something else it's
removing the 140 character limit on
direct messages when your privately
chatting with someone you can type as
much as you want this change begins next
month but normal tweets are still
limited to 140 characters as usual let's
switch gears to 3d if you want to make
your own 3d printed items there are new
types of computers to get you started
last year HP released the sprout PC it's
a way to scan objects and it also
projects images on a touch map below
where the keyboard typically sits it
lets you scan anything and create a
digital file in your computer to send to
a 3d printer the issue is that scanning
isn't exactly easy but now HP came up
with a turntable and software that
automates the whole scanning process it
tilts the object to help you get the
best scan from all angles the little
capture stage costs three hundred
dollars and the sprout PC is cell
it's nineteen hundred dollars and get
ready for a slew of video game news in
the next few days as the big III video
game expo kicks off in Los Angeles
Microsoft has the first big announcement
Monday morning expect much of the talk
to be around halo 5 it's one of the most
anticipated games coming this year and
I'm sure Microsoft is going to give us
more reasons on why a Windows 10 PC is
going to make your xbox experience
better because Windows 10 this coming
out next month Sony will follow with its
PlayStation news later in the day and
Nintendo has its news conference on
Tuesday we'll have to see if Nintendo
will talk about its mobile game plans or
maybe give us a clue on its mysterious
new console in the works that's it for
this tech news update there's plenty
