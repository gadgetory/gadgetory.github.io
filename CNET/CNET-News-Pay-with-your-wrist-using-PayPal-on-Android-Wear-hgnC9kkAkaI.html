service available across Android devices
if you want to go buy something in the
store is there an offer available bang
it's in my wallet bang I purchased it
right we can make things happen really
quickly for people by just giving them
just the right hint of information
versus even kind of the glut that you
can get through mobile right we thought
mobile was limited in reality the watch
that's a super limited amount of real
estate and we can make it smaller and
smarter it's about speed it's about
security it's about not waiting in line
those are things we think there's a
solution industry by industry where we
can make a slightly better experience
for people
we're here at PayPal headquarters in San
Jose California i'm speaking with
richard mercele he's a wearable
architect here at PayPal and he's going
to show me the new PayPal app for
Android wear so tell us first of all how
it works I can just take my phone put it
in my pocket I have so many pockets and
then I can do all of the work here so
now what will I would like to show you
is at our coffee place I'll use voice
voice is becoming a way to also interact
so if I don't know if I'm not recognized
being here I can just use my watch and
say okay now I want to search for stuff
so I would say Starbucks the system will
then pull up the shop and I'll be able
to pay there so now she should see as
she enters my order she should see on
the cash register my picture that should
be similar to this one right if she
recognized me she will then allow me to
go
with my double expression on your
sparking water and I'll get a feedback
once that transaction go to our system
that Ivan paid and I'm good to go here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
