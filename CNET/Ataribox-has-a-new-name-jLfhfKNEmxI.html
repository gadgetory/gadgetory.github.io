new game console from a company
synonymous with retro gaming until now
we've known it as the Atari box but now
it has a new name this is the Atari VCS
that stands for video computer system a
name that calls back to the original
name for the Atari 2600 the name isn't
the only thing this console borrows from
the original either it also features the
same matte black and wood veneer design
mandate as the original gaming machine
as well as a controller that feels just
like the stiff 2600 joystick you
remember though it has been updated with
some fancy LED lights it'll also have a
modern dual stick gamepad to Atari
wasn't ready to show us what will
actually be playing with these
controllers but promised that the new
VCS will have plenty to play including
brand new games and indie games as well
as a hundred or more classic Atari games
like asteroids centipede breakout
adventure and pong and even new
reimagine versions of those Atari
classics like the already announced
tempest 4000 but the Atari VCS is still
as the name implies also a computer
system outside of that console interface
it still runs Linux and the company says
it's planning to give users access to a
kind of sandbox mode that lets them
access the Linux desktop that means in
theory you'll be able to install
anything you want on it including the
Linux version of steam and it's library
of linux compatible PC games how those
games might run though is still kind of
up in the air Atari says the BCS will
have an all-in-one desktop processor
from AMD and it previously was looking
at a CPU based on Bristol rich but it
hasn't locked down the machines final
specifications yet that could still
change either way Atari says it's still
targeted at 250 to $300 price range but
hopes it'll still be able to keep the
console affordable as for when you'll
actually be able to buy it they aren't
ready to say for sure if it will ship
this year or next year instead Atari
says it's too important to just get the
console right it'll ship when it's ready
