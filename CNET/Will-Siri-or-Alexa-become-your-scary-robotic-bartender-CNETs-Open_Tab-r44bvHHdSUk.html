cnet's open tab this is going to be our
Facebook live show where we grab a few
drinks which we've done already because
I'm a little drunk I'm like I'm not that
drunk yet but I'm here to tell you that
we're going to be wrapping up the week's
tech topics my name is Jeff Bakalar here
in our very exclusive see nut on see you
know Deb wonderful lounge is our social
media guy mr. Michael Sorrentino how are
you sayin I'm great how you didn't thank
you for being here thank you thank you
should really be thanking you for a
range this is this is all you yeah thank
you and as well as executive news editor
Roger Cheng thank you for joining us
lovely to be able t good awesome beer
and afternoon back in the control room
we've got Joey cominsky and he made me
say this but he's going to be the
bartender serving us questions from you
who are watching at home or wherever
you're at and again we're not just going
to wrap up the week in tech we want to
hear from you we want to we want to get
questions from you it's not just going
to be us talking it's going to be you
talking so if you've got a question
comment let us know even if it's not
about tech maybe you have like a weird
brother-in-law that you want just advice
on we'll fix that for you so I'm gonna
toss now to Mike he's gonna glide us
into the story of the week what do you
got hey guys so why does get a couple
drinks together and talk about on voice
assistants like Siri and Alexa more and
more companies are just getting to know
us not over drinks but over what we do
right over IMS and email and we're just
getting more and more information to
serve us for that help us but ultimately
wanna know what you guys think is it
cool that Siri and Alexa and everyone
else is getting to know us that closely
or is it frightening that they are going
to know everything about what you're
doing no no when you wake up what you
eat you know I think it's all other both
I'm the paranoid start part of me thinks
that this is a bit frightening these are
digital systems that can
near us basically anytime there's no
real way to tell if they are listening
they're not even if you shut them off
and the other issue though and i found
covering this stuff the last couple
weeks is that fright or not we kind of
to live with it because it's coming
every one of these tech companies it's
just they're all that AI right now it's
the hot new thing and they're pulling
tons of money into it so whether we like
it or not Alexis Erie Cortana they're
all here today but don't you think we
like put way too much sci fi AI like of
a war of a paranoia share for them like
at the end of the day it's it's a robot
it's not something that's like oh I've
become self-aware and Ryan steal all
your money yeah I think it's less the
computer be malicious and it's more
about all the data they're collecting
rights all the information our
preferences you know what we wake up
only when we eat what we'd like to eat
all that getting served out to some
other third-party company that we're not
aware of right right it's not it's not
necessarily Google or Apple I don't
trust it's it's a third party that
they're dealing with later on right like
that it doesn't get creepy like
searching on Google wasn't creepy until
you started getting relevant ads served
to you yeah like when that happened you
have ten years whenever that started
when you be like oh I just search for a
new backpack and now I'm getting served
backpack now they're like do you need
back to school supplies your kids going
back to school or exactly so it's like
once it crosses that creep barrier right
who's winning now it's not just searches
it's it's anything you do in your home
right right and like this let me tap the
scoop that we had that Apple's purported
echo rival will have a camera mmm with
facial recognition they'll actually be
able to recognize you and see what
you're doing and it literally has eyes I
mean it's got your bedroom and you're
like oh that's what it starts to get
kinky don't sit and Roger see exactly I
don't know how I feel about that but
show like what what to you is the most
again we talked about how like there's
this sci-fi paranoia dystopian future of
life right voice recognition why not but
what do you think is like the most
realistic negative
I mean most realistic again is bad
information getting leaked out to not
leaked out but but given to other third
party advertisers and you know i'm i'm
the type that values my privacy you know
people or people have different opinions
on how much their privacy is worth but
it seems like a lot of those rights are
going to be given up once we start using
these digital assistants will start
embracing them right what's become our
part of our regular lives okay I'm gonna
propose this questions okay do they even
work that well like does voice readiness
yeah shucks or not because you know when
all that stuff started with like calling
up ups and talking to the UPS boys like
that was terrible it's still terrible I
don't want to do that right right just
some of them do like like if you go into
Google you could find everywhere you've
ever been because they're following
everywhere they nose or your phone is
and if you were just wondering where you
were last Tuesday you're just need to
click it and they'll know we're around
where you've been I mean to just point i
think the the interactions with these
assistants are great i mean that's
that's kind of why I haven't really used
elector neco right and it's why no one
ever uses Xbox Kinect either right which
is also kind of creeping it's in a way
but I think it's getting better I think
what the demonstrations that Google
showed off that the whole contextual
thing with being able to say like what's
what movies playing right you know what
was playing to tonight get me tickets
like that's right now computer can't
figure out that the context between
those two questions right sooner or
later and will once it becomes
conversational on your you're speaking
to the digital system like it's a person
I think that's when we'll all start kind
of jump on it sure privacy concerns or
not what do you guys think about so we
have a story today of about the S three
year anniversary of Edward Snowden leaks
and in it we have interview with Glenn
Greenwald and one of the subjects in it
was about how privacy is what is going
to be good for businesses and companies
yes do you think that that can become a
selling point for companies to be like
oh we keep your information safe here
here and here here and then how much do
we still trust it I think already is I
mean look at apple right apples the
Apple has sort of gone on record and
said security and privacy is our
priority and you know they've gotten
they stood up against the government the
whole battle with the FBI and I mean
that's really it sort of the combination
of
all the stuff that's happened snoring I
think it's the fact that these tech
companies are now been emboldened to
write defend our privacy against the
government that's another hanging it's
weird that like his entire revelation
has resulted in like a consumer-facing
like Oh transparency is going to be
better now with companies that you trust
your information with like I have to
come out on the government side right
but like just you know Google is going
to be more transparent about what they
have about you but think about it like
sit in a post Snowden era yep people
fundamentally search differently like at
the edits very core you know like that
that has changed the world right so I
think it's really interesting when you
when you have that mentality next to
like oh now it's now it's everything you
say and before we start before we went
live mic you kind of you kind of freaked
me out a little bit on what laughs you
saw it in my face but I was pretty
freaked out when you're talking about
you know minding what you say all the
time I'm gonna study all the game
celebrities right where it's like
there's a constant hot mic wherever you
go to me up you know I used to think
like oh they'll never get me in my house
like I could close the door and say
whatever I want about the president and
there's something a little disturbing
about the possibility I'm one month the
mind boggles wondering what you're
saying about the president dad so well
well let's see who the good guys but
like Alexa isn't always rubbing her
trophy clearly of course I don't look
like a drunk guy some of the iphones
already in the office have Siri always
on all the time and they are always
listening for a buzz word and yeah
allegedly they don't activate once they
hear the buzz word right like you ever
know yeah if the capability is working
from I'm technically speaking they could
be listening all the time right that's
that's part of the fear factor it's why
I'm creeped out mm-hmm a lot of people
who may be a little little older a
little less trusting of technology
understandably so have that notion of
like well no nothing is safe nothing
nothing you do can ever be safe and
there there was a point where I was like
no you're wrong because it's always
going to be safer but then again it's
like well maybe maybe not maybe
everything is inherently
honourable right and that something that
kind of freaks me out i mean like i have
a young kid at home I think about what
the future he's gonna live in and I
don't know like it would really freak me
out if like he turned 30 and all of a
sudden like everyone's google search
history ever got leaked out and he's
like oh man what was my dad surgeon in
2016 oh my god like that is but that is
his January where's me in his own it
from between the ages of 13 and 21 well
that although maybe the cultural the
social mores change at that point they
all just have no shame in all their like
that whatever he sorts that like that
next generation right now it's all about
transparency it's all about sharing
everything right so maybe there they
just they don't get embarrassed are we
gonna go into that cuz I could go into
that I have theories man like all right
well I'm just saying like when you talk
about generations coming behind us like
I'm 34 you're 30 I'm all of you I'm 37
okay you're a little young eight that's
adorable thank you um so you know I feel
like you know there's and this doesn't
apply to you because like it or not
you're part of our generation I think
there's a maybe one or two behind us we
are like there's not a real life and
Internet divide know that has been
flattened yep like that is the same
exact thing and I don't know I just I
bring the interacting with your phone is
as real as interacting with a person
right for a lot of them for sure yeah
for sure so you know that makes me
wonder where it's like there isn't this
sort of reservation to be like oh my god
that that's gonna get out that's right a
private thing that I said it's like the
default is I have to share now right
like there's no there's no barrier it's
just everything has been flattened that
kind of freaks me out a little bit I
don't know I don't know if it's good or
bad i'm gonna say it's good cuz i don't
want sound like an old guy so it's great
we're ahead yeah yeah again his awesome
it was good remember though how to keep
like records that are not on the
internet like it's good to some some kid
some kids are like only on the phone all
the time period everything through the
phone yeah and like there is valued
having intrinsic things that like having
a photo that is offline or
or like personal information that is not
rice touted a cloud cloud it's a place
there's like when things cloud locker
it's quaint it's sort of like I'll go
that you've got a physical photo that's
that's sweet or even like personal like
real business documents maybe you don't
want them floating inside a G Drive
maybe you don't want write a contract to
something or a college application lease
a copy of it like physically on your
desk part of that way you know where it
is yeah yeah I've know you were my
diploma is I'll also need it actually
yeah I don't know wait a minute my did
you imagine that service you're not even
question what am i doing how are you
tired let's see that we don't have
leaned on center you said it not me oh
I'm just curious bartender Joey who's in
the back doing god knows what do you
have any questions first you have
anything you want to share your just
gonna sit there and not use the prompter
we have one person's curious as to why
Siri only understands English me Alexa
only stand understands English cuz the
Lexus racist haha that's that's him you
said that like softball that was not see
that's Oh Jeff Bakalar that's a softball
Alexa hates any language no why why is
it it is just because that's the one
they went with that's a minute they
launched the echo in the US and makes
sense to go english first I mean
obviously they want their their
ambitions are go overseas I'm sure Alexa
will be speaking multiple languages in a
short time right yes Syria like began
with a few languages that expanded
behind it and then she got smarter and
Syria was on a phone that was sold
around the world i mean the echo is
still as popular as it is in the u.s. I
mean it still cover us centric
predominantly stolen in the US right but
it's not as then I don't know if the
newer ones are sold overseas yet another
it's something I think they're slowly
expanding that that product but it's
it's largely here so it makes sense to
start with English so let's talk about
Alexa being included in that new pebble
core oh yeah they added there they're
adding that into petals launching a 3g
enabled little button that could
essentially in a way replacement ipod
shuffle adding Spotify playlists
and the buttons are programmable to
whatever button is a weird way I say I
don't know if I'm saying it the way most
people do wait say it again button wait
button for a second it's like I hear
it's weird but i don't it doesn't seem
weird give me a right way to get the
button button ya know it's weird it's
almost as if you're somehow pronouncing
both teas in that word yeah button I
love it that's funny I've yeah I don't
think any less of you I still like ya
thank you yeah they've added they're
adding as one of its features that's
gonna collaborate with and so that'll be
the first instance of Alexa becoming
completely mobile outside of the echo
tap kind of has that to rip but that'll
be like on somebody's waist and that's
it right it's just slightly larger I
mean yeah this is like a little button
mm-hmm nuttin but say it's right way
Roger wait so now I thought so that
thing's not independently connected to
the internet I thought it can through it
though it has become so just got a sim
card in yeah yeah okay well that makes
sense so all right so we're so what else
do we have like what else do we want to
figure out about all this because I'm I
mean for me I use the only thing I use
voice for these days is voice to text
like that's look I said it that's what I
do if I'm walking down the street I'm
not trying to you know look down and get
you know hit by a cab I just want to
dictate my text and send it off I set
timers a lot by a leopard last night
that if I ask it to make me how to show
how to make a drink it'll tell me so I
tell it Siri how do I make a margarita
and it says the primary ingredient is
tequila right like oh that's great
information yeah God is the old man of
the group I actually I rarely ever use
any of the digital systems like Siri
maybe I asked for what's playing around
sure but that's it I don't really Jodi
you're my age yeah joe what do you think
what do I think about what our usual
assistance that we're talking about the
TV is like whoa yeah but give it a
trippy in the lab what are you
actually doing paranoid car nor took the
trippy
I i use Siri for like Google searches
it's funny because I'll be like Siri
Google such and such I don't I don't
really use it for voice to text cuz it
it always messes up my words I guess I
speak very fast really yeah that's a
surprise i gotta do i think i prefer the
the g board when i'm texting alexa i
love it um the only problem is sometimes
i asked to play certain songs and
actually have to name the song then the
artist I can't really say the artist and
the song because then it says that
playlist doesn't exist yeah who wants to
do that about valid ID suppy i'm curious
i mean it's habit usually say artist and
song right right you can't just do one
of the other well like you know like i
like this old elastic by a whole sea
bank when Jenny Burton like I say play
one more shot if I say play C bank it
goes you do not have that song and if I
go play one more shot by C bank then it
recognizes into place I'm curious with
people watching at home think again
don't forget we are asked we're
answering questions you might have about
a likewise any times that the sub
question there the sub director is like
yeah anything you want to discuss about
you want anything they said what is Jeff
Bakalar what's your problem with the
president what no I love our crop
residue with our curve but really big
dog truck guy I'm just a huge I just had
this problem right you know look just
loves all trouble that's uh that is not
the case so funny like I'm so willing to
joke about everything but I draw the
line there no yeah that's I have no
problem with our current present I love
that guy do you have anything like
really off the wall not it the thing it
makes sense that we're receiving I'm
somebody said can you tell me why do you
choose the name Siri Siri why do we
choose Siri we didn't so for the record
that has no Apple by the way yeah for
the rim no input into whether or not no
Apple names how is that a question
though you said anything i'm getting for
you oh yeah yeah why I picked the topic
was because it has to come up in the
news over the past week yeah that's true
so that's why I'm people it it is inside
of iphones iphones are a very popular
phone we often do see that there's
plenty of attention that our readers
seem to wonder about with those devices
and like i said just at the code
conference there was plenty of talk of
artificial intelligence
every country talking about the impact
that will have on our lives ebay say
it's going to use AI to deliver us crap
we didn't know we needed Oh even though
we will need something mean like though
like say we want you to buy it is that
1980s Optimus Prime that you've always
wanted you don't need a I to figure out
that I am totally lurking all over that
but the computer will know that you
wanted and deliver to you I feel like
there's certain things artificial
intelligence has a logical sort of
relevancy to yeah and there's other
things words like will know your
shoehorning that technology into a place
it doesn't necessarily belong I think
that's where we over the law of these
companies because AI such a buzzword
right every company looking desperate to
sound relevant they're like oh no we're
on a I we've been investing air for 10
years right talking about right yeah I
don't know a lot of like the last
buzzword is like obviously this cloud
computing thing right which is just like
yeah you could say that most people
don't understand what that means hey
guys I got one more what about VIP vi v
the voice is sent the I think there was
the creator of your makers of Siri have
split off when they splash Apple really
greatly they made their making a
different voice assistant that it's not
stuck on any one particular platform
this little third party okay but what's
interesting about them is that it will
tear your question and then do a whole
bunch of different formulas to get to
that answer and as well as referring to
history so it's fascinating but it was
really really early i believe it was
shown off at a techcrunch disrupt if i
remember correctly so it's like an
independent platform yeah the mower
anywhere where would it actually like
where will you use on your phone on a
computer I don't know thing on the phone
is where they were showing it off I
think you had to download is it a nap
but right well it's sort of it's so
early it's hard to know exactly what
angle are going at which is funny
because it's like any mobile platform
that you would want to use that has its
own proprietary assistant like it have
to be way better for you to just write
using it like I know hound
have you got to try hound that was a
really good idea hound is pretty amazing
it's a great demo voice inside
soundhound a fright yeah yeah I think
they shortened it to hound now and now
it does music and like everything else
you could ever want and they do a lot of
like really sexy demos well like
subtract the population of india from
how long it takes for light to travel to
the Sun it's almost like the Wolfram
Malcolm are like wow you know nice which
was like okay yeah that's not something
anyone would ever love ya wolframalpha
was great as a concept right whenever
you guys that like we yeah like no one's
trying to like divide butter by New
Jersey like knows Jenna like that I
actually have a question for you guys
all right yeah well were to release
their own version of Alexa with a camera
would you guys purchase it in why or
wouldn't you and why so he said say that
again Apple created their own Alexa like
you know home unit yeah and it did have
the camera but like the story that
sharra yeah the story that we've roadmap
I want to know your personal opinions of
would you or wouldn't you if it worked
with other things and it had a mute
button maybe it to me the new button is
really important when Google home was
announced and has no buttons on it I was
like all right cuz i do sign up for the
google music service or sounds like
that's convenient for me but then like
no no buttons then how do i tell okay I
cannot I can't not here neither what's
crazy I would probably not like I
haven't really embraced the echo and I
probably wouldn't do you have an echo no
it's thing I haven't really sure I kind
of just want to buy one I just I
whenever amazon comes out with something
like a new product is like do you buy
the tab buns or the push button the dad
no I have any uh any dashed okay i know
the dash phone although i'll think about
getting was like diaper dash but do you
think you'll get a job delivery for like
if you wanted some hockey equipment in
those last minute so guys I think it's
about time we do a last call for
questions okay yeah so do we have a way
I mean I question I just do it out there
i'll see if i get anything but it ok
anjaneri the the amazon drone commercial
they believed had Jeremy Clarkson in it
as well they showed it off the drone
concept by showing a girl this
commercial is not new at all by the way
it's a few months old now but a girl is
going to her soccer practice and her
shoes have been eaten by the dog okay so
they order the shoes and then it gets
delivered to their backyard right via
drone and then she makes it on time to
practice with brand new soccer shoes
yeah that's never gonna happen you don't
think that I'll ever having all right
it's gonna happen but it's I can happen
for a long long time right like how like
let's just stop with the sci-fi crap for
a second and just think like logistical
e how is that yeah yeah hundreds of
drones fly everywhere yeah right they're
not gonna collide I mean that dull avoid
each other yeah they'll be able to avoid
like you won't ever see the sky again
Kazuki the stros it's gonna be a drum
track carry tidy amazon boxes cuz i mean
if there are enough boxes like the
shemitah boxes we order at home yeah
there are gonna be like 40 50 thousand
drones just around my apartment it's
very weird how like any residential
high-rise you walk into it's just like
Christmas every day just like a bunch of
brown boxes like Christmas alright guys
I think we're gonna make this the last
question ok here we go laughs the
inflatable Space Station what do you
think what we should do Oh inflatable do
it what is that yeah I'm afraid that
there I cuz there any contacts for that
question or is that just it started out
what it no it's just the inflatable
Space Station what do you think like is
that a space station with helium inside
hey I knows Mel I mean I've imagined his
oxygen or something filled up inside
right none if there's if a helium won't
we be seeing you you don't need anything
in space well you need oxygen ya know
for sure i'm seeing like for something
why is it inflatable probably cuz it's
more durable Vinnie beautiful toy like I
can't it can't Ripert you talking about
like like just like a nice like pushes
like know your docking I don't know like
it's elastic i guess and palaces there's
no collision i'm now obsessed with this
i think we're going to look that one up
yeah and yes no comment we'll let you
know we're good i know i love a big fan
yeah big fan edyta flagpole on
especially hey thank you 22 Roger to
mike hanke to Joey and to Brian in the
control room for helping us out we
really appreciate it we hope you enjoyed
our first on tab I enjoyed it yay as
long as I'm getting free open to what I
call
taunton open to it yeah see that's open
tab yeah the bar is now closed Oh
petition bars closed the lights are on
everyone looks weird everyone wants to
go home it's awkward keep watching
facebook com so I've seen it all of our
Facebook live stuff thanks to to Mike
for putting this all together thank you
