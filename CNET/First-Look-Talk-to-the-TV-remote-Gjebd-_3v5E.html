doesn't really have any number buttons
on it here i'm with samsung's new smart
touch remote it's going to be coming
with their new Smart interaction
televisions basically if you have a
Samsung TV that has a camera on it and
you're going to get one of these guys
it's a remote that has kind of like a
laptop touchscreen pad and you simply
select different areas some are buttons
like channels and volume they have
buttons and then you have shortcut keys
to get to different menus on the
television so here I tap the top I have
now a menu that showed up and I can
simply scroll back and forth with my
finger like I was on a trackpad and if I
want that number pad I simply hit the
number key down here to pull up the
number pad and this remote also has a
mic on top so you're doing voice
commands you can speak directly into the
remote first you hit the voice shortcut
key cute cat pictures as many cute cat
photos as I can this button here will
take me quickly back to the Smart Hub
and if I want a history of what else I
have seen I can simply hit the history
shortcut key to get to different
applications within the samsung
television like Skype or the camera or
the past channels I've been to now
another neat thing about this remote is
that it is connected via bluetooth so I
don't have to point the remote at the TV
I can point at the wall I can point it
at you anyone can get in my way and I'm
still gonna be able to get the channel I
want now if an on-screen keyboard isn't
your thing Samsung also has come out
with its smart keyboard it's sold
separately it's going to work with
different smart televisions roughly
about $99 or so and it also has a
touchpad on it too is also shortcut keys
to the Smart Hub volume channel and a
return button another neat value out of
this keyboard is that it also works with
Samsung galaxys tablet and phone line
because it's bluetooth connected so you
have a keyboard out to go with your
Samsung tablet Samsung right now is all
about connecting to these devices
making them touch friendly and you can
even speak your commands now coming from
Samsung spring launch we now have new
ways to interact with Samsung Smart TVs
with Sina TV I'm Bridget Carey in New
York</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
