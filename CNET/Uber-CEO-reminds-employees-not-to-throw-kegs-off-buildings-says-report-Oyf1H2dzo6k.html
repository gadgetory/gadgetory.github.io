eyebrows remember when people talk about
uber because it was an innovative way to
get a ride well that's not happening now
in 2013
uber held a party in Miami Florida to
celebrate the company's success company
parties need rules of course according
to recode uber CEO Travis kalanick wrote
an email titled urgent urgent read this
now or else with multiple exclamation
points Kalyn explained the do's and
don'ts of the party under the do side
were have a great time this is a
celebration as well as share good music
the don'ts side is causing a bit of
commotion though it included do not have
sex with another employee unless a you
have asked that person for that
privilege and they have responded with
an emphatic yes I will have sex with you
and be the two or more of you do not
work in the same chain of command yes
that means that Travis will be celibate
on this trip
hashtag CEO life hashtag FML also in the
don't side
do not throw large kegs off of tall
buildings the report says Callen ik was
advised not to send the email due to its
tone because you know it doesn't scream
professional however the uber CEO
apparently sent it and now it's public
