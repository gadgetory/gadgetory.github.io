NASA opened his doors on October 1st
1958 but it was not the government's
first flight research agency the
National Advisory Committee on
Aeronautics or NACA was founded way back
in 1915 the agency was tasked to conduct
aeronautical research including the
development of wind tunnels the NACA was
a very successful agency the program
made history in 1947 when Chuck Yeager
broke the sound barrier but it wasn't
all about breaking records the d558 had
a radical new design that had swept
wings
thanks to NACA research the design was
proven to be more efficient and became
common on commercial jet aircraft years
before NASA was founded the NACA was
already researching rockets it even went
as far as researching re-entry vehicles
in 1957 the USSR successfully launched
Sputnik one the first satellite to orbit
Earth forcing the US government to make
changes the National built around the
present but now we've come to a new and
AFA is to become part of a new agency
the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration
and like that the space race was on
NASA's first decade in space
much of the first decade was spent
gathering data from satellites
telescopes and research vessels
as research advanced satellites carried
plants microorganisms and animals
these bio satellites taught us how
weightlessness radiation velocity and
pressure affected life
NASA sent probes to Mars and Venus to
learn more about our neighbors NASA's
next step was to place an unmanned
vessel on the moon proving that a person
could walk on surface
in 1962 the Ranger for accomplished that
mission that gave a green light for
astronauts to begin preparing themselves
for spaceflight
they began going through intense
conditioning and training exercises to
be ready for one thing
each test flight provided new and
critical information NASA began docking
with spacecraft already in orbit which
led to spacewalks and of course the most
important test green astronauts back to
earth safely
some of NASA's missions didn't go
according to plan but with every failure
there's potential to learn and grow
pushing us further into the infinite
darkness of space and bringing back new
knowledge in preparation for one of
humans greatest achievements to the moon
July 16 1969 mission commander Neil
Armstrong prepares for the historic Trek
the team rose early ate breakfast and
dressed in their spacesuits 10 9
ignition sequence starts 6 5 the journey
to the moon lasted three days the team
kept busy navigating observing and
grooming on July 19th Apollo 11 enters
orbit around the moon sending back
incredible images
I'm bad like okay engine stop we got to
get down eagle
seven hours after landing Armstrong
finally steps out of the lunar module
they left behind an American flag along
with medals honoring those who lost
their lives in earlier space tests they
also left messages of goodwill from 73
countries
after spending 21 hours on the moon's
surface it was time to go home the lunar
module rejoined the command module and
headed back to earth Apollo 11 and crew
came hurling back to earth at 25,000
miles per hour the crew was welcomed
home with rescue divers and thunderous
applause the astronauts were special
airtight garments to protect against the
possibility of lunar contamination they
were immediately placed into quarantine
the historic journey ended on July 27
1969 the mission was a success unlocking
a wealth of knowledge about the moon its
history and its composition from all of
us here at Cena
congratulations NASA on sixty years of
space exploration and research for more

calm
that you are really fast
is he on the ground at all kilometers
huh
he's got about two wheels on the ground</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
