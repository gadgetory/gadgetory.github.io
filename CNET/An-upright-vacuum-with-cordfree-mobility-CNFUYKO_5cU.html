here with the Hoover air cordless vacuum
this $300 vacuum is a departure for the
industry because it's not really an
upright and it's not really a stick
vacuum yet it doesn't have a cord and
its maneuverable like a stick vacuum but
Hoover claims that it has the power and
the technology of its own Hoover
Windtunnel 3 vacuum while this vacuum
looks great and it's the lightest
upright model we've tested so far it
kind of disappointed us now I had really
high expectations to start out with but
it's also $300 so I expected it to go
really above and beyond either the 180
dollar Hoover Windtunnel upright or the
180 dollar Hoover Linx stick vacuum but
it really didn't it performed about the
same as the Hoover Windtunnel overall
this one did a really great job on
carpet it got the larger particles like
the clumps of pet hair up really well
but it did struggle with suction so as
far as small particles like sand it
didn't pick up as much as I expected it
to and that's actually an area that the
Hoover Windtunnel excels so that was
pretty disappointing especially because
this is a hundred and twenty dollars
more expensive than that model it also
underperformed the Hoover Linx stick
vacuum which is you know lighter weight
even easier to move around then this one
is so while this outperforms some of the
other upright brands we've tested I
would really still recommend the Hoover
Linx if you're going within the Hoover
brand I really love the design I love
that it comes with two brushes and
accessories I love that it comes with
two batteries but I think they still
have some work to do to make it as good
as the Hoover Linx thanks for watching
I'm Megan Willerton Pristina
