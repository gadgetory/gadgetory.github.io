Kara Tsuboi cnet.com and it's time to
get loaded
Verizon may be planning to launch a
streaming movie and TV service putting
it in direct competition with Netflix
Reuters reports of the companies and
talks with programming partners for a
possible 2012 launch for roughly 85
million homes in the u.s. companies like
epics that stream content to Netflix
have contracts that expire soon leaving
the door open for partnerships
potentially with Verizon google plus is
adding a check-in feature starting next
week
similar to Foursquare Google+ users can
take advantage of discounts by checking
into a company through the social
networking site a neat feature with
Google Plus is that users have the
option to share offers that they redeem
with people in their circles with
Facebook being the top competitor Google
hopes adding new features like this will
drive more people over to the service in
other Google News its Android Market hit
a significant milestone this week
announcing that 10 billion apps have now
been downloaded sure it's got a long way
to catch up with Apple's established
ecosystem iTunes and its 18 billion
downloads but the Android growth has
been steep and strong in honor of that
nice round number Google will be selling
select apps for just 10 cents over the
next 10 days starting today the app
Flipboard will now be available for the
iPhone the super slick app for the iPad
came out last year it takes content that
your friends have shared inside your
social networks and gives them a
magazine style layout download it for
free from the App Store according to
Facebook users if sama bin Laden's death
was the most memorable thing to happen
in 2011 over the year the social
networking site keeps track of what
shared and what trends even breaking it
down by country for example in the UK it
shouldn't surprise anyone that the Royal
Wedding ranked number one visit
Facebook's own page to see all of 2011's
highlights twitter also keeps track of
top tweets according to the number of
times a subject was tweeted per second
and these results couldn't be any more
different than Facebook's
in 2011 Osama bin Laden's death
didn't even crack the top five number
one was the MTV Video Music Awards with
nearly 9,000 tweets per second and since
these results are based on worldwide
data it reasons why the FIFA Women's
World Cup and Brazil's elimination from
the Copa America were amongst the most
tweeted about those are your headlines
for today I'm Kara Tsuboi cnet.com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
