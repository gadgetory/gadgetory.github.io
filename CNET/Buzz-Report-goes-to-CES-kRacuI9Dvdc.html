buzz report at CES 2007 and now for the
gadget of the week and now for the news
you know one thing i've really noticed
it CES 2007 this year is that there's a
lot more stuff geared toward women not

technology so we've seen great new
women's gadgets from kodak and appealing
things from nokia and well all sorts of
things take a look

week there was also macworld and there
was a huge announcement at macworld
Steve Jobs finally unveiled the
long-awaited iphone which is not just a
wide screen ipod it's also a cell phone
and a touchscreen Internet device that

three revolutionary products of this
class the first one is a wide screen
ipod with touch controls the second is a
revolutionary morgan
