I'm at Microsoft spoof checking out the
xbox one this is the closest we've ever
been to the actual console and I'm
pretty surprised because it's a little
smaller than we thought up here on top
is obviously the new version of Connect
which also does look a little smaller
than what we thought judging on the
product shots that we saw at the reveal
and the press conference here at e3 you
can see right here has a glowing Xbox
logo there's a port around the side and
around back all the connectivity that
we've known about hdmi in and out and
infrared blaster some optical audio
inputs so we're checking out the
upgraded Kinect sensor a little smaller
than we thought like I originally said
you can tell the lens is located on the
left side and then what appears to be
some sort of sensing microphone below
again we're not a hundred percent sure
exactly how all this works right now we
can just get an idea of what it feels
like what it looks like again I'll
definitely a lot smaller it does
maintain the same sort of angled grille
design as the console so they do match
in that capacity it's so we have here
the xbox one controller first thing I'm
thinking the second I picked this up
it's much more angular it definitely
fits in your hands better than the
original xbox 360 controller you got to
love this d-pad it's been perfected for
the most part there's no sort of wiggle
room analog sticks are a tiny bit
smaller they feel like but
ultra-responsive and they click as well
around back is the RB lb and triggers
and those sort of morph into each other
as you can see right here now we're it
on the buttons these buttons nothing
much has changed I can't really notice a
huge difference in how they feel but
they are certainly responsive and then
there's also the two buttons located in
the middle right now we're not a hundred
percent sure how those buttons will
operate
with the xbox one but needless to say
they're probably some sort of menu
button and a sharing button perhaps
although we don't know that for sure the
controller does feel a little lighter
perhaps compared to the next box 360
controller but it feels really great in
your hands is a port here at the bottom
and probably what's a charging point up
top and of course xbox one will be out
in November for five hundred dollars I
want to keep playing rise right now but
this has been a first look at the xbox
one from e3 2013 I'm Jeff Bakalar for
cnet com I'm getting killed thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
