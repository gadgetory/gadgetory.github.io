is a quick look at the Samsung wb800f
one time zoom lens in optical image
stabilization and by that I mean that
it's photo and video quality isn't
really any better than what you'd get
from an above-average smartphone but you
also get the features of a reasonably
priced point-and-shoot like that long
zoom lens I mentioned and a 16 megapixel
BSI CMOS sensor and a 3 inch touchscreen
LCD as well as built-in Wi-Fi and a nice
pop-up flash that can be angled up and
bounced so you get more even light and
you're not blasting your friends and
family with flash the camera is teeming
with shooting options too there are semi
manual and manual shooting modes but the
bulk of them are automatic if you like
using effects and filters you'll
probably really like this camera and if
you like sharing your photos on the go
you'll probably like it too the cameras
built-in Wi-Fi can be used for many
things including uploading direct to
sharing sites or connecting directly to
your smartphone or tablet
and if you have an Android device with
NFC you can just tap and connect once
connected you can shoot and have photos
sent to your device or you can use the
devices or remote control however the
remote feature is very limited with no
real control over settings but hey you
can use the camera as a baby monitor too
so there's that anyway like I said up
top if you're looking for an affordable
compact 21 X zoom to supplement your
smartphone photography this is available
for that I'm Josh Coleman and that's a
look at the Samsung</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
