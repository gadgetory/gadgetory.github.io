warrants I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your cnet update the video service
voodoo was hacked the old-fashioned way
it's hard drives were stolen from the
office after a break-in and the hard
drives contain customer names email and
postal addresses phone numbers birth
dates and the last four digits of some
credit cards voodoo has reset all
passwords and sent out a warning email
to users the company says passwords were
encrypted but if you ever get a
notification about your information
being stolen from a website or service
don't just shrug it off change your
password on any site that also uses the
same sign in information thieves will
use your password and email combo on
dozens of sites to see if it unlocks
access to anything else as Tax Day
approaches here's some comforting news
for my fellow Americans the Internal
Revenue Service doesn't believe it needs
a search warrant before reading your
email internal IRS documents state that
Americans enjoy generally no privacy in
their email facebook chats Twitter
direct messages and similar online
communications so the IRS can just go
after these documents without going to a
judge for a search warrant of course
that goes against what many lawmakers
have argued that your email is protected
by the same Fourth Amendment privacy as
your hard drive or physical letter
that's in your desk a federal appeals
court in 2010 ruled that Americans do
have expectations of privacy in email
and it might make you feel better to
know that email providers like Google
Microsoft Yahoo and Facebook do expect
warrants for email access these IRS
guidelines were in a handbook obtained
by the American Civil Liberties Union
and that group is speaking out against
this guideline asking the IRS to amend
its policies t-mobile will be selling
the iphone on Friday and it's running a
promotion to learn new customers in with
a trade-in program bring in an iPhone 4
or 4s and customers get an iphone 5
without any down payment normally
tmobile charges a hundred dollars to
walk out with the iPhone 5 and then
customers pay off the rest of the phone
in monthly installments if the tradin is
worth more than a hundred bucks t-mobile
could even lower
monthly payments from say twenty dollars
a month to fifteen dollars a month it's
all part of t-mobile's new system where
you don't sign up for a two-year
contract you just have to pay off the
cost of the phone over two years and you
can leave t-mobile any time just as long
as you paid off that phone of course if
you have the time and energy to sell it
on a site like ebay you'll get more
money for a used iphone than you would
with a trade-in program that's your tech
