more than just pretty pictures they're
unveiling the M 200 series rugged drones
for more industrial uses including
search and rescue and powerline
inspections the idea is to provide
better access to remote locations and
reduce the risk to workers it's built on
a similar blueprint as their $3,000
inspired to drone but it's CJ's first to
offer a dual gimbal setup on the front
and an upward facing gimbal on the top
though you can't mount all three cameras
at once to avoid blocking the GPS you'll
have to choose between the top or the
front facing ones the pilot can focus on
flying using the first-person feed from
the built-in camera well someone else
can monitor the visuals from the mounted
cameras with a picture-in-picture
display the cameras are interchangeable
and must be bought separately it also
has two sensors on the front to render
images in 3d for more precise obstacle
avoidance and a built in a DSP receiver
which is an aircraft positioning system
that alerts the pilot of nearby
airplanes or helicopters we weren't able
to see them in trees 200 in action but
DJI envisions uses in areas like
search-and-rescue construction farming
bridge inspection or any other tasks
that can create using the open SDK and
because it's weather resistant it will
get the job done
rain or shine another first for DJI the
company's drones had already been used
in some of these scenarios but never
with this level of customization in both
hardware and software like the inspire
to the M 200 has a dual battery setup
but a longer flight time of about 35
minutes according to DJI there are three
models in the series the M 200 with one
gimble the M 210 with the dual mount or
the top mount and the 210 RTK pictured
here with a more robust navigation
system for centimeter level precision
during flight DJI will be launching the
new line in the second quarter of 2017</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
