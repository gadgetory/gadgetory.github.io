guys are gonna make money this is this
is what i want i will let me ask you for
salt do you know how you're going to
make money uh we don't mean it like that
is the title of the talk right um it's
in parenthesis we can forget about it um
I don't read things in room so here's
the deal instagram has three things that
we need to need to get right the first
is building an audience okay so we have
27 we have 27 million people you know 27
million people is not too shabby but
it's nowhere near the scale you need to
make a massively large business so we're
working on it we add a million users a
week it's fantastic things are going
really well the second is that we want
to create a stage and when I say we want
to create a stage what we want to do is
build a platform where advertisers can
come and you know perform their
advertisements so if you look at our
medium we're all about images and images
are really important to us because
they're the same language that
advertisers tend to speak and display
advertising what we've seen is people
like Burberry banana republic Audi you
name it they're all signing up and
they're using Instagram as a really
clever way to showcase their product and
I think that through that we can do some
really cool stuff now the third part of
this is actually tools which we haven't
gotten to what are the tools that allow
advertisers to use our platform
differently than say a user right now if
an advertiser wants to put something on
like if burberry wants to post a photo
they either need to take it with a
single iPhone or send it to themselves
via email and then crop it out of their
library it's like such a terrible
experience that it's almost amazing that
people are doing it it's amazing that we
see the amount of traction with brands
that we do so those are the three
components and and I think the third is
really where the monetization starts
getting interesting and I'm not going to
say that we're going to know day one
exactly how it takes form but i think
it's about experimentation and not
ignoring it say for like the first five
years of the company i want to make sure
that it's always top of mind because
we're here to build a business
