would I go low you don't need to have
seen any other Marvel movie and to enjoy
Ant Man and the wasp it's a very
self-contained story but you should
probably at least know what happened in
Captain America Civil War it's the movie
that leads directly into where we catch
up with Scott Lang in this film I
haven't seen ant-man before so you don't
really have to know anything going into
this but if you had you'd have never
been caught I think this movie is much
better than the first ant-man and it had
me laughing pretty much straight through
the first 20 minutes it was amazing
ant-man and wasps is a better movie than
the first movie it just is the the
character interactions are better the
humor is funnier the action is better
the story is better the villain is
better all around it's a much better
movie the effects are better the effects
are better than the first movie the
first we had great effects this movie
has better effects I did not see the
first movie
we see Evangeline Lilly playing the wasp
and she's actually in this movie the
first one we see in a suit the first one
we see kicking butt and it is so great
to see on camera she is awesome and she
kicks a ton of ass and it's not just
like oh we have this ass-kicking woman
here but she's integral to the story she
drives the plot in a lot of scenes
she's very heroic in a lot of scenes
she's so goth but also open but also
really brilliant and great kick-butt
superhero I thought Wonder Woman was the
first female lead
hold on you gave her wings and blasters
so there are two post-credit scenes
you'll definitely wanna wait for the
first one it's really good the second
one you don't have to wait for it and
you wait for like 20 minutes
because there are 10,000 special effects
people in the credits so if you're
patient sure you can kind of leave after
the first one the first one is way
important and it actually catches up our
ant-man timeline with where we are
right after infinity war but the second
is much less important so Leo take now
someone to take over the world or
whatever who knows I feel like every
I've seen some other Marvel movies and
every single one seems to start in the
middle of a movie so I don't know I mean
a wasp takes place between Captain
America Civil War and Avengers infinity
war ant-man comes before Avengers
infinity war and I know it seems a
little strange the way that that might
you know have come out in theaters but
if you haven't seen infinity war don't
worry you can still watch ant-man in the
wasp
