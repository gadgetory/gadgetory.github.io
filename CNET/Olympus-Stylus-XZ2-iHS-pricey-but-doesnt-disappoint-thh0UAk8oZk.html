while digital camera technology keeps
moving forward it's not moving so fast
these days that an older camera isn't
worth checking out especially more
advanced models like this the Olympus
Stylus xc2 IHS now the centerpiece of
this camera is its great 4x f-18 2f 2.5
28 to 112 millimeter lens which gives
you more flexibility when shooting in
low-light even with it zoomed in and a
built-in ND filter makes the f-18
aperture more usable in bright
conditions though it can certainly be
used as a fully automatic
point-and-shoot the camera is truly
designed for those who want to have more
of a say in the results that's reflected
in its shooting modes and setting
options and its control layout including
assignable function buttons and the
hybrid control ring around the lens that
can be switched between manual and
digital operation and there's also an
accessory shoe for use with external
flashes or an add-on electronic
viewfinder its photo quality is really
good though its JPEGs are noisy above
ISO 400 from the one over one point 7
inch 12 megapixel BSI CMOS sensor if
you're willing to do a little
post-processing you can get better
results from editing its raw shots
though you can check out the full review
on cnet.com but if you're looking for
something to supplement an SLR this is a
nice choice however with this being a
crowded category you probably should
look for it below its $600 starting
price I'm Josh Goldman and that's a look
at the Olympus Stylus XC 2 IHS</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
