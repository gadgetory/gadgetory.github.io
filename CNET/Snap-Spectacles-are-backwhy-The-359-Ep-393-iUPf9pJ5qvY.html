you're still here
everyone is so excited about no I know
in other news dial-up is back right Wow
in those hits in early so we're gonna be
talking about Facebook's earnings as
well as the continued controversy over
Cambridge analytic a and lastly Ben's
gonna be talking about the final story
in our funny follow the money package
look at the death of cash so as always
if you have any questions living in the
comment section Brian will pick up the
best and we'll get to them in 3 minutes
59 seconds in three two
welcome to the 359 I'm rotor Chang I'm
Ben Fox ribbon I'm Alfred Aang snap
spectacles are inexplicably back snap
announced a second version with faster
uploads water resistance and better
audio quality for video and also tout a
smaller profile but I have to ask why is
there a camera company that's what they
make why wouldn't why wouldn't snap what
these are glass cameras they have
cameras on that camera built-in they
also take photos now which I'm so
confused they couldn't take photos
before there was only video before and
you had to hold it down and you couldn't
like change the amount of time that are
recorded for or anything like that okay
the first spectacles were very bad I
actually own a pair
actually using yes I use them for like
two weeks all right there you go totally
worth it how much were they again they
weren't like I'm good thirty hundred
three hundred fifty now look at these
new ones because they're water-resistant
take it to the beach yeah she's got a
pair kind of like the water resistance
idea but it's just I'm I would have to
see how it affects my phone's battery
life because that was like the biggest
reason why I stopped using it it was
like killing my phone battery yeah all
right so next up Facebook is facing its
biggest crisis ever but you couldn't
really tell from there the recent
quarterly earnings revenue was about 50%
and profits were up as the quarter of
the company just got better and using
data to create targeted ad so I guess I
mean the it's scandal proof essentially
maybe it still Cambridge analytic is
still a fairly new phenomenon for the
company so maybe it didn't hit this
particular quarter the social network
had 2.2 billion monthly active monthly
users in the quarter which is up 13
percent from the year before right
that's the number to really pay
attention to to see if people are
migrating away from really you think
we'll see a drop-off in the next quarter
report that would probably be more
likely if there is a drop-off at all
right I I would argue those it probably
won't be yeah with all that also talked
about you know hashtag to leave Facebook
people really haven't jumped on board
actually getting rid of those accounts
yes I can break even noted that it
wasn't like a major impact to like how
many people are using Facebook yeah it's
also a huge huge pool of users and so
how many people would have to delete
facebook to try to not just stop the
growth from happening but actually get
the number to go down yeah I don't know
if you tell the controversy isn't over
Zuckerberg is maybe heading to the
European Parliament for another round of
grilling and the UK today called it a
morality free zone so yeah
lastly Ben you've got the final story in
the funding fall of the money package I
did it the death of cash tell us about
it is it dead can I stop using my cash I
just give it away to me how much do you
use cash now though that's the thing I'm
actually I've not completely stopped
using cash but I tend to not
my wallet right most people tend to have
I would say like an emergency 20 or 50
dollars in their wallet
well feather roughly high-roller there
are only about 5% of Americans that
don't have any cash at all in their
wallet so if you're one of those people
with a very small minority I mean I it
varies but sometimes that they'll go
like a week or two without any cash my
wallet and like I will actively choose
places where they take credit cards or
debit cards yeah I try to live cashless
but I can't do it in my own neighborhood
like if it were around this office I'd
be able to do it yeah like in my
neighborhood it's like they're all very
old-school there and it's like most of
them are like cash only there right and
that's a major hurdle to actually doing
cashless a lot of the boosters that
argue for cashless say that it's more
secure there's less fraud you're less
likely to you know lose your money if I
just you know kind of somebody takes 20
bucks off of you don't know where it
went
so oh the flip side is hackers hackers
wallet baby yeah they can they can hack
your wallet yeah especially a Bitcoin
wallet that's definitely true so alright
that's all the time we've got for more
of these stories chicks I've seen it I'm
Roger Chang I'm Ben Fox Ruben I'm alfred
hang thanks for listening and thanks for
joining along for the recording of the
regular audio podcast that is now being
scats soloed by Ben Fox Ruben go ahead
little sis bye over there a little bit
sound exactly the same so I'm gonna go
ahead and jump into the chat and start
taking out some questions and comments
so we can keep the conversation going
right out the gate from DC one four
seven it is Thursday my dude
can I pay with my face using snapchat
spectacles by just head-butting the
contactless terminal yes yeah yeah
that's actually why money is dead now
your brain says you like smash if the it
only works if the spectacles break
though so you have to break the
spectacles and then buy a new pair for
every single way to go snapchat I'm just
really confused by the whole spectacles
thing because it had to book a 40
million dollar loss in November because
it had
so many unsold spectacles so they're
doubling down on the strategy yes some
of the these new spectacles were made
with the parts of the unknown ones
I mean unsold one really yeah yeah so
you know they were selling stock back
from the dead Franken glasses but I mean
I don't know like it's clear that they
want like their hardware to be like a
major selling point for them right they
are trying it is cool I get that they're
China they're trying to be a camera
company that they're trying to hardware
they're trying to be cool but like I
don't know it hasn't really caught on
like I still see actually I see fewer of
them now but those the the snap whatever
yellow vending machines right may be the
reason why they're like going so gung-ho
about this is like try to copy that
Facebook and Instagram can't copy
sunglasses book could do I mean they
have the money to copy be a failing
business but about why bother they can
just be a fast followed word to snapchat
successful businesses as opposed to
catching up on something doesn't really
maybe map is just like the incubator for
all the future business models a
Facebook maybe it's like a heart
maybe it's a honeypot and they want
Facebook the copy you have way more to
lose than we do so looking at this I I
want to ask a broader question this was
back more than a year ago snapchats or
snap incorporated stock was at around
$27 now it's below 15 yeah what could
help this company like I I feel like
after the IPO everybody like the the
Polish came off a lot of people actually
do use it like everyone like goes off
about you know oh in Instagram stories
like the thing that everybody uses but
like that's the thing that like
influencers and like you know media
companies are using like but part of the
problem there is investors aren't
necessarily looking at that they're
looking at yeah daily active users
nothing active users and those numbers
have not been that great and the whole
this whole we're gonna do a whole reboot
thing the reboot thing didn't really
work out so well I think there's there's
just a lot of questions about the
direction yeah I would say that the only
place where snapchat really wins on is
like demographic yes like they they
actually have like a lot of young users
as opposed
so like Instagram stories is like very
popular right now and I've like even
started using that instead of like
snapchat anymore I definitely use it
it's just yeah it's more convenient but
it's one of those things where I don't
know I feel like it'll end up like
Facebook where it's like just old people
on it maybe Instagram is already where
old people are yeah they're like the
cool people maybe I don't know I don't
think I'm a cool person that's me right
yeah cool whatever more questions from
sir enjoy why can't snap make the
spectacles look a little more subtle
they look so cartoonish I agree with ya
the Ridgid had a rigid had a great tweet
on it where like so the little glass
like cameras on the sides they look like
like their eyeballs and they're like
looking on the side like cross-eyed like
that are there two cameras on yes what
why - why just one both sides or
something all right Devin yeah so they
look like eyeballs yes for symmetry
purpose oh that's the new ones yeah I am
disappointed though that the new one
wasn't just like a monocle like snap
monocle yo like that seriously hipster I
would wear that I know because you're a
hipster so too
string choice question though I think
they very intentionally made the design
look like this because they don't want
to make them look like regular glasses
yes so this is a marketing ploy they
want people to recognize them as
snapchat beyond beyond that I mean it
there are physical limitations to
putting a camera to glasses you can't
make them look like regular slimmer
profile glasses because you still have
the hardware that night I think they
wanted the cameras to be obvious yeah
yeah like when like Google glass had
there and it was just like yeah sure
that's exactly what dcv 1 4 7 is saying
in the chat right now you don't want to
have the hidden glass yeah and get
called out yeah that's true creep that's
good it's definitely a creep move so
let's talk about some alternatives for
snapchat and if they really do want to
embrace being a camera company
Josh Boyd says a snap made a cheap GoPro
like camera I would buy that
where would we like to see a snap camera
implemented besides stupid looking
glasses a friend of mine actually use
the glass
as like a GoPro like camera like he
would just put her on like the dashboard
of his car or something like that
impress it if you want it's what it
locked into doing a snap story yeah so
it's short video shorts well yeah I
think that's how I like it manages to
like last throughout the whole day like
it's not recording video like constantly
it's not like battery life on the camera
on the glasses itself isn't that great
yeah well it would function more like a
real camera but like you you're not able
to upload like long extended footage on
snapchat if you look at a GoPro right
saying don't lock it to snapchat I mean
no but GoPro is like those cameras you
know have some heft to it because
there's there's camera there's bad
storage storage so that's a little bit
tough integrate that into a wearable is
that's a little bit tricky like we and
we've seen someone saying no like here
not necessarily a wearable though he
says if they made like they're only
GoPro if snap decided to actually start
manufacturing more legitimate camera
type products yeah he might be like
they're so snap is so tied into its
system that it would be tough to see
them do it GoPro is struggled it's a
downfall of every company that came
before them AOL I don't know who on and
on I know that in like 2017 like around
last May like snap acquired like a drone
company which maybe they were trying to
do like you know selfie drones yeah sup
so there you go talk about a unitasker
maybe you have to put the glasses on the
drone and then it or that data meant to
so how are we going to actually get
these new snappa they're gonna do the
kiosks again no you can order them
online Oh
so they actually made it a pleasant
experience god forbid oh come on they
guide so much attention yeah it was a
good mark the attention of being jerks
yeah it's true bye you know how the tech
world works where excuse really
important attention to big jerks that's
like very in line with Chad's reputation
how would you fake it through yeah I
could see it anyway alright let's move
on into Facebook from imagine soggy the
impact in Facebook's revenue will be in
advertisers not using the platform
because of reduced profitability
excellent
point will people on Facebook stop
clicking on ads is the real question and
as a follow-up
let's see where Facebook revenue is one
year from now it says that's a fantastic
point because also points yeah points
yeah ultimately yeah Facebook makes its
money from advertising my the only
quibble to that is Facebook it's gotten
really really good at using our data to
create really specific ads and there's
very few places that are I mean Google's
probably the other you know the only
other option there are few places for
advertisers to get that kind of super
specific targeting so I don't know how
much it's really gonna hurt its bottom
line I just don't have other
alternatives so during the testimony
Zuckerberg like mentioned to one of the
senators basically you know people
actually like getting ads that are
targeted toward them as course like
irrelevant ads and so I've started like
since I started like my new Facebook
page that I've liked nothing on and like
comment and I'm not it's so weird it's
like so they have no profile to target
me based off of and it's just like hey
here's some like Dragon Ball Z thing I
don't know why why is this on yeah it
was really weird I don't get it I don't
know why I'm getting don't you like you
like try to buy like so new already it's
not that weird they know you better than
you know you're like what weather stuff
I'm getting them sandals I mean I said
it'll be cool
I've said it before trying to sell me
something I don't mind being sold stuff
that I would like but I mean I remember
for a minute there in the earlier stages
of Hulu I was getting ads for like
depends under gold I'm like yeah
definitely early stage of Hulu they
didn't have targeted yeah I think
Facebook's really good at that now I
it's usually stuff the ads that pop up
now stuff that you kind of care about
them but the one I hate tell them are
that I don't know what the algorithm is
but it's just regurgitate stuff that's
already in your amazon shopping looks
like I know they're suggesting when I
joined Magic the Gathering sick deals
deals yeah i mean ii never played Magic
the Gathering
never play again miss Theriot typing
type I think they just do like hey your
friends like this maybe you'll like it -
I don't know that - yeah oh yeah
more questions more on Facebook from
APEC for the people who grew up in the
social world type media I think this
one's that you Alfred who posts
everything online and don't care do you
really think they'll delete their
accounts and stop using now we've talked
about this before yeah yeah yeah have
you seen my Instagram there's like
nothing on it and like my new Facebook
page that has nothing on it yeah it's
not hard to like delete your account
like my my thing has always been like
you don't have to delete your whole
account just like start fresh like you
can add all your old friends again but
like now that you have this knowledge
that oh you know they are using all my
data for this thing like just don't do
anything on it except like the very
minimal thing that you need to do I've
act on this new profile I've actually
rejected people now we're like dude I
sent them a message after I was like hey
look there's nothing personal but like I
don't like I don't need to talk to you
dude and I know your preferences and
your preference is a terrible that's
extremely personal friend I got a friend
request from a dude that I haven't
spoken with since like high school and
was just like why that's how Facebook is
why man like we have him sometimes none
of us welcome old friends back into the
okay but like I had this fate the old
Facebook page for years and he never hit
me up on that so I was like there's
literally maybe onion but it didn't
surface for him maybe a surface now at
the recommendation yes I mean maybe he
just joined I don't know no no it's just
a friends with it doesn't matter what it
seems like this is more of a personal
Garage thing now we've gone from like
Facebook best practices to I'm just I
can't just walk it my point look Alfred
what's out the best practice is just
delete your account and then make a new
one so like you can still keep in
contact with your friends but you don't
have to like quit cold-turkey
yeah I guess so I wouldn't know that
seems like a lot early yeah that's the
thing it's a lot of work especially if
you yeah I've got like a thousand people
in my network how many of them do you
regularly talk to you
then add make a new face we're gonna
only add those five people that's kind
of that's a good point you're right
about that
I like syringe eyes idea to just start
going to chaotically weird dark web
places or like my garden you should see
Bridget's Bridget with all the research
she has to do takes her out of her you
know typical comfort zone a lot sure so
her cookies must just be a cesspool and
her Facebook ads are all over the place
sark hacker yeah yeah so there's
actually a Chrome extension that will
actually do that for you it's like take
you to the darknet it's basically like
no it'll like it's a script that like
poisons like your facebook data so that
like it's just like a bunch of random
stuff that they get it makes like random
posts with just a bunch of gibberish so
they have no idea how do I like target
to you that's another thing you can do
that there you go that seems easier I
would like to say that I have
successfully severely downsized my
facebook interaction over the past three
weeks I have posted two things one was
to commemorate the loss of one of my
heroes Carl Kessel who I met a few years
ago so rest in peace sir and then
yesterday I met Henry Winkler so I
couldn't help but yeah so jealous Barry
zuckerkorn he's very good yeah so I
couldn't help but brag just another note
about the like the you know people that
grew up in social media generation that
post everything and don't care yeah
they're doing it on snapchat where it
deletes itself so it really doesn't
matter and they don't track it anyway
that's why there's no like massive log
of it like online that's like people are
fuckin stay there's a younger portion of
yeah snapchat has if anything I'm much
more concerned about like the younger
demographic that's like everyone that
wants to be like YouTube stars and like
that lasts like them that's their like
people and they're not gonna delete that
because it's one of those things like I
want to be a star so I want to like yeah
I want it out there mmm all right and
our few remaining minutes Victor wants
us to come back and talk about cash
again and I think this is a good thing
to talk about because it's one of those
things we've seen come in a long time
and it's still kind of a long way off
but he wants to know how long until we
think we are just paying with our phone
SmartWatch etc oh I don't think it's our
gonna 100% go away like us like maybe
like 20-30 years like the whole world
society yeah that's never gonna happen
yeah no no I think it'll definitely
happen at some point but it's really far
off like physical cash like actual yeah
like that's it's been predicted for more
than 20 years
yeah the cash will die there's obviously
well from the story that we were out
today there's there are more reasons why
there would be a tipping point nowadays
but it's true especially in the
developing world it's much more cash
societies that know what would actually
developing world their mobile payments
are they are taking off they are taking
off but it's it's starting at a lower
level yeah so that you know places like
Kenya it's much generational perspective
there they are already way more
comfortable with it than we are that is
absolutely true but again it's it's
starting from a lower level than you
have in the United States or other
developed yeah part of that issues yeah
there's different different technologies
like what they're used to doing we're
not doing and the technology they're
using is a lot more rudimentary versus
ours yeah yeah yeah the other thing to
really think about too is like what does
cash do it's kind of like thinking about
like a book versus an e-book or a tablet
what does cash actually offer you that
the other stuff literally can't do it's
there it's physical it's time test you
can buy drugs with it you could buy
drugs with it completely anonymously
which is a big reason why people would
want to be using you could do that
potentially with Bitcoin is probably
easy yeah but there's like a log of that
there's like if they if they know that
it's your wallet than like it's pretty
obvious that it's you but yeah like also
certain things I mean what if you do
natural disaster most people defer back
to cash just like you remember with
hurricane sandy people started you
because the phone networks a lot of the
phone like cell phone networks were down
they started using like the actual like
phones on the street right pay phones
the pay phones thank you the street
phones now what if you make the venmo
transaction and in in the note in the
subject note you just put not drugs does
that cover your yeah exactly yes
good at Columbia University actually got
busted over that Oh like they said no
but like he was a drug dealer at like
the campus and his whole log was like
that's like what cops used against him
in the case it's like been Molag yeah
that was real Internet stacks for
mary-jane he asked them to like make a
code off of it earlier but he's like
clearly very easy to like bust yeah all
right don't do stuff on November
basically but I mean look cash there are
some disadvantages of cash right like in
terms of moving money around be who save
money it's really difficult if you don't
have like a certain level of income
right because like opening a savings
account on a bank it's really tough yeah
I think if you can't get a bank account
you can't save money and so have like
having access to these kinds of tools
especially as they go digital you're you
know you're able to save manage manage
your money
save your money access more financial
tools yeah I talked to a start-up CEO
and Barbados they're developing a whole
retail network where you can take the
Barbados dollar and turn it digital and
access it from an app and that just the
convenience of being able to do that it
was actually really interesting because
like it's something that I don't live in
my normal life at all where people have
to go directly to utility company to pay
their bills in cash yeah you could just
pay the utility bill through the app
that just makes your life I mean you
will still go to cell phone stores now
to pay their bills right yeah up until
weird
yeah no true they don't have accounts
set up right like it's there's no
electronic transfer because they don't
have the income for it they literally
have to go in and pay by cash or pay by
cheque there are still some merits to
paper transactions ill beats points out
like leaving a tip it's nice to do yeah
either because you don't have to claim
it on your taxes right or at least most
people don't even know you kind of
technically are supposed to but you're
supposed to yeah there's a whole light
you don't grey economy to where like
people get paid under the table that's
mostly in cash exactly there are a lot
of reasons why cash would continue to be
continue to exist crypto currencies
obviously provides certain levels of
that with the anonymity
that's also being challenged by a lot of
regulators these days - is agreeing with
what we were talking about yesterday a
little bit and the the splintering of
the mobile payments and how there should
be a better assistant standard yeah I
mean good luck with that
oh yeah that's that's the big issue I
think Brigitte had a really great video
breaking that down individual companies
and individual parties have their own
vested interest in keeping things
fragmented but that's not good for
anyone
yeah and using Google pay on my samsung
s8 isn't that much fun because the
fingerprint sensor is in like a really
weird place oh yeah I have to try it
like three different times I'll try it
yeah like it doesn't it doesn't require
an NFC terminal that's a problem with
Android is that like there's five
different options every Samsung pay
Google page when I was when I was an
Apple users just Apple pay now you're
like why don't you try some check paying
but I don't know it's only two I mean
that's so much yeah try try setting up
your messaging services they gave me
like fifteen options for messaging
services hello you should make a low
your primary that's where all my friends
are beats also mentioned it kind of
sucks getting stuck behind the stumbling
fool present company included that was
yes pay with mobile payments at Robert
can I just point out have you ever been
stuck behind the grandma with the
checkbook at the grocery store 25 cent
penny gum I do remember Bryan Ben and I
we did this little experiment of a
couple years ago just sort of testing
how the Mobile Payment experiment
experience would be we like walked
around the cities we used we couldn't
there were a lot of places we couldn't
use it obviously other places were
worked but the worst scenario was like
we were in a cab and it was time to pay
and like it was supposed to take back
then it was called Google they rebranded
news anyways so the we had like an HTC
phone we're holy at the sensor and like
we were just keep kept fiddling around
with it cuz it would register like the
cabbie was getting pissed at us we
stopped at this intersection we're just
really
and if father registered but it took us
like five minutes it was like
excruciating a long time to like get it
to work
so the technology is not ready is what
your said that was but this was several
years ago I mean things have gotten a
lot better
those contactless payment connections do
seem to line up a little bit easier now
kind of hard to believe that that's but
it was already that long like it's been
around that long and it doesn't feel it
feels still fairly new because even
though it's been around for several
years it was still kind of a niche thing
until Apple brought to the mainstream
yeah it's still neat
it's totally there so only people are
aware of it like before when Google had
it just people it was around but people
