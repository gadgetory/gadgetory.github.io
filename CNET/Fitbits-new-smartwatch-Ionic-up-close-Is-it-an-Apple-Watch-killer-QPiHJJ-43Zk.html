a SmartWatch and the ionic could maybe
give the Apple watch a run for its
feature set it's a clear attempt to
compete at the top end with a lot of
features
it looks like last year's blaze but it's
sleeker and it also adds a lot of good
function like 50 meter swim water
resistance contactless payments which
work a bit like Apple pay or Android pay
and onboard music your own music library
needs to be transferred via computer but
there's also support for Pandora's
premium service on watch for offline
playlists when you run music playback
happens over Bluetooth Fitbit even has
its own set of fitness headphones the
flyer that promised faster Auto pairing
between the ionic watch and a phone the
design looks sharp it's got a brighter
thousand nits display and the all metal
body and swappable bands ranging from
perforated sport ones to leather designs
feel similar to what fitbit's other
charge and Alta accessories look like
Fitbit promises four-day battery life
for everyday use including a daily run
the ionic also has apps much like pebble
the company that Fitbit acquired there's
going to be a future watch face and app
store promising all sorts of ideas
including games down the road right now
there are only four baked in apps
Starbucks Strava Pandora and AccuWeather
the ionic also has timers a stopwatch
baked in workouts which happened via
fitstar and support for more onboard
coaching down the road including audio
coach way that's going to be available
in 2018 Fitbit also claims the heart
rate tracking technology on the ionic
can track other conditions including
sleep apnea although that won't be
available right now
the ionic promises to be the most
complete fitness watch fitbit's ever
made but it also costs $300 when a
debuts in October will it be worth it we
won't be able to answer that until a
full review but this looks like the most
complete package it feels a lot better
to wear than the blaze and it does a lot
more to
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
