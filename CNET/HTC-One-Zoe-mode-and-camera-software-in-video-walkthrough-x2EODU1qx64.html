World Congress 2013 in Barcelona where
HTC stands taking a look at the HTC One
specifically some of the camera software
that you get with this phone
now this mobile is absolutely bursting
with filters and editing tricks so let's
see exactly what you get
so the HTC one's camera software is
split into two modes there's normal
shooting mode and something called Zowie
mode we're going to talk about both but
first let's just go over what the normal
features are so down here in the bottom
if you want to take pictures you get
loads of filters which you can apply as
you go I really like this it makes it
very very easy to get some quite crazy
looking shots if you tap up here in the
corner you can see loads more settings
there's a night mode and an HDR mode if
you put these modes on then you won't be
able to apply those scenes you just saw
so that's something to bear in mind as
you can see you get video options as
well including the ability to record in
slow motion so that looks particularly
good maybe if you're shooting sports or
or moving animals something quite
exciting you also get HDR video so if
you're trying to capture something
really colorful that could come in handy
and as you can see there are loads and
loads and loads of other regular camera
features you can adjust the ISO in the
white balance that the size of the
pictures you take that kind of thing
once you've taken a picture you're going
to want to edit it and happily there are
absolutely loads of things you can do to
your pictures so you can apply even more
effects like this which you'll
definitely make anyone who's into
Instagram happy you can also flip them
like this which is a feature that I
haven't seen before that look that's
quite unusual I like that and if you're
editing video you can trim that as well
you also get retouch options is be
pretty good if you're taking close-up
portrait photos I think you can change
the contours of people's face and
there's things like an eye enhancer and
a skin smoothing effect okay so that's a
brief overview of normal mode what about
Zoe mode so you tap this icon up here
which turns this little camera icon blue
and that indicates that you've gone in
- Zoe mode now what Zoe mode does is it
means that when you press the shutter it
actually captures three seconds of video
specifically three seconds with twenty
images you can see along the bottom this
camera fills up red and there you go and
then it's taken once you've taken a
picture in Zoe mode you can use this
slider along the bottom to go frame by
frame and find exactly the one you want
I quite like this one so then I just
press up in the corner here and go save
frame Zoe mode uses the cameras memory
to actually start recording video before
you press the shutter if you have a look
on the timeline here this small white
mark indicates the point where you
actually press the button and you can
see you can scroll to before that point
it's very cool so because Zoe mode has
this reserve of 20 images stored up in
one short video there's quite a lot you
can do with that if you go to edit and
use the retouch menu here unlike when
you're editing normal photos you get
some extra options so one of the coolest
ones is sequence shots so if I press
this just gonna have to spin the phone
around sorry what this does is it lets
you choose from five frames that show
the actual photo and you can choose to
pick individual bits from from the Zoe
video and merge them into one clip so
here's the guys swinging on a bar and
I've chosen the three frames that show
him actually swinging so you can get
some really cool action scenes again if
you're into sports this is something I
think you'll like another feature is
called always smile so again if I tap
retouch press always smile here it will
identify faces in your group Zoe photo
and then you can tap on each one and
slide along so you can find the point to
which everyone's grinning I've only been
able to try this using HTC's very very
velocity high value demo shot so we
don't really know how well this will
work in a real-world situation you'll
have to wait for the full review one
more Zoe feature is object removal so
the idea with this one is that if
someone has walked into your Zoe shot or
if there's something in the picture that
you don't want to be there you can
strike it from the record here
see there are these two people walking
in the background and the software
automatically identifies things it
thinks you might not want in the frame
and you can just tap them to remove them
I tried using this on an on HTC photo
just the things I was shooting at the
stand and it was quite dark condition so
it wasn't perfect but it certainly
didn't work quite as well as this so
expect mixed results
so loads of options for taking videos
but to be honest my favorite thing about
the HTC one's camera software is one
that takes all of the editing effort out
of the process if you go into the
gallery then things are sorted by events
and the phone will automatically mash up
your photos and videos into a 32 second
clip it can do this based on location so
for example if you go out to the zoo
take loads of photos and video then when
you get home they'll all be grouped
together and you can quickly press one
button and they're all being mashed into
this video if you don't like the way it
looks there's a shuffle button down here
and that will randomly basically throw
everything into the mix again and spit
out a completely different video
impressively there are some cool filters
here as well so again for the Instagram
crowd if you want something to quickly
put on Facebook that's going to look
quite trendy this will absolutely have
you covered so absolutely loads you can
do with this phone my only concern at
the moment really is that there are so
many features it can feel a little bit
overwhelming I'm the Westway casino and
this is the HTC One</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
