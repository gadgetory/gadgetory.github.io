standing beside at $800 top freezer from
GE model number GTE 1/8 GM h es now the
interesting thing here at first glance
is the slate finish this kind of gray
build that isn't quite stainless steel
isn't white or black it's in between
this would blend in with a lot of
different decors so I like that about
this fridge I also like these handles
nice and sturdy stainless steel gives it
a premium feel as you open and close it
and if you take a look inside you'll
find two subtle things that separate
this fridge from cheaper top freezer
models that GE offers the first is the
shelving you've got glass spill proof
shelving there it's a nice slightly
higher-end approach than the wire racks
that you'll get with the bottom of the
barrel models second you get humidity
controls down on the crisper bins you
don't get that with the cheaper top
freezer models the GE sells now all in
all it came away pretty impressed with
this refrigerators performance the
cooling ability is a little up and down
it's gonna have some temperature
fluctuations and that's common for a low
end fridge but it did average out right
where we wanted it take a look at this
heat map this shows the average
temperatures across different regions of
the interior of the fridge and in the
door in the freezer and you can see
those fridge attempts are all nice and
consistent and even in the doors you're
not getting any weird hot spots so
overall the performance is pretty good
here I was also happy with the capacity
that I got out of this fridge it's only
28 inches wide it's kind of intended for
smaller kitchens maybe an apartment but
you still get a good deal of space
inside of it we were able to fit our
entire test load of groceries into the
fridge and still have room left over for
a party platter a large pitcher almost
were able to fit an extra-large pizza
though the fridge wouldn't quite close
not quite deep enough the bottom line is
that it's kind of tough to find a fridge
for less than $1000 that doesn't look
like a cheap piece of tin this one gets
the job done and the performance is on
point so for $800 I think you can do a
lot worse thanks for watching check out
the rest of our reviews at cnet.com
along with the full review of this guy
for CNET appliances I'm right Chris
