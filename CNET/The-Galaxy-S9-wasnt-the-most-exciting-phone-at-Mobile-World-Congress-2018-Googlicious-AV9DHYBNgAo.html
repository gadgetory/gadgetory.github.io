Google issues for everything Google you
can think of and with so much stuff
rolling out of Mobile World Congress
2018 from Barcelona Spain now we told
you everything you could expect from the
Samsung Galaxy S 9 last week so you know
we're not gonna do a review the s9 is
going to be a nice incremental upgrade
for a long time Samsung users nothing
really groundbreaking here and if you
have an s8 you're probably still good to
go with your s8 unless you got to have
the latest thing now the biggest change
here is the camera its dual sensors on
the s9 plus and it's variable aperture
the layout of the fingerprint sensor
below the lens is a big improvement as
well it's subtle but you know what it
makes a difference now during the
keynote I was more disappointed they
didn't really show a real heads up
comparison to feature the difference in
the results of their new camera versus
competition like the pixel 2 or iPhone
10 something they've done before so
maybe it didn't work in their favor and
slo-mo is cool but we didn't need a 5
minute demo of that also if you're gonna
make digs at the competition you've got
to do better than this and as always you
know there's no knotch
come on some at least have your
employees do like fake reactions or clap
real loud like Apple does it was weak
now a are emojis and these are creepy
and kind of cool at the same time like
bitmoji is on steroids but maybe not in
a good way but I still wouldn't use them
now the s9 and s 9 plus will be released
on March 16th pre-orders open March the
2nd with pricing for the s9 starting at
seven hundred and twenty dollars and the
s9 + at 840 it's going to be different
depending on the carrier you go to and
there's trade-in value with your older
phone that can help out as well but the
Samsung Galaxy S 9 wasn't the best phone
showing off at Mobile World Congress
that title easily goes to the vivo apex
concept with innovation that come on
will blow your mind yes it's a concept
but you want a true bezel this phone
it's right here that just makes you want
to dive in the media content but we're -
the front-facing camera go guess what
switch the camera to selfie mode and it
slides up from the top of the phone it
looks cool
could it break possibly but you're also
a true bezel this phone now there's no
room for speakers so the OLED display
itself vibrates to produce sound for
phone calls music and is loud enough on
speaker mode we've seen this tech on TVs
already and if you weren't familiar with
vivo before they're the company behind
the first in screen fingerprint scanner
and the vivo apex concept takes that up
a notch to support up to two finger
prints now there's a dual camera on the
rear side but no specs have been
actually confirmed for this phone
there's no timetable when we'll actually
see this in yet it's easier to show off
stuff like this when it's a concept but
damn that's the coolest thing I saw a
Mobile World Congress alright
other phones at MWC Sony announced its
new flagship phones the XZ 2 and the XZ
2 compact with a curved design on the
rear an HD plus HDR screen with an 18 by
9 resolution and screen sizes of 5.7
inches and 5 inches for the compact now
there are front-facing speakers but the
larger XZ 2 creates synchronized sound
vibrations that allow you to feel the
sound through the phone while you're
watching it you'll get a snapdragon 845
four gigs of ram and a single 19
megapixel camera with 4k HDR video and
960 frames per second slo-mo that
captures that 1080p besting the 720p of
the galaxy s 9s and we won't forget
about LG and their LG v 30s that gets
updated with new AI features that we've
talked about now there's not much new
here not even an updated snapdragon 845
and really I'm only mentioning it to be
nice like a solid phone don't get me
wrong but we'll just wait for something
new in 2019 alright let's jump into
what's happening in the Google world the
Google clips companion app has arrived
on the Play Store ahead of its launch
this week on February the 27th it's
their 12 megapixel always on camera that
uses AI to capture pictures and videos
from candid moments and then saves them
now it's probably best for people with
children or pets that can't get enough
of themselves and feel the need to post
more of them to annoy their friends and
family on social media we know who those
people are now I still don't see the
general consumer getting on board with
this especially for 249 yeah 2 for 9
I'll write the pixel 2 and 2 XL are
getting an update to the pic
so visual core service that will bring
more efficient hdr+ processing and other
machine learning tests that you can get
right now
it improves what's already the best
camera on a phone right now until we see
how it matches up with the new phones
from MWC it also reveals Google's first
custom system on the chip is codenamed
ezel see that's cute
now seven new languages have been added
for developers to build actions for the
Google assistant Hindi Thai Indonesian
Danish Norwegian Swedish and Dutch
they've also added changes to make
google actions faster for regular app
users so you don't have to deal with
these longer introductory prompts and
over the weekend Google released a our
core 1.0 to the public opening up to
over 100 million Android devices now if
you played the Google's a are stickers
developers will now be able to put their
own creations into the Play Store for
you to use it will also allow them to
work to create new AR experiences of
their own on Android phones and finally
Google lens will also be officially
rolling out in the next few weeks and
will be made available on the Google
Photos app for iOS and Android now this
is a feature that allows you to search
what you've captured through the camera
it identifies what you're looking at and
offers suggestions the Google assistant
will also get google lens capability for
english-speaking users if they are using
a compatible phone as well whew alright
that's it for this week you can email me
at Google issues at sea Netcom or to me
at Brian Tom thanks so much for watching
we'll see you next time for some more of
that Google issues</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
