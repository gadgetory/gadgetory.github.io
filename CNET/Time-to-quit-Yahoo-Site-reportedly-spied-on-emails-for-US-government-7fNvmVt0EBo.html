Yahoo reportedly has been spying on its
users emails and even wrote a special
program for the US government to scan
through messages that alarming report
comes from Reuters citing four people
aware of the email scanning program the
report says yahoo built this spy
software last year and it was designed
to search all incoming emails for
specific information at the request of
the National Security Agency or the FBI
if this is true this would be the first
time an Internet company agreed to such
a request from an intelligence agency by
building a program to scan all incoming
mail in real time as opposed to just
looking at stored messages or scanning
select accounts Yahoo is not confirming
or denying the report only saying that
it complies with the law Reuters reports
that when Yahoo chief executive Marissa
Meyer chose to obey the request instead
of fighting it her chief information
security officer quit the company of
course this is in contrast to Apple's
fight with FBI earlier this year when it
refused a request to create a program to
break into an encrypted iPhone so why
didn't ya who fight back well back in
2007 yahoo did fight back against the
government's requests and lost reuters
reported that yahoo thought it would
lose again and it wasn't worth the fight
representatives from google facebook
twitter and apple all said they never
received such a request from US
intelligence and if they did they would
fight it microsoft also said it never
scanned emails in this manner a problem
is that these government requests have
gag orders prohibiting the companies
involved from revealing to the public
that they got the request so if this
Reuters report is accurate it is likely
that the government did ask other tech
companies to scan user messages Yahoo is
still recovering from the world's
largest data breach losing info on half
a billion yahoo users it happened in
2014 but it was just revealed this month
and between the hack and this unsettling
surveillance news hard to imagine
verizon still wants to buy Yahoo with
all that baggage and hard to imagine how
anyone can still trust Yahoo with their
privacy
sit for this tech news update I'm
