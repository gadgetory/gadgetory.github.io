appliances and we are taking an up-close
look at the zojirushi fresh brew plus
thermal carafe coffeemaker for one
hundred and ninety dollars this coffee
machine certainly is on the expensive
side but it does have a few pluses that
definitely our selling points first off
you notice that it has a very big water
tank right here what I like about it is
that it is removable so you can just
pull the whole thing up take it off you
know hold it underneath your kitchen
sink and your tap and just fill it up
right there or you could just set it on
your kitchen countertop and fill it by a
pitcher and take it put it back into the
machine no fuss no muss it's pretty easy
to do the other really cool thing is
that it has a large thermal carafe this
carafe actually will keep its coffee hot
for well over half a day I'm talking
about 13 or more hours at a hundred and
fifty degrees which is a pretty piping
hot cup of coffee
zojirushi definitely makes some big
claims about this coffee machine it's
part of its gourmet line of cooking
products and they also say that it
reaches the ideal temperature of 200
degrees Fahrenheit which enables a very
flavorful brew a very nice and rich cup
of coffee the only problem is it takes a
very long time to actually brew which
means that the coffee is over extracted
and a little bitter for my taste and
that's something you definitely don't
want in a coffee machine that cost this
much those O's Arushi fresh brew is
definitely a decent coffee machine I
just wish it wasn't as expensive if I
could have gotten this thing for $70
that would maybe convince me to make the
purchase but at $190 it's just extremely
expensive you can buy something from
Bonavita such as the VV 1900 TS that
essentially bruised extremely delicious
coffee for the same price that's
something I would suggest you do it
ultimately is just more enjoyable to use
for more check out my review of this
coffee machine as well as other coffee
makers at cnet.com I'm Brian Bennett for
