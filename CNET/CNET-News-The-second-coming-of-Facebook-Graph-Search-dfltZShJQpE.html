joined by tom stocky the product manager
for graph search at Facebook and Lars
Rasmussen who runs the engineering group
at the team welcome yeah thanks for
having us so grab search launched
yesterday and it's an early beta version
of the product it's going to be in beta
for months what are the next steps to
really make it robust and roll it out to
more people well so look the first thing
we need to do is get a lot of feedback
from you guys who know can use it and
the people we're rolling out we're
rolling out pretty slowly we have only a
few thousand people in there now as the
feedback comes in will be spending a lot
of time responding to that and just
making it better and better but there
are a few major pieces that we know are
missing you can search for people for
photos for places for interests but we
can't yet search over poster the stories
the status updates people have made we
don't have a mobile version yet and it's
only available in English and so those
are the three main things that we're
going to be working on going forward and
when when Mark Zuckerberg was talking
about the product he was saying would
take years and years to make this
product whole what does it look like at
the end of those years hmm that's a
really hard thing to predict I mean
it'sit's we have some idea of where we
want to go and Mike Mars mention there's
a few things we know we want to work on
but to be honest like the thing that's
going to be most interesting to us is to
see how people use it to see what they
complain about it to see what it they
want it to do that it must have a road
map that says you know beyond doing
posts and beyond doing languages and and
also as well as the open graph so that
you can bring all the data from those
applications into play it seems to me
that that one of the features that
missing is yes I can ask my friends
about what restaurants they like in New
York City but can they tell me more
about that restaurant such as show me
the menu or can I make a reservation
through facebook services yeah I think I
mean that's definitely part of it I
think at a high level where we want this
to end up is everything you can see on
facebook we want you to be able to
search for that so to make everything
searchable and like you were saying I
mean there's a lot of stuff that isn't
there about restaurants and places and
other pages and maybe now those those
guys have a reason to fill that stuff
out
Lars on a technical side what are the
big challenge you're facing they say
that there's 240 billion photos at
trillion connections a billion users how
do you take all that massive data and
turn it into something that a natural
language query can deliver a straight
answer on it's a very good question so
there's there's two main pieces to the
technology there is a pset understands
the the natural language that people
type in we actually we think of what
people type in as the title of the
content they're looking for it's as if
you were building your own page on
facebook you type in the title we try to
understand the title and we fill in the
content and that's one challenging
pieces as we cover more content areas we
have to grow this piece to understand
more kinds of these titles here and so
that's as one thing the other thing is
that then once we want to stood what the
title is and we have to then answer the
question and we have to do it fast and
we have to do it in a way that respects
all of the privacy settings and all of
that data and that's that's just a big
systems engineering challenge because of
the sheer volume of data you mentioned a
bunch of numbers we have a billion
active users about a million come new
ones every day 240 billion photos about
300 million new every day one of the
trillion connections that I mean the
numbers are just huge and also we want
it to be so that if you go and upload a
photo or you can tag someone in a photo
you should be able to search for that
right away and so we get I think it's
more than 5 billion new pieces of
content whether it's a like or photo or
comment or post every day and we want
all of those to be indexed live let me
ask you one final question people always
saying well this is a you know going to
be going up against Google what's your
take on it well look the way we think
about it is that we're focus on here's
the data that people have shared with
each other on Facebook can we make that
more useful by making it searchable and
I think you will find and this is
actually what I think makes the product
the most interesting that most of the
content you'll find through graph search
is not public content its content that
people have shared on Facebook with a
limited audience that you happen to be
in and so as a result I think if you
compare any web search engine to
Facebook's graph search there's very
little overlap in the data that we're
actually searching for they're really
very different product
okay oh thanks very much both of ya
thang you like for Cena I'm Dan Farber
