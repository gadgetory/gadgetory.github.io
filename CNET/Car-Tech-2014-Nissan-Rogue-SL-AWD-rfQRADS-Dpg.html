dishonest unprincipled man a scoundrel
cheat or Nair do well well the 2014
Nissan Rogue is about as roguish as a
maul polished up smooth Dover and more
sophisticated not sure what they can do
about the man let's drive the SL
all-wheel drive version and check the
tech now it's easy to spot this new
generation rogue it doesn't look at all
like the outgoing generation you've got
this more sophisticated presence to its
styling and its details they tell me
it's also a three row optional vehicle I
actually find that hard to believe
looking at this one which only seems to
have two rows you can easily put the
second row seats down to create a flat
load floor and they have this divide and
hide stowage system in the back - all of
which are nods - keeping it practical
and not just better look now inside the
new rogue they've really redone the
interior and the quality of the
materials they've really brought the
rogue up the minute you sit in here I've
been griping about Nissan head units for
some time this one is a substantial step
forward first of all it's nice smoothly
rendered beautiful dot pitch on the
screen nice and bright it's actually got
a bit of an infinity quality to it as
you run through your media choices you
see you've got a whole new layout on the
screen if you've been paying attention
to infinity does a pretty good job with
metatags for example there's room for
the full spell out and they let it do
that a one-note where you do have
satellite and AM and FM radio of course
CD aux bluetooth plug-in and bluetooth
streaming your interestingly missing HD
radio which on a car like this which is
the highest trim of its family that's
kind of an auto mission as you get to
your navigation screen this is also nice
big buttons and the thing I love quick
response to the touchscreen you just get
on it and as soon as you hit that button
you get a response that's the way it
should be let's see how the voice
command works street address 235 second
Street San Francisco California please
wait
street address showing matching
locations one one status destination
show on now or indirect set as
destination so on the upside it took an
entire phrase address without me having
to use any particularly tortured
language that's great on the downside
you saw a long processing delay between
each step and like so many cars it still
does dumb stuff like okay we found your
address do you want to go there
or do something else with it I want to
go there Tesla's the only car maker that
really gets your right to that most
others give you a bunch of additional
choices to take my mind off driving but
they've made big improvements
now the apps is a very interesting area
hit this other button in the upper right
and frustratingly you get some media app
to me I Heart Radio and Pandora are
forms of radio yet they're not even
remotely related in the interface to
radio which is over here under satellite
and broadcast
that's a hodgepodge but so be it once
you get there just hit the Pandora
button it will invoke the Pandora app
automatically on your phone believe it
or not some cars make you start it in
both places
this one blessedly doesn't again I find
slow response time as it makes the
handshake between the two but once it
comes up again we're seeing the nice
metatag display album art looks good in
this case and your usual Pandora
functions are available as well and of
course notice here we have Google online
search which lets you either search via
a keyboard for entry or use voice search
but notice this it's a different button
not the one on the wheel and it's a
different platform it goes out to nuance
as opposed to the Nissan onboard which
is only for phone calls and navigation
so again we're seeing kind of a
confusing mess of expectations and
interfaces here and because we're doing
Google search I've got fairly familiar
ways to sort by category by distance or
by ratings put this guy in Reverse on
that screen of course becomes a backup
camera but notice you've got a split
screen here your traditional backup on
the left this is the around view monitor
on the right a big Nissan Infiniti thing
using front rear and under mirror side
cameras and when you're underway at very
low speed you can invoke the camera on
demand like so with this button and
pushing it again gives you a side view
on the right for things like curbs
cyclists approaching or someone
stepping off the sidewalk towards your
car another sees little flags right here
mo D that's moving object detection this
will also alert you to things moving
within your camera view in case you
missed them in terms of your in-cabin
driving controls very straight forward
on this car because we have a CVT we
have a very traditional looking shifter
from Park down to low and the classic PR
nd L layout no paddles on this car even
though it's the top trim over here is a
tiny very little sport button that
extensively improved response a little
bit it gives you a tiny little icon over
here clearly the sport mode is not a big
headline in this car you can enable and
disable most of your driving assistance
technology divided this button on the
left or you go into a menu here in your
center screen your forward collision
warning which works above 10 miles per
hour and warns only does not stop you
lane departure warning again that's
passive and blind spot warning also
passing now under the hood of a modern
US spec rogue you find out rather modern
but unremarkable engine it's a two and a
half litre inline-four so big as fours
go but small as engines go standard
configuration is sitting sideways like
this driving the front wheels or you can
also get all-wheel drive as an option
the numbers on this guy are 170 horse
175 foot-pounds of torque
you know fine there's nothing tricky
going on here no direct injection super
charging turbo charging it's got
variable valve timing lawnmowers at that
now you're gonna see about a 3,500 pound
kerb weight on this vehicle it gets up
to 60 and 9 seconds which is just fine
your mpg you're gonna have 2633
front-wheel drive lose 1/4 all wheel
drive 25 32 where the whole rogue rubric
really falls down is in the driving
nothing devilish here the throttle
response is tepid and laggy partly
because the power is barely adequate and
partly because having a CVT between the
engine and the wheels isn't helping
matters these can be good gearboxes and
Nissan's hands but not in this case as
it surges and dives and hunts for the
right rpm putting it in sport mode here
I am not sure what it's doing I can't
really detect anything active trace
control is interesting that's where it
uses the brakes automatically pinpoint
to yo you through a corner and I swear I
actually feel it when I'm going around
the big sweeping corner here and I turn
into it some speed I'm actually feeling
the car kind of rotate a little bit more
than I think it's actually capable of oh
that must be that trace control then
there's active engine braking it's
basically the transmission being told to
downshift and use compression braking
more than just letting the car rely on
its service brakes and finally there's
an active ride control that uses the
gearing as well as some braking to
counteract that sort of body bounce you
get when you go over a big undulation in
the pavement or a speed bump I don't
really get as much bounce and porpoising
as I would expect
finally the forward collision warning
lane departure warning and blind spot
warning technologies wall passive seem
well calibrated reacting neither too
sensitively nor too numb Lee however the
small indicator lights or generic
sounding beeps they issue to alert you
don't mean a lot car's beep and flash
indicators for everything from low tire
pressure to low fuel to to radio preset
confirmation ok pricing the new Road
you're looking at about 29,000 or so
base for an SL that's a high trip car
before you add all-wheel drive that's
thirteen fifty more now to get it seen
that style just one thing you have to do
get the SL premium package that's gonna
bring you that big panoramic roof that
basket of a handful of passive driver
assistance technologies and the LED
headlights all the other media and nav
gears included as part of the SL trim
