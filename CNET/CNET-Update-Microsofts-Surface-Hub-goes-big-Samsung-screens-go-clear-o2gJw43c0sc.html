do I mean big I'm Bridget Carey this is
your scene that update your office can
now purchase Microsoft's whiteboard of
the future only for a mere seven
thousand dollars this is the surface hub
and Microsoft gave the world a glimpse
of this massive conference room computer
back in January it's designed to replace
all the gadgetry typically found in a
meeting room and now we know the price
the 55 inch model is 7 grand but if you
want to go all out there's an 84 inch
model with better hardware and that's
$20,000 it'll start shipping in July
now if 20 grand sounds steep keep in
mind that projectors and high end video
conferencing equipment can add up to be
more than $30,000 the wall-mounted
computer can be operated with your hands
a stylus or your voice it can hold
conference calls or be used for
note-taking during brainstorming
sessions this is just another way for
Microsoft to temp businesses to use
Windows 10 but if you want your office
to get really futuristic try on
Samsung's first transparent OLED display
it also can be made into a mirror so you
can replace the mirror in the work
bathroom with this no actually it makes
more sense for a retail store to use
this as a clothing fitting room mirror
letting you interact with transparent
windows to call for assistance or see if
an items in stock some retailers like
Neiman Marcus and Rebecca Minkoff are
testing this type of technology out in
their fitting rooms I got to see
firsthand earlier this year at the
National Retail Federation show in New
York Tech is also transforming the
kitchen this is the June intelligent
oven it's the size of a toaster oven but
costs more than a high-end full-size
range it's $1,500 it's packed with the
same nvidia tegra processor you find in
a tablet along with a camera and Wi-Fi
all this for the ability to detect what
type of food you just put in it so it
can offer suggestions on how to cook it
the camera records videos so you can
take a peek at your dish through the
video stream on your phone app or you
can save a time-lapse video as it cooks
to share on social media but
you can't own it yet the first test
units won't be fully baked until the
fall and before we close a few quick
updates from the social world you can
now play a game inside a facebook
Messenger chats it's an add-on app
extension called doodle draw similar to
pictionary you get a word to draw and
friends have to guess what it is
to access it first go into a chat
conversation and click the more button
that's the little ellipsis on the bottom
then find doodle draw to install and the
video app vine now makes it easier to
search through the network six-second
clips the explore tab lets you search
people tags or any word or phrase that's
it for this tech news roundup and
there's always more at sina.com
