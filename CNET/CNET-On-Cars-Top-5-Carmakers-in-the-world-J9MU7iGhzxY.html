worldwide in 2014 but who accounted for
how much of that I'm Brian Cooley with
the answers the top five global
automakers that's different and I think
more interesting than the top five Auto
makes let's get started number five the
Hyundai Kia Group eight million sold up
a hearty seven percent now Hyundai Kia
has been a huge growth story for several
years taking its solid place as a member
of the big five their portfolio of car
brands is perhaps the simplest on
today's list basically Hyundai and Kia
but they are part of perhaps the most
diversified family conglomerate in our
list that includes steel shipping
machine tools finance aerospace and
their original industry construction
number for Renault Nissan eight and a
half million of two and a half percent
these two formed a tight partnership
back in 1999 under it our Nissan Renault
Infiniti Dacia Lada an important stake
in Auto Vaz in Russia and a partnership
with Daimler that will soon produce the
first Mercedes pickup truck no not come
into the u.s. here Mercedes is seen
strictly as a luxury brand never as a
taxi or a truck now we enter the tight
race between the global big three number
three General Motors nine point nine
million up two percent GM was number one
for over 75 years but it's the only car
maker now to have slid a spot on this
list from number two in 2013 to its
current number three now not because its
sales dropped but because number two
grew even faster GM is huge beyond its
American brands in Chevy and Cadillac
for example they've got Holden in
Australia Opel and Vauxhall in Europe
ten different car making operations in
China which is also where Buick does
most of its sales number two the
Volkswagen Group 10.14 million up four
percent last year and crossing the 10
million line for the first time in
company history they've been talking
about soon being the world's biggest
automaker now if the VW Group succeeds
it would do so with the while
portfolio in the entire big 5vw powdi
Porsche Bentley Lamborghini say OTT
Skoda Scania trucks Ducati bikes a big
slice of Suzuki and two joint ventures
in China its ownership is also rather
interesting largely split between
Porsche and the government of Lower
Saxony
don't ask before I get you to number one
where are all these cars made according
to numbers from the International
Organization of motor vehicle
manufacturers China makes the biggest
slice of the world's 85 million cars
followed by the US Japan Germany and
South Korea oh by the way take out
commercial vehicles and the u.s. drops
from number two to number four the
biggest car maker in the world is Toyota
ten point two three million up two and a
half percent tight race at the top as
you can see but Toyota has nudged out VW
so far for number one using its namesake
brand along with Lexus Scion he no
trucks Rams V's in China majority
control of Daihatsu they've got a stake
in Fuji Heavy Industries that Subaru as
well as a piece of his Susan the
interesting story to watch at the top of
2016 is will Toyota dropped to number
two and BW go to the top spot for the
first time so far mid-year Volkswagens
ahead by 82,000 cars more top 5 lists to
wait the car lover go to see net on cars
