you're like me when you travel your bags
are stuffed with your smartphone tablet
laptop headphones and more so we wanted
to give you a suggestion to lighten your
load and trust me your back will be
thanking you for it now laptops can be
clunky and heavy but they don't have to
be so we have 2 13 inch laptops and
these guys significantly shave off a few
pounds the samsung series 9 is one of
the lightest of the bunch at two and a
half pounds with a super sleek design
and solid performance that starts at
twelve ninety nine I know it's a little
more pricey compared to others but we're
focusing on weight and this is the one
now if you guys want to go Apple then
it's the macbook air 13-inch that starts
at eleven ninety nine it's another great
design laptop that's just under three
pounds and it's a top-performing
editor's choice laptop from cnet now the
tablet craze isn't going away anytime
soon you probably don't need those big
10 inch screen clunkers so check out the
7 inch tablet that is established itself
as the sweet spot for both men and women
and also fits nicely in a purse or murse
so check out google's nexus 7 it can do
everything from web surfing and watching
movies weighs 12 ounces and is seen
that's editors choice for the category
and the best thing about it it's price
point starting at one hundred and ninety
nine dollars now Apple fans might go for
the iPad Mini which is one of the
lightest at just under 11 ounces with
apples great apps and ecosystem but the
Bugaboo is it's 329 dollar price tag so
I'll let you decide which one makes more
sense for you but if you don't even want
to tablet and you're looking for a
little bit of everything device check
out the Galaxy Note 2 this really brings
some of the best tech together with its
huge five and a half inch touchscreen
and a stylus that allows you to create
detailed notes create documents and work
on a larger screen while still also
being able to take phone calls it costs
299 with a two-year contract on verizon
but it's really an intriguing gadget now
I get that people still love hardcover
physical books but something like The
Hunger Games trilogy adds a whole lot of
weight so why not go digital with
Amazon's Kindle paperwhite which is
lighter than most hardcover books at
seven point five ounces and boasts the
best screen we've seen on an e-reader to
date that also has this built-in light
for
time reading the kindle paperwhite cost
119 dollars but it's really worth it in
the long run so there are some of the
ways that you guys can lighten your load
when you travel but still have some of
the best tech toys on planet earth i'm
