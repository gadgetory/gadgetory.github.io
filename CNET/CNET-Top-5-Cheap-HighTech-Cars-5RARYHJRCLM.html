high-tech car you probably Blanche at
the thought of buying something which
cost as much as a foreclosed house but
you can actually roll seen that style
for a monthly nut low enough to swing
even after you're laid off
I'm Brian Cooley with the top five high
tech cars that cost under 20 grand
reviewed and ranked by CNET so far in
2011 let's hit the road number five is
the Hyundai Accent S II now we love us
some Hyundai and Kia these days so why
the bottom of the list well because you
can't even option a navigation head unit
on any accent at any price and it
doesn't have a very elaborate voice
command system like a Ford SYNC so this
is all kind of a throwback to a few
years ago when car companies positioned
their small cars as utilitarian
transport that offered less now the
accents a nice car but they kind of
missed the boat on this idea of really
loading it up closer to the mid-range
cars at least optionally number four is
the loveable Fiat 500c the most stylish
car on our list though unnerving ly
close to Fred Flintstone's car in some
aspects navigation consists of a clip-on
TomTom unit and the cars powertrain is
shall we say modest but it does offer a
cousin of Ford SYNC called blue and me
and a very cool power rag top that opens
up to la dolce vita all for under 20
grand number three is the chevy cruze
eco it scored high in CNET's review
because of its wonder of an engine a 1.4
liter turbo four-cylinder that cranks
out 28 42 mpg while being sufficiently
powerful and refined on the road as is
the whole car you can't get factory nav
on a cruise either but it does have
OnStar which can bring in a form of nav
and it also supports the new OnStar
mobile app which lets you control
various aspects of the car remotely from
your smartphone while it's sitting still
of course number two is the newcomer in
the bunch
the little Scion iQ very small but not
stupidly small like a smart car instead
Scion has a smart strategy of offering
an array
of high-tech head units at good prices
and the IQ has Pandora integrated right
out of the box it's little motors a 1.3
liter engine it's best in cities
confidence killing on the highway and
sounds like it's grinding coffee in both
situations but overall it's an
affordable car with interesting tech
options and a style that stands out just
don't trip on it before I take you to
our number one cheap tech car check out
this survey
according to Arbitron and Edison
research the tech that we use most in
our cars is still am/fm radio CD player
and cell phone but when you ask folks
what they love to use in their car it's
satellite radio iPod and GPS and the
mainstreaming of all those technologies
and more into inexpensive cars like I'm
talking about today is a very happy
trend okay the number one tech car to
look at when you're on a budget is
pretty easy it's the Ford Fiesta two
things stand out for us first for its
excellent sink system which I almost
think is better on a simple display like
in this car then on the elaborate LCD it
does a great job of recognizing contact
names and music titles when you bark
them out by voice and Fiesta offers a
dual clutch manual gearbox nobody else
does that at this price not even close
on the other hand the navigation is kind
of an OnStar like system which we found
was sort of hit and miss and even then
it only works when you have a cell
connection but still if it's our 20
grand
we're probably gonna buy a Fiesta by the
way everyone always asks implements like
this what do I Drive sorry to disappoint
you but my 88 country squire doesn't
even have airbags and I want you to be
safe for more top fives like this go to
