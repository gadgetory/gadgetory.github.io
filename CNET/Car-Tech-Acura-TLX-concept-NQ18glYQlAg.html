goodwin with cnet.com were on the floor
at the 2014 Detroit Auto Show taking a
look at the acura TLX prototype now as
that name kind of implies this is a
combination of the TSX and the acura TL
merging the larger sedan and smaller
sedan into one that should be just right
for the brand the thinly veiled look at
what we should expect from a vehicle in
the future so under the hood you've got
a choice between either a 3.5 liter v6
or 2.4 liter 4 cylinder engine again one
of those engines came from the TSX one
came from the TL both of those engines
will be able to be made it to acura
super handling all-wheel drive system
another sort of trickle down from the
larger TL model and then you also got
Acuras all-wheel steering which is
something that we've actually only ever
seen in the RLX the actual really big
large flagship model that they've got
now this prototype has a couple of
really sort of concept thing that you
wouldn't see on a production car like
the sort of sequential LEDs and the turn
signals but things like the all LED
headlights will probably actually see on
the production model because the acura
mdx already employs that technology i
wouldn't be surprised to see this thing
showing up at another car show later
this year without the prototype moniker
and with a model year showing up
sometime next year as an actual
production model I'm Antoine Google with
cnet.com and we're on the floor at the
2014 Detroit Auto Show taking a look at
the acura TLX prototype</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
