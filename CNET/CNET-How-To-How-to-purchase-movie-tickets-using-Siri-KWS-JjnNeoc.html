with it bug fixes more LTE support and
the ability to use Siri to purchase
movie tickets I'm Jason Cipriani a cnet
how to you contributor and this is how
to purchase movie tickets using Siri the
first thing you'll need to do is make
sure you update your iOS device to iOS
6.1 after that you'll need to ensure you
have Fandango installed on your device
and then you'll be able to use Siri to
order tickets now there's a few
different commands you can give Cirie to
order tickets and you could view those
by bringing Syria tapping on the eye
scrolling down to the movie example and
then it's the second set of examples in
the list so let's try one of these
commands out two tickets to a movie
tonight at 7pm
so as you can see I gave it a general
time and Cirie has returned a local
movie theater and a half an hour window
15 minutes prior 15 minutes past the
time I provided it and a list of movies
that fall within that as well as the
ability to view information on that
movie the synopsis what it's all about
and then if I tap on the play time or
the showing time down here I could buy
tickets using the fandango app tapping
on that will launch Fandango here I can
complete the transaction how many other
tickets I need notice I said two tickets
earlier that's already prefilled in the
fandango app for me again you don't have
to say a time you could say a specific
movie and launched directly to that
movie as well as what other options that
siri includes with it once again this
was Jason Cipriani a Cena how to you
contributor and that was how to use Siri
to purchase movie tickets</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
