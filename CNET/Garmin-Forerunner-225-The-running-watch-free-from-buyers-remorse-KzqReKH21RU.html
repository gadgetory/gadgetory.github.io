used to be a big pain you had to wear
these uncomfortable chest straps but
more and more companies like Fitbit and
Apple are now including optical heart
rate sensors directly and watches the
latest to do this is Garmin I'm dan
Graziano and I'm here with the Garmin
Forerunner 225 this is a watch that's
designed for runners not only does it
include GPS for pace and distance
tracking and all the activity tracking
for things like steps taken and calories
burned but it's also garments first
running watch to include an optical
heart rate sensor and once you know it
it's quite good when I compare the heart
rate data to a traditional chest strap
the results were similar with the
forerunner 225 being off by a single
beat the watch held up well over the
past month but you will notice a small
scratch on the screen this happened when
I tripped and fell a few days ago on a
run in Central Park speaking of running
I was impressed with how fast I could
acquire a GPS signal even when
surrounded by the skyscrapers of New
York City it would also maintain that
signal throughout a run for when you're
running inside on a treadmill the 225
has an accelerometer but because it's a
relying on the motion of your arm it's
not as accurate as GPS tracking but I
still found indoor runs to be only off
by about a tenth of a mile when you're
done with your workout all of your
information including a map of your run
your pace distance splits and more can
be viewed on the garmin connect mobile
app on android or iOS or on garments
connector website as an activity tracker
the 225 is on par with many fitbit's and
Jawbone's
it can track the steps you take distance
travel and calories burned it will even
measure your sleep at night
automatically but it only shows a graph
of movement throughout the night instead
of what Fitbit and jawbone do by
detailing how long it took you to fall
asleep or how much deep sleep you got
battery life with the 225 is pretty good
with an active GPS signal you will get
up to 10 hours or up to four weeks when
using it only as an activity tracker but
it really all depends on how much you
use the GPS I got a little over a week
and a half with four to five runs
between 20 and 30 minutes the only real
issue I had with the 225 is that the
heart rate sensor is not running
continuously throughout the day like the
Fitbit charge HR
while this save is battery life it means
that 225 isn't using the heart rate to
improve the accuracy of calorie burn or
your sleep measurements you can check
out my full review over at cnet.com but
overall you won't be feeling buyer's
remorse with the 225 with its accurate
GPS and heart rate sensor and all-day
activity tracking it's one of the better
running watches on the market the
forerunner to 25 is available now in the
US for $300 I'm Dan Riley I first seen
it and that was a first look of a Garmin
for 225</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
