new logo for Airbnb looks like a master
class in Freudian interpretation but a
company logo doesn't have to be
anatomically correct to qualify as a bad
idea
in fact Silicon Valley has a rich
history of bad logo design and some of
the biggest names in the business are
guilty of it I'm Donald Bell and in this
top five I'll count down some of the
worst logos in tech starting off at
number five
Firefox before the name and the logo
evolved into that cuddly world
encircling one we know today Mozilla has
to take a few stabs at this one the
project was originally named Phoenix
until a trademark dispute forced them to
change that the Firebird both names were
accompanied by an image of what I can
best describe as a flaming goose being
cooked alive in the fires of hell
fortunately another tech company already
had the claim to Firebird forcing the
change to the Firefox we noted a high
number for Facebook back in the day the
Facebook logo was often accompanied by
an actual face this guy he was like the
soccer version of MySpace tom legend has
it that the face was actually a
manipulated image of Al Pacino but
there's some compelling evidence that it
was actually Peter wolf lead singer from
the Jay geils Band either way it's
really creepy but then again so is
Facebook coming in at number three Apple
computers for a company that now has one
of the most iconic logos in the world
their first attempts look like an
engraving from a Charles Dickens novel
can you imagine this thing being put on
the back of an iPhone I mean on the plus
side Apple would have to make the phone
bigger just make the logo readable but
then you just know Samson would come
along and make a phone with more cross
hatches and enhanced historical
obscurity at number two Google yes the
company that is quickly taking over the
world and harvesting your information to
sell it to the highest bidder is a case
study on how subtle design changes make
a big difference the early logo while
virtually identical the name of an
illegitimate Clown College
but you redesigned the font and you drop
the drop shadow and suddenly you're
worth billions
finally my vote for the number one worst
tech company logo
Nokia now to be fair this logo probably
made a lot more sense when the company
was founded in 1865 and their best
selling product was rubber galoshes and
let's not forget the people of Finland
do love their fish but even so I'm sure
you could not have found an uglier fish
it's like half logo half nightmare it
looks like it should have the Millenium
Falcon flying out of its mouth so there
you go five tech brands that proved that
the air BnB logo is in good company
honestly I'd kind of like a t-shirt for
every one of these more top five top
five cnet.com I'm Donnell Bell thanks
