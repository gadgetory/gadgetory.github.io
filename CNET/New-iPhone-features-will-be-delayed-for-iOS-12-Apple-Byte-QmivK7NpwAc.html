to the apple bite for everything good
and bad inside the world of apple now
last week we had to get a little real
with you all about the state of apple
but this week it got really real
a report from axial says apple has
decided to delay key features for iOS 12
that were originally planned for this
year now that's in order to improve the
performance of iphone software after we
called iOS 11 the worst iOS we could
ever remember with update after update
and bug after bug for more than a one
month stretch now you can also go back
to our worst Apple moments of 2017 to
see how bad it really was like it was
ugly now there's two ways to look at
this good Apple you know get it together
just get it right but it's just another
example of Apple dropping the ball yet
again with another major product now the
yearly iPhone in tandem with the new iOS
upgrade has been the killer combo to
convince users to upgrade each year and
do I still need to remind you of the
days gone by when Apple used to be able
to innovate and deliver a quality
product at the same time now this is the
new Apple we talked about last week
they're spread thin and I really can't
remember a six month period where so
many cracks across multiple product
categories have shown themselves all at
one time
now Bloomberg also reports some of the
features iOS 12 has been working on
include a redesigned home screen app
grid a multiplayer mode for augmented
reality apps and a merger of third-party
apps running on iPhones and IMAX some of
these and others have been put on hold
now including a possible delay to a
revamped photo management app as well so
according to Bloomberg other tweaks that
are still on track include the combined
apps platform for iOS and Mac OS better
parental controls to monitor kids use on
apps and improvements to Apple's
FaceTime and hey Apple we're still
waiting for a multi-user FaceTime call
to help us out here and yes I know they
are in the iOS 11.3 beta but we still
don't have I clawed messaging sinking or
airplay to just yet the report also says
this will affect the yearly Mac OS
software update to a lesser degree but
Apple watch and Apple TV upgrades won't
be affected by this shift at all so we
can all treat iOS 12 kind of like a Snow
Leopard year back in the day when it was
still called Mac
10 it'll be a year of fine-tuning for
iOS so just do it right because you need
to Apple alright in some more not so fun
news the US Department of Justice and
the Securities and Exchange Commission
are investigating if Apple violated
security laws after release their
software update that slowed down some
iPhones without telling consumers they
were doing it now Apple released a
statement about the investigation and
said we have received questions from
some government agencies and we are
responding to them now my favorite part
of this overall statement we have never
and would never do anything to
intentionally shorten the life of any
Apple product or degrade the user
experience to drive customer upgrades
that's until Geekbench found out that
you were actually doing that all right
the news this week just hasn't been that
good for the big a and the latest report
from The Wall Street Journal isn't any
brighter according to the report Apple
is slashing their planned iPhone 10
production for the first quarter of 2018
in half from the originally planned 40
million units to 20 million units their
supply chain sources also say Apple is
cut orders for components used in the
iPhone 10 by 60% now those are just
numbers but they're big ones especially
so early in the iPhone tens lifecycle
but this isn't rocket science
think about your premium $1,000 phone
needs to do more than an emojis have a
better selfie camera and bring a face
idea that works consistently compared to
the iPhone 8 like there's more people I
know that have decided to either pass on
the iPhone 10 or get an 8 or 8 plus and
in the past everyone had to get the
newest iPhone well that didn't really
happen with the 10 now the iPhone 10
design isn't a failure it's not horrible
but it's little to me their concept car
phone and it needs to get better but
don't worry Apple is still sitting on
over 250 billion dollars in cash and you
know they're gonna ride this one out to
make sure it succeeds alright in other
news bloomberg reports Apple is
developing at least three new updated
Macs with their own custom coprocessors
currently only the MacBook Pro with
touch bar and the iMac pro include
Apple's custom processors now the report
says new Macs with these Co processors
will include updated laptops and a new
desktop with a plan to release them as
soon as this year
Apple's a4 for the iPhone 4 that was
their first processor designed in-house
and we've always said you know it's only
a matter of time before Apple designs
their entire CPU from one of their
machines like look they're already doing
it with the iPad pro which is just as
powerful as a computer what's a computer
oh I hate her so much like that's some
arrogant Apple stuff right there and you
know what that's a bad apple and I can't
believe it took two months for
mainstream people to get completely
turned off by that ad who got mad about
it first yeah we did and that's
something to be really proud of and just
in case you were wondering yes i
pre-ordered the home pod for review
because I didn't make this clear to you
I buy my own stuff it's not from Apple
and it's not a work expense either but
one week later you'll still be able to
get a home pod on time for its February
9th release date now I can't remember
the last time that happened with any new
Apple product on its launch in an
interview with sounded vision Phil
Schiller said Apple is in a position to
create a new kind of music experience
that not only sounds incredible but is
also fun to interact with so home pod
everybody still available alright that's
gonna do it for this week's show you can
email me at the Apple bite se Netcom or
tweet me at Brian Tong and I'll respond
you know when I'm super bored
thanks so much for watching and we'll
catch y'all next time for another bite
of the Apple
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
