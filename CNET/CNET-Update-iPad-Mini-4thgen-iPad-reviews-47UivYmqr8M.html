Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update the ipad mini review is in cnet
senior editor Scott Stein says that if
you're looking for the apple tablet
experience in a smaller travel friendly
package that it's worth the premium
price he praises the minis ultra thin
and light design and says it feels as
light as holding a Kindle e-reader what
would make them mini perfect well their
retina display and a faster processor
says Stein curiously the mini doesn't
include the passbook app even though
passbook is on the ipod touch the mini
starts at three hundred and thirty
dollars and the new fourth generation
full-size iPad makes it way to the top
of the 10 inch tablet list this updated
model has a faster a 6x processor so
boost system speed and graphics power
but it looks the same as the model that
came out six months ago if you have any
older ipad accessories you'll need an
adapter for the new lightning connection
port both the ipad and ipad mini go on
sale friday if the new ipod touch sounds
like a better fit for you than the ipad
mini there's a new accessory that makes
it even sweeter for $99 the freedompop
case gives an ipod touch 4g access users
get 500 megabytes of free data a month
or it can be bumped up to 1 gig of data
if you recruit friends to buy it the
ipod touch has always been Wi-Fi only so
for a one-time cost it gives users the
option to connect on the go for small
things like checking email or getting
map directions but first check the
coverage map to see if it works in your
area for anyone who buys a deluxe Wii U
game console you can earn money for
every downloaded game you buy until the
end of 2014 here's how it works if you
buy a fifty-dollar game you get back

added up over time and can be used to
buy new games on the Wii U or the
Nintendo 3ds but this promotion only
works if you get the three hundred and
fifty dollar deluxe Wii U in black which
comes with additional accessories and
the Nintendo land game the wii u arrives
