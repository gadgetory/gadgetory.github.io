so what better way to combine my
passions down with a photography
expedition where I would hopefully learn
what it takes to get great shots of
brilliant creatures like the Osprey pine
marten and the elusive red squirrel
armed with some of the best photography
equipment around my trip would take me
six hundred miles from down here in
London right the way up the country to
the kangan's
National Park in the heart of the
scottish highlands stopping off of
course at the TV services farm shop for
some really rather excellent biscuits
after about nine hours of driving it's
time to get familiar with the cottage so
there's a car outside of course in the
rain safely in the rain nice kitchen we
have a living room with sofas and chairs
whoo lovely conservatory in here we're
right in the middle of a forest here as
well chickens downstairs bedrooms single
bed and a desk looks like here is the
Reuter so this bed is where I'm going to
get the strongest signal strongest being
the operative word because of course
they has strongman Popeye on the bed
school like twister by myself and look
at all these VHS errs scotch VHS is JVC
and Memorex got here BBC's Pride and
Prejudice on VHS ha stairs lovely
bedroom ensuite two single beds bathroom
another twin room where they like a
goose and a Care Bear and some sort of
psychedelic elephant so there we go
there's the upstairs I might use the
upstairs it has occurred to me slightly
that the guy staying alone in a cabin in
the forest is a horror movie setting
which has been really rather overdone
I'll be fine I guess I hope in order to
be prepared for any photo situation that
might occur I brought a big stack of
equipment with me look at it all counts
6d 5d 3 wide-angle lens
macro lens Sigma 150 to 600 male canons
massive well as a Canon isn't it my 72
208 gets a carbon fiber tripod to keep
everything still
so I'm up got coffee it's 3:30 in the
morning I've got to meet the
photographer at four o'clock where we're
going to go and then get into his hide
and hopefully find some off sprays he
did tell me last night over the phone
and there is a chance that's because
we've had a lot of rain the hide might
actually have been flooded in which case
if we go in it we will drown it is
horribly early in the morning it's not
quite daylight outside yet and this is
seeming like less of a good idea than it
did last night given that only had about
maybe two hours sleep I'm off to a hide
next to a lake in the nearby town of
every more little more than a ditch in
the ground this hide will hopefully let
me get close-up shots in the Ospreys
without them being alerted to my
presence I've been in here a couple of
hours now the light is terrible so I'm
having to use all four settings so my
shots aren't coming out very well we've
had a few birds trying to grab some fish
from the lake that they're not doing a
great job of it and I've not done a
great job of capturing them which is a
disappointment the weather's only
getting worse it's raining fire it is
which means it's not only unusually dim
it's just this horrible grey light
there's no controlling when the bird
show up of course
so my morning involves a lot of waiting
and waiting and waiting so far this
morning this is certainly one of the
best shots I've got maybe bit of who did
it this guy see we've you know
reasonably sharp on the eye but after
you said sure I would normally slow
shutter speed and the high ISO that it's
just not that it's not great in the
light it's just nothing like what I'd
hoped it would be just two days ago
the weather was completely different
they had this
gorgeous golden light it was bright
should we some of the photos that people
got from there and they looked stunning
this lovely backlight to the birds
pin-sharp great colors that's amazing it
could not be any more different just two
days later which is extremely
frustrating because the weather forecast
over the next few days doesn't look like
it's gonna pick up so I think my
opportunities for those beautifully lit
dramatic shots are gonna be a bit
limited also a bit too tall for this
hide and I keep banging my head on these
stress which hurts day one has been a
disappointment to say the least the rain
is still coming down it hasn't stopped
all day I've been looking through the
shots I've got nothing's particularly
impressive and certainly nothing I'm
even remotely pleased with considering
how much effort I've gone to to come
here
in my head I'm already writing the story
about how failure is okay and what you
can still learn from this sort of vague
with Riaan of the day I'm still expected
to write this article with with paid
plenty of money for me to be here in
this cottage for a week I've got a I've
got to write something tomorrow morning
I'm heading to there is a cafe in the
middle of a forest which has a good
reputation for having a variety of
different birds and red squirrels
feeding right outside they know I'm
going to be there from about five
o'clock it's not even open until ten
o'clock so I've got pretty much a full
rein over the place and for a few hours
before people start showing up so really
hoping I can get some good shots there
failing that my life line will be the
hide I'm booked into on Sunday evening
where I'm hoping to be able to get some
nice shots of Badgers and pine marten
but even then if it's raining that hard
which it is currently forecast to they
might not even show up at all so that
could be several hours of me sitting in
a box in the
in the dark in the middle of a night for
literally no good reason here's hoping
the weather improves after a decent
night's sleep I have another priest
sunrise start but this time I'm off to a
local cafe is known for his visiting
birds and squirrels and for his cake I
got some fair shots in the cafe but the
poor light meant that nothing looked
brilliant as I ventured up to the grass
more it was clear that the weather was
only going to get worse don't quite know
what we're good to do our makers my
fantastic it really is just awful there
the rain isn't stopping at all it's
freezing cold my hands feel numb I'm
supposed to be summer Scotland and I
greatly differ on our definition of
summer the weather looked a bit brighter
on the morning of day 3 so I went back
to the hide for a second attempt to
capture the amazing Ospreys on camera
we've got better weather it's still a
grape a little bit of light is much much
better so I've already had some I bought
had a few a few good shots coming out of
nothing spectacular but so much better
when I was getting the other day
luckily my perseverance was paying off
the brighter light meant I was getting
sharper shots of the birds with the
action nicely frozen that's a bit more
like it
with a good set of shots in the bag I
went back to the Moors from yesterday to
get some proper photos of the lovely red
grouse what a difference a day makes
though it's not raining it's not as cold
there's a lot more why it's not getting
much better photos I haven't got as many
wildlife shots so far as I hoped I'd get
so I kind of want to basically filled up
like literally fill the blank pages the
magazine with kind of anything of
interest so I've come down to the side
of the lake I found this nice line of
rocks coming out which I thought would
make a really good shot for a long
exposure so I've got my lis big stopper
filters attached on the tripod of course
and I've got my remote release doing a
bulb exposure about a minute to
hopefully get some nice silky smooth
water and maybe even some movement in
the clouds although there's not a lot of
wind so these clouds aren't moving all
that much but we'll see what we get and
the day just gets better and better the
Sun came out and I was able to take off
my three jackets I've been asked about
all over the place I've been over at car
bridge to do some long exposure stuff
for the river tumbling underneath it and
now I've parked up at the end of this
trackway and I'm on my way down to lock
var where I'm just more like fishing
house that I've been told about which
could may be some really nice shots and
we may see some wildlife down there we
may not it may just be about seeing the
nature and getting sort of general
landscape shots either way I don't mind
because it's a beautiful place we're
walking down skies blue sun shining it's
going pretty well now it's amazing to
think that this is Scotland not
somewhere in Canada or somewhere else
luxurious it's Scotland and yesterday it
was checking it down with rain windy as
all hell I couldn't get anything and
today this it's now about half five I've
been on the go a long time haven't
really eaten so it's definitely
dinnertime I think I think I've earned
it
the question is what to have beef
I think beef steak two steaks
it's for last evening this is Sunday
today I've been out at the mountain
which has been great I've been spending
quite a lot of time actually going
through all the photos I've been taking
back in the cottage and now I'm getting
ready to go to the Hyde's in the middle
of the forest where I'm hoping to see
some badgers and pine martens I've
certainly got some decent shots of other
things so far so it could be kind of
like a nice extra to have if it works
out got to be in there for about nine
and I think usually expect to sort of be
there until certainly past midnight if
not two o'clock ish so it's gonna be a
late one when I'm driving back to London
in one go tomorrow it's about 600 miles
so might be my needs I do a few a few
strategic naps in service stations on
the way so that I'm not too tired to
make the distance but yes it's been a
good a good trip wanting to hide I
barely had time to prepare my equipment
before the first pine marten family made
their appearance
very bad it's certainly about what's
wrong we've got father's tooth you can
see on the table so that really was
incredible I I've been here well I've
been here about 15 minutes the the guide
had left the hide after and and within
five minutes of him having left I look
out the window and is four four pine
martens already here already feeding I
mean I thought I'd be waiting here a
good couple of hours for I maybe saw one
if there's any guarantee of them
arriving at all and within minutes
that's four there it's absolutely
incredible and such a joy to see them
this closes it really is amazing now I
have just seen over the distance as a
whole group of wild deer right I'd love
to get some photos of those guys around
here but I am somewhat stuck as it were
in this hide if I leave now at any point
even just a nip outside to go to the
toilet I'll disturb the wildlife fell
they'll hear the noise they'll get
they'll catch my scent and I will mean
that not only will they disappear now
where they definitely won't come back
for the rest of this evening the people
who operate this height have to be very
strict that once you're in you're in
there are now four badges it's two
outside here two on the other side so
wherever I choose to stand gonna see the
badges are just such amazing little
things seeing them up close like this is
um
that's badger does not care though in
this close you definitely see me I'm
sure probably smell me as well become
amazing
sensitive smell but it's far too focused
on the nets on the ground this batter is
probably about a foot and a half from me
look that's my hand the Badger is
incredible so it's now 20 past 3:00 in
the morning
I'm just leaving the hide it's stupid
early Oh super later suppose I should
say annoyingly I do have a 9 hour drive
to do today back to London but may have
to have a bit of a sleep first it's been
a good night though and well worth it
got some great shots of the pine marten
and the Badger both species put in great
appearances 3:20 a.m. I don't know what
I was thinking
thanks to multiple coffee stops along
the way I did eventually make it back to
London in one piece I did learn a lot of
important lessons on the way I can go to
a stunning location we've some of the
best camera equipment around but if the
weather doesn't play ball and you're
going home with nothing thankfully
though I did have some success and it
was because of the knowledge I gained
from the local guides as well as my own
sheer perseverance in battling through
the elements that I thankfully came away
with many of the shots when I set out to
get
