three new iPhones this year the iPhone
10 is new and futuristic but it is $1000
and doesn't come out until November and
then there are two very familiar-looking
iPhones with a few key upgrades
available now the eight and eight plus
they look a lot like the iPhones you've
been seeing since the 6 and 6-plus back
in 2014
they're not exciting looking but they're
practical consider these the sensible
sedans to the iPhone tens roadster the
iPhone 8 feels more like an iPhone 7s
from the outside you won't have much to
show off but inside there are quite a
few upgrades the 4.7 inch 8 still has
the same sized body or with a glass back
this time that allows wireless charging
compatible with a common Qi standard
this isn't an oled display like the
iPhone 10 but it does have apples true
tone technology which adds extra warmth
and auto adjusting tones to match room
lighting the eight still lacks a dual
camera this time around 2 which means no
telephoto or portrait bokeh effects
you'll need to spring for the A+ or the
upcoming 10 to get those the iPhone
eights cameras take great photos of
video and have better detail in
autofocus in low-light videos look
fantastic
this phone does have a blazing-fast new
chip inside that nearly doubles
multitasking speeds apple says it
enhances augmented reality applications
- with iOS 11 which offers a bunch of
new upgrades like an improved control
center built-in document scanning and a
revamped Siri Apple's enabling apps that
can create surprisingly good augmented
reality by holding your phone at the
real world to project realistic virtual
things Apple's a Ark it also works with
other iPhones so you don't need the
eight for it but it could help render
these better over time the problem is
the A+ still offers a better camera
battery life and larger screen and with
the iPhone 10 cramming an even bigger
display into a body almost as small as
the iPhone 8 this models look feels
older than ever but it does have a home
button and touch ID something the
upcoming iPhone 10 lacs maybe you want
to play it safe since we still don't
know what face ID on the 10 will be like
or you don't want to pay a thousand
dollars for a new iphone but here's the
thing until we review the 10 when it
arrives we really have no idea how the
eight compares all I'd suggest is if
you're paying this much already consider
the 8 plus it's worth the upgrade if you
like the 7 the 8 is greater</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
