spider-man was always meant to be seen
you know he was created by you know Stan
Lee and Steve Ditko in the 60s to give a
new perspective on the crazy world that
they had been building and that's
something we've never been able to
explore in movies before and now that we
can I just feel like it's an infinite on
our possibilities that's not a hug I'm
just grabbing the door for you oh all
right good good luck out there
there is some element where it just
feels like you're shooting a documentary
with Iron Man you know he shows up and
he just embodies Tony Stark in in this
way that is just a joy to capture even
before this opportunity came up like I
would watch Marvel movies or any sort of
big epic superhero movies and it would
just always think about like what are
the regular people and those worlds
doing you know even in guardians of the
galaxy I remember just like you know you
see this big crowd shot I was like what
does that guy do like where does he live
you know what's his day-to-day life like
so I always thought that would be a
fascinating thing to explore in one of
these movies and and because Peter
Parker is sort of the ground-level
superhero in this universe that was an
opportunity for me to do that and you
know I had known a little bit about you
know the complexity of the world and the
various various storylines that had been
told over the years but for me it was
important to just go back to the origin
and start at the very beginning and that
was so satisfying you know because I
didn't want the movies to be the
jumping-off point I wanted the comics
the original books to be the most direct
inspiration for me and that was really
satisfying to just read just read so
many comics tough tough job this arrived
at a really interesting time in my life
because I had been wanting to make a
coming-of-age movie like I had been
writing my own coming-of-age story and I
got to take a lot of that energy and a
lot of those moments and themes that I
wanted to explore in a much smaller film
and then apply them to spider-man
homecoming so in a way like I got to do
what I wanted to do anyway but on a much
much bigger scale
yeah I mean I had no problem relating to
Peter Parker like he's he's been chosen
to do this incredible thing and it's a
lot of responsibility and he feels like
he might be in way over his head
but is desperate to prove himself I mean
you know no similarities</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
