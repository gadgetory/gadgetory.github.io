gotten some updates but before you ask
it still got just that one USB C port
despite that this remains one of my
favorite current laptops and this
third-generation version of it fixes one
of the major complaints that I and many
other people had about it
the superflat keyboard just never felt
entirely right and when the MacBook Pro
Series adopted a similar flat keyboard
last year it had an improved butterfly
mechanism under the keys which make
typing just feel better now the 12-inch
MacBook has adopted that improved
butterfly mechanism from the proline and
even using it in just a few initial
typing sessions I can totally tell the
difference there is a click and a spring
to the keyboard now that was lacking
before also new is a jump to current gen
Intel processors they call this
generation cable a till it's fast enough
for everyday tasks like writing video
streaming and social media the included
solid-state storage is also faster too
according to Apple it's not quite as
updated as we'd like you're still stuck
with a not great 480p webcam there's
still just that single USBC port for all
your power and connectivity needs and it
still starts at a hefty $12.99 it's not
for everybody but if you could work with
these limitations this is definitely the
best version of this 12-inch MacBook by
far</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
