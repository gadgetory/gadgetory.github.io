all-new r8 supercar and truth be told
it's not that different from the current
replaces the vents on the front and a
vertical rather than horizontal the side
blade has gone missing and the exhausts
are rectangular
rather than circular the interior has
been given a ferrule spruce as well
taking some pretty awesome inspiration
from the incredible TT sports car
dimensionally it's four centimetres
wider two shorter and one lower than the
old car it's also up to 50 kilos and
lighter than the car it replaces with a
dry weight of 14 54 kilos is done that
thanks to a new space frame an extensive
use of carbon fibre and aluminium from
launch there are two engines to choose
from both 5.3 litre v10 the base car is
packin 533 brake horsepower and 398
pound foot nor 262 takes three and a
half seconds in its top speed is just a
shade over 200 miles an hour
however if that's a bit too slow for you
you can always go for this the v10 plus
it's back in 600 and super brake
horsepower and 413 pounds foot nor 262
takes 3.2 seconds it'll do nought to 124
in just under 10 and its top speed is
205 miles an hour pretty impressive
stuff and all of that power goes through
a dual clutch flappy paddle gearbox no
manuals confirmed for now neither is a
smaller engine v8 or anything like that
they will be doing a limited run of an
all-electric each wrong as well the new
r8 is looking fairly into hurricane
territory which makes me wonder whether
Lamborghini should be a little bit
worried
however the r8 itself is a pretty
legendary car to understand why let's
take a look back the original audio rate
was something of a phenomenon born of
the Lamar winning r8 racer and the 2003
LeMond quattro concept car it showed the
world that not only could OD do a
supercar but it could take the likes of
Porsche on and not come out with a
bloody nose but a bloody fist when
rumors began to spread the
od was going to make a supercar of its
very own the press and car fans all over
the world went a bit nuts
the idea of sensible howdy making proper
supercars was too much for some to take
the first production r8 was revealed in
2008 and after its reveal all of the
initial cars sold out within a week is
safe to say that when it was launched
the r8 was warmly received it shared
some parts with VW Group stablemate
Lamborghinis Guyardo though to start
with it was put on a back foot given a
mere 414 brake horsepower 4.2 liter v8
rather than the Lambos 5.2 liter v10
the v8 was good great even but later
down the line that v10 appeared as did a
convertible as you'll expect there was a
facelift a minor power hike and tweak
here and there and a number of special
editions it was to put it politely
proper which I have a couple over the
years of v8 and a v10 plus and loved
them both they were comfortable very
fast and surprisingly practical the
Marquand r8 was a supercar that had been
designed by people who knew about making
normal cars they took the vichy like
such as visibility access and user
friendliness and added them to the best
bits of supercars large mid mounted
engines and looks to kill look at the
impact the r8 had in the rest of the
world as well as soon as it launched it
became one of the hottest cars around
how Iron Man drove three of them now
it's time for the first r8 song to end
its v8 can be heard in the intro sting
of every ex car video for now at least
and personally I think the v8 r8 is one
of the greats
especially with a 6-speed manual</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
