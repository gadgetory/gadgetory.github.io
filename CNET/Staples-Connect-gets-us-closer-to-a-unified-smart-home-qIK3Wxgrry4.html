today we're taking a look at the Staples
connect hub now it's a very simple
looking device but it's actually pretty
powerful it plugs into your router and
it's got z-wave ZigBee Wi-Fi Lutron
clear connect all these different types
of protocols that smart home devices use
to talk to each other
built into it so we can talk to all of
them and it can integrate them all under
one app and have them work with each
other to help you automate your home let
me walk you through an example I've got
this lamp here with a Philips color
changing hue bulb inside of it and then
here I've got a Yale smart deadbolt now
these products can't work together
because they don't speak the same
language but the staples connect hub
speaks both languages so it can be the
translator so what I've done is I've set
up this deadbolt to turn the light green
when i unlock it and red when I lock it
so if I turn the knob here and unlock
the lock the light turns green if I turn
it back the other way
light turns red and you see that happens
really fast what's happening is a z-wave
signal is going out from the lock into
the staples hub the staples hub is
sending it back over ZigBee to the
philips bulb that's all happening within
this course of just about a second
that's a really quick easy seamless
interaction now getting up and running
with staples connect is very quick it's
a very easy installation getting that
lamp and that lock set up took me about
10 minutes it really wasn't difficult at
all so if you are new to home automation
or you're just looking for something
pain-free staples Connect is a good way
to go the iPhone app is very clear and
very easy to use and if you have an iPad
and want to use that instead they have a
dedicated iPad app it's not just the
scaled up iPhone app that's very nice
Android users you've got your app as
well so your bases are probably covered
no matter what device you're using
there's also a web interface that works
quite well and you get all of that for
$99 and that's a really great price
compared to another option like revolve
this costs $2.99 and does basically the
same stuff as staples connect still it's
not a perfect system if you look at the
products you add to it like Philips hue
bulbs for instance you're not always
getting full functionality within that
staples app you can change the color
turn them on and off and dim them a lot
of the basic functions but there's more
out there music sync all those
third-party apps that exist
you're gonna want all of those you're
still gonna want the Philips he
so staples won't replace all of that and
that's sort of the dream plus you're
still going to need to plug in the
Philips hue bridge to use your lights so
we're just not quite there yet in terms
of total unification but I do think
staples Connect makes sense if you want
to start automating your home in a more
unified way it doesn't get you all the
way to that dreamland but it's a nice
step forward for seeing it I'm right
