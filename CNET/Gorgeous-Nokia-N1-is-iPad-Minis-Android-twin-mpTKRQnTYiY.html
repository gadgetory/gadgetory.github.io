Nokia's Lumia phone business but Nokia
is still making hardware and here we're
taking a closer look at is n1 tablets
running android although you can see
which is running on the latest Android
5.0 lollipop you actually can't really
tell because Nokia has put his dead
launcher over the top
now the Zed launcher does look really
neat you can see this is your home
screen where you've got some of your
some of your key apps and to find new
apps all you do is simply draw a letter
on screen and the tablet will then
search for any apps beginning with that
letter you can see drawing T brought up
the Twitter app and Ted now you can just
search for your list of apps
alphabetically as well by swiping over
to an app list here and you'll see
familiar Android things like the
drop-down notification panel where
you'll still get access to key settings
like brightness and so on if you're not
keen on Ted launcher you can get rid of
it though and just use a standard
Android lollipop interface and if you're
keen to try Android Zed launcher then
you can actually get it for your Android
phone now the interface looks nice and
sharp and colorful and that is thanks to
the 7.9 inch display that has a 2048 by
1536 pixel resolution which is very high
definition so everything does look
really nice and crisp now it's running
on a 2.3 gigahertz dual-core processor
as a 64-bit Intel chip and it does seem
to be pretty Swift design of this thing
is very familiar although still very
nice you can see if I turn it round
we've got an all-metal aluminium body
it's got this sort of brushed matte
finish which feels nice although does
look very similar to Apple's iPad Mini
of course if we look down here we can
see with these drilled speaker holes and
an interesting addition is the USB
type-c connector here now that is the
new version of the USB connector which
means you can plug it in either way
round so no more of that awkward
swapping when you go to bed it's fairly
lightweight and the metal design does
make it feel like a very premium device
on the back here as well because you've
got a 5 megapixel camera and there's a 2
megapixel camera on the front as well
for video calling
now the n1 is already on sale in China
and it costs the equivalent of about
$250 which is very affordable
considering the tech as inside this
thing sadly there is no
of a wider release yet but we are hoping
for more information in the coming few
months
I'm Andrew Hoyle for CNET at Mobile
World Congress in Barcelona and this is
the Nokia n1</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
