like this element you know like yeah
Lord Li because I watch it on the beach
I forgot to see the new movie velaryon
by luc besson he did a Fifth Element and
Leon the professional and now he has
this movie called valerian based off a
French comic book it started in 1967
which was really surprising to me now
they're making the movie going into this
movie not knowing much about it but
there's the central story is there's a
character named valerian and Lorelai one
big part of it which actually I think
both you and I were kind of bonkers for
was the opening where it kind of set up
the universe it starts basically in 1975
and shows it going from like the
International Space Station being built
to this massive thing called alpha which
is so big like it's like it's a city of
a thousand planets is that what the city
yeah I think that's the subtitle here
we'd probably think it is then we meet
these bikini clad nami the Navi they're
like yeah there's a CGI kind of like
alien this whole sequence of CG and
that's what they're trying to do here
they're trying to set up this story but
at the same time I'm like why do I care
about these aliens and I gotta say like
the CG kind of threw me off too like the
CG was it was fine but it looked like a
video game cutscene to me so we go Space
Oddity sequence like video game sequence
for the Naboo yeah - we meet our main
characters agent valerian he'll be
running solo I only work with my partner
hi we're a team
neither of them there are the most
likeable characters they're not easy to
like but they kind of established
valerian as this kind of womanizer kind
of character right off the bat right and
they also established very early on
Lorelei likes him just as much as he
likes her there's no tension but I agree
I didn't care for them and then what
sucks is like they're the thing
characters like a shirt I don't know if
it was the cat sad to say that I didn't
you did I care either in that what goes
back to that chemistry because I would
establish some of that chemistry that we
kind of lack because I felt like we
didn't see the fun part of their
relationship leads me straight into a
wall he said he wanted the shortest way
I really liked her though I thought she
was well cast in that role she was good
she was she played she was in Suicide
Squad which I didn't like the
enchantress and I didn't like her in
that movie she wasn't a great character
or any by any means but she was
definitely better than he was yeah he I
felt like telling us before they felt
like he was fairly young Keanu Reeves I
put you're in backroom joystick will you
put your hands back on the joist okay
there are some surprises like cameos the
biggest one Rihanna Rihanna it was the
right moment were just cally I don't
care what's happening and then Rihanna
said you know shows up and screen like
okay I'm intrigued what's gonna happen
here
and she had a wonderful performance
whatever thing I do I want to mention
Clive Owen cuz he's in the movie okay
love Clive of equivalents is great movie
no he's totally movie I love all the
alien characters now there were so many
different kinds and they did they really
did do the job of fact making them
trying to make them different
I make them creative there was a like
the three kind of ant eater looking
dudes yeah they were called I think she
calls them like the pigeons no no no H
to avoid such situations Oliver
for me she's divided three ways to one
of us and you keep the information that
would be and that that right there is
lupus on like sci-fi weirdness
yes best for sure Patrick who would you
recommend in Valyrian - I would
recommend you go see valerian if you
really like this element or Lucy his the
last movie he did it's got that camp and
weirdness to it and I would watch this
again just to see the visuals the vigils
I thought were pretty amazing and I
would love to sit back and have time to
enjoy that I would only recommend seeing
this if you'd like seriously if you can
see this in Dolby cinema you can see
this in IMAX and you haven't seen
spider-man homecoming you haven't seen
the new Planet of the Apes movie and
you're burning a hole in your wallet you
know you just want to go out and see
something that's not you know some kind
of genre film then yeah you know if you
can see this in the matinee go ahead and
check it out if you're really curious
that's that's my recommending after
seeing this other room after seeing
another maybe see those other movies a
couple of times and then they're like
okay so cool sequel area maybe if you
have money left
yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
