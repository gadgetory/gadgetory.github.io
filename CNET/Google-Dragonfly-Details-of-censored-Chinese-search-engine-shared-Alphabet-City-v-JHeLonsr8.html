show that covers everything related to
alphabet Inc alphabet just so happens to
own lots of companies including Google
I'm your guide Aya's Akhtar and you are
the fantastic audience today we're
talking about some new phones a new
Google smart home device and your
comments but first things first let's
talk about dragonfly to the garden of
Google the intercept published another
report about Google censored search
engine built for China codenamed
dragonfly this time the intercept wrote
about a memo that's circulated within
Google written by an engineer the memo
said that users would have to log in to
dragonfly in order to use search
information would then be shared with a
Chinese partner that partner would have
quote unilateral access to the data
searches would be connected to the
person's phone number both Android and
iOS apps were being developed the memo
said that movements of Chinese users
would be stored additionally data would
be sent to a database in Taiwan but wait
there's more the Chinese partner could
add terms to blacklist
front search and quote selectively edit
search result pages unilaterally and
with few controls seemingly in place end
quote
there were internal protests at Google
about dragonfly
according to intercept sources
higher-ups at Google found out about the
memo and were pretty ticked off since
details of dragonfly were not supposed
to be shared employees were told to
delete copies of the memo immediately
sounds pretty rough let's head on over
to uptown updates several reports say
that Google made a strange change in its
browser beginning with chrome version 69
when a user would log into a Google site
Chrome would then sign in that user to
Chrome's in browser account system
called sync guess what people are upset
Google engineers published a few tweets
explaining that the auto log-in does not
sync data to Google servers to do that
the user would have to manually turn
sync on seems kind of fishy though right
Samsung just introduced the Galaxy a7
and it's got three rear cameras one
camera is a 25 megapixel shooter another
is a five megapixel one used to control
depth of field then
there's a 24 megapixel lens wondering
where that fingerprint sensor is Samsung
put it on the side the a7 comes to
Europe and Asia in the fall the pixel 3
may have been listed on a Chinese site
JD comm and it looks like it could cost
around seven hundred and twenty nine
dollars also the pixel 3xl may have
leaked again on Twitter look at the pics
oh wait okay
YouTube music got an update you can now
choose from three audio quality levels
the bitrate to top out at 256 kilobits
per second Google held an AMA and
explains quote right now we don't have
any plans for audio quality higher than
256 kilobits per second our deals would
require us to charge more to stream FLAC
so at this point we are focused on
improving performance rather than
supporting lossless streaming end quote
