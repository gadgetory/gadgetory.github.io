Francisco welcome to a reporters
roundtable this week we're talking about
a disturbing turn of events in online
privacy could you be forced to give up
Facebook access as a condition of
getting a new job if you're applying for
a job at the Maryland Department of
Corrections you may be asked to let an
interview or into your Facebook account
to poke around and see what the social
network looks like from your private
perspective previously interviewees were
even asked to give up their passwords at
some colleges in the US students have
been required to friend coaches or
compliance officers so their lives could
be monitored in the social network while
employees and students can always
protest these requests if you want the
job or the scholarship and you're asked
for access to your private social
network you're likely to feel coerced to
give in these reported issues and there
are probably others raise important
questions around privacy and the
delineation between our personal and our
professional or public lives on
Wednesday a bill to prevent employers
from asking for passwords failed to win
a vote in the House of Representatives
Facebook though has clearly said that it
is against the Terms of Service to share
your password with others and if the
company will fight this trend in all the
ways that it can
all right so our guest today to discuss
this really important issue is Bob
Sullivan a reporter at MSNBC who
reported first on the story and is the
author of the online column the red tape
chronicles Bob thanks so much for making
the time so how did this happen how did
this whole thing come to light tell us
the genesis of the story well you know
like almost all privacy stories it
starts small and it just creeps for a
long time now we've known that employers
very liberally use Google to background
employees they look at social networks
they see what people have up there in
their public sites and so if you think
about it it's really not a large leap
for a company that wants to know
everything I can about an employee that
they're going to invest a lot of money
and to say well we see what you got in
your public Facebook site but do you got
anything interesting
behind your privacy wall behind your
password and so there's been a couple of
scattered incident it's not widespread
yet but certainly very clear incidents
of either on applications companies
asking for individuals to give up their
username and password or as you
mentioned during job interview saying
please log into your account so I can
shoulder surf while you click around for
your friends and and schools are
requiring this kind of thing either
requiring that athletes connect with
compliance officers or they're using
software to manually look at and inspect
all of their athletes posts so it's just
becoming what what always happens when
there's data available employers and
governments are gonna want to try to
look at it and use it to their advantage
so tell us about that in the case of
Robert Collins which i think is the
watershed incident here yeah a couple of
years ago this started and he applied
for a job he was a actually a former
employee was reapplying to to work back
at the Maryland Department of
Corrections and they demanded that he
give up his username and password and it
turned out that this was policy in
Maryland at the time they had asked for
several thousand potential employees to
give up their Facebook username and
password he did it because he wanted the
job but then he went to the ACLU which
complained about it and filed a lawsuit
and as a result of that initially
Maryland suspended that practice and
then when the heat was turned off they
slowly went back to something that was
almost the same but not quite now they
just asked people to log into their
accounts so they can see what's on their
Facebook account No
the Maryland Department of Correction
folks say they're doing this because
they want to see if a potential guard a
potential of prison guard might have
gang ties but as you might imagine and
you know lots of folks have problems
with this and while it's optional well
over 90 percent of the people who
interviewed did give up their
information so it's not optional when
you're applying for a job you just say
yes when you need a job yeah no kidding
especially in this economy now this is
also affecting as you said college
applicants or sports scholarship
recipients is that right yeah there's
two different stories there one is I
have actually has a lawyer named Bradley
Shearer who's really been spearheading
all of this he's based in Washington DC
he's just a First Amendment lawyer and
he's been tracking this for a long time
and he has heard from parents who say
when their kid went for their college
interview the interviewer said can I see
your Facebook page can I see inside your
Facebook page so nothing systematic on
that front but what is systematic is
that athletes in big-name sports
programs football players basketball
players by being required all over the
country to at a bare minimum to friend a
compliance officer so that means that
someone at the school some official a
coach or or a an assistant can actually
see everything that an athlete posts to
their friends even if it's private and
they're also hiring these software
companies that monitor 24/7 every tweet
every Facebook page and again even the
ones that are only intended for a
limited audience and then sends alerts
to coaches whether or not you know if
the word alcohol is used for example and
opposed so again this makes a lot of
people uncomfortable because the real
world parallel is how would you feel
about a coach having the right to walk
into a student athletes off-campus
apartment and say okay who's your
friends now that happened to to some
extent that happened was it a year or
two ago at a Pennsylvania School
District work school supplied laptops
had their webcams turned on by stealth
yeah the light didn't come on and is
that it was that a similar case and that
was mounted monitoring students
basically in their bedrooms it was and
interestingly with that case I think the
the public outcry was unanimous that
that was a horrible thing to do this is
a little bit more subtle although I
certainly think a case can be made it's
it's incredibly similar that if you can
you know turn on a webcam in someone's
apartment what's the diff
between that and knowing what people are
saying privately to their friends just
because it happens to be using a
technology device and I keep coming back
to this point I write about privacy a
lot and I think we we just don't have
the right social rules in place for any
of these circumstances it's
understandable that universities are
scared because there's been lots of
incidents that an athlete might tweet
something really dumb and embarrass
themselves and in fact there's a case
recently in North Carolina where an
athlete was tweeting about all these
expensive dinners that he had and he
ended up it was clear was violating the
professional amateur line and and he
ended up you know having to leave school
as a result of that in the schools being
investigated so there's reasons that
schools are interested in this but as a
less lawyer Bradley sure says what
schools are supposed to do is to teach
kids how to do the right thing not
violate the First Amendment yeah that
sounds like the ends justifying the
means argument and which I mean I try
not to get too political on the show and
reveal my own biases but this sounds to
say it's our well Ian I think is just so
blindingly obvious
to think that what we do in our private
lives is no longer basically it's
basically not private there is no
private life and which brings up the
question in the modern world of work and
education
what expectation should we have and
should employers respect for our own
privacy in the world of networking well
we really need to talk about this and I
think we are a decade behind having this
public conversation you mentioned that
the law was proposed in the House of
Representatives failed this week
and I don't know who would be against
forbidding employers to get potential
employees usernames and passwords that's
obviously that's not something that's a
terrible idea
but I think that one of the reasons that
it failed is because what would it
really have accomplished the line is not
really clear you can say you can't ask
for username and password but what could
they ask for could they ask could they
require you to friend someone that's
maybe now quite as dramatic and
Orwellian a level but it's close there's
already recently there was a study that
showed that if you had analysts look at
people's public Facebook pages forget
the private thing using public posts
that could actually create something
that they loosely called a Facebook
score and
predict whether or not a potential
employee would be a good employee or not
and they ran a study and they use posts
to identify things like
stick-to-itiveness and Fijian
Congeniality and all of that and
actually turned out to be a pretty good
predictor of what their employees would
be good workers and so is that is that
that's again if you're gonna invest a
lot of money as a company you're gonna
use every tool that you can but that
sure bugs the heck out of me that a
company would use a tool that extensive
and that invasive but all the things are
these things are on a continuum and we
don't know whether the right spot on the
continuum is yet well let's go back to
that the law for a little bit here
because I can my perspective on this
which I'd like to hear your feedback on
is I can kind of understand why a law
about requiring Facebook passwords about
not allowing people to require Facebook
passwords etc could be struck down
because one could argue that employment
law already protects against the
gathering of certain types of protected
information religion the medical status
age there are many things that you
cannot ask in a job interview and if you
are made
get access to somebody's personal social
network that information will present
itself to you by nature just go to the
profile page yes oh so isn't this
information already protected and that's
the argument that some of the Senators
are and reps we're already making isn't
it yeah you hear that argument a lot we
don't need a new law do the old laws
which need to enforce them and that
could very well be true I do think in
the digital age
again these issues are squishy and when
we find one that it's just you know
universally accepted there's no reason
not to actually explicitly ban it
because of course when there's Running
Room lawyers will find that Running Room
and again you know I can't stress the
point enough that government agencies
and companies will use all the data that
they can get their hands on to make the
best assistance that they can that's
that's what organizations do and so if
it's not explicitly illegal they'll do
it and by the way a lot of this activity
we're talking about is illegal in places
like Europe and Germany you've an
employer can't even look at a citizen's
public Facebook page to make a hiring
decision so there are ways there are
societies that are trending to do this
in in ways that protect people's privacy
more than the US we tend to be pretty
hands-off with these privacy issues and
hope the marketplace works the mountain
I think it's hopeless to think that free
market is going to determine what's
private and what's not in a way that's
beneficial to consumers so the house Act
to prevent the collection of passwords
didn't pass this time through what is
the future you think of legislation in
in this space well there's been forever
talk of an updated privacy law an
omnibus bill and and it is time for that
although I understand every technologist
is listening to this right now a friend
is at the thought of members of Congress
sitting down and making you know hard
decisions about this very complex area
they need to get a lot of good advice
when they do it but what we don't have
is is very clear rules that that empower
consumers to know what people know about
them and what they can do about it and
and I think it would be a really good
place to create it's a civil right in
the European Union for example the right
to privacy and here in the u.s. our
rights are very vague and almost always
take a backseat to a tool to technology
expansion to innovation and even in
issues of computer security that privacy
of people comes last and it's something
we really need to talk more about well
with with that perspective certainly you
must have some thoughts on what a
citizen can do when he or she is
applying for a job or a scholarship or
grant or some kind of aid or something
like that knowing that their information
may be collected from their public or
semi-public profiles on a social network
from insurance records from well from
any anywhere I mean what is your advice
for the the the person the human being
in the United States caught up in the
middle of this this confusion well well
a very specific advice right now for a
group of people there's really two kinds
of people when it comes to privacy there
is people who say they care about
privacy and then there's people who say
they don't care about privacy and you
know I have nothing to hide but the
folks who say they care about privacy
and that's about two-thirds of the us
perfectly none of them do anything about
it so they might say they care about
privacy but they'll still hand over
their phone number to a grocery store to
get one of those discount cards and
they'll still use easy Pat's they don't
do it they don't change their behavior
at all and and that's a little bit naive
I did a story with the professor Daniel
solo who wrote a great book called the
digital person as a professor at GW
University and the headline for the
story was life isn't fair and companies
aren't either and one of the things that
he finds with young people right now
college students just after college
students is there's this sense and even
though you and I talked about it we know
we shouldn't have pictures of people
doing keg stands on our Facebook page
the truth is a lot of young people
believe you know what I get when I apply
for a job the human resources person
that's a person - they've done all this
it's not gonna be that big a deal and
well well that makes him crazy during
this conversation that really is the
mindset of a lot of younger people that
that ultimately they're gonna be treated
fairly out there and I'm here to promise
them that they're not went especially in
this economy once somebody has 50 people
applying for a job if you're the one
with the moderately embarrassing
pictures on your Facebook page you're
gonna be the first to go and this is a
harsh reality like life isn't fair
companies aren't either and I think the
basics are where we should really start
I I do I get excited when people are
appropriately paranoid about what might
be construed about them in the future
and I can conjure up lots of scenarios
about how someone might map your music
tastes your future employment prospects
and and all those things I think are
going to happen but today what I want
people to do is to be incredibly
conservative but what they put online
what pictures they put online
what tweets they post we see it every
day we saw it with Spike Lee this week
people accidentally tweet things to get
them in a whole host of trouble in the
future so it's so easy to do and if
you're young and you don't have a solid
job yet maybe it's time for you to drop
off the grid for a while it's really
important to realize that you're not
going to be treated fairly when somebody
sees something out of context in the
future if I may make a leap of a
comparison you know this has been some
people have talked about what you do
online is the digital tattoo and you
know walking around in any city or in
any place sometimes you see people with
crazy tattoos on their
neck and you know that's never going
away at least not inexpensively but from
my perspective that's those are the
people who make life interesting people
are willing to take that risk willing to
be a little bit crazy in their youth
everybody grows up one way or the other
what you're proposing I have to say
sounds like a conservative milquetoast
socially conservative milquetoast boring
world where everybody is so concerned
about looking good that they repress who
they really are and we end up with a
horrible boring world and a huge
thriving undercurrent of society that is
totally off the grid and unknown and I'm
very sorry to do that but I think it's
the best advice I could give someone
right now and I I would of course never
want to enforce a boring world on people
but a boring virtual world I think
that's right I think that right now we
just don't know what things are going to
look like in 2020 and we we don't know I
hinted that this already but I know
these kinds of projects are already
underway if somebody can map the kind of
music you download to your likelihood
that you'll show up late for work in the
future they're going to do it and
employment background companies are
going to sell that it's going to be very
valuable to future employers so you know
frankly the footprints that you leave
online you just don't know how they're
how they're gonna cost you in the future
and so you're best off not having them
or having as few as you can what what
musical taste should we put into our
Facebook profiles to insure ourselves a
better job history in the future well
see you that that's actually a that's a
good point credit scores and credit
reports are a really good lesson for
what we're talking about right now
the credit score formula is one of the
great mysteries of life in America we
all have hints as to what it is but it's
a secret sauce like fried chicken no one
really knows what it is and it has to be
secret because if it weren't secret then
people would game it and all of these
things that I'm talking about with
privacy what kinds of things might make
you a future good employee we're not
gonna know what they are so you won't
know if saying that you like the Beatles
is good or bad for you and only able to
tell you that and the minute that you
know it will no longer be relevant
because the companies will stop selling
it
that's the merry-go-round that we're
caught in here hey what does Facebook
say on this whole topic they can't be
silent on this no when I first
approached them they really didn't know
how to respond
we spent about a week going back and
forth and then they gave me a statement
and frankly they wouldn't give me an
official statement they just pointed me
toward their Terms of Service which
quite clearly imply that you're not
allowed either to give your username and
password to someone or that you're not
allowed to let someone else watch while
you surf your account I think they
didn't realize how extensive it was and
then there was a three or four weeks of
stories and so recently they published a
blog post which was quite clear where
they said no giving out your Facebook
passwords and in fact we stand ready now
to to do everything we can even legal
action to stop employers from doing this
it's a real threat to Facebook's
business model if they get a sense that
these people are abusing the service in
this way and for the employers out there
I'd like to also touch on the fact of
what can happen to you as an employer as
a hiring person yeah if you end up with
access to somebody's private data Bobby
you want to talk about the exposure that
this opens up to employers oh I can't
stress enough what can of worms are
opening up if you're an employer just
for starters first of all just acquiring
people's usernames and passwords we all
know that they're probably using those
usernames and passwords at other places
and immediately you're probably subject
to the Federal Trade Commission
safeguard rule so you now have private
data you have to take care of it and if
you don't you're liable for what happens
to it so you're an employer and you can
now have a cabinet employment file full
of people's passwords inevitably
someone's gonna steal it and you're
gonna be in a lot of trouble in your
mind to pay for it so there's a lot of
money
additionally especially when it comes to
colleges what you find out once you
start rooting around people's private
information you start rooting around
their Facebook page you know the example
that I was told again and again with
yeardley love and the terrible murder
incident down in Virginia what if the
school's athletic compliance officer had
access to some tweets a Facebook post it
might have hinted that and then felt
like that was going to occur and didn't
stop it
wouldn't may incur incredible additional
liability for not stop not intervening
it and that the more that you have
access to the more liability that you
have and as an employer I wouldn't want
to touch that with a ten-foot pole tell
me about these compliance officers
what's the job description and how do we
get a job like that it sounds it sounds
great job for a voyeur or
I don't know but you know that a
student-athlete their lives are very
hard right now and they have a million
rules to follow and as a result in order
to keep these programs going there are
guys men and women the clipboard to run
around making sure that they are wearing
the right tennis shoes that they're not
accidentally getting their picture taken
with a car dealer who might use it as an
advertisement that this it's actually a
being a student athlete can be can be
pretty difficult so there are I mean you
know we used to hear about morals
clauses and in sports and for TV actors
and things like movie actors what is the
state of the the moral monitoring of
public and semi public employees right
now in the social sphere you know I just
don't think that there is one I really
think this this story which again we
know this has been going on for at least
a couple of years so it's not as if this
is a brand new thing it's just come to
light now we barely scratched the
surface of talking about it and as a
railway have no social mores I
ultimately hope that's what takes over
here I ultimately hope that you know we
all reacted to this idea that school
would turn a webcam on people's homes it
wasn't anyone who thought that was a
good idea so I think almost all school
districts now would would not do that
everyone did it it would be a rogue
superintendent I hope that's the kind of
thing that happens with this Facebook
password Facebook password situation by
the way we didn't even mention there was
a case in Minnesota of a 12 year old
student who allegedly was having a spat
with a teacher and was hauled into the
principal's office with a sheriff's
marshal there who had a sidearm actually
and they demanded that she gave up her
Facebook password so that they could see
what else she was saying about the
teacher essentially so so this kind of
thing is happening all around the
country and again who's a
twelve-year-old to say no to the
principal and demand like that but but I
am hoping that socially we decide now
this is this is just a step too far this
is like looking in someone's diary which
we would never do and and let's just cut
it out
we need compliance compliance officers
that's what we need all right what's
coming up for you what's next in in this
developing story well I write about
privacy all the time and you probably
have already gotten a sense of my
drumbeat here which is there's there's
data that's collected now about us in so
many different ways collective what
every time we make a phone call every
time we use an e-zpass every time we get
onto a subway or use public transit and
all that data is is is being used in
credible ways and meaningful ways in
some ways you know great ways for
marketers a great ways for us to
understand ourselves but consumers are
last in the bottom of having access to
that data and right to dunk to control
that data and it's it's really time that
people stood up and said enough is
enough that data is valuable it's my
property and I should get to decide what
what happens to it great Bob thanks very
much Bob Sullivan is the writer of the
red-tape Chronicles over at MSNBC if you
care about this stuff and you should you
should check that out Bob thanks for
your time thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
