according to the New York Times google
and verizon are close to an agreement
that would allow for Google's content
providers to deliver services much
quicker the catch these companies will
have to pay for such privileges which
ultimately means consumers could see
hikes in their internet charges of
course this certainly dishes a big blow
to the concept of net neutrality and
it's a bit upsetting to see that Google
is part of such an initiative in more
google news google wave the next
generation communications platform that
was essentially meant to replace email
instant messaging whiteboards and wiki's
is shutting down the service was a
real-time character by character
messaging system that in reality most
people didn't really seem to understand
in a blog post google says that although
the company was excited about it
internally the product did not have the
user adoption that Google wanted the
company does say that the technology
will still find its way into other
products and portions of it are still
open source the Federal Trade Commission
and Intel have announced that they have
reached a preliminary settlement in
their anti-competition case the
settlement prevents Intel from entering
contracts that reward customers that
only purchase intel chips or punish
others that buy chips from Intel
competitors the agreement also requires
that intel maintain PCI Express as a way
for graphics competitors to interface
with Intel chips for the next six years
in more iphone jailbreaking news Apple
has announced that it is readying a
security fix for the browser flaw that
allowed jailbreakme.com to easily
compromised iPhones no word yet on when
a patch will be released but expected
soon because the iphone dev team has
announced that a new version of the
carrier unlock tool ultrasnow is now
available now ultrasnow in conjunction
with a jailbroken iphone will allow
users to unlock their phones with
non-approved carriers those your
