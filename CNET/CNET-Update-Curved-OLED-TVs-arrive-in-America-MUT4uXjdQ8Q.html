Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update a new type of television is
coming to some stores in America this
week OLED TVs that have a slight inward
curve we first got a glimpse of this
technology at the Consumer Electronics
Show in January Samsung's curved OLED is
going on sale at specialty stores as
early as this week and LG is now taking
pre-orders in the US for its model which
would arrive in a couple of weeks but
both of these curved OLED TVs are very
pricey a 55 inch model would cost you
fifteen thousand dollars an OLED screen
could be better than LED and plasma
because it can deliver the deepest shade
of black of any TV technology samsung
galaxy s smartphones use OLED screens
but this is the first time it's put into
a TV screen the curve is supposed to let
viewers enjoy a more natural match to
their angle of view if you're sitting
between six and ten feet from the screen
we have seen it have yet to test this
tech in our labs but I'll update you and
we do and what the verdict is on how
much benefit there is to a curved screen
and if you like OLED but you don't care
for the curb Samsung is making a flat
version but we don't know when that's
going on sale in the US Google is
putting advertisements where no one has
put them before inside your email inbox
new as our appearing as emails in a
user's inbox but it's only for people
that have the new gmail layout which
uses tabs to divide emails into
different categories the ads are only
going into the promotions tab that's
where your daily deals and other store
offers already get sorted into looking
ahead Motorola is set to unveil the
hyped-up Moto X smartphone next week on
August first but there's not much
mystery left since several photos and
specs on the phone already leaked out it
looks like a mid-range phone but it
could have some cool software tricks
that make it stand out we already know
one trick apparently you don't need to
touch a button to prompt the phone to
listen to your voice command Google is
having an event to show something off on
Wednesday and we
it could be a new Nexus 7 inch tablet
this new version could have a camera on
the back based on leaked images and a
gadget worth checking out today is the
leap motion controller it's like a
Kinect sensor for your Mac or Windows PC
it's in stores now for eighty dollars
and lets users control their computer by
waving their hands it only works with
certain apps so you can't control
everything and your arms could get tired
over time which makes it more of a fun
toy than something you'd use for serious
work but be sure to check out the full
review now on cnet that's your tech news
update you can find more details at cnet

York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
