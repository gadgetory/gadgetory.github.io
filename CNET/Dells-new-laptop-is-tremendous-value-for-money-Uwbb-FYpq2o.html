it's a Dell but it's also one of the
very best notebooks you can buy for 750
dollars Dell didn't skimp on any part of
this affordable computer here's a short
list of things you won't always find in
a laptop this shape a crisp 1080p
display with wide viewing angles that
folds over backwards into a touchscreen
tablet your choice of 13 or 15 inch
screens for the exact same price a rigid
metal frame that extends all around the
edges instead of just a token layer of
rough brushed aluminum a responsive
backlit keyboard and a touchpad smooth
and accurate enough that you won't want
to scream a fast solid-state drive with
256 gigabytes of storage a place where
manufacturers usually skip six hours of
real-world battery life and my personal
favorite a special depth-sensing camera
that lets me log into Windows with my
face you can find any one of these
features on other inexpensive laptops
maybe even two or three of them all of
them come standard on this dell all of
them for $750
I've been asking PC of manufacturers for
years to make these features standard
instead of making you pay more money to
get the things you want Dells the first
one to actually do it
but there is one upsell that might
actually be worth your cash this
external battery the same kind you might
throw into a backpack to charge up your
phone and tablet this one can charge
laptops too it gave me three to four
hours of additional battery life for
about a hundred bucks
I've got a few quibbles with the dell
inspiron 7000 of course the screens a
little glossy the hinges are a little
bouncy and the keyboard is a tad shallow
but no laptop is perfect for 750 US
dollars the Inspiron 7000 comes damn
close</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
