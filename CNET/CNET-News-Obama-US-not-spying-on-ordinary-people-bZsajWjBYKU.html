transformation America's intelligence
community had to go through after 911
our agencies suddenly need to do far
more than the traditional mission of
monitoring hostile powers and gathering
information for policymakers instead
they were now asked to identify and
target plotters in some of the most
remote parts of the world and to
anticipate the actions of networks that
by their very nature cannot be easily
penetrated with spies or informants and
it is a testimony to the hard work and
dedication of the men and women of our
intelligence community that over the
past decade we've made enormous strides
in fulfilling this mission in an
extraordinarily difficult job one in
which actions our second guest success
is unreported and failure can be
catastrophic the men and women of the
intelligence community including the NSA
consistently follow protocols designed
to protect the privacy of ordinary
people they're not abusing authorities
in order to listen to your private phone
calls or read your emails when mistakes
are made which is inevitable in any
large and complicated human enterprise
they correct those mistakes given the
fact of an open investigation I'm not
going to dwell on mr. Snowden's actions
or his motivations I will say that our
nation's defense depends in part on the
fidelity of those entrusted with our
nation's secrets if any individual who
objects to government policy can take it
into their own hands to publicly
disclose classified information then we
will not be able to keep our people safe
or conduct foreign policy moreover the
sensational way in which these
disclosures have come out has often shed
more heat than light while revealing
methods to our adversaries that could
impact our
operations in ways that we may not fully
understand for years to come now the
reforms I'm proposing today should give
the American people greater confidence
that their rights are being protected
even as our intelligence and law
enforcement agencies maintain the tools
they need to keep us safe
on all these issues I'm open to working
with Congress to ensure that we build a
broad consensus for how to move forward
and I'm confident that we can shape an
approach that meets our security needs
while upholding the civil liberties of
every American the bottom line is that
people around the world regardless of
their nationality should know that the
United States is not spying on ordinary
people who don't threaten our national
security and then we take their privacy
concerns into account in our policies
and procedures this applies to foreign
leaders as well given the understandable
attention that this issue is received
I've made clear to the intelligence
community that unless there is a
compelling national security purpose we
will not monitor the communications of
heads of state and government of our
close friends and allies now let me be
clear our intelligence agencies will
continue to gather information about the
intentions of governments as opposed to
ordinary citizens around the world in
the same way that the intelligence
services of every other nation does we
will not apologize simply because our
services may be more effective but heads
of state and government with whom we
work closely and on whose cooperation we
depend should feel confident that we are
treating them as real partners and the
changes I've ordered do just that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
