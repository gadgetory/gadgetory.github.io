place as the world's most exclusive
automaker following up the previous
supercar Veyron with the all-new sure
own this car like its predecessor uses
an 8 litre w16 engine that 16 cylinders
with four turbochargers so they have two
turbochargers on each side of the engine
one on each side is always on the other
one is electrically actuated so they can
bring it up when they need the force
more air into that engine all told that
makes 1,500 horsepower now acceleration
is still 2.5 seconds to 62 miles per
hour that's very quick but about the
same as the previous one top speed
however is now 420 kilometers per hour
that's over 270 miles per hour this is a
really fast car as you can see it's
mostly engine with a couple of seats
like previously it still uses a
carbon-fiber monocoque body but now
we've got eight LED headlights in front
they've also pushed out the grill more
it's got two active aerodynamic features
a front diffuser and a rear wing and
it's got an adaptive suspension that 420
km/h can only be achieved in the top
speed mode using a special key so
normally you won't drive this car that
fast as far as exclusivity Bugatti will
only produce 500 of these cars during
its lifetime and it'll cost 2.4 million
euro so yeah for your pretty high ruler
to pick one up and also a third of them
have already been ordered</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
