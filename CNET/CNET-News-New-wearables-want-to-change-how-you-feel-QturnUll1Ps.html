watching every step you take today's
wearables know a lot about you but what
if they could do more than just monitor
here at the wearable technologies
conference in san francisco and new
generation of devices look and feel
different to the wearables you know now
the doppel is a wearable device that
sits on the inside of your wrist it
delivers a vibration that feels like a
heartbeat with the creator's claiming
that it can change the way you feel if
it's pulse it's really fast that makes
you feel more energized more alert and
if it's slow that calms you down the
user strokes the surface of the DA poles
to deliver a slower beat or squeezes it
to speed up the pace that's very intense
you know it could be a bit much because
you're just sitting down I feel very
much like I'm talking faster now like I
feel like I want to talk faster and I
feel like things are moving much more
quickly like I could get up and sort of
do jumping jacks or something like that
the aura ring looks like an ordinary
piece of jewelry but houses an infrared
LED to track your pulse a 3d
accelerometer and a temperature sensor
users can keep track of recovery levels
and sleep phases aura says users can
then adjust their daily exertion based
on how much energy the app says they
have then there's the upright a device
that attaches to your lower back to
correct your posture it vibrates when it
senses you slouch this biofeedback is
designed to train your muscle memory to
keep your back straight wearables don't
just want to monitor how you feel but
hope to make you feel better in San
