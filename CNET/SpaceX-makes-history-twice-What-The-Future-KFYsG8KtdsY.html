SpaceX makes history not once but twice
your dream of becoming a Jedi Master
becomes a step closer to virtual reality
in a hotel room that picks you up at
home on Monday SpaceX became the first
company to launch a single orbital class
rocket booster three times the Falcon 9
rocket launched from Vandenberg Air
Force Base in California once it reached
orbit the rocket delivered 64 small
satellites for various companies and
organizations now that's a record number
for a us-based rocket the first stage
landed safely on SpaceX is drone ship
station in the Pacific Ocean now being
able to reuse a rocket is key to Keylong
Musk's vision for space travel he's
trying to do it more frequently on less
money the final version of the Falcon 9
called the block 5 is designed to be
used 100 times this is the VR experience
you're looking for engineers at Virginia
Tech call this force push it gives those
of us who haven't spent years training
in a Jedi Temple the ability to
manipulate faraway virtual objects
now it's true we've seen this before in
video games but do you notice anything
different here these guys aren't holding
controllers or wearing special gloves
they're using their bare hands and it's
not thanks to an unusually high amid a
chlorine count the technology uses leap
motion to track hand movements then the
objects respond to the speed and
magnitude of hand gestures in a way
that's intuitive for the user Engineers
built the environment and the force push
interface in the Unity game engine they
used an oculus rift cd14 display no word
if they're working on jedi-like powers
of persuasion next you don't need to see
his identification okay you know how
people say they don't want to spend a
lot of money on a hotel room because
they're never actually in the room well
this one you'd never actually have to
leave it's a concept for a self-driving
hotel room because why I walk across the
Golden Gate Bridge when you can see it
from the comfort of your bed
the idea comes from a Canadian design
studio and it's pretty simple say you
live in Seattle and you want to visit
Los Angeles call the hotel room like you
would a new bur and the room comes to
your door and takes you to your
destination it includes everything you'd
expect a shower a desk a minibar you can
even get your Amazon Prime deliveries
through the roof if that service ever
takes off now once you reach your
destination the room would connect to a
larger suite that's part of the
company's hotel network the company says
the hope is to improve inner city travel
now again this is just a concept right
now but let's face it anything that cuts
down on check-ins lost luggage and
flight delays is probably a win
all right what makes you say what the
future let us know in the comments if
you enjoyed this video think about
giving us a thumbs up and maybe share it
with somebody who hasn't seen it that's
gonna do it for this week
