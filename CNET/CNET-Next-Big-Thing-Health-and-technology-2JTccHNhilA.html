the next big thing
I'm CNET editor-in-chief Lindsay
Turrentine and I'm Bryan Cooley editor
at large at C net this is our 16th
presentation of the next big thing and I
want to thank you all for being with us
many of you I've been here I think
repeatedly how many people have been to
the next big thing before show hands and
next big thing veteran so we got some
new blood to that great excellent ok so
thank you all for being with us it's
here at CES every year we want you to be
part of this conversation so please feel
free to tweet anything you want to as
long as it's nice throughout the show
use the hashtag CES nicely or hashtag
CNET at CES and we also will have as you
veterans know will have the opportunity
for Q&amp;amp;A and if you haven't already
spotted them we have a couple of
microphones here in the center aisle we
had a lot of generous amount of time
toward the end to get your questions as
well as some of the smartest questions
in the room of course come from this
panel out here our topic this year is
called the invisible doctor
it's our term for the revolution that we
are now seeing at the intersection of
devices data algorithms and the new
healthcare techniques that are coming
from all of those things this is a truly
amazing topic what's happening here is
honestly and I can really honestly say
this the most important seee topic we've
ever brought to you here at CES
virtually every category of gear and
technology you've already seen in this
very early stage of the show and that
you'll see this week will or already is
some kind of a health sensor will be or
already is something like that
so if you don't think you're in the
medical business already at some degree
in the seee space just wait you probably
are
we are going to introduce our panelists
now and I'm going to kick it off with
one of the very exciting and folks on
our enormous topic enormously important
panel we were I just want to say we are
more excited about this group of
panelists than we've ever been it's a
really interesting group no offense to
last year's painless no they were great
they were great it just gets better
everywhere the year before our first
panelist is Brook Basinger she's a
technical lead of optimal ik hardware at
verily which is a division of alphabet
otherwise known as Google
please bring Brooke on okay bring up
next please say hello to Airy gentry
researcher at the Institute for the
future in Silicon Valley please welcome
Mary paul Stirling is VP of emerging
products at United Health Group welcome
Paul we also have David rhew who is here
from Samsung he is in charge of medical
devices at Samsung Americas and dr. ian
tong rounds out our panel he's the chief
medical officer at dr. on-demand please
welcome dr. Tom hello
okay so now we've got our panel
assembled he got a little taste of the
viewpoints they're coming from
hopefully they all you can see this this
array of different POVs but let's see
where we're gonna point all those points
of view let's take a little trip into
the future of your health take a look
consumer electronics have changed the
way we connect to each other are
entertained with audio and video buy and
sell almost every product and service
and run our homes inside and out but
what's coming next may outrank all of
our current home and personal
technologies as health gets digital
connected and intelligent get ready to
get well fitness bands are yielding to a
new era of wrist-worn EKG machines blood
glucose monitoring is moving from
occasional pokes and tests to sensing at
the swipe of a phone and pills can now
tell if you've taken them or not
it's a tiny chip the size of a grain of
sand it's combined with the medication
the person swallows it hits the stomach
then a signal was beamed to a patch on
the person's skin that patch then sends
a signal to your iPhone says I've taken
the medicine
almost everything in your home becomes a
health sensor from your interactions
with your smart speaker okay google turn
up the nest to 70 degrees on cold okay
setting the hallway to 70 degrees to
benign betrayals by your fitness band
that tells when you got up they all add
up to a big picture of your personal
state going to the doctor that will
change from an annual checkup with
little or no follow up so come on over
hop on up to steppin into what's
basically a full-body Star Trek
tricorder which they've developed here
at forward they sure can flat and push
forward into the Centers there that's
perfect with it so the first thing that
this is doing is building a 3d infrared
model of your body the data from which
is exposed to modern AI techniques and
then display it in a way that sure does
make a big improvement on the old
doctors clipboard which you weren't
allowed to see anyway or maybe you'll
see the doctor at home telemedicine
visits are going mainstream a better fit
for everyone's schedule and more visits
- more hassle equals more things caught
sooner and good behaviors bolster or
maybe the doctors always at your side
conversational robots can help detect
how you feel and keep you on track with
a good regimen and physical robots will
aid mobility so that Aging in Place
becomes so common we'll just call it
aging and all of this driven by data
there are all kinds of mysteries in
health and wellness that could be
unlocked by spotting patterns we haven't
even thought to look for you that's a
lot right and almost all of it
predicated on a series of behavioral
modifications that we've almost never
seen consumer electronics get involved
in before as consumers we're gonna
become partners in our healthcare not
just submit to being work done the focus
of healthcare will truly turn from
sickness met with hyphy heroics to
really keeping you from ever needing
them and new forms of prevention and
payment to accomplish that the two
companies call this a natural evolution
as they seek to put the consumer at the
center of the health care delivery
system and all of this data somehow
brought together and put into common
format so it can be shared across new
platt
forms and offerings and that within an
industry that has already strapped for
time per patient and often locked into
the way that it does things by
regulations on one hand and how it gets
paid on the other still the potential to
radically increase our health span while
shrinking the cost of doing so makes it
imperative we at least meet the
invisible doctor
the hardest thing and of all the times
we've done the next big thing this is so
hard because you always need an opening
question is a moderator this is so huge
I don't know where to begin
Norma's right is enormous I was talking
with Brooke backstage sort of saying we
we don't we want to say what this is
what is it that we're talking about what
is this future that we're talking about
it's probably a little bit different for
each of you and I would love actually to
start with you Brooke and hear from the
perspective of somebody who actually
makes medical devices and engineers them
what is a what's a beautiful future
scenario for you so I am an engineer so
I'm fundamentally a nerd and I am very
interested in getting lots of
information so that we can then use that
information to make smart decisions
about and as I was wandering through the
North Hall earlier today looking at all
of the smart cars and the automated
vehicles that we have the autonomous
vehicles that we have I was thinking how
many sensors are in those vehicles you
imagine there's dozens maybe hundreds of
sensors that are monitoring everything
from the fluid level to the tire
pressure to how far you are from the car
in front of you and making decisions
based on that data it might be the
decision to automatically brake the
vehicle or it might be just a decision
to prompt the user to take it to the
mechanic we do similar things in health
care but we don't have nearly the same
amount of data about ourselves so what
I'm imagining is if we could actually
instrument ourselves and the space
around us to have that same level of
information about ourselves we could
then use that information to prompt the
user to take the car to the mechanic or
we could use that information to
actively make a decision that impacts
the users life maybe administrate a
medicine or like with an AED or a
pacemaker actually stimulate somebody's
heart so you could take it all the way
from the incidental interactions all the
way through to very emergency situations
so that's kind of what I'm imagining in
the future everything is a health signal
isn't it when you get right down to it
we just
haven't had a way to do anything with it
I mean isn't this isn't this whole
conference this whole Expo here
basically it was a 2.6 million square
feet of health signals at some level it
could be and then for the doctors on our
panel the medical doctors I would love
to hear from you what ian was it like
for you when you're getting all the data
you need and then you're meeting with
people remotely does all of the sensor
based future help you be a better doctor
yeah I hope so right it's uh there's a
lot of data out there and it helps me if
the data is and I say I hope so because
it helps me if the data is coming to me
it's the right amount of data and it's
really just what I need to know but not
overwhelmingly with with extra
information so you're right absolutely
there's a lot of data points out there I
see them in every Airport and along the
walkways walking people watching people
walk I'm taking some of that physical
examination and observation and in in in
in accounting for that but then also
there's there's wearable and peripheral
devices that are also giving me more
data about your heart rate your
temperature maybe your oxygen saturation
and so it has to be in context and it
has to be useful and hopefully the the
condition that you're coming to see
before is um you know it's the whole way
that data is relevant to that to that to
that problem it's not I would say it's
not always the case
so when people are out there and you
know this is a great conference and
building the devices and the technology
it's it's fantastic to see and I get
really I kind of I'm a nerd as well and
I geek out when I see all of the all of
the devices all the automation and the
things that I think can make a doctor
more efficient but I also want those
those devices to be designed so that
they support the doctor-patient
relationship because ultimately for me
as a maybe a little bit of an
old-fashioned doctor I still want to
have that connection and I just want my
work to be efficient productive for me
and also of great experience for the
patient Paul you City United Healthcare
and you guys are known for the motion
plan which is a plan where a person
can't paid up to $4 a day into a health
spending account by just wearing
basically a Fitbit - that has a little
bit of custom firmware on it so that
they can
work in a feedback loop to get you to do
good walking behaviors that's it and
that was a number that made people's
heads spin around in the industry that's
real spendable money to the tune of
almost $1,500 a year it was a major
breakthrough how do you guys take
advantage of the right kind of data and
how much other data are you gonna try
and roll in to that as that program
grows to detains question here it's like
again we got to take data but do
something with it not just drink from
the fire hose and say we go up to data
yeah you know it's a great question so I
think we start with the basics which is
we're starting from a baseline of just
provide people with some basic insight
into their state of well-being overall
right so we start with what we can
capture which is simple activity in
steps just to provide people with a
starting point to understand an
objective baseline of where they're at
right and then from there we can begin
to evolve that so once we understand
where I'm at from a simple basic
activity perspective then on top of that
you can begin to layer all kinds of
interesting capabilities in terms of
acute intervention and identification to
chronic condition management you know
condition avoidance and so forth but I
think at this point it's it's we want to
start with the basics you know I think
the the technologies and the
capabilities are you know leaps and
bounds ahead of the appropriate in in
relevant application at this point the
future is very promising that we're
starting from the point of okay let's
provide a very meaningful and relevant
baseline in an interesting engaging way
once we get people to engage and
understand where they're at then we can
begin to layer all of the the
interesting capabilities on top of that
mmm dr. rue yes you are thinking a lot
about the ways in which Samsung can
create products that work for both the
consumer and the industry as a whole can
you give us an example of something that
you think is an inspiring possibility in
the next few years in the near future
yes so when you think about healthcare
today one of the biggest problems is
that it's just too darn expensive and
and part of it is that it is very
difficult for us to kind of change the
model so we oftentimes think well maybe
if we could virtualize that care and
provide this care outside of the
hospital and we're heading in that
direction so you have opportunities with
telemedicine visits and now it's going
to be reimbursable through some recent
legislation so we're seeing headway
there but where I really see this going
is an opportunity where you can take the
entire episode component of your care
and virtualize that aspect so an example
would be if you think about a person
who's had a heart attack one of the
things that happens is they're
recommended to do something called
cardiac rehabilitation and cardiac
rehabilitation is a program that will
maybe be out six to ten weeks and it's
maybe three times a week 30 minutes or
an hour it's not that much an effort but
the fact that you're asking an
individual to do that regularly for the
next six weeks it's very unfortunate but
many folks drop out of the program and
maybe after about a week they'll do it
and then let's say I can kind of do it
on my own but they really don't complete
it but that actually has a really big
impact on their health and the total
cost of care and all the other things
too trivial to that and if you look
nationwide depending on the region the
time of year or the socioeconomic status
there whether they've got they're
working you name it you'll find that
there are a lot of variables and it
could be around ten to forty percent
completion rate for this program so what
we thought was could you virtualize that
on a smartwatch and what we wanted to do
was we want to take the same components
that were part of that cardiac
rehabilitation program and figure out a
way to determine if we could make this
easier more accessible for individuals
and what we found is that we were able
to and improve the total completion rate
from about forty percent to almost
doubling it turn eighty percent and when
we asked the cardiologist and the
clinicians that were involved with this
program you know what does that really
mean you've increased that so what is
what's the big deal
well they said for every four patients
that are being treated that are
completing this program you're saving
one life and so what we realized is that
today we oftentimes within the
healthcare system make it difficult for
the patient the consumer to do the right
thing because we've asked them to adapt
to our model they have to come to a
certain facility they have to do certain
things but can't we change it around and
have technology in the system a
to the consumer and make that more
friendly and technology is the enabler
for that and by doing that we can
achieve great outcomes improved access
to care and reduce cost briefly before
we move on to and turn a corner here
I'll Ari I want to get your take you sit
at this high level of futurism as you've
heard medical device developers and
practitioners here what kind of a
takeaway are you hearing early on in
this discussion right now that is most
important to people we're here at the
consumer Technology Association event
and consumer is the key word here but
we're talking about a lot of the stuff
on the back end so I wanted to represent
the consumer aspect of it and what I'm
starting to think of is we consider
healthcare the sort of experience where
you interact with a physician or with
someone from the healthcare economy but
what about all those other moments where
you can capture insights that aren't
necessarily medically relevant yet so I
wear a number of devices that are
capturing my vitals or my sleep
characteristics the Apple watch in the
aura ring or what I've got on right now
and these are telling me things that
shape my behavior and in fact they shape
my health so as we move to a future
where more health sensing capabilities
are pushed into our environments just
looking around the pavilions you've got
the smart home you've got autonomous
vehicles these are all going to be new
ecosystems for health sensing so what
are going to be those insights that are
going to tell us more about not just
health or I'm sorry not just about
sickness about those points of care
where we usually visit a physician but
about health and how to make small
incremental behaviors that could
actually transform how we look at system
down the pike absolutely and I feel like
you were gonna say something doctor talk
well I was just because I think um a
couple of themes that I've already come
up are really what we're talking about
here is a bit of behavior change so if
the devices are enabling that then that
that's helping the patient so that's
something that the patient can interact
with and get to the feedback that they
need from the watch to guide them
through the cardiac rehab program it's
also though that's it's it's helping
the doctor as well because I can't be
there with the patient I can't be there
taking that walk with you or walking you
through your cardiac rehab I can tell
you about it I can take the time to
maybe explain it but I have the pressure
to do all that within a twenty minute or
maybe maybe if you know very generous I
get a forty minute appointment to do
that and and it's just overwhelming for
the patient I think to absorb all of
that so this is these are the ways I
think that technology absolutely is
going to help help the patient and the
doctor organized and really March the
down the treatment plan together it's so
a human machine partnership or human
technology partnership so not only are
those visits overwhelming for the
patients and for the person it can be
overwhelming for the family and the
entire chain of stakeholders that
interact with the patients and the
physicians on the backend so technology
and algorithms that can help to assess
how we're doing when we don't even know
how to articulate how we feel those will
be tremendous shaping the future of
healthcare I think we've got some flavor
now established of this vast promise a
lot of behavioral modification a lot of
pulling in signals that are not normally
recognized as medical signals yet but
can be interpreted as such and a lot of
it going toward getting in front of
things before they're expensive and
painful and have only moderately good
outcome so you can see why this is such
a huge one but notice this is not
composed necessarily of a bunch of cool
new shiny objects which we're so used to
seeing at CES and in the seee industry
it goes after this bigger idea it's a
little more amorphous better health for
all with less effort and less cost
so this revolution it has unique and
profound benefits we're talking about
them and it's very exciting and
inspirational but there are some special
challenges and hurdles that I think all
of you are very familiar with some of
you maybe even more than others it takes
a lot to remake medicine so we're gonna
take a look here at a couple of the
challenges that we're facing
the promise of the invisible doctor is
inspiring and we can easily see a future
in which we are all empowered to take
control of our own health but health
care works differently from the rest of
the tech industry its cultural and
regulatory challenges slow our progress
toward a personal health care utopia
there's a lot to overcome consumers are
used to visiting the doctor's office to
stay healthy so convincing people to
trust new systems may be difficult we
have to believe in the tech and know
that we can rely on it when we need it
Surrey what's my heart rate and doctors
have to want to try new technology which
will change how they access information
about patients and interact with them
and may scare these professionals in a
traditionally risk-averse industry
necessary regulations slow the rate of
change even under the best circumstances
and they're in place to protect us as a
result many personal medical devices
require FDA approval which can take up
to seven years from concept to sale
that's a lifetime in the consumer tech
world and once a device or technology is
approved all of the data it collects or
shares has to comply with HIPAA privacy
rules and there are a lot of them and it
has to stay secure so that personal
information doesn't end up in the wrong
hands and so that doctors and patients
can access the information they need
from their own devices and a variety of
platforms even if we can overcome all of
the privacy and regulatory hurdles how
can we ensure that everyone can afford
the invisible doctor of the future with
so many challenges and so many players
can attack and healthcare industries
work together to solve these problems
and make the world a healthier place
this is not like other sectors luckily
as part of its because it has adult
supervision which is nice don't always
find that and part of is because their
lives and livelihoods on the line and
health absolutely I you know there's a
very fine line to walk between safe and
progress and I'm sure that for in for
instance insurance companies are
thinking about that all the time you
want things to change so that everybody
gets healthier but you also want to make
sure that we do it in the safest
possible way how do you think about this
Paul as you're looking at that
regulatory landscape and do you think
about ways to get technology progressing
faster will that help an insurance
company well I think you know so the
application of new capabilities will
certainly help not only the insurance
company but everybody in general so I
mean you know the pace is important to
to everybody you know you think about
you know some of the challenges along
the way we spent a lot of time thinking
about and talking about your meaning
from gadget to meaningful tool all right
and that means a lot of things so you
know how do we take the wealth of data
you know streaming from the human body
and how do we understand that data first
and foremost protect it right so I mean
this is very personal intimate data even
more so than you know our personal
financial information and so you know
that's the primary that's that's the
primary focus is you know how can we
enter how do we you know build an
infrastructure how do we build a program
how do we build an ecosystem that
understands and protects that data and
treats it as such number one number two
then what from there how do we move from
okay interesting gadget to meaningful
relevant capability you know and you
know that's that's a huge hurdle as well
so how do you consolidate provide
meaningful insights not only to the
individual member and consumer but I
think we heard it here earlier you know
but also back to the the care community
in the physicians and the providers and
so forth I mean so the last thing we
need is to add another stream of
extremely dense data into that ecosystem
so it's all of those things we think
about once we once we build a foundation
of trust
on this type of data then it's and how
do we with sensitivity kind of make the
transition from gadget to meaningful
tool in those ways I'd like to ask I add
that you know we work very closely with
the FDA and and I think over the past
several years there's been a renewed
focus to try to accelerate the pace in
which things get approved and they've
been looking at consumer technology and
really starting to understand that this
is creating a brand new category which
they need to start thinking about how
they can accelerate that pace and in
fact Samsung is along with several other
companies part of a pre certification
program sort of like a TSA PreCheck
which we have gone through sort of a
vetting element but after that we can go
and try to accelerate some of these
applications and solutions through that
FDA process to make it more streamlined
and to give you an idea of like you know
when we talk about how consumer
technology can be used in healthcare I
was on a plane ride where I was flying
from the west coast to the east coast
and during that time there was an
individual who came out of the bathroom
and this person collapsed and he's
unconscious on the ground right next to
me and then they said is there a doctor
10 years so I said oh my gosh I
immediately jumped what have I gotten
myself into here and he was in a very
awkward position his head was kind of
like at my my feet and his arms were
over you know over there and I had to
reach over and I could barely I felt
something but I couldn't tell if it was
his heart rate or mine I took up my
watch my smart watch and I put it on
samsung gear s2 and I put it on and then
I saw it beating at 70 beats regularly
so what did that tell me I mean was this
an FDA certified device no did this was
it like you know 100% accurate probably
not but it gave me insights one it was
there was a heart rate - it was beating
regularly and three it was not like 20
it wasn't 300 but it was 70 which was a
normal so it gave me so much confidence
so when the flight attendant came to
said do we need to land his plane right
now the pilot wants to know I said well
I I think we might be able to
you know learn a little bit more and
sure enough he came to and things were
fine
but it shows that we actually with these
devices even though they're not FDA
certified we can glean a lot of
important information when we looked at
the cardiac rehab we thought that that
would be a very difficult you know
process because that was also on a
consumer product and this is for
patients that have had a heart attack so
holy cow that's the one population for
sure you need that FDA you certify
device and when we talk to the FDA about
it we realized that what we were really
doing here was we were providing a
coaching tool it just so happened to be
in the person who had a heart attack and
that is what's missing people need
information and that information is
around is the person active or not
active are they mildly active moderately
or highly and that's highly valuable
information for health care providers to
know even though we don't have that
level of specificity that we might use
be using for a diagnosis or for a
specific element and I think that's sort
of giving us a sense that consumer
technology there's tremendous
opportunity here and we're seeing this
across the board with wearables with
virtual reality with a variety of other
things that they're using it for
treatments options that we've never
never imagined before one of the one of
the things that occurs to me is kind of
the the wetware factor involved on this
not the hardware not the software but
that patient who will look at this and
say this is an amazing discussion
they're having these guys have got their
hand on a amazing future but when I'm
sick all I want is the best doctor in my
local clinic in her white lab coat with
that Harvard diploma on the wall I'm
gonna get real conservative real fast
when it's my situation and I'm gonna say
yeah your text great you go use it on
the next person who's got a condition
Brooke for what do you guys talk about
in terms of installing I guess some
gravitas in future medicine that will
equal human delivered medicine yeah I
think you're making a really good point
that there is a range of complexity some
things at the very top end of the range
really have that gravitas they also have
that high regulatory burden on them and
some things on the lower end of the
range the wearables that you might be
wearing are simply collecting data about
how we're operating everyday and those
may have a lower regulatory burden I
think if we can feed some of that
information into the Harvard
cardiologist for example that Harvard
cardiologist then has more information
hopefully targeted information as you
were commenting on earlier they have
more information to be able to make a
more nuanced more insightful decision
that will hopefully get to an effective
treatment faster so you're making better
use of that that Harvard cardiologist or
that person or that device that is
really on the upper end of the range
you're making better use of them making
more efficient use of their time and
more efficient use of their knowledge by
feeding them the right information at
the right time and by corollary more of
us can be exposed to the best
specialists they can time share more
efficiently absolutely yes and when it
comes to changing consumer behaviors you
probably all have a little bit of
experience with this but how do you get
doctor Tong how do you get people to
change the way they think about their
interactions with their doctors that's a
great question and it's it's it's a
balance I mean I think you want to
remind them that I am the doctor I have
the white coat on I am I'm I've you know
in our instance and doctor on demand our
doctors are employed so we have a
certain amount of engagement with them
where we're able to ask that they do
wear that white coat and that they
actually do have their diploma or their
board certification behind them on the
wall so I want the I want the patient
experience to feel actually very
familiar even though we're meeting now
on a two-dimensional screen so I was
asked many years ago it's a barrier
technology as a barrier and I was like
no it's it's a window because we're
actually being able to see we're
actually see in your home now you can
walk me through and I think the
patient's very quickly realize after it
first of all when they first get on the
screen they giggle a little bit and they
smile and you're like you're not sick
but they're just I think they're excited
that the technology works and that
they're face to face with a doctor
within minutes and that's never they've
never done that before and but then it's
direct but then they get more serious as
the questions start to come out it
starts to feel like a real doctor visit
they realize they're having that and I
think you have I think staffing our
service with board-certified physician
ones was a big win a long way but then
also the credibility
the professional being there who
actually has the experience and
expertise went a long way as well I
think this is a great area to for the
emerging partnerships between consumer
healthcare and medical device design I
know from the medical device side there
are a lot of devices out there that do a
very effective job from as a medical
device but it is meant to treat a
specific disease it is something that is
given to you by your doctor you there's
a little bit of a stigma in wearing
something or using something that is
known to be treating that disease and I
think the consumer electronics field is
very good at getting high scalability
high usability developing things that
people want to use that where it's kind
of a cool factor to be wearing it rather
than a stigma so I think we're starting
to see a lot of partnerships there I
know at verily we really were born out
of Google so we come from consumer
technology but at the same time we bring
a lot of medical device expertise as
well so those partnerships I think are
what's going to help bring the devices
to a place where people are interested
in using them every day well sometimes
the patients are telling me - I had a
patient that I saw the other day on our
platform and I said you know you you're
you look like you could have the flu and
you you you told me that you've been
going to the bathroom more often and I'm
a little bit worried about your pulse
and so I started to show her on the
video where I wanted her to feel for a
pulse and she was like well can I just
yeah I can do with this and I was like
absolutely so sometimes they're teaching
us that the technology is is in their
hands and and they know how to use it
and we spent a lot of time looking at
the consumer experience with the
technology and what we found is that
there are certain groups that will
readily adopt and then there's also
groups that will not adopt and it's not
because they don't want to but there's
some barrier that occurs so if you look
at for instance like individuals over
the age of 85 this is a group that we
sometimes think is a homogeneous group
but the reality is there's a lot of
heterogeneity and is changing about 20%
of that group will be readily able to
adopt a tablet or a smartphone right but
that means about 80% will have some
challenge and it might be that maybe the
screen went to him they moved the IKE
line off to the side they got they
couldn't figure out the username
password they didn't remember which
when was the doctors on call you know
visit versus Skype and and all of those
things end up being barriers and so when
we did an analysis working with some of
our research partners into space we
found there's 43 configurations that
need to occur to make this device this
tablet user-friendly and easier to use I
mean more apart from just bigger icons
and and kind of like making it
simplified it really has to be
configured you have to lock down certain
elements you have to kind of change the
way you boot certain things you have to
auto log-in and when you do those we ran
at the National Coalition on Aging ran a
pilot using this tablet and they found
that when 225 seniors that had never
used technology before after three
months they about 80% we're using it
regularly and they were using it with a
higher level of confidence around
different types of applications and
here's the real interesting part they
actually had higher levels of engagement
a sense of decreased sense of loneliness
sense of purpose and activity and the
reason was the NCOA
had implemented a program where they
would do social media exchanges and they
would be having these challenges like
let's walk around your block this week
you know see who can do the most talk to
somebody you don't know here's a little
mind puzzle and it's very interesting
because we think of technology in many
ways is this is something that's going
to make us more isolated and more
sedentary but in folks that are already
isolated and sedentary it has the
complete opposite of the other way it's
just really fascinating interested oh
let's let's play with some toys for a
minute we after all so Lindsey make a
little show and tell we can do here
right yeah we've been talking about a
lot of scenarios here we've been talking
about what we hope for the future we've
been talking about what's when the
problems are the reality is that a lot
of these sensors are doing pretty
amazing things right now and can start
to flesh out the path forward for us a
little bit so I'm gonna start by showing
you something that I'm wearing right now
I'm gonna get real personal but I'm a
type 1 diabetic and I'm wearing a Dexcom
5g transmitter and sensor what that
means is that I have this it's a data
out right here this is my data out port
this is a sensor that's checking my
blood sugar right now and is sending it
to a phone and so this is actually been
submitted to a phone and then I'm
sharing it with my producer and with
Brian and if we can pull it up in the
sink we can sign the waiver
I signed a waiver my producer for the
last week has been playing with this and
has been like you're high this morning
insight into what other people can know
this is my blood sugar right now
yeah and and this is what it's been over
the last with us right now that's a
six-hour view you can see I was up a
little bit then I went down and and I
can have access to this in a minute to
minute basis just looking at my cell
phone I can share it with people so that
if something urgent happens if I don't
wake up and my blood sugar is very low
it can send an alert to my mom and she
can call 9-1-1 it's it's this is right
now this is really cool and it helps
really illustrate the path forward and
brian has something yes pretty new so
I'm wearing a wristband on a SmartWatch
this from a company called a live core
and it's called cardia it's about a year
in market right now and what this little
this little metal part right here in
Celso is getting a shot of it right
there this little metal part and there's
another one inside the band is basically
very simple EKG sensors and to operate
this thing if i want to run an EKG I
just basically clasp my wrist to my hand
right here and I can hit record EKGs and
this thing's gonna start to actually do
amplitude and frequency basically it's
not just pulse it's gonna actually take
a look and I think you can see that
there we can take the camera shot it's
picking up the actual rhythm of my heart
in a relatively medically accurate way
looking good doctors what am I crazy oh
and my insurer is here too so anyway
that then comes up on an app and then I
can take a look at and and see here on a
similar app or I can take my reading and
I can send that to my physician easily
shared there's also a function which I
didn't use right now while I did
actually it's recording your voice at
the same time you're doing your
reading so you can narrate your own
reading as you're doing your 30-second
test here just a couple examples of
things that are already on the market
that are doing tests that you used to
have to make an appointment and go to
the clinic at least in this case to get
and hear far more I like to save are far
more transparent this is this is a
revolution in your in your arc of your
lifetime of doing glucose monitoring
absolutely I mean I used to have to use
a machine that I put a huge drop of
blood on this was many years ago and
then wiped it off with a cotton ball and
had to hold it up to the side of the
container and kind of try to figure out
using my I guess what my blood sugar was
close now I can know at any minute at
any time and I think that this is it's a
good chance for us to start to put the
end of the show together and start to
put it all together and talk about how
we can make this real because I want our
panel to help us map out how the your
head the years the near future can help
us pass create a path to the reality of
the invisible doctor which is basically
the idea that our we are we have doctors
with us all the time we are tracking our
own information
our health is ever-present area what's
the next chapter in the future nothing
nothing difficult about that but what do
you see is tangibly the next chapter in
the future and this sort of this broad
overview of what we're talking here
devices behavior understanding data by
applying AI techniques what do you think
the next trigger might be or one of the
most important triggers to get things
moving cuz this is still pretty rarefied
stuff right yeah well one of the themes
of this talk is that all the technology
that we're using all consumer technology
is sort of health technology it's
maturing and it's giving us insights
into what's going on inside of our body
that's pairing with other advances in
technology that we're saying this isn't
just in health technology we're seeing
that all boats are rising on the tide of
AI and better algorithms so it's not
just data anymore but it's insights that
we're gathering so that's one big shift
another is the smartphone itself so
we're starting to see a lot of medical
devices starting to
with a smartphone and many of our
partners that we work with the Institute
for the future come to us with this
question of what's next after the
smartphone what should my next strategy
be and when we looked at this question
we saw that the last decade was all
about pushing every kind of capacity
including health capacities into this
four inch box but the next decade is
going to be about sort of ambient
computing ambient media and
communications where we're pushing
communications technology and
capabilities into our environment we're
also pushing that into the health sphere
into wearables ingestible x' all types
of Able's and the future of that is it's
no longer going to be wearable
ingestible embeddable but they're just
going to be the devices everything is
going to have the smart capability so
just one example is the smart pill
so that would be an ingestible that will
just be a pill in the future so that's
what we're looking out toward and the
last point is that when you see every
sort of technology becoming a health
technology the lines blur regulators are
going to have challenging time figuring
out where to draw the line between
what's medically relevant and what's
just a smart home device absolutely and
you know in healthcare do you are you
looking very closely at for instance the
smart home the connected home as a
source for information and a way to
communicate with with your subscribers
yeah I mean absolutely so you know you
know engagement in in the you know
engagement in one's own healthcare is
critical for us right and so all of the
key all of the ways all of the
capabilities that you can engage with
somebody we're absolutely interested in
so you know all of the the smart device
you know any any engagement path that is
interesting and relevant to consumers is
critical for us to to to analyze and
take a look at and bring into the
picture you know we don't want to lock
into one mode or methodology or medium
it's all about you know mass
customization may not be the right word
but it's it's personalization
right it's how do I want to consume this
data and how do I want to interact with
this data and make this data meaningful
for me first and then how do I want to
bring that data into the healthcare
system second we're about to go in a few
minutes to take some questions from you
guys as well so just note if you want to
start lining up at the microphones in
the center aisle here if you've got a
question for our panel or we're just a
few minutes away from getting to that
point as we continue to work through
here how we get the rubber to hit the
road in this in this revolution I we're
talking to before in the green room
about how this to my mind is somewhat
analogous to the electric car revolution
electric cars are taking some pretty
good market share you know a couple
three percent depending how you measure
it and given markets but it's not really
being drawn through by Organic consumer
demand most of it is because we've been
told we shall either by regulations
around inner city core types of driving
that's allowed or by incentives which
are obviously a big part of it or by
kind of a general idea that car makers
are feeling the heat and they're getting
ready to start to turn out the lights on
combustion engines it's somewhere down
the road these are external factors
working on the consumer who might not
have gotten there on their own some of
this feels like it might go the same way
because let's face it most of us were
sitting here in this room talking about
it because most of us are happy to kick
the can in our health and say I'll get
to it later and we're not motivated
we're much more motivated about what's
new on Netflix so where is is this push
or pull that's really gonna make this
happen in all honesty I think there's
there's pieces of it coming from both
sides as I spoke about earlier when you
have something that really is a medical
device that is directed towards a
specific disease that's really the
doctor pushing or that's the disease
pushing and telling you that you have to
do it I think there's some pull from the
type of people who are in this room who
we're just interested in being good
consumers of their own data people who
are interested in the next devices so
they're pulling what I'm a little
concerned about is that space in between
people who are not yet diagnosed as
having a disease but could still benefit
from some of that health information
somebody who's maybe pre-diabetic if we
can make it easy for them to get these
signals about them
even if they're not super tech even if
they're not interested in having the
latest gadgets you know perhaps as we
expand beyond first world countries and
into other types of populations how can
we make it easy for them to get this
information about themselves and I think
it is about building this ecosystem of
things that are around you incidentally
that will help pull just enough
information together to help feed smart
decisions so I think it's pushing from
the disease pulling from the tech
community but then finding that middle
ground that's a little bit ignored right
now and trying to make sure that we
address that population as well I think
in addition to making it easy you've got
to make sure that there's value that the
consumer finds great value in using if
there's something that's either
enjoyable or creating safety or there's
solving some unmet need that drives that
level of consumer adoption towards that
and if you find that then that's where
you're gonna really see that big
disruption I mean what we think a lot
about you look at different technologies
today a lot of it's about what's
happened in the past or what what's
currently happening but really where
it's heading is how can you prevent
things from happening and in order to do
that you've got to be able to have some
mechanism where you're seamlessly
capturing that data you're analyzing and
you're being predictive and you're
you're understanding who is at risk for
certain types of bad things and then
informing the right people so they can
take the right actions to prevent that
and I think that's where we're really
heading it's about trying to create that
value proposition both for the consumer
but also for the enterprise and the in
the healthcare system and the folks that
really care about this from an overall
ecosystem perspective and when you marry
those together then you have a very
powerful solution you know if it's just
one it's really hard if it's just giving
technologies who consumer and expecting
them to get better by themselves it's
really hard this makes me this reminds
me of the first time I picked up my
phone for my morning before I got in the
car and it just said oh it's 42 minutes
to the office the first time that that
happened and I didn't ask for it but I
was very happy to get that information
no I was very pleased and I it do you do
you
as a panel see a future where that
starts to happen in our medical lives
where we've given a certain amount of
permission to the devices in our lives
to look into what we're doing and then
we get a message I don't know I really
hope so I think it's not just changing
the you know the behavior of the patient
but I feel like it's incumbent on the
providers and the technologists and the
the larger healthcare ecosystem to
create an experience that the patient
doesn't want to come to interact and to
and to have a strong doctor-patient
relationship I think you're right a lot
of people don't don't they don't want to
see their doctor I learned this a very
you know very humbling for me because I
thought I was really great to become a
doctor and everybody's gonna just like
to meet me and talk to me behind me
about their vision and and I can help
them and I realized and my program at
the VA ten years ago where I was taking
care of homeless veterans and the
veteran and we set up this an encampment
where they could come and get dental and
legal and medical and food and clothing
and I thought gosh this is gonna be
great let's get all the doctors there
everybody's in place and you know 8:00
a.m. the the veterans start to arrive
and then it gets to about noon and
everyone's having lunch and we haven't
had a single patient come through the
medical tent yet I was like what's going
on and so I started walking around and
they you know they were getting their
dental they were getting their legal
issues resolved they were getting if
they were getting these other parts of
their life in order so I think it taught
me a lesson that health care is not
going to always be the number one
priority for people it's very important
to me but but I needed to start figuring
out how to bring the health care to to
the patient you know it's really funny
because we have been looking at ways
that you can provide greater levels of
engagement through technology and
there's a really nice VR story where
there was individuals that were being to
talk about hypertension and the impact
that salt has on on the blood pressure
and of course everyone says oh yeah we
know we shouldn't put salt in in the
diet
well the team at in Los Angeles
associated with cedars-sinai did a
clinical or study where they actually
created some videos with a company
called apply VR and that and the video
was was really just like you're in the
blood vessel and you can see all the
blood you know but you know a little
pill eight platelets and rub RBC is
floating by for a normal person then now
you've added salt and also
sir shrinking and you're like oh my gosh
it's really tight inside here and and
then you see your heart and your heart
is like under stress and oh my gosh is
that why my blood pressure is so high
and you're connecting the dots and then
they asked these individuals you know it
was a church with predominantly
african-american mothers that were
feeding you know that we're creating
meals for their children and they said I
didn't realize that the salt that I was
adding which I thought was just pure
purely based on taste is having this
medical impact and we realized that we
could through visualization visual
storytelling directly influenced their
behavior by using this as a tool to then
and then we asked them all right I
should say this the researchers asked
them a week later you know how are you
doing and they said well we really cut
out salt from our cooking and that's the
type of approach that we need to start
thinking about little out-of-the-box you
know using some of these really
innovative tools to try to get people to
really change their lifestyle and their
behavior to want to do things because
now it's not about them it's about the
fact that they're caring for their loved
ones and when you you kind of solve that
problem then you have really the
ingredient on how you change the
behavior to improve one's health and
everyone else yeah we know we all know
how many people they've been almost
every family has someone who takes care
of everyone else and lets themselves go
that's also the old saw about doctors
right
I mean who often take care of their
their their huge patient body but maybe
let themselves go they're the last ones
to stop smoking you know back in the 80s
let's get to our to the best moderators
in the room which are you and we've got
a nice line of people here at the
microphone please come on and give us
your name there and tell us there's very
shortly who you're with and what your
question is so go ahead
hi my name is Joseph and myself I am
computer science researcher working out
artificial intelligence
okay and so you know we work with data
and this digital how that actually my
company is working on the automated
diagnosis from like CT stuff but okay
but this is no consumer electronics and
this the data is not like it's from the
medical those kind of kind of
professional device so a natural
question now that we have from our
perspective is that you know now at the
early stage we're imagining what we can
deal with this but what I'm wondering
what we cannot do with it what's the
limitation of all the data we can get
and we can talk about you know the
current sensor is you not mature enough
we still have improvement making it more
precise but suppose that all the sensors
like whatever EKG or blood sugar there
are as you know accurate eyes it can be
done you know the the best one you know
it's as good as professional but
combining all those data all those you
know those sense sense data we get from
a person in using those electronic
consumer devices what can we do at most
so like what as a so where's the
limitation is it on techniques is it on
bandwidth to be able to grapple I've
already heard from in a couple
conferences we don't even process one
percent of the data we're already
gathering about people where's where's
the bottleneck if you will I think
there's a couple I think from a
regulatory perspective there are some
limitations around reliability and
robustness I think from a privacy
standpoint there are going to be some
limitations around how we share this
private information but I think there's
also a usability limitation that we have
to be able to sort through all of these
you know multiple disparate datasets in
order to find the the nugget of
important information that is needed to
feed a doctor or to feed the patient
some tidbit that they need and I think
that's going to be the biggest
bottleneck in the near future is trying
to take all this these new datasets that
haven't really existed before and figure
out how to blend them together and how
to pull the right insights from them
okay let's keep a little lightning round
pace going thank you sir
let's go our next question here I want
to keep many questions as we can go than
even patient waiting in line what's your
question and is it for a particular
member of our panel or the whole panel
go ahead
oh it's for anyone Judy Rosen strike
consultant and public policy my question
concerns the social determinants of
health and the disparities that we're
all aware of when it comes to health so
I would like some commentary correlating
relating what we've learned from you
today
with the whole issue of the social
determinants of health which have been
come to recognize be recognized by the
healthcare community in the last five
years or so as major determinants of
someone's health but in fact there are
great disparities when we're talking
about population health and when you're
talking about all the medical devices
that are very impressive this reminds me
of some of those disparities for people
of various incomes so I can these
technologies level the socio-economic
imbalances and and perhaps are they
available to all yeah all the
availability that's my question sure
inspire sampling us and this is a good
question yeah I think so so you know you
know it's you know it's critically
important that any solution that we put
out there based on these technologies
nice capabilities you know has mass
appeal right so that this access to the
the capabilities and in the promise of
these technologies has to have broad
appeal has to be has to have mass
applicability this isn't a tailored
answer I think the the promise of what
we've talked about here today is
important for everybody all populations
all demographics socioeconomic it that
you know it's we're all facing we're all
you know we're all humans we all have
we're all facing the same health
conditions right and so so to the degree
that these capabilities can help us
understand identify intervene avoid the
acute manage to chronic you know I think
it needs to be broadly applied and
should be broadly apply now if cost is a
concern you know and as we all know the
cost curves and how those play out over
time but but it needs to be applicable
to the broad population I make about
seee it drives cost down we're not
talking about quarter-million-dollar
your drug regimens here we're talking
about things that are relatively and
going this way in price and relatively
affordable I would hope all I was just
gonna add was that the adoption of the
the smartphone actually is pretty
ubiquitous so so it's not it's not I
think actually it is leveling
playing field a bit I have I sponsor
kids that are at risk youth to do a
summer rugby program every one of them
has the equivalent phone if not the
newer version smartphone so and we built
our service to be able to have access to
give those patients access to our
platform at a reduced cost so when you
look at telemedicine in general there's
a number of studies that have tried to
show that it does reduce cost a very
recent one with Rand but you said that
it that it actually did not but I can
tell you that the data that we have and
this has been audited by a third party
actually shows that our visits in the
primary care space are able to actually
reduce the cost of health care and these
were as a match cohort of in office
practice compared to a telemedicine
visit so I think we are driving down the
cost of care I think we have to have
solutions like this that will make the
care more scalable but actually can can
i think level the playing field the one
last thing I'll just say is an
interesting piece of data what we're
getting is we can geolocate you so we do
locate every patients so now we can see
what's happening down to your zip code
and your block which i think is another
way to identify hotspots and things that
are going on in a neighborhood that
otherwise might not have access to to
the health system large Health System
the Stanford or or Harvard's okay last
question sir next in line let us know
who you are and what your question is
you get the last word go ahead I'm Alex
and I'd like to talk about urine let's
just say hypothetically I had a
connected toilet or urinal whatever on a
daily basis right what kind of value do
you collectively the panel think could
come from analyzing that data on a
regular basis I mean the flush has a
signature right a flush doesn't looks
like nothing else in the house looks
different than hand-washing
what's different than dishwashers and
Coler just announced an alexa compatible
smart toilet and you know i told you all
my story of my diabetes diagnosis yeah
is that a possibility yeah we've
actually talked about this for quite
some time so it's a good idea and we've
been thinking about it and I know others
have as well there is a lot of
information that can be gathered from
the urine and there's a lot of also
information that also ties into the
timing of
frequently your going you know so
there's tremendous amount of information
we just haven't used the tools yet in in
a way that allows us to be able to
derive some some meaningful insights but
yes it is one of multiple different ways
that we can gather information and it
probably as the technology improves we
can probably do a lot with it at the
highest level of care right intensive
care unit they measure that is one of
the main things that are measured every
day pretty cheap this question came up
at our 10 year forecast last year so we
polled the audience of several hundred
and while it was interesting to some
myself included most people were so
creeped out that they wouldn't even try
it
this is surveillance at the maximum so
there's always those levers pushing on
new technology personally it would be
interesting it is a thing that you use
every day so hopefully that could be
another thing it tracks the good news is
I think our panelists can stick around
for a few minutes after the bad news is
we're completely out of time so please
thank our panelists here at the next big
thing
Brooke facing here from barelly Airy
Gentry for mister new for the future dr.
David rhew from Samsung Paul sterling
from United Health and dr. Anton from
dr. on-demand thank you so much for
