days thanks to really cool devices like
the oculus rift and Sony's project
Morpheus but there's one major problem
these things are pricey I'm dan Graziano
in today's how-to I'm going to show you
how you can create your own virtual
reality headset out of a pizza box now
luckily we had an office pizza party a
few days ago so I have plenty of
leftover boxes but you can use any kind
of cardboard although a thinner piece
will be easier to bend and fold we are
using Google's cardboard design files to
build the headset they recommend you
pick up two strips of adhesive backed
velcro a pair of lenses that have a 45
millimeter focal distance a neodymium
ring magnet and a ceramic disc magnet
all their supplies you will need include
a pair of scissors glue an exacto knife
or a box cutter so let's get started you
will need to print out Google's
cardboard design templates I recommend
using a color printer as it will make
things easier down the road when you
have those carefully cut out the design
files with a pair of scissors take your
time and you want to be really accurate
with this next you are going to glue the
two pieces with the light numbers on top
of the two pieces with the dark numbers
once that's done glue the files onto the
cardboard and use your exacto knife or
box cutter to carefully cut them out now
that we've done that it's time to fold
the cardboard if you use the color
printer you want to fold inwards on the
red lines the flap furthest to the right
should be folded over the piece to its
left and glued down you will also want
to glue the three eye pieces together
then gently slide your lenses into the
eyepiece Lotz place the ceramic disc
magnet in the circle on the far right
flap and the ring magnet behind it now
it's time to assemble the headset place
the eyepiece in the slots near the
opening for your nose fold the cardboard
from the right and attach each slot to
the grooves in the eyepiece then fold
the flap on the left up and glue it to
the rest of the headset finally connect
the eyepiece divider in the front of the
device attach the two pieces of velcro
to the corners of the top flap with
other two on the top of the card
bored the last thing you will want to do
is download the Google cardboard app on
your Android device from the Play Store
then just open it place your phone in
the cardboard and start looking around
if you're worried your phone may fall
out google recommends using a rubber
band to keep it in place let's face it
not all of us exceed it in art class if
your cardboard is a little shaky you can
use some glue or even duct tape to keep
it together this is a really cool idea
and with enough patience and time you
could pull it off but I also recommend
checking out one of the numerous easy to
assemble kits that are also available
these can be cheaper and remove the pain
of tracking down the proper magnet and
lenses to learn more about Google
cardboard and for the links you need to
get the job done check out my article on
how to cnet.com you can also reach out
to me on Twitter with any questions or
comments I'm Dan Roger and for CNET
