complained that consumer technology is
somehow dehumanizing and let's face it
it is largely virtual and
representational using pixels
synthesized voices avatars all to create
this sort of XY universe
maybe that's why 3d gesture technology
sparks everyone's imagination
it sort of reinstall human into the
space we track all ten fingers it's very
precise and very low latency and what
that gets you is touch-free controlling
of the computer makers elite motion and
vision people may be using this for
robotic surgery twisting the phone in
your wrist twice quickly causes the
camera app to launch from any
application or when the device is asleep
and then I can grab different pieces you
can do all this with a key power Mouse
but you know you wouldn't be able to do
it nearly as fluidly and as easily as
you can with this controller some
numbers that move us beyond niche in
2017 ABI predicts 30% of smartphones
about 600 million of them will ship with
gesture tech that year some 40% of new
cars will have some kind of gesture tech
by 2023 according to IHS and the 3-d
gesture tech market expected to grow
from 2 billion dollars to 15 billion in
the next five years
3d gesture technology will probably do
best in its initial years when it's
simple and appropriate almost aha simple
I also think it's gonna be a good
example of a technology that augments
many others and replaces very few some
of the hurdles I'm looking for to see 3d
gesture cross as it moves to ubiquity
include higher precision a lot of the
things on 3d gesture technology right
now are coarse and laggy compared to
even a $7 Mouse that's not gonna work
for long as you get greater precision
you actually get greater ease more than
greater power this is about a hundred
milliseconds of latency with this demo
from Microsoft's Applied Sciences group
is using 2d gesture a touchscreen but it
still makes it very clear what happens
when the technology improves past a
certain point on the continuum
all of a sudden it's utterly different
not just better then there's user
discrimination really good 3d tech
tomorrow has to be able to tell me from
someone around me focus on my gestures
filter out there's then there's
personalization a recent University of
st. Andrews study found that users were
able to master 44% more gestures when
they devised them themselves as opposed
to just learning ones the manufacturer
set up on the technology prove it to
yourself next time you go to dinner with
friends notice how differently everyone
gestures even if they're talking about
the same topic a killer out and I mean
application not software app the first
big one was honestly the clapper next
probably Nintendo Wii now it's time for
the third that really leverages our
smart Mobile's and finally there's
simple because to me complex gesture
technology is kind of the mother of all
oxymorons
now notice I left out fitness and body
monitoring technology some put that in
the gesture category but I see it as a
different variant that's more passive
data probing as opposed to 3d gesture is
simple control technology for its
intuitive simplicity and the way it
injects human behavior into digital
living 3d gesture is a technology like
no other
