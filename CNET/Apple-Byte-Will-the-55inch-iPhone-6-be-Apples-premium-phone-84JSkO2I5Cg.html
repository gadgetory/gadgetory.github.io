the apple pie for all the good and bad
inside the world of Apple this week
Google takes on Apple on almost every
front possible and sep tember 19th could
be the magic date for the next iphone
let's get to it and the reason we talked
about competing products sometimes is to
give you all an idea of the entire tech
landscape and how it might affect Apple
because there's plenty of you that think
apple is the only tech company and I
know this because of the emails you
write me now Google is going for the
full court press at Google i/o after
they announced their plans to target the
living room with their Android TV and
improved chromecast that can mirror
exactly what's on your phone the
infotainment space in your car with
Android auto a handoff flight capability
between Android phones and Chromebooks
and their full rollout of Android wear
now LG Samsung and the super sexy moto
360 watch will be the first to feature
of Google's wearable operating system
and this was the perfect chance for them
to steal some of apple's thunder and
show us why we really should even care
about a SmartWatch but instead it fell
flat and we were able to order a pizza
in 20 seconds no one has figured it out
and it still gives Apple an opportunity
to do something different but the more
and more I see these demos the less
interested I get now I don't speak for
all of you but I don't even know if
Apple can justify the need for a
SmartWatch and I use my phone to tell me
the time over my actual watch in here
right now it says it's 324 what about
you just check it out and if we get the
same time that's cool now a recent
Reuters report claims Taiwan's want a
computer will start mass production of
apple SmartWatch in July with a display
that will likely measure 2.5 inches
diagonally and is slightly rectangular I
really hope this is a rumor because I
don't want a big ass screen on my wrist
that looks like I'm an NFL quarterback
Andy news and rumors in the iphone space
multiple
sources are reporting that September the
19th is the date we should expect the
new iphone to go on sale about a year
after the debut of the iPhone 5s
deutsche telekom started claiming that
date in may and now chinese internet
company Tencent is also saying that's
the date iphone releases have always
been on fridays just like jordans drop
on saturdays but this is still very
speculative alright bloomberg has
confirmed multiple reports that both the
4.7 inch and the 5.5 inch rumored iphone
models will go into production in july
we've seen plenty of leaked images and
dummy units floating around that people
are paying for and the report adds that
both may be available at the same time
that magic month in September and if you
want a sneak peek of your leaked
manufactured part of the week here you
go these are the alleged front and backs
of the 5.5 inch LCD screen for the next
iPhone so you can tell your mom that a
new phone is coming really soon and
next-gen iphone rumors have also talked
about optical image stabilization with
modules produced by InvenSense but
analysts are predicting that feature may
be limited to the larger 5.5 inch iphone
and used as a differentiator for making
it a more premium phone due to supply
constraints as well we've also heard
rumors at only the larger iphone 6 would
use a sapphire display instead of
Gorilla Glass but it seems like a total
shift in strategy compared to what Apple
is done in the past so we'll just keep
waiting out all the rumors until this
thing is actually released and yes that
mystery 12-inch MacBook Air with a
rumored retina display that we never saw
at WWDC is expected to begin production
in the third quarter according to a
report from digit times they claim the
actual industrial design will be similar
to the current heirs but will feature
design changes with a battery and the
internal layout all right guys and gals
the world cup is in full swing and how
can you not love what Team USA is doing
also the performance from my brother
from another mother Neymar go
00
oh and the cannibal Earthwise Jose
Suarez who was tweeted by Snickers to
just grab a Snickers next time if he's
really hungry now players have been told
by FIFA that they are not allowed to
wear beats headphones in the stadium
during games because of a licensing
agreement with Sony that competes with
beats that sucks for Apple but if
there's a conversation about Beats you
know Kanye West has to be a part of it
now in a recent ad week interview kanya
said the Apple beat steal only came
about because apples rival Samsung inked
a deal with jay-z and earned what he
called cultural credibility hey Kanye
just because you're jealous of dre and
jimmy iovine maybe for once you should
just give someone credit where credit is
due wait wait wait credit me a lot
credit couple weeks ago I was an escape
for you and there was lifting weight and
I will do all that and stop for you and
I see no credit for myself you even they
gave credit for that guy sipi some juice
in a cup then I got none all right well
um cell so they are interrupting the
show and um I apologize ok sorry I will
I'll take care of it okay yeah yeah all
right you know what isn't Brazil playing
the whole cup right now yeah it's like
throwing a ball to a dog alright guys
that's gonna do for this week's show
send us your emails to the apple byte at
cnet com or tweet me at brian Tong
thanks so much for watching we'll catch
you next time for another bite of the
Apple
hey Brian bargain tea is my favorite
