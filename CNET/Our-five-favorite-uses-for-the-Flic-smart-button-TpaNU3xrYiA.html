with tons of random stuff this thing
works with platforms like if and Tasker
so it can control your apps and your
devices but after a few days of working
with flick I wanted to show you five of
my favorite uses with this device right
here the first place I put a flick was
on the inside of my front door so
anytime I'm leaving the house I can
press it once and it'll turn off all the
lights in the house if I'm trying to get
out of the house fast and I can't find
my phone I can press this flick twice
and my phone will sound so I can find it
even if it fell out between the couch
cushions
I usually use my phone as my music
player in the car
but being distracted while driving is
really dangerous so I put a flick in the
car and now with a couple of taps I can
play my music I can go back or I can
skip songs communication while driving
can also be kind of a distraction but by
installing a flick I can send the text
to my significant other saying I'm on my
way home I can answer a call or if I
have an Android device I can have my
phone
read me incoming text you see finally
you can use a clip that comes with the
flick to use it as a safety wearable
whether you're a kid an elderly person
or you're just a student who has to walk
across campus alone at night
this device lets you press a button to
send your GPS location to a trusted
friend or family member in case of
emergency these are only five of the
many functions that flick can perform
well I'd like to see more features where
you could say order food or control
devices like say your TV I'm really
happy with what they've got now and I'm
excited to see the future of this
