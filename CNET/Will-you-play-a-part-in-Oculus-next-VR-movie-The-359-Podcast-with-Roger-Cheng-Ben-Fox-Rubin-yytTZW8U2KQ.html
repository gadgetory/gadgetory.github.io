Fox Rubin woo welcome happy thursday
thursday already that means it's a la
 i look for us i know it just zip by
earnings that's how it happened awesome
yeah i love u ur you've got a cup you've
got one today so I've got to Amazon
tonight and they're expected to post a
big profit so we see if Jeff Bezos
actually follows through with that by
the way did you know Jeff Bezos with
some Star Trek the last short cut yeah
yeah yeah I saw those stories that guy
is living out every single one of his
childhood dreams so that's what you can
do when you're a billionaire I should I
should have become a billionaire what
was I hey I know your career path was
away messed up we chose journalist
terrible um so welcome to the 259 sorry
for a little ramble where we're just
about to start taping we're gonna be
talking about a couple stories time on
oculus and sort of the the next
evolution of VR entertainment and our
storytelling if you are storytelling and
how you know us the audience will
potentially play a part in it and then
we'll be talking about Facebook
Facebook's earnings Grand Slam thanks to
mobile and their surprise yeah not
really well and then lastly Apple song
it's billion phone who's got your son
stats for the podcast I know that's what
you all come for stats three days
running of apple stuff on the podcast
yeah I know we'll try to do better next
week we have to redirect to Pokemon go
or sometimes I feel like our audience is
craving Pokemon go stuff which by the
way i evolved a what's the one with two
heads yesterday inter de mando do today
oh it's crazy i'm super proud of myself
i I only know that because I did the
same thing like a few days ago yeah
they're a lot of them out here right
them and zubat Saudis lots of piggies I
got I got a Pokemon go reference into
the podcasts there you go happy about
that all right as always if you have any
questions about the topics of the day
leave them in the comments section our
producer Brian will pick out the best
questions we will try to answer them to
the best of our ability after the f
the pot after the the formal taping of
the podcast so I uh Brian while we get
started ready to take away menu are all
right to plug in 3 2 welcome to the 359
when we talk about the top tech news of
the day and all the other crap we want
to throw in I'm Roger Cheng I'm Ben Fox
Rubin so our own Jones salzman chatted
with the co-founder of oculus story
studio who hinted that the next chapter
v our entertainment content be putting
us in the story are you at the story
rather the piece right did I yes of
course I read it yes it shows piece I
hope you read it I read it in VR alright
what do you think those that is that
what's going to get us to finally
embrace virtual reality in a real way
maybe I look I think it's a really
exciting idea to create this new form of
storytelling but at the same time like
the movies probably took years I would
imagine to really try to develop like
what it is that's unique about the
movies right I think the same thing as
can be said about VR it's gonna take a
long time for them to tool or sugar out
what exactly it is yeah vr has its own
challenges right like because it's
completely immersive 360 the director
really has to tell the viewer way to
look you know what's-what's or the
relevant point of reference right so
yeah the action would be happening in
one direction you could be staring at a
completely different direction well
that's so that's a very good point I
actually tried like like a small vr
story yeah in Google cardboard and I
kind of felt like they're just
constantly creating my head to try to
figure out where that point of reference
was yes that was like they were trying
to embrace what it is to have VR where
it's like 360 but I just kind of felt a
little annoying look maybe the idea of
putting you in the content have you
direct the traffic so to speak a little
bit will definitely kind of help with
that yeah we'll see definitely all right
next up Facebook had another strong
quarter no surprise there and again it's
all about mobile so what was what was
kind of interesting about this is that
Facebook live has now emerged as like a
really important way yep to share
breaking news which gives facebook even
more importance in our lives I know it's
so I think for a lot of people that's
where they're getting their news right
now that's where they're getting their
news and video yeah so yeah with
Facebook a lot they definitely have a
hit on there
I mean periscope and meerkat kind of you
know the fate of it right like it
started with me or cat you believe this
go right maybe periscope to a certain
extent but yeah meerkat is already
pivoted periscope isn't really a
significant and Facebook live has really
taken off so right I mean we'll we'll
see what they do to try to continue to
monetize it I guess because I don't
think that they're doing that much with
it but as people continue to use it it's
just another way to get you to just
spend your life on facebook yep which is
sadly what I do so one quick statistic
to is that mobile ad revenue the bread
and butter is ad revenue yeah from
mobile eighty-four percent of the total
without really impressive I mean that's
a real contrast from a few years ago
when their strategy was completely
scattershot they didn't know what they
were doing mobile and all the Sun
they're back in it yeah all right lastly
it's official apple last week sold its
one billionth iphone now i have some
interesting stats it actually took 27
years to sell 1 million pcs 131 years to
get 1 billion cars on the road globally
and 49 years for Disney's theme park so
welcome it's one billionth guest and the
iphone is only nine years old so pretty
impressive right yes you also
self-serving yes fine absolutely fine a
job good job Apple kudos Apple yeah for
taking all of our money but the real
question is what happens with the next
billion right like does Apple sustain
its momentum for the last nine years oh
god probably not i mean like we've
already been seeing you know some sort
of stutter with that big smartphone so
we've been at Peaks we've been at peace
smartphone for a while right yeah i
would i would say so but good for them
for getting to a billion that quickly
it's yep really impressive so and it's
all because of the iphone SE no that's
not true i'm probably not your last
reason they got all right y know more
about these stories check us out on cnet
I'm Roger Cheng I'm Ben Fox Rubin thanks
for listening and that's a cut on the
recording oh my god we actually made
right at four minutes amazing right we
are getting good at this we only had to
do almost a hundred of us
all right where they six right cheese it
took eighty six rides 86 yeah that I
would have never never expected that
yeah alright well look we've by the way
the other stat they gave that I think it
says much longer Cole Cole stat was
actually kind of cool 58 years to
manufacture 1 billion gallons of Coca
Cola syrup yes 1 billion per row so
these are these are definitely
self-serving numbers but they're it's
definitely impressive I mean we're
talking about the billion pcs 27 years
to sell 1 million pcs he's built by
everybody don't buy everybody whereas
these are a billion just iphone right it
was just smartphones that's one thing
but this is just it's one brand one
company yeah pretty impressive I would
say so yeah do we have any questions
right don't require we taking questions
we haven't gotten anything yet then it's
thursday yes i know it's everyone's on
vacation um no I guess we're not taking
questions we'll just I mean if there any
questions a pop-up definitely jump in
but well I'm kind of interested would
you guys participate in a VR movie
personally uh yeah I mean I look I think
the idea of the pitches up that's always
been given to me is imagine yourself in
an episode of Game of Thrones or you're
like in the middle of the battle like
yes sign me up for that completely you
know the story it sort of takes it
almost to the next level where you may
not be like the main character but
you're a side character we can actually
affect or interact with the scene around
you I mean it's not going to be a game
of thrones per se it would probably be
some sort of computer-generated thing
but that idea is definitely has a lot of
potential for me like I find that really
fascinate yes definitely as an ideal
however going back to what I said during
the podcast I think it's gonna take a
really long time for them to get there
oh yeah so we try to tool around and
figure out like what actually makes
sense to have a character influencing a
storyline what are you actually supposed
to look at what's the pacing different
things like that yeah but my guess is
gonna be really like this is a lot of
these experiences are the way relatively
short to 15 20 minutes like I don't
imagine you sitting there we're standing
there with your the
our goggles for an hour and a half two
hours that just seems like a really
excessive amount of time to be in a VR
system like I don't know how long you
spent using like the vibe with the
oculus rift it's it's not that
comfortable after a while like yeah if
you start to feel the weight that I
behind said yeah yeah definitely it
would also be interesting to see what
level of interaction you might have with
like other people let's say you're all
watching like a movie together or like
whatever you would describe yeah yeah
yeah what the social ramifications are
for this you you're not veering into
like there was there was a lot of this
and dymond age which is uh which is a
book I don't read I'm illiterate who was
I Stevenson I'm gonna say neal
stephenson okay so and someone was for
it was this interactive like theatre
show we were like part of the show and
it was it was like this cacophony of
activity again um that was that was kind
of what was perceived where there was
this big social element and there was no
such thing as like a fourth wall you
were like part of the action so was
there that that was the plane the West
in Chelsea right Oh God but was a new
bras yeah I forget the for the name that
right right i really look it up but it
said say interactive play where it's
like multi feels much more techie focus
so yes exactly was it Hamlet or was it
if it was the one that's at the hotel
yes ah man I'm blanking right now yeah
I'm just say Williams can't remember but
it's it was one of the Shakespeare plays
but it was like played like a different
accent it four floors and you can walk
up and down and could reverse the
sequence and it was each act was and is
totally interactive like you could like
go on part of it you can walk around it
you can talk i think you could talk to
the actors they don't respond back to
you but like they're still doing their
whole play but that's kind of like we
should get scotts time to talk about
this stuff which I feel like that's
that's all he ever does when he has time
office yeah weird interactive place and
they tweet about the style more speak no
more sleep no more okay all right yeah
the okay so consider that yeah you don't
have to leave your house yeah that would
be the VR benefit potential is promising
it
i I just I think it's very cool that
oculus is trying to do this yep I just
think that they're gonna have a lot of
like hits and misses on their hands
until they actually figure out what
exactly right it's interesting that the
the co-founder of luck Astoria studios
is for more pics our guy yeah that's you
know it says a lot for the credit there
so this street cred yeah you basically
like you can't do anything animation
related without going to like Pixar
DreamWorks dream mark story works you
know all right so a nuke as a question
yeah it's a bit off topic but he he
wants to know if you would recommend
waiting or going ahead to buy the
current macbook pro that's way off topic
but we can answer that question we did
you guys are the experts I would
probably wait wait when's the next
macbook pro expected to come out not in
September right I think there's gonna be
a refresh but the thing is it's well
actually you could technically by now
you could but they look the the key
issue is that the latest processor
that's out there or there won't be like
another new processor that comes out
this year from Intel right so there's
not gonna be like a faster step up next
generation a macbook pro they might come
out with one that's got some like more
resonance yeah but they always think
something in terms of pure speed and
processing power you're not gonna get
that huge step up not until next year at
least so I'm kind of sort of maybe in
the market for a new laptop okay and dan
ackerman our PC guru says you can't go
wrong getting a macbook pro because
there's the macbook lowes macbook air
right you are going to spend a little
bit more money on the macbook pro
obviously but out of the entire line
it's kind of the best of all worlds yes
oh yeah you're not gonna be disappointed
I guess if you do end up yeah my point
is that I don't think if you're waiting
for a huge step up version with with
more processing power I don't think
that's gonna be showing up this year
yeah definitely and that's that's across
the board for all laptops not just max
that's right Windows PCs are not going
to get any kind of huge bump this year
you could expect one maybe early next
year right so if you do wait you might
have to wait goes backwards law yeah
your favorite topic let's keep mentoring
oh we just lost another viewer I got a
comment from a voice of ghosts which is
back on topic they say VRR would be
great if it could be used in interviews
and shows like this could we have
someone on in VR in the show ooh what
would that even yeah how would that work
would would would we have to be wearing
VR yeah whatever won't be wearing the
headset or with someone be wearing a
headset and virtually be here I feel
like a hologram might make delivery with
owes them for schoo style like in Star
yeah we could we could do like well we
don't have the technology for it here
cnet but I'm sure that could be achieved
somewhere I mean that's not a bad idea i
mean the idea of everyone wearing
goggles and sitting in their own like
home doing this show and then maybe
three digital avatars in a central place
I don't know Oh what like we could we
can have any idea what I said we hit us
back voice of goats we want your ideas
yeah please blah will steal your idea if
it's really great and we could actually
do it yeah I mean if it really takes off
I guess like the concept of IRL will
cease to exist yes we're gonna make the
novelty that'll be the novelty yeah yeah
yeah like you go on vacation by going
alike going out to I don't know
McDonald's right let me look what if I'm
working from home I could I could do it
from my my office in my apartment or we
could have Katie Collins on from London
we could have Maggie weird and on from
Philadelphia shore of course it between
digital avatars not actual real people
but no then they get to the point where
like they can get three really accurate
representations of us pretty soon we
will never have to actually see each
other in the flesh oh I can't wait for
that day right oh that Michigan's a good
like like a cool like blue dragon or
something like that right yeah pokemon
if you want yeah leave the big blue
dragon I can't breathe I don't know like
instead of fire dad I don't know Pikachu
no hashtag been gyarados Reuben yes well
you could be been dragging Berlin sure
drop the Fox it could always realize you
didn't want to be a flaw like a virtual
like giant Fox yeah
yeah yeah I could do that a nine tailed
fox um sure it's a mythical agency this
VR stuff is now starting terrified I'm
not ready for the future I don't like
this I'm well I'm totally embracing it i
can't wait for it to come in a real big
way like the stuff was seen is really
cool i can he tried to star wars vr demo
yeah yeah i mean that's a class you're
gonna get to that was coming closer
lightsaber and actually like using in a
real way that I felt was a an enjoyable
representation what VR storytelling
could be um it was short sweet and to
the point I probably would have wanted
it to be a little bit more interactive
but it was no lightsaber battle be and
was convicted I mean it definitely helps
you I noticed like I I must look like an
idiot I was just sorta like I got a
racket I just what room with with all
right and then Han Solo comes in Saints
makes it one more before we wrap it up
yeah far up do you think we are from a
more consumer-friendly VR scenario one
that doesn't involve a really high-end
PC or lots of expensive equipment that's
gonna take a while well no I feel like I
would argue it's already here in some
ways if you've got like a gear VR okay
there are these you know cheap pants
headsets there about a hundred bucks if
you go on ebay there's actually a ton of
them that experience isn't that great
because it uses that the cardboard
technology from google so it's not super
polished but i mean some of that VR
experience is here it's it's it's pretty
approachable but just need to get a
flavor for what if you get a flavor for
you it's nothing that's justifies the
actual purchase of it like if you get a
if you get a VR headset with free with
the samsung phone I think it's fine it's
great like I don't know they wouldn't
want to buy it I think alcatel is doing
the same thing they're bundling a phone
with a VR headset and that's that's a
great entry in the VR and difficult you
flavor what things are going to look
like part of the problem is the content
isn't quite there yet right all others
just sort of its cool and interesting
for a few minutes but you know I get
kind of tired of it so yeah I i
personally think it is going to take a
while for them to speed up the
processors yeah shrink everything down
yeah and make it much much happy that
high-end experience that you
get an oculus or HTC vive that stuff is
gonna take a little while and it is it's
a step up it's definitely more immersive
does a better job fool you into thinking
you're actually in a different world but
it's yeah it's it's a ways away from
regular people actually investing in the
stuff yeah so all right let's uh let's
wrap things up for the week I want any
last questions no I think that's about
it for this week all right great in a
good week busy week thank you very much
