familiar but costs just a little bit
less I'm Dan Ackerman and this is the
digital storm Krypton and if you think
that you're seeing double that is
because I've put this Krypton right next
to in origin PC on 17s a very fancy very
upscale gaming laptop as the Krypton is
as you can see they're built into the
same exact off-the-shelf body with these
boutique PC makers do they take these
off-the-shelf - and pack in their own
components and do a lot of customization
and offer
millana service and support and that's
how they sort of add value to these very
generic looking bodies it frankly a
little bit dated let's be honest here
they're not slim like the Razer laptops
or even the MSI 17 years that we
reviewed recently very very slick very
slim 17-inch gaming laptops these guys
are full-on big thick monsters Intel
Core i7 GeForce 8800 M pretty much
the fastest gaming graphics card you can
get right now a little bit of
customization they got their logo on the
touch fan just like Origen does they put
a logo on the back they didn't quite go
as far as Origen did and kind of putting
a whole separate back panel on there
that kind of has ridges and has kind of
an alienware look so it's a little more
generic although frankly neither one of
these is gonna win a beauty contest
this configuration about 2200 the origin
is a lot more because it has basically
almost a thousand our CPU upgrade an
extreme edition chip versus just a
regular quad-core here if you drop this
down for the same CPU then there's maybe
only a 2 or $300 difference the origin
is more expensive because they offer a I
think a higher level of kind of hands-on
personalized service in support and
phone support in lifetime free labor if
you need any changes or updates but if
you want something that's extremely
similar same part same body and you want
to save a few hundred bucks you should
definitely take a look at the Krypton
which scored very highly in all our
gaming benchmarks I'm Dan actually
that's the digital storm Krypton</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
