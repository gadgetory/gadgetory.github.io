extensive line of high-end blenders it
sells but now this company is also
launched into the coffee maker market
with a new product called the coffee bar
for a hundred and forty dollars it's
certainly reasonably priced and offers a
whole lot of extra features and
capabilities that you don't often see
for coffee maker that is this
inexpensive just looking at the coffee
bar it definitely looks a little odd it
has this sort of plasticky retro 90s
early electronics feel but don't be
fooled because a lot of thought has
actually gone into the design of this
product first of all the water tank here
is removable it's very easy to take off
the machine and fill with water the
machine will automatically adjust how
much coffee it brews depending on what
cup size you select you can also brew
half crafts full crafts and all that it
also brews coffee pretty well too with
just a little bit of over extraction but
it's very drinkable this machine isn't a
perfect coffee brewer it's a little bit
a little harsh on the back end for the
coffee it brews and its design isn't
exactly inspiring it's not artistic or
very snazzy in any way for one-hundred
and forty dollars the ninja coffee bar
certainly has tons of features and
flexibility you can also brew espresso
style drinks and that's certainly
something that's pretty nice but it is
not the best brewer you can buy for that
you're gonna have to spend a little more
money and buy something from techni form
or Bonavita
form or read my full review at cnet.com
