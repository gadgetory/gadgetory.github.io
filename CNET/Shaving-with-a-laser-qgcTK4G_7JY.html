suspended on Kickstarter after raising
four million dollars for failing to have
a working prototype I checked it out in
person see for yourself in our video of
the laser razor in action
so I've rolled up my sleeves and I've
got a laser radio here here goes some
Harris okay so I'm pulling a few hairs
away it's not doing a clean shave with
this prototype with the initial fiber
they need a they say they need a rigidly
mounted optical fiber to get through
everything the laser cuts through I may
get a little bit close from try not to
hit my skin they say that if it gets too
close even a little bump in the skin can
break it's that rigid can't cut through
this many at once right now I'm not with
this flavor but I see them burning
individually here and there you can see
the ones that are landing on top of the
razor is they get cut a few here and a
few there final fiber that they're
hoping to work with they say they can
cut as many as 10 at a time conservative
estimate 5 but we heard 10 is what
they're shooting for whoops and broke
the fiber so can lasers cut hair
absolutely but you're not going to be
shaving with them quite yet laser yes
razor not so much the real question is
whether scarp can make the laser razor a
reality it doesn't deliver a clean shave
quite yet but it definitely felt like a
working prototype to me for more check
