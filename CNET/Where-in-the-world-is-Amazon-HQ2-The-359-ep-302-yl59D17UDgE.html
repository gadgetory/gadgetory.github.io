of the 359 podcast I'm BBG and today I
learned Alexa responds to burps in the
house today Ben Fox Ruben Roger Chang
and Alfred Inge oh sorry
to be fair I cute that oh yeah that's a
Alexa I'll clean this later god whew
coughs just drop like 30 we're already
off the rails Ben will be time out today
so today we're gonna be talking about
Amazon HQ - that's a massan's plan for
its next major campus and nobody knows
where it's going quite yet because they
sent out an open call suite just try to
find out yeah it's called the Amazon
lottery they want cities to send in
their best offers to try to get this
campus and we'll also round out with
Bigsby did I pronounce that right right
it's fix P next Bigsby Bigsby which is
coming to your refrigerator just a
reminder that's Samsung's digital
assistant because most people may not
know about it right we can't assume
people know it doesn't like a serum
herbs it's don't it will eventually know
then please now stop I know it's
Thursday but still it's sending your
questions and comments BVG we'll get to
as many as you can at the end of the
show let's get this podcast started yep
here we go in three two
welcome to the 359 I'm Ben Fox Ruben I
brought rain I'm Alfred Aang so Amazon
last month sent out an open call for
cities to send in their best offers to
land
Amazon's second headquarters out of
Seattle the deadline for submissions is
today some of the numbers are pretty
crazy about this this is they're
planning on eventually spending five
billion dollars to build out this campus
and hope to have 50,000 employees now
granted that's in like a 15 to 7 15 to
17 year time frame still this is no this
would be huge for any city that gets it
and you know you mentioned there's an
amazon lottery and there's there's
actually taking submissions on like I
guess the best pitches for which city
should get it yeah and there are a
couple of cities that have taken this
quite like a little little wacky ones
there was one city that sent in a giant
cactus which was really stupid how big
is this giant cat it was giant I don't I
don't know off the top how do they even
send it they drop it off with a drone
ship it over there was a Georgia city
that that said it would rename part of
itself Amazon that's their scene that is
that is very very thirsty I also oh god
New York City which is where we're doing
the podcast now send it would change the
lighting for a bunch of its building I
mean we did it last night
they just yeah they did it with the
Empire State Building all the link NYC
kiosks and like certain places what did
they change lighting to or Amazon Amazon
orange yeah I mean look I I'm gonna say
I don't want Amazon New York New York
doesn't need Amazon there are other
cities that need it I mean the new jobs
infrastructure a boost the economy New
York City isn't needed we have other
stuff wasn't Newark New Jersey one of
the contenders Newark New Jersey is
definitely one of the contenders New
Jersey pulled together a big package for
like seven billion dollars in tax breaks
which is definitely very significant
Newark a lot of people don't know is
also the home to audible which is an
Amazon company so an existing
relationship right and Newark if anybody
didn't already know this Newark could
definitely use the help
it's it's definitely got some blighted
areas in it and Amazon would
significantly change what it actually
looked like however there have also been
some important stories that have come
out to say look do you guys really are
are you seriously interested in having
Amazon come to your town because there
are also some other problems that may
arise from Amazon putting that much
investment and having that many
employees troll really there's a lot of
control a lot of traffic let's go up
gentrification there are a lot of things
to also consider it's not all positives
yeah you visited their headquarters in
Seattle and you know what was it like
there I mean it was like Seattle is like
a really nice place apparently the
weather is bad but when I was there the
weather was fantastic and Amazon took
over giant sections but granted Amazon
doesn't put its logo
outside of its building so it blends in
a little bit better but at the same time
you know it took over a lot of the space
and people should be aware of that so
next up we wanted to talk about
Samsung's Bigsby that's its digital
assistant Samsung announced bixby 2.0
and the big thing is it's not just gonna
be on your phone it'll actually come
into fridges and other appliances next
year right mm-hmm yeah and so if you
want to talk to your fridge that's I
mean who doesn't
yeah or you know fridge I'm lonely or
you could actually right Crist was
actually showing that you could ask the
fridge to look inside the fridge if you
have a certain Samsung yeah I'd be lazy
to look in just go you need to have a
samsung fridge with a camera inside and
so it's a little bit yeah it's not quite
right just open it now what if you're
out well what if you're the market
you're like do I have milk you know what
you know it would be it would be useful
if like you had like some really expired
stuff no it's I think it's useful if
you're at the market and you want to
know what oh why you can look at it from
like far away yeah I was thinking a
perspective like being in the kitchen oh
no it's true that was the one that he
showed on Twitter but either way if you
want to read more about these stories
check us out on CNN I'm Ben Fox Ruben
I'm Raj and I'm Alfred Inge thanks for
listening there it is I was like where's
the where's the ending child I missed a
step
we were only 16 seconds and you were
actually surprised we finished on time I
know I'm never ready for you to finish
off that's what she said anyways come on
who said that about us when did they say
this what a childish Oh burps and sex
jokes yeah I'm sorry show how the end of
the wrong week has been kind of a long
month or two or three in a long life
yeah so not for you so it's been a
relatively short life actually to
retarget to Amazon yeah I'm actually
pretty surprised that this thing took
off the way it did Amazon's genetic ax
yeah it does a couple of these like you
know experimental things they did it
with primed a couple years ago I mean
the drones I mean they just the drones
doesn't actually exist yet but with
primed a that ended up becoming its
biggest sales day of the year up until
the holidays and then I just like they
seem to have a knack for like
monopolizing the headlines but there's
like big splash announces well they're
not they're legit like like the drone
thing or or the prime day like people
can't stop talking about this stuff
right and with this one to this one is
only gonna make one city happy right
everybody else is gonna be a loser and
there are dozens of cities that I'm sure
say should have just done a game show
this is basically the American Idol and
bachelor yeah The Rose goes to
Cincinnati but I think it's a good point
to also mention like people have asked
like well what did Seattle get 20 years
ago it's a lens Amazon in the first
place wasn't like it wasn't like a
supermassive about it what did Seattle
get they offer didn't offer yeah but
what is Seattle what does he had a law
firm now to keep him on wondering so
Seattle isn't specifically a contender
but King County and a couple not to keep
sorry around them not for a cue to but
I'm just wondering if CL does offer
brakes now for Amazon like I don't know
off the off the top I'm gonna head I
don't know yeah that Amazon is
definitely still growing in Seattle
however Seattle is going through like
this whole soul-searching situation
where they're like did we do something
to upset you Amazon why are you moving
to like this giant campus and there
there has been a lot of like concern
about whether Seattle maybe wasn't
business friendly enough Amazon to one
to I was like yeah it was like a nice
like tech like City though cuz
Microsoft's out there too although
they're not really in Seattle they're
kind of like out in the burbs yeah in
Redmond yeah yeah but if they just
opened up another HQ like in Seattle
like that's just yeah I would love that
but we pick Seattle again
well like it makes sense for Amazon to
diversified locations though mainly so
the reason that a big reason a lot of
folks were talking about why Amazon
would need to do this in the first place
was because they were outgrowing Seattle
Seattle is not Silicon Valley they
definitely there's a lot of poaching
goes on between Microsoft and Amazon but
yeah
despite beside that there's not as much
going on there when you compare it to
Silicon Valley where you have like so
many more tech companies and talent -
right so so to diversify to a different
area where you are gonna get a different
pool can you can you handicap it do you
have a favorite do you have a most
likely candidate my my most likely
candidate and this is for a lot of other
people's is Boston Amazon already has
offices in Boston for its Alexa like
it's AI brains behind Alexa yeah a lot
of those folks are in Boston they could
also tap into all the smart people that
come out of Cambridge with you know
Harvard MIT so what I would have guessed
you would have even chosen Philly
I am from Philadelphia so Philly is also
tried yeah it Philly is another area
it's also a city that could use that
kind of yes there are certainly blighted
areas in Philadelphia that have been
blighted for decades and could Amazon
know if I made a pitch for it I believe
so and so I'm gonna also run through so
Moody's last year came out with or sorry
last week came out with the top ten
contenders I'm gonna run through a
handful of them they put Austin number
one then Atlanta Philadelphia Rochester
New York Pittsburgh PA Pittsburgh where
I went to school so represent Rochester
yeah interesting and then and then
behind Pittsburgh is the New York Jersey
City White Plains New York that like
hold by the New York area so people
aren't really at least Moody's isn't
strongly expecting Amazon to end up here
yeah because like it's so expensive
where we are they were they build same
amount of tax monies in yard probably
upstate like I don't think it would not
upstate but not New York City right
right like maybe White Plains where yeah
you still live cuz they've got like
IBM's up there they've got the IBM's
yeah that's right but it's not like
there would be some flashy new campus in
the middle of the city no no like luxury
condos we're taking over Central Park
just all that would
but wait wait wait nurse T these these
different places have been I wouldn't
surprise me if mayor de Blasio were like
yeah just build over a Central Park no
way let's take a page from Arrested
Development make it a floating campus in
the sky on the sea that would be Amazon
barge just like the mick barge that was
such a huge success the way
remember when McDonald's anguish no no
no everybody go to youtube and look up
the mick barge your ships dropping right
crazier that's better do we have
questions by the way yeah first of all
new free to dis at the comment that's my
contribution huh we got a lot of people
making really great bids in the chat
about their local yeah Josh Boyd says I
feel like Chicago would make a lot of
sense because it's basically the center
of the country
yeah logistical II that's for sure
totally fair I like mothers mustache she
says Atlanta has the biggest
International Airport Savannah has one
of the biggest ports the tech industry
is huge here in the metro Atlanta
Georgia Tech I could see Georgia being
for sure a contender for them yeah
Lana's a huge hub I'm surprisingly put
Austin as geographically I don't get its
column great like yet does have talent
and Whole Foods is based there and
Amazon just bought Whole Foods so there
are there are reasons to go to cool town
yeah yeah that's why that's why I would
hang out yeah yeah not you know create a
new headquarters for five billion
dollars yeah I mean it's up to Jeff its
whatever wherever Jeff feels friend Jeff
is BFF the first name nice that's your
Bezos if you're nasty
be in Jeff that's me that's what we call
each other yeah he being named Jeff
right I would watch that show oh yeah
slide 83 says Detroit if we're talking
blighted yes that's true in Detroit has
definitely been one of the area's that's
been kicked around an eventual
I think they made a pitch
not sure off the top of my head the
problem is is with a place like Detroit
you wonder if they have enough firepower
to actually you know make a really
strong edge you know then they can start
their own self driving car delivery
system from there oh yeah the other the
other problem too is is like does Amazon
really want to get into the automotive
industry I feel like they definitely do
maybe I don't think for like consumer
prefer definitely for like shipping
delivery yeah it's if you want to go in
like the middle of the country I think
Chicago sounds like a bit of a stronger
contender but you know there are a lot
of other places like Salt Lake City Utah
is on this list
really it's fake Hoover it also made the
list I was gonna ask if there's any
question about them going across the
border yes just made a big pitch for
Toronto yeah Toronto yeah and you know
somebody else even contributed Puerto
Rico I mean that would be nice but also
logistically or difficult I don't I
don't like I don't think there's enough
like tech talent specifically for the
infrastructure their perspective is like
needs it right now like yeah yeah yeah
well absolutely right I I think that
yeah like for Newark I think New Jersey
but just logistically transportation
wise that would I know I think New York
City's in pretty rough shape they could
probably use the boost jobs yeah you
know just give out more tax breaks for
giant companies I think I was pretty
clothing that's what we do New York
let's go back yeah
so the dash says with so many places
wanting HQ to it seems like just a
money-making scheme for Amazon
absolutely that way it's right Amazon is
really just trying whether I have a lot
of competition well the competition
means like they can go to these cities
in like well like what can you offer us
right what kind of tax breaks what kind
of I mean yeah very plausible that they
just basically don't pay taxes for like
15 years right right I'm speaking of
taxes there's no taxes in Texas yeah
you're right for Georgia residuals
though not necessary for
businesses how was that how it works I'm
curious to see because it was for
Florida's the same way every I got so
much attention with this though that I
wonder what other company could also
play this game or is it like the Amazon
I mean I've never could do that right
I've never seen companies before kind of
like dangle this out in front of cities
usually it's like all kind of behind the
scenes soil right like tax breaks and
things like that
Twitter was kinda like that what that's
f right yeah they have it kind of like I
mean it came out but I sort of had this
handshake deal with that stuff tax
breaks they didn't try to like you know
like you said dangle cross other cities
so yeah the Amazon way to go I Amazon
like a big splash yeah always
well we'll see hopefully they move here
it would just be easier for me to like
visit their offices all the time all the
time hey you want to break some wine
bottles on Windows later today so let's
talk about turnaround time slide 83 says
the thing is that there's going to be a
long turnaround time on them really
getting things up and going no matter
where they build oh yeah you think
people will be willing to deal with the
changes over upwards of a 15 year period
I think that's being a little extreme I
only 15 years is really gets fully
established I mean it'll it'll go like
you'll see construction go up a lot
faster but it's that's why I think it's
a refined old form no no it's totally
fine but there's any one my final form
for them to dangle five billion dollars
in investment and fifty million
employees sorry everyone in America
works here now that's that's like the
time timespan Christmas actually right
we all just like turning our badges
ya know Abbas on pad alright it was on
hiring 50 billion actually that's I mean
how what you do right post office yep in
that
basically how tim horton's works in
canada everyone just has their own
Timo's idea I mean everybody works it
there are a lot there are a lot of them
I'd be pretty bummed out if this did end
up going to Canada
sorry - any Canadian listeners out there
but it would be nice if Amazon did you
know stay within the United States but
you know they they are China held up a
such competition so patriotic
you know I do love this country all
right let's blast you a couple more
questions thanks Ben will a patriotism
but you sir how am I supposed to respond
what am I supposed to make like a snide
no no you're good you respond exactly
how you should responded are we done
Mary
let's go hope so okay America Matthew
badger will HQ to actually have a real
effect on local economy and contrast a
bill of goods and sports stadiums and
other effects oh yeah oh yeah absolutely
yes very Bob's alone I think the the
point is is that it would have such a
significant impact on certain cities
like big cities yeah that it could you
know gentrify areas and raise rents and
raise taxes well beyond that like Amazon
sets up shop all their businesses are
gonna come around it's it's not like
it's just Amazon it's not in a you know
vacuum its other people are gonna want
to build businesses around that exactly
then that kind of secondary tertiary
effects are just as important as well as
someone in the chat earlier and I
apologize because I missed the the
screen name pointed out that just
maintaining that facility in itself is
an entire job force oh yeah absolutely
great point so that that's that's a huge
one and that's not just thinking like oh
who's working the assembly lines say
like they're gonna need groundskeepers
they're gonna need maintenance you're
gonna need engineers and electricians
and they're gonna need delicious sub
shops to make delicious subs for all
those 50 million workers probably need
people to write all those like press
releases that they're gonna be putting
out I know so if you guys are coming to
New York all right yeah a couple more
real quick Rick says the cactus was from
Tucson and it was 21 feet tall
well done Rick they send that in one
piece basketball hoops I think it was a
tractor-trailer something they said
flatbed I remember that okay yeah that
probably makes a lot more sense
somewhere might dumb my nose oh yeah you
can put it down yeah and just just to
point out to him azan decided not to
keep the cactus because they were like
we were not allowed to take gifts you
know we wanted to stay fair to everybody
so I think it was like to some I don't
know like Conservancy or Oh God
Arboretum or whatever but that makes
sense yeah so they just yeah like they
gave it to the next guy mystery but hey
corby imagine Jeff Bezos holding a 21
feet tall like actively what do I do
with this thank you
a couple more come more Dre Frey says
will Bixby be able to summon Google on
your fridge or toaster toasters I'm sure
they do you can summon Google now like
it's a genie yeah you rub your phone be
a feature
Najeeb also has where's the Amazon phone
oh oh great question
I've long time no it's not
I don't like there used to be in Amazon
was the fire phone and there is like a
very soft rumor that came out I think
out of like press in India that talked
about the ice phone that they were
developing but that was several months
ago is that like the codename for it
yeah that's the codename is the ice
phone and I don't know if it would just
be for developing markets or
what-have-you but it's it's it's not I
mean that would make a lot of sense to
me right like a super super cheap phone
that sounds like that's a direct outlet
to Amazon shopping right tablet yeah
well no but like in emerging markets
where are those super cheap phones do
really really well but yeah this was
something
that was mentioned again from I think it
was an Indian publication and never
mentioned again so usually like when
these things tend to get hide you get a
lot of rumors stories and that one was
just kind of a one-off yeah so don't
expect an Amazon phone just yet
all of this talk of like the smart
devices this makes me think the world is
going to turn into them movie them my
Brave Little Toaster remember that we're
like all the appliances were like
personified and yes I remember the
toaster I don't remember his friends I
just wrote this in a vacuum nice play
and what else train or something that's
all I remember from that movie reminds
me no no but like I remember from Brave
Little Toaster that the air conditioner
was played by Phil Hartman rest in peace
and it was terrifying auto-delete air
cuz he like Ozzy's DreamWorks or
something maybe but all I know is like
the air conditioner explodes and it
traumatized me wow this is a weird
episode alright one more question before
we wrap it up take a hello from South
Korea it's my first time watching live
hey what's up to obtain a joining us
Bixby here in Korea is not too bad I
guess I like I guess just like Syria and
I wonder how BIG's beat is doing in the
u.s. you know they say it's I mean they
they threw out a large number I forget
what it was yesterday at the developer
conference but there was no way to say
whether or not people were actively
using big space so it's hard to say I do
really like that big space the only
voice assistant that's you know
bilingual no doesn't like to like
understand Korean yeah a Google
assistant I think does a couple
different right and Alexa speak I
thought Alexa didn't okay oh I'm sorry
and then series piece a bunch of
language yeah really wrong on that one
there I know it's okay but it's good to
mention actually I mean hey if you have
any like what what do you use things
before I'm actually really curious like
what an active Bixby user how an active
Bixby user employees because to be frank
it's not as prevalent here in my us as
they might try to
I don't have a number state so I don't
have a chance to really play with it
when the demos came out when we got a
chance to play with the phones big spiel
wasn't ready yet so since it came out
like I have a chance to play
I like this comment from from Josh he
says do the count accidentally pressing
the button as using Bigsby
they probably probably yeah sure yeah if
you press that button if you get
anywhere close to the button that
counted can they and I forget I don't
remember if they actually gave you the
option
I know initially they didn't give you
the option to change it but I wonder if
they've changed they've updated so so
change the like before it was like it
had to be the big abundant even when big
speakers around it was just sort of like
a a useless bun but I feel like that's
come a waste especially if you don't use
Bixby well yeah it would be nice if they
let you change it to like the Google
assistant button but who knows you can
hit the home button for Google system
mm-hmm and that's all we got for the day
yeah hey if you get a chance to respond
to us tweet at us yeah Witter we do want
to hear what your perspective is and how
you do use Bixby and that goes for
anybody anybody who is engaging with
Bixby we're just kind of curious yeah
point feel free to tweet at us at at the
three five nine podcast at Twitter and
then email us at the three five nine at
CNET calm cool and that'll be it want to
take us out Ben oh I have to do it fine
all right
