going to take a look at the bun my cafe
MCU this is a single serve coffee maker
cost about 170 bucks and it's probably
the best coffee maker we've looked at we
like it because it's nice and versatile
it also feels very sturdy you can see
this a pretty simple design here there's
not a lot of buttons or switches or
anything you need to deal with I'm
actually find it pretty easy to use
overall so to make a cup of coffee you
simply slide the top open here pouring
water into the vent and then you put
whatever coffee you want into a dis
receptacle or one of the others that
comes with so the receptacle options are
probably one of the things we like best
about this little unit here so this one
lets you pour in fresh ground coffee
this one can take tea bags or coffee
pods that you might see in a hotel this
one takes K cups from Keurig and this
one will distribute just plain hot water
if you wanna make a cup of tea your hot
chocolate is actually brew the cup you
hit the brew button it heats the water
up and then distribute it automatically
join a brew say a stronger cup of coffee
you can hit the pulse button which
distributes the water and serve a
staggered fashion let's it seep a little
bit more so cleaning the bun is actually
pretty easy you simply take off this
metal piece and slide this tray out you
can wash them both with dishwasher safe
because a few challenges with this unit
it's unlike a lot of the k-cup makers
that you've seen out there it doesn't
have a big reservoir so you are kind of
stuck making one cup at a time
there's also no way to really finely
control the temperature so depending on
your interest in coffee making some
people like to have cooler water come in
so you really kind of have to take what
you get here we've done to still take a
very very hot cup of coffee
overall though for its versatility and
its simplicity we really like this unit
the best members Brown this is the Bunn
