four hundred and fifty dollar receiver
which promises a lot of cool features in
addition to solid home theater
performance it's easy to use thanks to a
simple remote and an attractive
interface I also like the inclusion of
six HDMI inputs which is rather good for
the money these are also designed to
pass 4k and HDR signals which offers
some future proofing the receiver offers
several streaming features but some of
them are yet to be switched on the most
interesting of these is Google cast
which will offer streaming from many
apps on Android and iOS files and the
second yet to be used is fire Connect
which is a proprietary multi-room system
but if you want to keep it simple you
could also get Bluetooth and Spotify
connect home cinema performance is the
star here with detailed dialogue and
plenty of low-end muscle as you'd expect
from a surround receiver for the money
music is a little lacking with an overly
bright sound if you want to play music
for most you'll probably need to spend
more money around $600 but as it is the
Pioneer vsx 831 offers decent value in
an easy to use package</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
