showroom
hey I'm Donnell Bell for cnet.com and
today we are unboxing the Fitbit force
now this is the new hundred and thirty
dollar top-of-the-line Fitbit it's a
fitness tracker it comes in two colors
comes in black it comes in like a slate
blue kind of color not sure which color
we have here take a look we have there
is the Fitbit force got in black it's
understated it's gonna be a good color
for me a good way for me to get in shape
or at least just look like I'm about to
alright we got it out of one box let's
get it out of the the other one here the
box itself looks pretty cool it gives
you a little description of what the
Fitbit force is all about let's open
this thing up
carefully so there's the Fitbit force
itself you see one of the coolest things
about this particular version of the
Fitbit is that it has a display that can
tell the time you can click the little
button here on the side and be able to
see a record of your activity number of
steps taking all that good stuff let's
see what else is in the box I get a
little tab down here at the bottom give
that a tug so inside the box and see
what we get we should have some
instructions here it's telling you to go
to fitbit.com slash setup because that's
really the critical part of this whole
thing it's not just the force itself but
all the software that can help you track
and set goals and do all that good stuff
and then you've got the charging cable
now the charging cable is only gonna
come in handy once every week it says
the battery life here should be about
seven to ten days which is a nice long
stretch and then you also have this this
is the USB dongle that gives you
Bluetooth 4.0 compatibility for your
laptop it's both Mac and PC compatible
and it's a way for your Fitbit force to
communicate wirelessly to your computer
so it can upload all that important
information about how many steps you've
taken calories burned and all that so
you get the charging cable you get the
USB dongle and you get the Fitbit force
that's all there is to it let me try
this thing on what do you think cool now
the cool thing about this is that it is
both splash proof and sweat proof so you
can get pretty active here and not have
to worry about it blinking out on you
the other interesting thing that the
Fitbit force does that a lot of the
other competitors don't is that it
tracks your sleeping habits and tell you
how good a night's sleep you're getting
so you're supposed to keep this thing on
you 24/7 and live a better life because
of it so there you go that's the
unboxing of the Fitbit force 130 dollars
great way to kick off a New Year's
resolution
