important is it can make the right half
of the freezer its own special flex
compartment and you have dedicated
temperature presets that can dial it all
the way up into fridge mode you can dial
it up as high as 43 degrees which is a
nice temperature for chilling beverages
and you'll notice it even has a wine
rack in there for that purpose so it's
kind of a nice feature up top you've got
basically the same refrigerator design
as in samsung's french door
refrigerators - doors that open from the
middle and then about 16 cubic feet of
storage space inside the fridge that's
not a lot for a high-end model like this
one but you do get the extra storage
space of that flex compartment if you
need it the other big feature here is
Samsung's food showcase compartment
which is basically Samsung's spin on the
door and door feature you've seen a lot
of LG fridges it's kind of a convenient
way to get beverages milk butter things
like that out of the fridge and you've
got two shelves pull out like drawers to
make it feel even more luxurious it's a
nice feature though probably a bit
gimmicky for my tastes that's said it
performs pretty well if you look at the
temperature map of the default setting
of this fridge you can see that that
food showcase compartment stays below 40
degrees which is very very good most
door in a door compartments like it tend
to go north of 40 degrees and that's not
good pretty FDA that flex zone performed
pretty well - if you look at the graph
you've got here this shows the four
different settings that it offers to
fridge settings and then a 23 degree
soft freeze setting and a zero degree
bottom freeze setting but you can see
that the fridge took a lot longer to get
down to that zero degrees setting that's
not surprising that's a big drop for it
but still keep in mind as you're dialing
down to freezer mode all in all I think
$2,600 is a very nice price for a black
stainless steel fridge like this that's
got nice features good performance and a
very distinctive design if you're maybe
remodeling your kitchen and looking for
some high-end looking appliances that
won't
bust your budget I think it's worth a
look</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
