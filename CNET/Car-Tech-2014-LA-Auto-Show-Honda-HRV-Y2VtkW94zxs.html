crossover it was Twitter's rav4 but hot
on its heels was the Honda CRV still of
course a big seller but here is kind of
the next chapter of that ethic now even
from the top in Japan the message has
come down we got to get some sex back in
our look so this is a vehicle that's got
the currently fashionable upswept side
line just see that and then it meets a
coupe like window line as he comes back
to a slightly concealed rear door handle
so lots of interesting styling touches
that you don't always see in a Honda the
Front's a tidy nicely curvaceous front
as well now let's get practical because
Honda's have that written all over their
DNA they point to the fact that it's
small on the outside which it is and
very spacious inside not like a giant
car but they have these magic folding
seats they call them that are really
easy to go flat also really easy to pull
up and get them out of the way so you
can put things like a bicycle behind the
front row with just the front wheel off
you know you always want to stand it up
back there and not lay it down part of
how they did it was moving the gas tank
low and in the middle of the vehicle to
get it out of the way of cargo space in
the second and rear area engine and
transmission choices pretty standard
Honda stuff 1.8 liter gas for either
6-speed manual thank you or a CVT right
probably the main choice but not as fun
and will expect it to be priced and have
mpg in the zone with other competitors
the message here though is style compact
size bigger on the inside than it looks
we'll look forward to seeing on the road</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
