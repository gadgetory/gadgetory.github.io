to level up I'm Bridget Carey this is
your cnet update as we get closer to the
launch of Sony's virtual reality gaming
headset it now has an official name it's
called wait for it PlayStation VR yeah
didn't see that one coming right
although PlayStation VR is a pretty
predictable name the codename was cooler
it was called project Morpheus while and
development Sony confirmed the name on
Twitter after announcing it at the Tokyo
Game Show and released this video
showing off what types of games could be
played in Virtual Reality the
PlayStation VR has to move controller
wands that you'll hold to sense your
hand gestures we've been able to test
out the prototype versions during
various video game conferences it has a
5.7 inch oled screen inside with a fast
refresh rate to help you not feel so
dizzy sony still hasn't given a price
but it says it's planning to release the
headset sometime early next year now
virtual reality is ramping up with
headsets coming out soon from HTC and
oculus which is owned by Facebook and
even if you don't buy a special headset
Facebook is working on bringing
something like virtual reality to your
phone The Wall Street Journal reports
the social network is working on a video
app that supports 360 degree videos also
known as spherical videos it lets you
change your perspective by tilting the
phone so instead of a headset this is
more like using your phone as a window
into virtual reality world YouTube also
started supporting 360 degree videos and
it created a camera rig of 16 GoPros to
capture such video looking ahead
Microsoft is holding a press event to
show off new products on october six it
sounds like it's time for some new
surface tablets you know the ones with a
detachable soft keyboard and a stylus
that were around before the ipad pro
based on reports were expecting a new
surface pro 4 and microsoft will be
under pressure to show how it's better
than the ipad pro but maybe we'll see a
new version of the fitness tracking
Microsoft band also it's time to see new
Lumia phones that run Windows 10 and of
course everyone is waiting for more
details on the hollow lens
that's Microsoft's headset that isn't
exactly virtual reality instead the
screen shows 3d images in front of your
eyes overlaying objects onto the real
world in front of you it stitches
together the virtual world with the real
one although we've seen a few
demonstrations Microsoft still has not
given a price or release date the fall
is a busy time for new gadgets and LG
announced it also is going to have
something to show off on october first
it could be the recently leaked v10
phone which is said to have a separate
small display under the main screen the
event is movie themed judging by the
invite so expect some talk about this
place that's it for this tech news
update there's always more at cnet com
from our studios in New York I'm Bridget
