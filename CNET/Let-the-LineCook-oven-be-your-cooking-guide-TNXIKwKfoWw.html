GES micro factory called first built
here in Louisville Kentucky that
drilling here is the factory working
hard to invent cool new things like this
line cook oven this just your standard
built in wall oven I cept you can scan
the barcode of your food and have it
cook it for you the idea pick up a
frozen pizza at a grocery store scan it
into your oven put it into the oven and
its gonna know exactly how long to cook
the thing to make the pizza the way you
want it to down the road GE hopes to
expand this technology to a number of
markets they want to put this line cook
ability on their advanced ium microwaves
even on regular microwaves so that any
food that has a barcode you scan it in
and your appliance is going to know how
to cook it that's still a little ways
away the technology is still new and the
first step is gonna be to release it to
a small market for it is essentially
beta testing during this beta testing
interested parties will be able to help
GE collect the food it needs for its
database and collect information about
that food so it's gonna know not only
how you want to cook a pizza normally
but how should you cook a pizza if you
wanted a little extra crispy
eventually lime coke hopes to be smart
enough to not just use the recipe on the
packaging but to also be able to fit to
your exact taste needs to do that yeah
they're gonna need a big database so
they have a lot of work in front of them
ideally it'll also be able to combine
what it knows about the recipe to what
it senses from your food all of that
from customizable options to advanced
iam integration is still pie in the sky
at this point but what they've got is a
cool prototype that should go out to a
small beta community very soon and allow
you to scan a barcode and automatically
cook your food with the line cook
foreseen it
