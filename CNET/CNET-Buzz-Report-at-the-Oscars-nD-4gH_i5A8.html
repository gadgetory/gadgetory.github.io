online information source for the
digital age
hi i'm molly wood and welcome to the
buzz report the show about the tech news
that everybody's talking about like the
Large Hadron Collider ebooks and the
Oscars but first let's get started with
the gadget of the week update as we
expected the Amazon Kindle 2 was
released this week it's better designed
than the last version supposedly a
little faster at turning pages and it
has a higher capacity for storing books
it still costs 350 nine dollars which no
one's super happy about but you know
what it doesn't matter what it costs
it's a luxury gadget right now but trust
me the kindle is blazing the trail for
readers like you never wanted one before
but admit it you kind of do now don't
you you totally do you want one okay
let's do some headlines scientists say
the Large Hadron Collider probably won't
come back online until September which
would be a year after it was shut down
due to a malfunction or the delay is due
to that new research about how the black
holes it creates might last a little
longer than expected delay all you want
Buffon's it was announced this week that
Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak will
appear on Dancing with the Stars
microsoft has a new ad out called
rookies it debuted at the grammy's this
past week and they are taking a
dangerous new approach check it out my
name is Carly I took a picture with fish
dorky and I'm going to send it to my
family I plant this being here Mac PC
and I'm for them oh yes she's not
selling windows she's selling cute and I
am buying and now for an editorial
comment Christian Bale freakout spoofs
not funny I know you think they are but
they're not Michael Cera I'm talking to
you if you're thinking about making one
I beg you do not instead I don't know
record a video of a fox jumping on your
trampoline see way funnier ok onto the
big buzz of the week the oscars are
coming and since they don't allow actual
geeks at the Oscars the Academy gave out
its scientific and technical awards this
past weekend in a smaller more private
black-tie event buzz report was there
well when I was first asked to host a
show about science and technology to a
technically minded audience I thought
wow who was the head of that selection
committee I mean as if actresses okay or
maybe just me don't feel technically
challenged enough already oh come on
that was just embarrassing throw the
geeks of bone right at least give us
someone who can tell a Centurion from
c-3po am i right what oh sorry you're
listening yeah no no yeah you're right
she looks great blade trinity womb and
it's an honor for me to be asked here
this evening to help honor you oh okay
the actual awards but you know I was
thinking how geeky can they be the
system uses to telecentric lens groups
one creates an intermediate plane of
focus or aerial image within the hulen
unit the aerial image is modified and
then reimaged onto the recording
or sensor plane by the second lens group
oh wow yeah this is legit cool the John
Boehner award isn't really just about
career success it's an award that is
also given for outstanding service and
dedication to the Academy and in this
area mark Campbell has also excelled oh
okay this one is exciting this mark
Kimball guy he's been working on movies
for almost 30 years after graduating
from UCLA with a degree in electrical
engineering in 1978 mark Kimball joined
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory where
he worked until nineteen eighty when he
joined Walt Disney's productions dude he
was like a rocket scientist how does a
deep space engineer end up in Hollywood
oh right duh well good for him he got a
medal for tron now only one fellow got
an actual statuette this year and they
don't let us see that part because he
might get to be on the show what nerd
could get this honor ed catmull the
co-founder of Pixar computer scientists
president of walt disney and pixar
animation studios yeah pretty much a
genius he developed software that has
been used in 45 of the last 50 films
that were nominated for visual effects
Oscars I think he is roughly on the same
level as that scary wacko grinning at us
from the front row every year yeah could
be on the show I'm just going to tell
myself that the rocket scientists have
to have their own little nerd Awards
because they make the actors feel
insecure anyway congratulations to all
the winners of the Academy's science and
technology awards and that's our show
for this week everyone from the Oscars
I'm mollywood and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
