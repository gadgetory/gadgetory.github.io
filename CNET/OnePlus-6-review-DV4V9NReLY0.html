snapdragon 845 processor six or eight
gigabytes of RAM dual rear cameras and a
rear fingerprint reader wait Kim that's
that's the wrong phone that's the Galaxy
S 9 plus hang on let me just go slowly
and no one will notice me swapping them
out and putting the one plus six into
the shot there but oh you cut to this
shot hello looks like you caught me guys
but you gotta admit there is a bit of a
resemblance between the galaxy s 9 plus
and the 1 plus 6 and that's not
necessarily a bad thing the galaxy s 9
has a glass back with two rear cameras
and the 1 plus 6 does as well the center
stack camera and the fingerprint reader
underneath it I kind of like the new 1
plus 6s looks it's like a little tuxedo
makeover glossy and refined on the back
with a bowtie notched on the front what
the knotch does is it leaves room for
the earpiece the sensors and the
front-facing camera but if you don't
like the notch you can go into the
settings and minimize it and what it
does is puts a black bar across the top
but it still shows the time it has a six
point three inch display and looks
fantastic and bright videos and
scrolling through Instagram is a delight
colors are vibrant without being too
oversaturated the one plus six has
iPhone 10 like gestures which I'm a big
fan of it took a few frustrating days to
get a hang of it but after that they
became second nature
the one plus six like many other phones
uses has dual rear cameras the main
camera has a bigger sensor than last
year's five t in fact you get 19 percent
more light and maybe even a better
background blur according to one + the
second camera is exclusively for
portrait mode photos which by the way
are some of the best portrait mode
photos on any thumb and here's the
reason it's all about the blur the way
it creates the bouquet that background
blur is gorgeous and looks like a DSLR
with a fast lens but it also keeps the
details in the face nice and sharp it
works really good on objects like food
avocado toast and it works great on cats
probably dogs too but I didn't get take
any pictures of dogs the 1 plus 6 has my
favorite camera interface ever it's
simple but you can get to almost
everything within 1 or 2 taps so right
up front we have video photo and
portrait but if I want more modes I just
slide the drawer up and now I have
access to things like slow motion and
pro mode time lapse and panorama one of
my favorite things is the aspect ratio
is right there so if I tap on 4 by 3 I
can go from that to 19 by 9 which goes
fullscreen side note it is cropping in
so you do lose a little bit of image
quality but it just looks magnificent on
this LED panel if I go into video mode
here I can go into 4k 60 frames per
second I can also go into 1080 60 frames
per second or just regular 1080 or 720
the image quality of videos has a nice
punchy contrast which looks filmic and
dramatic
it also has electric image stabilization
for video which looks pretty good and if
regular slo-mo isn't enough for you the
one plus six just like the Galaxy S nine
plus has a super slo-mo mode how much
you still get out of it I don't know
because it your actions have to be very
fast and very well lit for them to look
good does the one plus six look a lot
like the galaxy s 9 Plus have iPhone 10
like gestures and a simple interface let
the pixel - absolutely
and I welcome that one plus has managed
to take some of the best features from
Android and iOS and package them in a
beautiful gorgeous glass body for a
price that is hundreds of dollars less
than other flagship phones and I
absolutely like that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
