I'm Bridget Carey and this is your see
net update sometimes you may feel like
you're getting too old for social media
especially when dealing with the teen
centric messaging app snapchat last week
more people jumped in on the quirky app
in hopes of getting to understand it
better because it became a news tool
with a feature called discover it shows
daily videos and stories from media
outlets like CNN and ESPN there's also
entertainment from Comedy Central but
the posts disappear in 24 hours each day
there's something new and now there's a
tool to make it easier for people to
follow your posts of disappearing photos
I'm getting more into it myself you can
follow me by scanning this code with the
app or just search my username
CNET also has an account on there with
the username CNET snaps this weekend the
app also launched its first original
video series called literally can't even
if you missed it you have to wait until
next Saturday because each episode is
only around for 24 hours literally can't
even is an appropriate name considering
how painful it is to watch but
nevertheless snapchat is on a mission to
become a media destination 18t is also
going to launch a show on snapchat soon
about superheroes called snapper hero if
you think you're too old for snapchat
you're not alone but social media is
getting younger and younger
now there's vine for kids Twitter's
6-second looping video service now has a
kid-friendly version where all videos
are pre-screened for child
appropriateness as if children didn't
already have enough issues with
attention spans now mom and dad can have
their kid this app to watch looping
video clips that are shuffled through by
swiping a finger with only six seconds
per clip people get creative and post
jokes sports stunts and pranks kid vine
has more fuzzy animals than what you may
typically find on your feed the vine
Kids app is a separate download only
available on iOS for now and on the
topic of apps Android apps are teaming
up with Google now to show up in those
card pop-up shortcuts Google now is the
personal assistant service on Android
and it shows you alerts and
info about your commute your sports
teams and other personalized advice but
now this includes notifications from
about 40 different apps for example if
you order groceries from the insta card
app you can reorder quickly from a
Google now card the Walgreens card
shortcut displays your loyalty rewards
barcode so you can scan it at the
register pandora has shortcuts to play
recent stations but not all makes sense
like Airbnb reminds you of rooms you may
want to book that's not helpful for your
day-to-day life it's just another way
for apps to nag you that your tech news
update and you can stay updated at
cnet.com and follow along on twitter
