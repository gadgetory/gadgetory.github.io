this is the Sennheiser urbanite XL
wireless one of the better sounding
Bluetooth headphones on the market
it carries a list price of $300 and
currently only comes in black but more
color options should arrive in the
future Sennheiser's urbanite line is
designed to have a little more urban
flair to it and appeal to the beats
audience this model looks very similar
to last year's Wired urbanite XL that we
liked but this model gives you the
option of going either wired or wireless
and as touch controls on the right ear
cup tap the side of the headphone once
and your music pauses tap it twice and
you advance a track forward you swipe up
and down to control volume some people
don't like these types of touch controls
because you can end up accidentally
touching the side of the headphone and
interfering with music playback but the
touch controls worked well for me
although I did have a few accidental
pauses along the way as far as other
extras go you get apt X which is
supposed to offer enhanced bluetooth
streaming with smartphones that support
it and dual microphones so you can hear
your voice in the headphones when you're
using the headphone as a cell phone
headset this model does not feature
active noise-cancelling like the Beats
Studio wireless and Sennheiser's more
expensive momentum Wireless but sound
isolation is quite decent and the
headphones are comfortable to wear
battery life is rated at a strong 25
hours of music playback and the
headphones do come with a two-year
warranty while made mostly of plastic
they do have metal hinges and seem
sturdily built and fold up into a more
compact form factor they come with a
carrying pouch but it's pretty skimpy
which is a little disappointing the
sound quality isn't however as I said
this is one of the best sounding
wireless headphones and may even sound
better than the more expensive momentum
Wireless depending on your audio taste
this is a very dynamic headphone with
very clean sound for Bluetooth and good
tight bass the bass isn't as huge as
Sennheiser says it is and this is
actually a fairly well balanced
headphone with a pretty warm mid-range
well the urbanite XL Wireless isn't
cheap at $300 it's cheaper than other
premium bluetooth headphones it overall
I think it's a pretty
decent value when you factor in its good
build quality comfort level and very
strong performance its design may not
appeal to everyone
that's an excellent bluetooth headphone
I'm David Carr noise thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
