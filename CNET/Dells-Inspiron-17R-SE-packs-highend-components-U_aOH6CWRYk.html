with the dell inspiron 17 r SE now that
is a mouthful but it helps you figure
out which part of Dells laptop line this
is first it's an Inspiron as opposed to
the more high-end XPS line secondly it's
an Inspiron 17 which means it's a big 17
inch desktop replacement that's not a
size we really even see that often
anymore then it's an Inspiron are which
is just a regular old Inspiron line as
opposed to the Inspiron z line which is
a little bit thinner I haves the z-axis
and finally is an Inspiron are se which
stands for I assume special edition
which means that they've actually packed
some higher-end components into what is
basically their more budget priced body
and the first reaction I've gotten from
anyone who has seen this laptop from the
moment we took it out of the boxes wow
that thing is big and thick and it's not
even so much that this 17 inch laptop is
remarkably bigger or thicker than 17
inch desktop replacements were last year
the year before the year before that
it's just that people's expectations and
conceptions of what a laptop should be
have really changed a lot thanks to
ultra books and a lot of other thin
laptops in fact a lot of those ultra
book style laptops are getting to be
bigger 15 inches 16 inches we've even
seen some fairly slim under one inch 17
inch laptops this is not this is an inch
and a half at the back of it making it
pretty much the thickest desktop
replacement we've seen in quite a while
and frankly just looks like a big
plastic brick now even though it's not
the most attractive system under the Sun
it is packed with some pretty high-end
components we've got a quad core Core i7
CPU and an NVIDIA GeForce 650 M graphics
card along with a one terabyte hard
drive all that packed in here it's 1099
which is not the most you know budget
price laptop of all time but if you
think about all those high-end
components that's usually a couple
hundred dollars less than you'd get the
same set up for from somebody else even
without moving into the more rarefied
air of a boutique laptop maker like
Dells own Alienware brand or origin or
main gear or somebody like that so what
you get is a very powerful laptop
and a little bit of a budget body so if
you're willing to go for the components
rather than look and feel there's
actually a good deal and pretty good at
mainstream to high-end gaming it's got a
1080p screen so it's great for HD video
as well if you spend another two hundred
dollars you can trade up to actually a
3d screen and you'll get a blu-ray drive
along with that I'm Dan Ackerman and
that is the Dell Inspiron 17r sp</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
