the Acura RL was the first time we gave
an editor's choice to a product that
didn't fit through the front door
it had futuristic tech like Bluetooth
voice command and GPS navigation we
wrote Acura has staked out technology as
its territory and the 2005 RL is the
company's deed of ownership well that
house got foreclosed on today you get
that technology when you rent a Kia
that's why we've got this guy the
all-new descended to the RLX let's drive
this 2014 it's loaded to the gills see
if they've caught up and check the main
styling tubes are the standard LED
headlights you don't see those very
often and this kind of kicked down belt
line and this body line that gets you
there that's unusual one creates a
little taller greenhouse you'd normally
expect but other than that it tends to
make the front end look kind of bulky
and the rest of the car just looks like
2013 car from Acura
okay first thing you notice in the RLX
is something that no other car has not
to this degree to LCDs both roughly in
the mid-size class navigation is what
you see right now on the top this is
what's new where you would normally have
this forest of Acura button they've
cleaned it up and given you a constantly
morphing contextually sensitive control
panel on the second one
but that's where things start to get a
little wandering and weird the
relationship between this screen and the
one above it will change in ways that
aren't consistent to my mind right now
I've got audio controls and some audio
information here we've climate at the
bottom an awful lot like the same
physical climate buttons just below it
that seems a little redundant but if I
go to the audio mode now I've got audio
taking up the upper screen as well as
the lower screen and again quite a bit
of redundant information going on
between here and here where this does
succeed is a couple places first of all
only having contextually sensitive
buttons means that you can have larger
ones because you only have the ones you
need at a time instead of these little
fiddly ones that acura is known for I
also like this this is a shortcuts menu
here that is sort of a clipboard you can
shortcut any number of vehicle settings
or menus into this area I will say that
these two screens are beautiful looking
now Acura has completely redesigned what
they do on LCDs except when you go here
that's the same map basically we've been
seeing for seven or eight years in Acura
Honda product which brings us to
entering an address now here's where
things get goofy I go to nav I go to
menu I hit address and you can see I
still have to enter things by bucket
tell it the city then tell it the street
then tell it the house number and this
is madness - alphabetic displays - enter
the address once QWERTY ones Roley
scrolling this is absurd which brings us
to our audio settings now just about all
the major hits of current audio
technology are in here AM and FM with
really clear indication of HD radio XM
satellite radio bluetooth audio
streaming Pandora support is built-in
works real slickly AHA is built-in as
well
I could never get it to invoke well off
my motorola droid phone now you've got
three audio
output systems to choose from the base
is Els audio which used to be a premium
rig then you can go up to Els studio
audio which takes you to 588 watts and
14 speakers up from 10 but the really
interesting thing is to go all the way
to Crowell Audio which we have here and
is a brand new offering you still have
14 speakers around the cabin but they're
made of exotic material some kind of
fiber that's stronger than Kevlar you've
got these metal grills on the actual
speakers they say they buzz less than
plastic and what may be the hottest
looking triple driver cabinet I've ever
seen in a production car living back
there on the back shelf never mind what
it looks like it sounds tremendous
now tell me we have a three and a half
liter v6 and Acuras hardly news but this
one is all-new three and a half liter v6
sitting sidesaddle driving front wheels
only for now we'll talk about all-wheel
drive in a minute direct injection
technology but normally aspirated the
numbers are 310 horse 272 foot-pounds of
torque gets this roughly thirty nine
hundred pound car up to sixty in a
pretty sprightly six and a half seconds
while delivering 2031 MPG not bad the
transmission is hardly a star though
it's a 6-speed automatic that's
garden-variety stuff these days what's
interesting about this engine as well is
that it's got active cylinder management
so it can through electronic and
mechanical means go from six to four to
even three cylinders and in between
those configurations on the fly
depending on how much power it needs so
when you're cruising on the highway
you're not driving a v6 you could be
driving a what a v3 now what this car
does have it all four wheels that you
may have noticed on that badge on the
rear is four wheels steering Honda's
been into that for a long time but this
is different they can point the same
direction as the front wheels for lane
changes or opposite direction of the
front wheels for cornering when you jam
on the brakes the rear wheels go
pigeon-toed
so you're basically dragging the rear
end instead of rolling it to help scrub
off speed and finally there's also agile
handling assist which uses braking not
steering on an inside wheel to help
vector you in around a turn
so the first thing I notice about the
RLX is while it's not overwhelming in
any way on paper I love this power train
this engine comes on with power when you
step on the gas I can't tell you how
many cars instead choosing to set up a
committee of sensors and servos and
semiconductors to think about it for a
moment I also think Pardo makes this car
nice to drive is the effortless nature
of it I attribute a lot of that to this
all-wheel steering technology no matter
what you do whether it's a short turn
like this or whether you're parking
you're doing a lane change it's pretty
effortless but it gets there without
being over assisted it gets there by
being fleet of foot handlings a little
tubby I mean here in this corner I got
too much lean and as I come back around
a little bit of slop going this way you
hit the sport button and you do not
sport highs the suspension all you do is
recurve the the powertrain responds it
doesn't do anything for body role and
such now let's go on the freeway and get
a little taste of one of the most
self-driving cars you can buy today this
guy
I've got adaptive cruise enabled here
and that brings on Lane keep assist
I'm going to set my adaptive cruise
speed and now the car is handling the
throttle maintaining speed maintaining
distance operating the brakes and it's
also steering it just read the curve in
the road left now right it is
maintaining the lane that is not
straight not me now by the way you keep
your hands off the wheel even though I
was just an inch away for too long if
lasts a big old warning up there on the
dash it knows you're not driving by the
lack of input on the wheel so it's not
encouraging you to do that now splicing
- 2014 RLX starts off at around forty
nine three but don't get too excited you
don't hit seen that Stiles - you pack
another $12,000 on top of that 2500 four
nav which is obviously navigation acura
length 3,500 for the tech package that
brings you studio audio line spot
technology 19-inch low noise wheels and
fancier leather 2500 bucks for the Krell
package that's that great crab audio
system and oddly rear sunshades finally
add 3500 on top of all of that to the
advance package and that's gonna bring
you the adaptive cruise Lane keep assist
and collision mitigating braking system
basically all the self-driving stuff
that's also the way that you get into
heated and cooled seats and parking
sensors there's a lot of bundling going
on here too bristle at in the end you're
gonna get a car that has a lot of
technology it's very ambitious but it's
not cutting edge across the stack you
also have a very interesting drivetrain
on this vehicle but unfortunately I
can't say the same about the styling
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
