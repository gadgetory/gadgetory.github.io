cnet.com and I'm here with the Panasonic
RP htx $733 anyway and they're quite
well built their lightweight headphones
for over the ear closed back headphones
they are designed for both home and
mobile use and they have this retro
styling air they come in multiple colors
and they're comfortable on your ears
they do offer a very tight seal so not
only do they seal out a lot of sound
passively but they also don't leak any
sound so they are good for cubicle use
at work terms of sound quality these are
pretty well balanced they also have good
detail there isn't a ton of base here so
if your base lever these probably aren't
the headphones for you but there is
ample base and it certainly is pretty
tight especially for that what these
guys cost they do accentuate the treble
a little bit which means they're a
little bit brash they will make badly
recorded tracks sound worse so you might
want to be careful of that but otherwise
they certainly perform well for the
money one small thing worth noting they
do have a reinforced plug so if you do
have a tough case on your phone that
plug probably will not fit into the
headphone jack on your phone terms of
X's there really isn't anything else
here except the headphones
there is no inline microphone or remote
and these don't fold flat so what you
see is basically what you get really
your choice here is a color choice this
is the white version it's not incredibly
exciting there are more exciting colors
but I did like these headphones a lot
particularly for the money their design
and their performance may not appeal to
everyone but for a lot of people these
really are a great bargain I'm David
Carr noise and those are the Panasonic
RP HT x seven pounds thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
