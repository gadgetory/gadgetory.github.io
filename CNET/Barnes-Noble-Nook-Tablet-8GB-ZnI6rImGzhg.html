net and has 199 the new entry-level
price for a color eReader tablet
certainly seems to be the case because
the Kindle Fire was $1.99 last year and
now the 8 gigabyte Nook Tablet has
debuted at $1.99 the same price with his
set of specs that matches the Kindle
Fire on a number of levels
last year's Nook tablet was 16 gigabytes
in its storage capacity and costs $250
this a gigabyte version halves the
internal storage it also has the amount
of RAM down to 512 megabytes as opposed
to one gig now Ram you may not really
notice in fact on our test unit here
seems like apps work reasonably well
it's a matter of expectation and
relative zippy nough storage you will
notice in fact that 8 gigabytes of
storage only some of it is user
accessible the way the Barnes &amp;amp; Noble
breaks down storage on the 8 gigabyte
tablet 1.5 gigabytes is accessible for
the Barnes &amp;amp; Noble Nook store that means
apps and books that's not a lot of
storage space where'd the rest go well
some of it is in the system software and
then there's 4 gigabytes that's set to
be user accessible now as you may know
if you are a Barnes &amp;amp; Noble Nook Tablet
user or you may not know there are no
cloud music download services or video
download services like you get on the
Kindle Fire sure there's Netflix Hulu
Plus Pandora a lot of ways to stream
music if you want music files or
full-length videos that are not streamed
via Wi-Fi you're gonna have to sideload
that which means you connect this to a
PC and take those files and put them
onto your Nook Tablet that's what that 4
gigabytes of storage comes in plus you
do get a micro SD card slot that's a big
deal because the Kindle Fire has no
expandable storage this is a micro SD
card slot that's expandable up to 32
gigs like the note tablet before it now
the advantages of the Nook Tablet versus
the Kindle Fire 1 the quality of the
screen we find that it's a little bit
better than the Kindle Fire and Netflix
looks even a little bit sharper
streaming on the Nook Tablet and that's
certainly something that Barnes &amp;amp; Noble
is touted on the Nook Tablet devices
that have come out in the past year now
the cons you're not going to have that
cloud music &amp;amp; video service so if you
want to
you download a movie saying watching on
a plane it's a little hard to do on this
in fact it's not possible unless you
start using things like Netflix and Hulu
Plus right now and those are
subscription-based services plus there's
a question of your ecosystem obviously
wherever you have the most books or
magazines or apps that's probably where
you want to go and as far as apps go
it's like the Kindle Fire it's a curated
selection of apps maybe not quite as
diverse as what's on the Kindle Fire but
you got a lot of your major games
covered Angry Birds of course and a lot
of others now at the same time there is
the Nook Color making it even more
confusing
that's the previous generation color
7-inch tablet that looks nearly
identical and costs 169 now dropping the
price a little bit
it also has 8 gigabytes of storage so
what's the difference the screens not
quite so great the processor is a little
slower and honestly for a 30 buck
difference you might just want to go
with the newest generation one for app
compatibility the real question for
users is going to come down to if you're
gonna buy a 16 gigabyte or an 8 gigabyte
version that attributable storage could
be a big deal allocating only 1.5
gigabytes of storage to Nuuk store apps
is very limiting now on the 16 gigabyte
version that jumps up to about 12
gigabytes and that's a lot more space
frankly the Nook Tablet is really nicely
designed I actually like it a little bit
more in its overall feel than a Kindle
Fire because of its clean lines it's
dedicated volume buttons off to the side
and it's got that fun little carabiner
over there I think it's cute I'm Scott
Stein and that's a look at the eight
gigabyte version of the Nook Tablet that
just became available at $1.99</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
