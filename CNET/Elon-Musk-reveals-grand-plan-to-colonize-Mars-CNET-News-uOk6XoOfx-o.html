industry is going to bifurcate along two
directions one one one path is we stay
on earth forever and then there will be
some eventual extinction event I don't
have an immediate doomsday prophecy but
there's it's eventually history suggest
there will be some some doomsday event
the alternative is to become a
spacefaring civilization and a
multi-planet species which I hope you
would agree that is the right way to go
yes so how do we figure out how to how
to take you to Mars this is an actual
scale of what the solar system looks
like so we're we're currently in the
third little rock from the left that's
earth and our goal is to go to the
fourth rock on the left that's Mars and
if we get a cut the cost of moving to
Mars to be roughly equivalent to a
median house price in in the US which is
around two hundred thousand dollars then
I think the probability of establishing
a self-sustaining civilization is very
high I think I think it would almost
certainly occur no not everyone who'd
want to go in fact I think a relatively
small number of people from earth would
want to go but enough would want to go
and who could afford the trip that it
would happen there these are the key
elements that are needed in order to
achieve the four and a half order of
magnitude improvements
most of the improvement would come from
full reusability somewhere between two
and two and a half orders of magnitude
and then the other two orders of
magnitude would come from refilling in
orbit propellant production on Mars and
choosing the right propellants and then
the propellant tank it goes up and
actually it'll go up multiple times
anywhere from three to five times to
fill the tanks of the of the spaceship
in orbit and then once the spaceship is
the tanks are full the cargo has been
transferred and we reach the Mars
rendezvous timing
as messages roughly every 26 months this
is to give you a sense of size is quite
big
and the funny thing is I think in the
long term the strips will be even bigger
than this I think this will represent
this will be relatively small compared
to the Mars interplanetary ships of the
of the future</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
