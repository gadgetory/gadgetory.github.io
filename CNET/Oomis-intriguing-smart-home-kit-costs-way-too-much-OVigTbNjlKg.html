called umi's successfully crowdfunded
1.7 million dollars for a new starter
kit for the connected living space and
here it is the only home smart home
system it comes with this dedicated
control tablet an Umi Cube camera hub a
smart switch for turning lamps fans and
other appliances on and off and two
color-changing smart bulbs one of the
really nifty things about goomy's system
is that all of the gadgets have
near-field communications built-in or
NFC for short with NFC two devices can
connect to each other just by being in
close proximity so when I bring the
tablet up to the bulb like this it
starts to change colors and pairs up
automatically just like that really easy
way to set up your system Lumia offers a
range of other gadgets you can add to
your set at a la carte style and the
system also syncs up with nest philips
hue and you can connect it with alexa
too though I wasn't able to test that
part out because movies Alexis skill is
still a work in progress all in all it's
still a pretty good pitch as far as
smart home platforms go
and as I tested it out here in the CNET
smart apartment everything worked
reliably well you can create custom
animations right on the tablet that will
do things like turn lights on when
motion is detected you can use the
tablet as a makeshift universal remote
and you can use Ruby as a basic DIY
security system - the big problem is
that this starter kit costs $700 $700 to
put that into perspective let's take
another look at the kit replace those
two bulbs with a pair of lifx bulbs
replace that smart switch with a Belkin
Wemo mini swap a nest cam bin for that
Gumi cube and replace the tablet
controller with an Amazon echo show
those are all well reviewed alternatives
with better features than what Lumia
offers and the total cost for them all
is just 585 dollars and that's if you're
buying everything full price for me
that's just too tough to reconcile I
like it with me is a simple no fuss
smart home system but there's just no
way I'd recommend spending $700</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
