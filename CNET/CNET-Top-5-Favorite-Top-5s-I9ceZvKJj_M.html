cnet top five from badly named products
to great blu-ray movies apple rumors oh
the apple rumors and of course cat
videos so as I hand this series over to
the crafty capable hands of Donald Bell
it seems there was just one last top
five for me to do top five top fives the
ones you watched the most over the last
year number five apples top five biggest
flops oof the hate mail I got for this
one don't dare point at the Emperor's
Harry unclothed body right but yes Apple
falls on its face now and then and this
list was proof that a great company
isn't built on what it does well but
also how it stays unfettered by the
things it doesn't do well and how much
vodka turns into the kool-aid damnit
there we go again number four top five
tablets duh nothing is growing as fast
spreading so wide and confusing so many
as the tablet market that makes it
pretty clever that the guy who's taken
over this series is a tablet guru look
for a refresh on that topic soon number
three top five things to do with a $99
HP touchpad do you recall what a dud
that thing was until it went on fire
sale and then everybody realized I don't
care what it does for ninety-nine bucks
as long as it powers up finds Wi-Fi and
launches a browser HP's biggest claim to
fame in tablets will be its retreat
number two the top five reasons not to
buy the new iPad the third one this
really struck a nerve as I heard from a
lot of folks who were on the fence about
the ipad 3 better display yes 4g you
probably won't sign up for and beyond
that a lot of incremental upgrades a
whole bunch of you were looking for
confirmation really permission that it's
okay to keep your iPad 2 and not feel
like a dolt and we had no problem giving
you those reasons and the number one top
5 video of the last 12 months was worse
named tech products how could it not be
I mean really
and seriously I mean no one comes up
Adobe names like the tech business
somewhere in that global confluence of
engineering company is trying to be
creative and languages all over the
world trying to make sense in English is
a great reality series or as we found
out a great top five for all these top
fives and a whole bunch more coming from
Donald make a run over to top five cnet
com I'm Brian Cooley thanks for watching
