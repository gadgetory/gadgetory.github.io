cnet.com and I'm here with the JBL on
beat micro this is a lightning equipped
speaker duct it retails for around a
hundred dollars and it's actually pretty
good what I liked about it is that it's
compact it also sounds pretty good it's
designed to sit on a nightstand it also
has an audio input so you can sit it on
your desk and use it as a speaker for
your laptop or desktop PC JBL also makes
speakers that work with lightning equip
iPads however this one is only designed
to work with the lightning acquit iPhone
or iPod Touch another small extra worth
mentioning is that there's a USB port on
the back that allows you to charge other
mobile devices including other
smartphones or even other tablets
including other iPads I did connect an
iPhone 4s and an iPad Mini and you can
stream audio through that USB connection
the only problem is that once you
connect anything to that USB port you
can't play audio through your dock
device though it will still charge
finally this is a portable speaker there
is a hidden compartment on the bottom of
the unit it allows you to add four
triple-a batteries that gives you about
five hours of battery life on the go
obviously it would been better if this
was a rechargeable speaker but that
probably would have added another $25 or
more to the cost of the unit in terms of
buttons on the unit it's really very
simple there's a power button and a
volume up and down button and that is it
one design element worth highlighting is
that the connector itself the Lightning
connector the post if you will does have
a little bit of play to it so it tilts
back and forth that allows you connect
your iPhone a little more easily but it
does have some play in it so if you do
pick up the speaker dock it may tilt
forward and that can be a little bit
disconcerting it's also worth mentioning
that you'll probably have to remove any
cases from your iPhone unless they are
ultra slim aside from those small
drawbacks I really did like the unit it
does play a lot louder than you think
it doesn't deliver a great sound but
it's decent sound and it can't fill a
small room with audio I'm David karna
and that's the JBL on beat
crow lightning equipped speaker doc
