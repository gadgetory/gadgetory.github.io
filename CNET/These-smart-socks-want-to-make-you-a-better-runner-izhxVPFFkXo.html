gather a lot of stats about your run or
maybe trying to change your forms and
you might be interested in something
like these what are they smart socks I'm
Jessica's all-court from CNN and these
are the censorious smart socks I'm gonna
walk you through the system because it's
a little bit bizarre you'll notice that
the socks are labeled right and left and
there's a reason for that that we'll get
to in a minute but for now I'm just
gonna put them on there are studs on the
front of the sock and this is because
we're going to attach this kind of cut
this is an anklet and it attaches
magnetically and this is what's going to
collect the data from our run so this
cuff only measures one sock at a time so
you can either have one sock and switch
it for your run if you're trying to get
data on your right foot and left foot
performance because that could vary or
you could spring for a second cup now
when you put the cuff all and see it
pops off kind of easily so this is the
best part you have to make sure that you
cup the sock over the anklet creating
this beautiful bulbous package right
here each sock has three textile sensors
sewn directly into the material now it's
these sensors that are measuring the
pressure of the foot that you run and
that can help you determine if you are a
ride the foot striker or a heel striker
the data from the sensors on the bottom
of the foot talked to the anklet which
all go into this free app for Android or
iOS that's where you're going to learn
everything about your run after the fact
including your cadence your pace your
distance your route that's been
collected through GPS and all
importantly if you're landing on the
ball of your foot or on that heel and
you want it to be the ball in addition
the app can help keep you on track there
is an optional metronome that will tell
you when you're off cadence there are
voice updates that let you know things
like your pace and how far you've gone
how many steps you've taken you can also
put it in a distance goal or a time goal
and the app will let you know as you're
running whether you've reached that goal
there are some line graphs after the
fact - and you can also look up your
statistics online on the Santori at
dashboard overall the whole system is
complicated as it is is trying to give
you a very detailed picture of your runs
so that you can train or so that you can
improve your form there's a lot more to
know about the whole sensoria smart sock
system you should definitely check out
my full review at Cena comm for all the
pros and cons</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
