emerges from Japan which means you know
things are going to get weird
some people are trying to teach a robot
karate cuz that's a good idea it's a
terrible idea and we check out the
Quadra foil an all-electric watercraft
that looks like it came straight from
the future not unlike this car tomorrow
daily
greetings citizens of the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily at the best
geek talk show in the known universe I'm
your host Ashley scanning me as always
once again forevermore Gaylen octopus
forever and ever forever you're actually
stapled to these chairs we are yeah
there's a there's an Arduino that's
actually keeping it's actually an
electric fence in the studio this keeps
us in here soured by raspberry pi in our
shop real cheap cheap only caused less
than $50 to keep us trapped in here we
have guys it's a weird day
it's a weird day we got some weird
stories so so we might as well just jump
right in let's have the headlines okay
as we always say here on tomorrow daily
we love Japan we love Japan love you
Japan and when I saw this story very
early this morning I knew it was gonna
be on today's show because it is right
up our alley this is called the close
sisters bra now we're going to get this
is a very special bra it's from a
company called triumph and it changes
look at that change
yeah the cup changes yeah it changed the
pattern change of the cup changed okay
okay so this is okay the close sisters
bra inspired by the movie frozen which
is apparently why they're wearing these
little crystal crowns and and it changes
from polka dots to look at two
snowflakes to blue and white snow so
it's it's it's a it's a themed bra that
listen I do not recall I've seen frozen
I do not recall a scene in which Elsa
Nana hung around in their undies but the
version begun is it Japanese version of
frozen yeah okay so the bras come with
matching short skirts with little heart
shapes on the hips and so what's
happening is you can see a little heart
shapes on the side there when they bump
hips they eat it's the bras made of a
paper the part that changes it's like an
ePaper deccan that can transform so when
they bump it changes so that's there you
go goes back and forth from black and
white polka dots to white and blue
snowflakes the the saddest part about
story is I know if there was a down side
of the story here it is there is no plan
to release these to the general public
there's no plan to make these retail
this was made with triumph and and they
collaborated with this company called
fashion entertainments in Japan to
promote sisterhood and show off the
technology the ePaper technology yes all
right I just thought this was so bizarre
apparently fashion entertainments
actually already makes a bowtie out of
this ePaper that changes that's cool
which is really neat and so that they
like took it to the next step which was
working with a lingerie company to make
like an ePaper bra I'm big on the ePaper
has very very strange doubt by the bra
but I bump your sister's hip I know I
just so bizarre but I really like the
concept of like clothes that can change
on a whim as you to fit your mood or
your stuffing what about what about if
we did a couple thing you know like you
you and your significant other you know
like they you know your significant
other had the bra and then you had the
bowtie and then it would you burn in
your case reverse it yeah yeah
but cool that would be really cool so
yeah it won't be for sale but I just saw
it and thought you guys needed to see
that and honestly anybody who's only
listening to an audio version of this
show please watch because that was
incredible it was cute it was kawaii you
might even say kawaii is adorable okay
so speaking of some some weird tags I
don't know I was gonna say I was hoping
you weren't gonna say speaking of
adorable because I'm like this is not
it's not adorable this is a terrible
idea this is a robot that knows karate
his name is Atlas and this is from
Boston Dynamics it's owned by go by
Google so here we go it's it's this
six-foot 330 pound robot nope that can
do the the crane move like from karate
look at it he's balancing on a cinder
block with one leg and the other leg is
in the air as if he is doing a crane and
he's moving around so he's got complete
control over his balance so this is a
this this is Atlas of course this is
from the same people that have made pet
man and wild wild cat and big dog no but
I don't like any
and they're all terrifying all amazing
but all kind of creepy but uh what's
what's interesting is that the this
robot was not programmed by Boston
Dynamics it was actually programmed by a
Institute named the IH MC so they
programmed it to do the the karate moves
here incredibly horrifying yes master
controlls but I mean usually this robot
is programmed for actual product
productive things and to scare or beat
us to death with karate moves right it's
supposed to save people from like
disasters and whatnot yeah I guess
instance I guess it could go places like
I like Fukushima it could have gone into
a nuclear site where humans couldn't go
be too dangerous and I guess it could do
that but now we can send it to space to
fight aliens with its karate moves well
you know it's a really good contingency
plan I think I think it's like I think
that's why companies and labs like
Boston Dynamics like listen we have
these robots they can help people but we
should probably teach them martial arts
because there could be aliens and maybe
we can't fight them look if we if they
had taught it to drink a cup of tea we
wouldn't be reporting on it right now
it's knows karate it knows more deadly
moves than I do
no but I mean it doesn't look it doesn't
know any attacks it looks like it knows
how to balance so it's almost yoga but
only matter type but karate kid' reboot
with the robot it is all I'm saying it
is only a matter of time before we see a
headline where Atlas the robot kicks
researcher in face escapes Boston
Dynamics facility that's that's what I'm
waiting for
kake's researcher right in the face
takes off train it to help people
all right so training it brings it to
our hashtag of the day so our hashtag
the day to day you guys are question
that you are you are gonna answer is
you're gonna use the hashtag TD karate
but we want to know who's your friends
completely run who would you want to
hire fictional or real what person would
you hire to train a robot and in what
discipline so it could be anything
really anything I would hire Cesar
Millan Oh to train a robot to walk my
dogs all right I would I would do
Oh what's the Alton Brown okay and I
would just teach you how to cook like
everything real weird I like it did
these macaroni and cheese bars and you
make them and then you fry oh oh good I
come on when he did that grilled cheese
sandwich actually on the grill oh yeah
that was the best so that's really smart
I look about and that's that first step
into the wally universe and where they
feed us we get fat and then so then it's
cupcake in a cup all the way but it
could be fictional people like yeah good
julia Morpheus Morpheus from the matrix
it could be Morpheus or it could be
Keanu Reeves from the matrix now I can
say for John wick
yeah from John wick anything how to seek
revenge yeah I like it
alright I'm gonna just see what people
want to trainerroad I'm gonna do dying
to know I'm dying to know alright let's
talk about the Quadra foil this is a
very interesting little bit of kits so
usually if you write if you've ever
ridden a jet ski or some other kind of
watercraft they're pretty loud yeah they
have motors in them they're run by gas
you put gas in them that can be really
expensive so not anymore because the
Quadra foil is here to change that this
is the Quadra foil it's a hydrofoil
impersonal craft it runs entirely on
electric power nice fully electric so
those are the foils they look like
little legs they actually act as lifts
for the craft so once it hits seven
miles per hour it rises up out of the
water wow that looks creepy kind of
amazing out looks like a giant spider
floating through the floating through
the ocean yeah very it's not touching
the surface of the water very much so
because it's electric it's very very
quiet it releases zero emissions which
is great because there's no oil getting
leaks into the water there's no chance
of if you have a crash it's not gonna
you know spill a bunch of fuel
everywhere but for me it looks like one
of two things either a seadoo for rich
snobs who hit country clubs way too
often this couple this couple looks like
the ad League Country Club like they
should have cardigans and early haha
Buffy like high ball once I get off my
quadrupole I can well I dropped my gold
watch that's okay I keep another exactly
exactly all my gold by 24 karat gold
Rolex went into the ocean oh well I have
another one on my left arm like that's
what it looks like or or it looks like
an alien spacecraft that is meant to
actually cruise the lakes of Europa
which is like I thought that was pretty
cool so is this thing shockingly light
as well is that what we're looking at so
the cool thing about this is is the
creators say it's unsinkable they claim
it as unsinkable oh that's always worked
out well Titanic I'm sure it worked out
really well fin abut it because the
craft has a hollow hull so there's an
engine in there but it's for the most
part of the hull is hollow so it's very
difficult to sink and it gets it seats
to people as you can see in the video it
tops out at 25 miles per hour and has a
range of about 54 nautical miles so you
know it's kind of his range and it takes
two hours to charge fully so not long at
all only two hours a couple hours um
you can pre-order it so are you ready
are you ready to get out your wallet
you're ready to get out your gold Rolex
sell it pocket buy one of these
quadruples all right I like that you
have a Velcro well I hate that I have a
Velcro thank you you're such an adult
okay so if you want the lower powered
q2a model that's gonna cost you
18650 dollars but that but you know what
if you have a little extra cash in there
you can get the limited edition q2 S
which has a larger motor and that'll set
you back twenty-seven thousand nine
hundred and eighty dollars how much does
a normal boat cost probably well it
depends on the size of the boat but you
do get here you get some extras you get
the Quadra foil you get two life jackets
and you get a paddle in case you run out
of power and you also get a safety
whistle so if you want to recreate
Titanic where she's hanging on to a
board or something and be blows the
whistle to get the ship to come rescue
her you could do that okay so it doesn't
sound that expensive but it also sounds
like it might be cheaper to get a boat I
just you know what my recommendation is
don't ever buy a boat and just rent one
whenever you want it because most people
unless you're gonna live on the boat my
dad has a boat and it's just AM is a
money pit just keep putting money into
it it's ridiculous alright scary spider
boat yeah scary spider boat Quadro foil
pretty cool though I mean I thought it
was really neat I would like for them to
get cheaper in price and then maybe
maybe not $30,000 doesn't mean the cost
of student my student loans maybe maybe
not that so alright well on that note we
are gonna take a quick break we'll be
right back in about 30 seconds with new
releases and there are so many good ones
this week and of course your user
feedback and our phone target for the
day so don't click away tomorrow daily
hey friends we're back I know you points
it looks so nice and I pantomime stupid
like you anybody listening is like
what's really not adding a lot today
killin really is just not he's just he's
not into it today alright you guys it is
Tuesday which means and we are gonna
jump into all the cool new stuff that
you should be checking out so this is
new releases
I feel like we actually might have to be
due to new releases every week these are
so much good stuff reading much today
leading up to the holidays it's gonna be
an avalanche of amazing games but that's
good stuff down right so that when Black
Friday happens you have your shopping
the best American you can be by buying
all of them buying all the things so our
very first new release is of course
Assassin's Creed unity out today for
Xbox one Playstation 4 and PC Oh PC PCI
so this is well that's what I saw in
Ubisoft so hopefully hopefully PC today
I haven't I've heard that it's not not
getting great reviews not not a hundred
percent great it's that every other one
gets great reviews though yeah I mean if
you're looking for multiplayer I mean
this is this is the Assassin's Creed for
you if you've always wanted multiplayer
this is the one you want to get because
this is the only one with it not to
extend this this part but like how can
they get it wrong they've been kind of
just adding things and not really
subtracting things yeah I mean I'd like
the reviews that I've seen thus far have
been like well and producer Logan and I
were discussing it too right before the
show what we've kind of seen is that
people are saying well you have to
communicate with your teammates like
vocally like which I don't care for if
you're playing with strangers because
you know how that always ends you guys
and then the other part of it is is that
the single-player game wasn't really
like it was just kind of like they're
like it was just like oh okay well it's
no Assassin's Creed game so but the
thing is is there are diehard fans in
the series who I'm sure will love it so
there you go and then not and then also
today but speaking of multiplayer
speaking of multiplayer big the the one
the one that you could argue started at
all yes halo Master Chief collection is
available for Xbox one today $60 for all
the Halo for every Halo that you've ever
played including online remastered in
1080p 100 maps for multiplayer
it's got Halo one two three and four and
also I think has the TV series on it
nightfall yeah it's this episode
nightfall and then I think it has access
for the Alpha 4 halo 5 Guardians
somebody in the in the comments correct
me if I'm wrong yeah please correct Kel
if he's wrong and also the one thing
that I have been hearing about that is
that matchmaking is broken right now
yeah so we did it apparently very
popular a low master chief collection
but you know that's good that means
people are still people still love it
which is so cool I mean that that was
really the game that broke open I would
say that and maybe goldeneye for the 64
broke open multiplayer console like FPS
I think it was Halo that was the online
one the one that was the big one where
yeah where it was online and then but I
would say like console FPS like gold and
I would be the first of like that I can
think of where I was like oh my god like
this is changing everything halos one of
the smartest shooters for sure it's
really great
you made my Kneedler yeah you're a
needler person now everybody hates to be
like a real person
everybody hates the needler it's the
worst but great go $60 very very very
reasonable and if you have a friend or a
family member that likes video games
they probably want this if they don't
have it if they have an Xbox one and
then also today which I thought was
super cool is if you have ever loved
Batman the Batman 1966 television series
is available now on blu-ray oh yeah this
is an unbelievable remaster okay like
look at how beautiful the remaster is of
this show so they remastered everything
oh wow it's gorgeous like it is so
beautiful compared to what we used to
see on TV and so look at how crisp
everything it was only 120 episodes yeah
fully remastered blu-ray all the things
there's some really great special
features they have like I think it's
like a sit-down talk with Adam West
where they it's Guelph Garmin and Kevin
Smith sat down and talked to Adam West
there's like a roundtable kind of
discussion with the others but it's
really really cool and and it's
available I want to say on Amazon I want
to say it was pre-ordering for like 170
bucks but it's like a box that like it's
a full box out of a whole series so I
would imagine that's not too
unreasonable
there's a lot of extras and for people
who are really big fans of that series
and there are many it's a it's a good
deal think about already how much people
spend on like the box set for friends
with the entire series the entire so
many episodes is that well it's like ten
seasons 22 episodes of season oh there
we go there we go you pulled it up Logan
pulled it up how much to say 175 yeah
free shipping
that's all would be a lot of fun to
provar weekend's hang out the front I
wait man I mean it's one of those things
where it's like it's really fun to have
it's cool you can throw it on during
like a party or something it's always
entertaining I just have on the screen
so I'd be like a good gift for my dad my
dad would probably really dig that yes
and also just to Betty's getting a tie
again this you're gonna get an ePaper
bowtie oh yeah I'm gonna get my stepmom
a bra perfect
and then that won't be awkward at all
also we are just because because we
don't have video of this but Foo
Fighters sonic highways dropped
yesterday so if you're into Foo Fighters
their new album is out which it's
producer Logan's the head musician of
our crew he likes yeah he missed her
musician well yes it he doesn't want to
listen a whole thing until he watches
the documentary series on HP I can't
tell if that makes him a good like music
fan or not he's like maybe a little bit
of a music snob but in a really good way
this gives us good recommendation yeah
he does
so a party he told me to listen an
eye-for-an-eye party high fives for
knife party uh on that note it's time
for user feedback picking a knife party
I am jumping around stab people you're
all you do is just say speaking of
speaking of and then whatever the line I
know is that that's I there's something
endearing and charming about it to me
especially when has nothing to do with
what you're about to say that's the best
part
so first of all I just want to really
briefly say thank you to attack beast
who yesterday wanted to beam us as
Holograms into his living room so that
he could have tomorrow dealings living
room he actually photos we gave him an
opportunity to photoshop
into the show which he did and say thank
you very much for that and it just makes
me laugh every time I see it's great
like he says here's my here's my
hologram of me and you guys on the show
lol happy Veterans Day
and also yeah happy Veterans Day to
anybody out there who has will or or is
serving in the military thank you for
being better people thanks mom thanks
dad thanks stepmom thanks dad stepdad
thanks stepsister
I know I'm like I'm like grandpa great
oh yeah bye grandpa yeah I mean like
there's no you have a lot of a lot of
service history and my family as well
okay so moving on to our tweets we asked
you guys yesterday to use the hashtag TD
net to ask us your net neutrality
questions or to ask or to make comments
about it so okay Matt wrote to us and
said I think net neutrality is a great
thing the internet needs to be the same
for everyone that's just my opinions
right we agree there shouldn't be any
roadblocks and communication and
information I agree so here's an
interesting question most of these other
through your questions so Jay wrote to
us and said why did net neutrality
become an issue and they go that is a
really good question so basically back
in the 90s we passed the
Telecommunications Act which required
the FCC to treat ISPs like common
carriers which meant that there couldn't
be discrimination of content or going to
or from your computer so it's basically
right at the beginning kind of when the
internet started picking up steam with
the general public they were like okay
listen it's common carrier at one point
then after that some folks in the
government people who are now lobbyists
and all this other great stuff decided
to change that and reclassify broadband
as an information service so that now
that sort of regulation of you can't
discriminate does not apply to
information services so it stops the FCC
from being able to stop ISPs from
discriminating against specific types of
content so this reclassification is
really what's at the heart of the issue
so this reclassification when did that
happen I want to say it happened in the
2000s like during when Bush was
president okay I think so this
reclassification is sort of the problem
because a lot of people think that we
should go back to classifying the
Internet as a telecommunication service
which would let the FCC disallow any
type of traffic discrimination okay so
that's what we mean when we
say that we would reclassified as like
under title 2 which was reclassified as
sort of a public utility and we used to
so when we had phones just landline
phones and Telegraph's as we used phone
lines to access the internet for
dialogue right so we used phone lines to
contact each other it was our main means
of information which means that we could
not discriminate against content going
across that data or across that pipe
when I call it a pipe okay so now
because the Internet is our source of
information we we get some people get
their television from an Internet loop
some people have they have all of their
internet from that some people have
their phone line set up to run off of
their internet they have voice over IP
so why would we not the argument is why
would we not reclassify it as a public
utility because it is used very much in
the same way that phone lines were back
before we have the Internet so that's
why it's important and why it happened
so there you go that's it's sort of a
weird like I I feel like it's important
for people understand why and what's
going on and stuff but that's why so
that's there you go
so like the big argument is that let's
say like Comcast says well I don't want
you to use Google anymore yeah we don't
like Google yep so on the oatmeal they
have this great cartoon about what net
neutrality is and he explains it this
way so Comcast decides we're gonna have
our own search engine and to go to
Google either Google house maybe Google
has to pay a bunch of money or maybe you
get slower internet if you want to go
use Google or they basically try
everything they can to discourage you
from using the sites that they don't
want you to use so that is not very good
thing so bad so but no one's saying and
here's the thing no one's saying that's
happening right now but it could and the
other thing by little to it is kind of
happening because we saw Comcast very
publicly throttling Netflix and saying
no during these negotiations you need to
pay more for all the bandwidth you're
using Verizon doing something like that
today we're - and as soon as Netflix
paid oh suddenly miraculously they're
there download speeds went way out
so you can find these charts online and
basically like the mom
they're like the mom kind of yeah yeah
it's just it's really it's a lot of
strong-arming and it's not good for
anybody who loves a free and open
Internet
that's which is you yeah so really yes
everybody it's all of us it's me it's
you it's everybody listening and
watching so you're just scared of it
slowly happening because it's slowly
happening you can go into the radar but
as long as we're like hey we need to
keep aware of this then we can like the
net neutrality thing needs to be a big
noise right now all the time like yeah
so that we've got our eye on it and it's
good that Obama said it so that we can
have some subscribe everybody can hear
it so right and I mean very much is that
whole concept of if you put it it's like
an old adage if you put a frog in hot
water the Frog immediately jumps out and
boiling water frog jumps out if you put
it in cold water and slowly bring it to
a boil frog won't jump out I'll just sit
there and die so we don't want to do
that with the internet we have to be
vigilant about what's going on here so
we'll see how at work we need Google
Fiber like now everybody hates good we
need Google Fiber was it one terabyte
down it's crazy it's just like really
slow high-speed Internet compared to a
lot of places in the world
Korea is theirs it's like cell phones
have like 150 down I mean it's it's nuts
like your infrastructure is a madness
but it's also about smaller than the US
so it's much harder to build out an
infrastructure here than it is in a
smaller country mine is like 12 12 down
it's not cool not so great I'm still
loading a picture of a fish that I was
looking at earlier I have said I have 75
75 on quantum FiOS but whoa the average
say it like 60 down 60 that's why you're
good at Mario cards cuz you beat every
because you got a better internet
connection no I'm just better lamb just
better all right our very last piece of
user feedback as always is our photogra
for the day
this phone target for the day we're
gonna have problems with I'm gonna tell
you right now here's why
dear tomorrow daily crew my name is
Connor C and I am an avid 14 probably 15
year old photographer I took this photo
whilst on a day trip to London with my
new iPad oh why did you do that the
photo is of London's iconic Tower Bridge
with the Sun setting behind dense clouds
in the peripheral of the image there was
no post editing a photo shopping just
plain old HDR I hope you like it enough
to be featured on your amazing show
Connor whilst I know that the iPad is
not a phone I still hope that it
qualifies I will allow it I will not
appreciate it as much really nice
picture it's a fantastic picture it's
beautiful but but all I can see here is
what I see I know you see it you see I'm
doing it
here's yeah I this is what I see this is
what I see when I when I see that
picture I see this yep the instance
someone said I am looking through that
picture and all I can see is you taking
it but I will say that I am impressed
with the actual photo no it's a great
picture it's gorgeous yes it looks look
at the color in the sky I mean it's
really beautiful obviously I mean listen
I'm not about taking pairs of tablets
cuz it makes me enraged but but I will
say that the iPad twos camera looks
really good yeah I'm gonna play devil's
advocate iPad air 2 I'm sorry I'm gonna
play devil's advocate and say well you
probably could size of the pictures
actual scope better because he was doing
it on an iPad oh okay all right let's
get artsy let's talk about it he's
Connor Kevin you're sad Connor kills has
called you out that was a really nice
picture of the Tower Bridge though
they're really nice and it took me a
