Dreyfuss and happy new year welcome to
rumor has it the show where we round up
the week's biggest tech rumor and then
we vote on what sounds legit and what
seems like it will never ever happen and
remember that you can vote on all the
rumors too so keep your eye out for the
interactive poll if you're watching on
cnet first looks like blackberry
messenger users are finally going to get
video chat images leaked of the new face
time like service for blackberry 10 in a
reader forum on crackberry com but have
since been taken down but not before the
boy genius report snagged a few for
posterity I didn't even realize that
BlackBerry's had cameras kidding but
only kind of the launch of blackberry 10
is slated for january thirtieth so if
you care at all about this rumor you'll
find out benefits for real next up
according to Japanese newspaper Asahi
Shimbun toshiba is creating lighter
light camera technology for mobile
devices that should be released before
the end of 2013 much like light shows
light field cameras toshibas version
would let people choose what part of a
photo they would like to focus on after
they've taken the shot the camera would
also supposedly record video in a
similar fashion which is something that
lytro hasn't yet introduced this is an
awesome concept the lytro camera is
unimaginably fun to play with but it's a
standalone device that's decidedly
unnecessary especially if you're
thinking about dropping a few hundred
bucks if it were built into a camera
phone though whoa yeah I wonder if
putting the tech into a camera that you
have with you all the time will allow it
to take off or if it'll just be another
gimmicky feature like 3d next Russian
gadget site rosette ked has a video of
the samsung galaxy s4 that is really
cool like stop what you're doing and go
watch it cool okay are you back did you
see how thin the s4 looks that laser
keyboard the projection onto the table
and works perfectly it make us the
galaxy s3 look like one of those old
like wouldn't crank sizes but before you
go out and sell your samsung galaxy s3
on Amazon let's consider the source
rosette kid is a Russian gadget news
site this video was made in
by them supposedly of leaked parts the
marketing language is in English but
it's definitely not formed by someone
entirely fluent as employees of a gadget
news site ourselves let us tell you how
unlikely it is that leak parts of the
hottest phone in the world right now
made it on to rosette keds editor's desk
that would be highly unlikely more
likely the graphic design team at the
Russian site is pretty talented and
that's not nothing it's a really cool
video just almost certainly fake next an
apple rumor that doesn't have to do with
the phone or a TV can you believe it
Business Insider is reporting that Apple
has partnered with Intel to develop an
iOS watch according to supply chain
sources the watch would be Bluetooth
enabled and it'll have a 1.5 inch oled
screen and it would be released sometime
in the first half of the year this isn't
completely unfamiliar territory for
Apple of course you can already buy a
band for the ipod nano and wear that on
your wrist just like cnet editors Scott
Stein did he loves his nana watch I
don't see a reason for Apple not to do
this it'd be great to wear while
exercising and if it had a FaceTime
camera you could pretend that you were a
spy although be the greatest father's
day gift ever so what do you guys think
do you think Apple is going to make a
watch what colors would it come in what
features would it have don't forget to
vote while we ask the cnet council the
cnet council is composed of five editors
who cast their votes anonymously their
opinions are not an endorsement by cnet
or CBS interactive obviously because
these are rumors folks and the cnet
verdict is no four out of five of our
cnet editors think that apple will
definitely not come out with a
SmartWatch but one of them said why not
that's our show everybody please share
your rumours that rumor has it at cnet
com or call us at 1 800 750 cnet and
tweet us next week we're going to be
coming at you live from the cnet stage
at CES in vegas we're going to scour the
show floor to find you the hottest
rumors see you then
