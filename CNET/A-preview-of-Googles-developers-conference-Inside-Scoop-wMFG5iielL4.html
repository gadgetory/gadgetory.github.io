Needleman editor-at-large for Cena Rafe
thanks for being with us okay so Rafe is
going to be at the google i/o conference
that's taking place later this week Rafe
tell us you're planning to attend yeah
what can we expect from this year's
conference it's going to be big and
flashy I just talked to the Google guys
and they're saying we're going to
whatever was last year with all the
screens going on it's going to be even
bigger this year so they're trying to
get a lot of buzz going for the show and
it's interesting because it's a
developer's conference the audience are
people who build products on the Google
platforms Chrome Android the tablets the
phones and all that but they're trying
to make it a big media splash so attract
attention beyond the developers
obviously right well the debate starts
with developers the developers have to
build things but they're building them
for Google's new products so we expect
to see a new google tablet hear the
rumors of the the nexus 7 the 7-inch
tablet google-branded tablet not done
with partners but branded by Google like
the Nexus phones are okay and anything
different besides the flesh from past
conferences any major differences um we
don't know yet we are very excited to
hear more about google glasses we don't
know what they're going to be doing with
glasses at the show but i can't imagine
that they're going to have a big
developers conference like this with a
splashy new product that they say
they're going to bring to market this
year without giving people a hint maybe
a Tryon of these new goggles so somebody
besides a Google employee perhaps might
get to try them on after this conference
maybe I hopefully me but I don't know
we'll see and finally you know Larry
Page the CEO typically attends every
conference so this year though it seems
like he may not be there why and tell us
what kind of impact it may have well he
sent a note out to staff saying that
he's unable to speak for a few days so
he won't be giving any speeches at at
Google i/o and that's a bit of a downer
i mean you expect the leadership of the
company to be there of course they're
sergey we expect to be there we don't
know who yet is going to be giving the
keynotes there's one on Wednesday
morning one on Thursday morning probably
the condola of Google+ because that's so
core two
googles mission now the social angle
google stock went down on this news we
think so it's kind of a big deal that
Larry's not able to make it okay all
right and we will have more updates
throughout the week of course we will be
live blogging the keynotes it's a
three-day show will be covering the heck
out of it we've got a whole team going
we'll be looking at the new products
both for consumers and for the
enterprise any new hardware
announcements the whole thing Google
cars maybe we don't know Rafe thanks so
much for joining us for seen it im sue
me does thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
