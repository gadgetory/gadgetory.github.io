festivals then leave your iPhone at home
then you knock yet 33:10 is a phone that
you need to take no this is not your
supercharged smartphone you won't have
Instagram you will have snapchat you
don't have any apps at all you don't
even get 3G Wi-Fi a touchscreen and
don't even get started on contactless
payments but you don't need any of that
what you need is a small phone that will
fit in your pocket while you're dancing
in a crowd a phone that will easily last
the whole muddy weekend on a single
charge so you're never out of contact
with your friends in the other campsite
a phone that will raise a smile when you
whip it out in the key for drinks and
raise a smile it will the original Nokia
3310 has rightly become a classic icon
of mobile phone history and while this
modern iteration is a bit slimmer and
more rounded it's still very clearly the
3310 that many of us are doored in the
early noughties sure it's 2 megapixel
camera is absolutely awful so if you do
want to remember your weekend in detail
you can just take a cheap camera you can
still brag about the amazing time you're
having on Twitter and Facebook they'll
just need to log into the desktop
websites directly through the Opera Mini
web browser now that's no quick task
because there's no 3G so it's likely
that you'll have missed your favorite
bands hit song by the time you're done
best pay for that for those long food
queues and only 50 pounds here in the UK
the new Nokia 3310 is well worth a shot
as a second phone for those rough
weekend's away where your pricey Galaxy
s8 might take a destructive tumble
risk-taking and breaking your smartphone
if you absolutely must just make sure
you've got a 3310 in your other pocket
while your friend smartphones with a run
out of juice by lunch you'll still be
going strong long into the night with
more than enough power left for a
classic game of snake to help take your
mind off those awful festival toilets
