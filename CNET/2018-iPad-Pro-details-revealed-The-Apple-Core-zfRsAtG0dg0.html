and Apple spy chip problems let's get
right to the core of this week's Apple
news and rumors with Apple's expected
October announcement getting closer and
closer with every passing week we're
getting more details about what those
products will look like and this week
it's all about those new iPad pros which
have basically been confirmed at this
point thanks to the code in iOS 12.1
beta that actually references an iPad
2018 fall in the code that's according
to nine-to-five Mac now we've talked
about the two sizes were expecting an 11
and a 12 point 9 inch screen with that
edge to edge display no not and face ad
support but one of the rumors that was
still up in the air was whether or not
it was going to have that horizontal
unlock and now according to sources
familiar with the matter it is a go
another new detail to come out of this
report is that the USB C port on this
iPad would actually allow it to output
4k HDR video to external displays and an
older rumor talked about that new smart
connector for accessories that this time
would be above the charging port as seen
in these on leaked renders and then
there's a new Apple pencil in the works
which apparently will have that air pod
like proximity pairing now back in
iPhone 10s news it seems like all is
good with the gates well sort of this
week Apple released an iOS 12 point 0.1
update which includes the fix for
charged gate that charging issue that
was causing phones not to charge
immediately when they were connected to
a lightning cable if the screen was off
among other issues which users were
complaining about like Wi-Fi
connectivity
so good for them for taking care of
these issues right away and not having
users wait until the iOS 12.1 release
but maybe next time get it right the
first time
the other issue that seems to have been
resolved is the so called beauty gate
where users were noticing an airbrushed
effect on portraits coming from the
front camera of the phone and when I say
resolved I guess I really mean explain
because this wasn't a result of a
software update but more of a conclusion
from multiple photography experts
including our own here at CNET who came
to the same conclusion that it's not a
deliberate smoothing effect but more of
a result of the noise reduction and the
HDR features on the new phone now if you
want proof that this is more of a
subjective issue I invite you to go
check out Jonathan Morrison's YouTube
page now he conducted an interesting
experiment where he told his followers
that this selfie was taken on a pixel
phone now a lot of his followers on
Twitter and Instagram
we're raving about this photo saying
that the pixel was the camera King some
even went on to say that it looks so
much better than the iPhone I fail and
then he revealed that it was actually
taken on an iPhone Tenace now I'm sure a
lot of people weren't happy with what he
did
but I think it's kind of genius it goes
to show you that this is really
subjective
now the other shout out goes to
photographer filmmaker and Gregory from
photos and colors who published an
interesting comparison of the video of
the 10s and a $10,000 professional
camera now besides the fact that the
video itself is pretty cool what really
got me was the blind test at the top
where he invites users to pick out which
one is which now it may be obvious to a
lot of you from the get-go but to me it
wasn't that easy at least not until he
pointed out the differences but this
week Apple's been dealing with more
serious issues a Bloomberg Businessweek
report published last week suggested
Chinese spies had implanted tiny
surveillance tips into the data center
equipment of dozens of high-profile
companies including Apple and Amazon
during the manufacturing process
now these tips are extremely hard to
detect according to their report because
they're smaller than a grain of salt but
they could extract all kinds of
information from the devices they've
been built into and have been allegedly
used to gather intellectual
property and trade secrets from Apple
and Amazon and the report goes on to
suggest that Apple became aware of the
issue in 2015 and cut ties with the
manufacturer Supermicro since the
publication both Apple and Amazon have
flat-out denied the allegations stating
that nothing of the sort was ever found
Apple even said - seen it that if they
did they would have been transparent
about it and they would have worked with
law enforcement to resolve it and
they've received some pretty high-level
support the Department of Homeland
Security and UK's national cybersecurity
Center have both backed up the denial
stating that at this time we have no
reason to doubt this statements from the
companies named in the story but
meanwhile Bloomberg is not backing down
you can check out all the details from
the original report on Bloomberg or
check out our continued coverage on CNET
comm that's it for our show but I want
to know what products you're most
excited about to see in the October
launch event so hit me up on the
comments section below or on Twitter you
know the drill and come back next week
for more apple core</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
