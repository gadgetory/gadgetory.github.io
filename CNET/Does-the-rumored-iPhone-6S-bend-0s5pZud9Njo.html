welcome to the apple byte for everything
good and bad inside the world of apple
lots of action this week after John pics
cow skis BuzzFeed report claims apples
fall event will happen on sep tember the
9th and will feature not only new
iPhones but new iPads and the new Apple
TV now that's a whole lot of apples so
what are we hearing about each of these
products right now well the iphone 6s is
expected to bring force touch to iphones
for the first time and a 9to5 mac report
says it will be used for shortcuts or
faster actions and not a new screen for
more button options like the Apple watch
with its smaller screen now according to
their sources it's known internally as
orb and an example of a shortcut action
would be forced touching on a map
destination and immediately launching
turn-by-turn directions or even force
touching directly on a home screen icon
like let's say the phone app and you can
take you directly to voicemail now
forest touch looks to be a nice touch
but I don't expect Apple will be using
this as a big-time selling point for the
success there's a lot of back and forth
on whether or not we'll see an iphone 6c
but recent developer logs from feek su
has revealed two new iPhones into web
traffic logs over July labeled iPhone 81
and iPhone 82 now the first iphone 5c
was labeled 73 but there's no phone with
the number a 3 that is shown on their
logs with the majority of hits coming
from the United States so really all we
know is this is what's being tested
right now so uh maybe the 6e could still
live on now you all remember the video
that confirmed been gate for last year's
iPhone 6 from unbox therapy well this
time around with an alleged iphone 6s
case in hand Lou measured it out and
confirms the new back plate is slightly
taller wider and thicker but actually
lighter in weight supporting apple using
their new 7000 series aluminum use in
the Apple watch now the areas around the
volume and power buttons really the weak
points on the six plus are now thicker
as well measuring out to 1.9 millimeters
compared to the previous one point one
four millimeters and after all this
there was no attempt to bend this case
so you know just milk it out to make
another video
in a few weeks all right an iPad news
developer Hamza suit has discovered in
the resource files of el capitan that a
split screen view exists in safari for
the ipad mini now currently only the
ipad air 2 supports his feature in the
developers release but the expected
faster processor and this new evidence
shows the ipad mini could be getting the
same feature set also Eveleigh has been
a reliable source in the past and
released what's believed to be the
dimensions for the new iPad Mini for
measuring in and only 6.1 millimeters
thick with a similar look and feel to
the ipad air 2 s design now the current
iPad Mini 3 is 7.5 millimeters thick and
you all know I'm thirsty for the iPad
pro so we'll just wait to find out all
the iPad details in September as for the
Apple TV we haven't heard much for a
while but in an interview with Jimmy
Iovine and wired I'll being talked about
the prospect of applying music curation
to the television he says discovering
content on the TV is technically good
but the curation of content for the TV
is still not that great now the apple TV
is still expected to bring a brand new
set-top box a new touch remote and Siri
capabilities as well as an app store and
more content with the recent signings of
local TV stations but a better curation
system could be part of the mix as well
now we also acknowledged in the
interview that Apple musics connect
needs a lot of work to make it a better
platform for artists and fans and like I
said from day one it's not very
compelling at all also a while ago you
might remember that CVS and Rite Aid
decided to make the move to block Apple
pay because they were part of a group
supporting another form of e-payment
called currency which now may or may not
be launching in 2016 so what did they
decide to do well rite aid will now turn
back on support for Apple pay also
google wallet and android pay at almost
four thousand six hundred locations
after they realized how stupid they were
while CBS will continue to hold out for
current see if it arrives by 2016
alright that's going to do for this
week's show you can always email me at
the apple byte at cnet com or tweet me
at brian Tong and we'll answer when we
can thanks so much for watching we'll
catch you all next time for another bite
of the Apple
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
