actually responds to the motion in my
hand just slide out the lock screen you
see how it slides in now I want you all
to look away for a moment while i type
in my ok you can look again don't tell
anyone about that hi so here we here we
are on the gorgeous new home screen
let's go into whether see on whether
it's a little cloudy today I can
actually tap here the degrees get more
information like humidity and rain let's
swipe through some locations clear and
Sydney kind of hot in Phoenix here in a
big thunder mountain it's looking a
little little rough we've got some some
Thunder brewing oh yeah some heavy snow
here in the North Pole and tropical
storm here in Gilligan's Island I hope
they got off that Island so
and it's more functional than ever if
you pinch you get this gorgeous overview
of all your cities even with the time so
it's a world clock as well let's take a
look at the calendar so clean it's swipe
from days today like this turn it into
landscape see your whole week at a
glance at a big week ahead zoom out
scroll easily through your months even
go all the way out to the year let's
take a look at messages you notice as we
scroll we have this great sort of
playful motion the bubbles let's bring
up the keyboard you slide contents of
the keyboard you see the layering and
transparency gives you that sense of
context there's this gesture now from
the left edge of the device it's great
for using the device of one hand if I
want to just go back I can just swipe
from the edge of the display pull back
like that move in out so clean and
natural let's take a look at folders
that go here into my games folder can
have multiple pages store hungry
take a look at Game Center
some of those good-looking friends let's
take a look at mail the type is just so
clean and your drill into a message look
how you get these full screen
edge-to-edge photos it's really great
and that gesture for moving in and out
works here too of course just move
between messages just like this so great
if you just slide across in any item can
get it the trash and more options as
well right here in mail finally let's
take a look at Notification Center same
as always we can just swipe down from
the top of their vice comes down with a
nice thud you can see all notifications
just my missed ones and we've this great
new today view so you can see your
friends birthdays current look at the
weather or upcoming uh in invitations
your calendar your stocks and even a
quick look at tomorrow you know it's
really great is for the first time ever
Notification Center is now available
from the lock screen as well you don't
even have to unlock your device so
that's a quick look at iOS 7 it's a
comprehensive end-to-end redesign of the
user experience installing iOS 7 on your
phone is like getting an entirely new
phone but when you already know how to
use one that's so much more beautiful
and functional than ever before but iOS
7 is actually more than that it's also a
major feature release as well I have 10
features I want to talk to you about
today starting with control center
control center is something that's so
simple and yet so essential you have
those switches that you just want to get
to really quickly from wherever you are
well now with control center swipe up
from the bottom of the device
and there they are
turn on airplane mode adjust your
brightness play a song even get a
flashlight next let's talk about
multitasking I'm pleased to announce
that we're gonna have multitasking for
all apps
so how does it work well imagine you
have an app that you're using constantly
throughout the day a social networking
app or something you're checking in all
the time well iOS 7 is notices that
pattern of use and is going to provide
that app with frequent background
activity to stay up to date let's see of
another app you use maybe that you just
check in on in the morning breakfast
maybe at night after work well iOS 7
notices that too and it's going to give
that app background cycles just in time
so it's up to date for when you need it
now in addition to this intelligent
scheduling iOS 7 does opportunistic
updates the average user wakes their
device dozens of times a day and those
provide great opportunities when the
systems already powered up to update
apps in the background it also adapts
intelligently to network conditions so
if it's in good coverage it's a great
time to fetch and it coalesces updates
across multiple applications so once you
have those radios powered up let's
multiple applications take advantage of
it for their background updates and
finally iOS 7 responds to push
notifications as a trigger to give that
application time in the background so
when you follow that notification the
Apple are to be ok
