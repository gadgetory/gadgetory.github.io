Conte and it's time to get loaded a new
rumor is that Sony is set to announce
Hulu on the PlayStation we thought this
would happen for the Xbox last week but
it did not the PlayStation deal could be
announced as early as next week and
include a paid subscription model for
extra content on hulu HP has purchased
melow do a music streaming service
melodia streams your own library to your
mobile device this could mean that HP is
getting pretty bullish about a new palm
device with multimedia and Nokia is
going to make a pretty major change to
its operating system on higher-end
smartphones the company will begin using
a linux based system called me go
instead of the Symbian system it has
long since favored this will start on
the n8 and then beyond all n series
phones from here on out and Fox Mobile
is launching a subscription-based TV
service called bitbop it looks a lot
like Hulu it has full-length TV shows
front box that you can watch over Wi-Fi
or 3G it's only on blackberry phones for
now and it costs nine ninety-nine a
month and porn sites may get their own
domain ending this means that porn sites
would end in dot xxx instead of com one
company has been petitioning for this
from the internet corporation for
assigned names and numbers or i can but
i can has not been amenable to this idea
until now the agency said that it has
not treated the request fairly and will
now move swiftly to carry out checks on
this proposition and finally it's a
little hot out but when the weather does
cool down you might want to consider
this hoodie with built-in earbuds the
hoodie buddie replaces a drawstring with
earbuds and the headphone jack is in the
pocket for your music player the sweater
comes in various colors but I'm not sure
about the quality of the earbuds or how
you would go about washi mess it costs
forty four dollars that's your news for
now you may have noticed that loaded is
back to a daily schedule instead of
twice a day that has to do with
production resources here at cnet TV in
new york this schedule is temporarily on
hold at least until i get back from
maternity leave we appreciate your
feedback regarding the change so
stay tuned for scheduling updates
sometime in the fall thank you for
watching have a great weekend I'm Natali
del Conte the cnet TV and you just been
loaded</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
