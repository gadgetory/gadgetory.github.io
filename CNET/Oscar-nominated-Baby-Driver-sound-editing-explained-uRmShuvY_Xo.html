America working feet frames the for baby
driver we worked in bars and beats so
everything had to be broken down to a
musical notation
every piece of music has to be tempo
maps which is something I've never done
before so that first car chase sequence
which is the John Spencer Blues
Explosion
because the tempo is not constant it's
going one two three four one two three
four one two three four one two three
four one two three four one two three
four
so you take that you map out the tempo
across the whole of the music cue
because it's used in its entirety in
that sequence and then you take say a
police siren and then you tell the
ProTools the tempo of the police siren
and then you map the tempo to the tempo
of the jump Spencer Blues Explosion
so what you get is a siren rather than
just goes floating around all over the
place
all those cars that you see in the movie
we got onto a racetrack in Atlanta where
they shot it and re-recorded from every
angle all those cars we had a microphone
on the exhaust yeah and another
microphone under the hood we had a
microphone inside the on the driver's
side so we had these multitrack
recordings of every single car and then
you get them back into the editing room
and you kind of think oh man that that's
great but it doesn't it still doesn't
sound right like for example what that
red Subaru WRX has what's called a dump
valve every time you rev it up those ugh
which if you're trying think about stuff
to music doesn't work so even though we
recorded the Subaru WRX very little of
that was used we then used a myriad of
about five different cars for that
Subaru WRX hopefully the audience don't
notice but each car is an amalgam of say
five or six different cars used in
different way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
