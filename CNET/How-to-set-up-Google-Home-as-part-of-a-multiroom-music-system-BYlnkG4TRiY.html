going to look at how to connect a Google
home to your network and then use it as
the heart of a multi-room music system
firstly you'll need the 129 dollar
Google home in addition to a Google cast
compatible audio device this is either
the $35 chromecast Audio or one of a
growing number of third-party speakers
and AV receivers firstly to set up this
speaker you will need the Google home
app for iOS or Android to add devices to
your Network press the little device's
icon in the top right corner of the app
from here you'll see the Google cast
devices that the app is found or the
ones that needs setup so we're going to
set up the Google home today it's pretty
straightforward you just follow the
prompts when it gets the wireless setup
it can actually use your password saved
in the phone if you want which is quite
convenient then you'll need to set up
the default music service you want in
this case I use Spotify and then you're
pretty much done next we'll create a
group this lets you make a set of
speakers which will play all at once and
it's the crux of multi-room audio you
can make as many groups as you want but
they all behave like a single speaker
now to play to your new group you can
use any Google cast compatible app we'll
use Spotify again press the list of
available devices and choose the group
from the list and then your music
players you can also direct Google home
to play music on a speaker or group with
just your voice okay Google Play so
that's how to set up Google home as part
of a Google cast music system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
