special vehicle we have named it the
Golf R touch from the outside it looks
like a conventional Golf R but inside it
offers a preview of forks Wang's future
interior technologies it's a car puts
operation information offerings and
ergonomic features and closely aligned
with our consumers and customers needs
the Golf R touch is also equipped with a
gesture control system gesture control
marks a further step in the pursuit of
our goal to create highly intuitive and
easy to operate infotainment systems we
took our lead from the consumer
electronics interfaces and use it in
smartphones and tablets and redefined it
for automotive applications we've been
very systematic in our approach here
that's why the Golf R touch doesn't have
just one display but rather free first
the cars equipped with an impressive
trance point eight-inch main screen in
the center console offering brilliance
resolution beneath the main screen there
is an 8 inch control center screen and
finally there is a twelve point three
inch active info display which replaces
the traditional instrument cluster the
content for the two large screens can be
customized in accordance with the users
wishes as it's a case for consumer
electronics images or illustrations can
be integrated as a screen background
various windows can be arranged as tiles
containing different content another
step we took was a replace of all the
mechanical buttons and rotary switches
normally found in the car
all of this follows our philosophy make
it easy the use of proximity sensor ring
and every touch panel is an example of
this another new feature is a
multi-touch slider this new type of
control element links functions such as
for you control balance fader and
lightning in the simplest possible
manner the setup here is extremely easy
because the slider can recognize the
number of fingers being used for
adjustment anything from volume to a
mint lightning they mint light in the
Gulf our touch is also quite
sophisticated the example for example
the lightening atmosphere selected by
the user is transferred throughout the
entire interior creating the ultimate
customized environment to ensure drivers
are not distracted Volkswagen has
incorporated haptic feedback within the
control center screen as adjustments are
made the system provides censoring
feedback so the driver doesn't have to
look away from the road to confirm that
this lecture was received this brings me
to another important technology that we
will be using in the future to gesture
control all of the functions I talked
about before can also be carried out in
this special golf using gesture control
at the heart of the system is a sweet d
camera mounted in the roof console the
camera defects and recognizes hand
gestures and converts them into commands
this is a highly complex technical setup
but one that's very easy to use the
system significantly increases user
convenience with a swipe of your hand
all functions can be controlled this is
just the beginning
stay tuned for more to come from folks 1
