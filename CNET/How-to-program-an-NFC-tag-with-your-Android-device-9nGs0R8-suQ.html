market today that are capable of reading
NFC tags did you know those same devices
are actually capable of writing in NFC
tag as well
I'm Jason Cipriani a scene a how-to
contributor and today I'm going to show
you how to program an NFC tag with your
Android device all right so the first
thing you're going to need is an Android
device that's capable of reading NFC
tags such as the Galaxy Nexus you're
also going to need some NFC tags you can
get these on Amazon I'll put a couple
links in the post where you can get them
they're about 15 dollars for ten of them
make sure you get the pre formatted tags
there are some issues with Android 4.0
and formatting of text so make sure you
get the pre formatted ones and then
you'll also need an app called NFC task
launcher it's in the Android Market for
a dollar ninety-nine I'll include a link
to that as well I have a blank NFC tag
here it's just a regular sticker but as
you can see there's a it's an NFC tag
and you can actually scan it and this
one here should pull up how to see
Netcom we're going to go ahead and
override that and change it so let's
launch the NFC task launcher and let's
go to create task add new action
Wireless and connections there's a whole
bunch of stuff you can do we're just
going to demonstrate one right now and
let's do disable or toggle Wi-Fi on the
device so now I have toggle Wi-Fi as a
pending task all I have to do is tap
write tag it'll let you know that go
ahead and tap the tag to if you want to
write to it and there's also a box there
you can check if you want to permanently
lock that tag and never be able to write
over it again once you do that that tag
is set in what it's doing there's no
changing it going forward we'll go ahead
and tap the tag to the phone again heard
a couple beeps there the tag is now
wrote to so it's the same tag we used
earlier that was programmed to pull up
the browser when I scan it now as you
can see it turned off Wi-Fi that's it
we're going to come
a lot more and a lot fancier tricks you
can do with NFC text in the future make
sure to visit us at how to see Netcom to
stay up to date on what we're doing with
NFC text thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
