most of them look the same and all of
them invariably sound the same with
boosted bass and highs i untie
pendlebury and the me electronics atlas
take the me and atlas names to heart and
try to make a distinctive looking
headphone which is also good for use on
the road the headphones come in a number
of different designs which all feature
printed artwork I'm not all that big a
fan of the looks but at least the
angular lines don't have the width beat
clone that other street style headphones
do these headphones fold for easier
storage in your bag and the flat cable
is also detachable and pretty tangle
free to the remote control attached to
it comes with a microphone and a
universal volume control that will work
with any source it's not iOS specific
sound quality is good if you tend
towards rock or dance music with a very
bottom end heavy presentation there was
also a slight notch in the upper
register that gives vocals a little more
presence but compared against hi-fi
headphones at the same price they seem a
little closed-in as these are closed
headphones though the noise isolation
isn't as good as other models of the
price though the trade-off is that in
some of them may not make your ears
sweat as much likewise they might also
be good for exercise if you don't like
in air miles this has been type and a
brief to see her</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
