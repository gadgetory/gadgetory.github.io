checking out Google's Chromebook pixel
now I know what you're thinking it looks
really familiar and you're right it's
basically got the same body on the same
screen that's last year's model but
thanks to a price cut and new support
for USB see this could be a good fit for
the ride user the new Chromebook pixel
packs the same 13 inch 2560 x 1700 pixel
resolution display as last year's model
google claims it offers improved color
gamut which should improve color
accuracy the screen is really bright and
identity of 239 pixels per inch means
that texas crisp and a pleasure to read
there are two of the relatively new USB
sea ports one on either side the laptop
charges through these ports which is
actually pretty great as it gives you
two options for a place to put your
power cord or a room for a cord and some
other accessory the Vixen can also
charge pretty quickly you get about two
hours of battery life in just 15 minutes
of charging and full capacity which is
about 12 hours of juice in an hour and a
half the obvious downside is that pork
selection is really limited you're
getting the pair of USBC port a pair of
USB 3 ports and an SD card reader if you
want to say connected to another screen
and the pixel can output to up to 4k
displays you're going to have to show up
for adapters the rest of the changes are
under the hood and they're welcome the
base model packs a 2.2 gigahertz 5th
generation Intel Core i5 processor eight
gigs of RAM and 32 gigs of storage for
999 1299 gets you a core i7 processor
with 16 gigs of ram and 64 gigs of
storage that's quite a step up from last
year's base model for the same price
there is no LTE support this time around
however the low storage capacities are a
pain but an SD card will slide in and be
flushed with the side of the chassis so
it could be a good option for extra
storage now the Chromebook pixel run
into the same problem as its predecessor
and that's Chrome OS a thousand dollars
is still quite a bit of cash to shell
out for a machine that's going to lose
quite a bit of its functionality once
you're off live by at that price you're
better off going to say a cheaper
Chromebook or a proper windows or mac
laptop that's head the hardware is
gorgeous and it's pretty powerful so I'm
looking forward to the day when chrome
OS finally catches
be sure to read my full review on cnet
I'm Nate thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
