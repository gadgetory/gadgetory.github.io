just happening this week on cnet scrape
blog the nope and then researchers at
Columbia University are learning how to
harness the power of evaporation to
power complex machine the discovery of a
tiny spore found in soil bacteria that
reacts to water by expanding and
contracting itself has led to a
breakthrough an engineering that could
lead to a renaissance in water powered
machines by carefully placing the spores
on two strips of plastic tape they were
able to control the spores movement by
manipulating the moisture around the
sport add water the spore expands reduce
moisture and the spore contracts some of
their inventions include an evaporation
engine powered by water of course which
can open and closed shutters another
device the researchers created was the
moisture mill using small strips of
spores and creating a space on the mill
that is high in moisture and then
leaving the other side exposed to dry
air they were able to build a simple
evaporation powered car that could
maintain its forward momentum as the
spores pass through the moisture and
then quickly recoil as they enter the
dry air Wow it's magical read more about
the evaporation machines and watch the
entire video in the krave blog post now
you can watch all six Star Wars movies
at the same time Super Star Wars fan and
filmmaker Marcus Rosen Trotter
composited and mixed every episode of
the star wars franchise to make star
wars wars check out Marcus's imager
photo gallery of the best HD stills from
the video and may the force be with you
and you in
the Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency otherwise known as DARPA is
working with the Wyss Institute
genetically engineer ii coli bacteria
that will live inside our stomachs and
help to fight off stomach bugs and alert
us of poor health by changing the color
of our poop the genetically engineered
ecoli would be swallowed in pill form it
would proliferate in your stomach if
anything foreign could potentially make
your stomach sick the e.coli will attack
it and get rid of the intruding bacteria
will also in some cases change the color
of your stomach waist alerting the
patient and doctor that there is a
problem the genetically engineered
bacteria could be useful for people
traveling to other countries including
our military who are susceptible to
getting sick while serving overseas
computer AI has mastered super mario
better than any human being on this
planet super mario fan and AI Brainiac
sethbling has created mar io which uses
a process called neural evolution to
teach itself out of play super mario
when it first began it didn't even know
the button jump but through trial and
error and using neural evolution the
computer quickly learned how to fly
through the level safely and without
being touched by any Goomba
mario's brain uses a neural network much
like a human's biological brain as you
can see in the top left-hand portion of
the screen there's a box that is
basically Mario's perception of where he
is in the level bling calls this the
input which is basically our eyes as
mario approaches an obstacle his brain
is mapping the correct response to get
past the obstacle encountered in the
form of controller buttons or his bling
calls them the output this allows Mario
to figure out the best response for any
obstacles getting him through the level
quickly and safely read more about the
mar io AI in the crave blog post alright
guys that's a show thank you very much
for watching as always you could find
all these news stories the students
crave blog at crave calm make sure you
follow crave on Twitter at crave and
check out this week's crammed giveaway
this week scrape give away our three
custom photo products from collage calm

Varla welcome home Waller this is
Rameses smell my bastard a pleasure
mother I have a treat for you in war
when the heat of a rolling where can't
return
the North bananas surinder the surrender
and I accept your surrender you can head
back my wrath must be lonely hello
thank you
but we're all family
