tracker $150 $100 $50
I'm Scott Stein and the new misfit flash
is a $50 activity tracker that's coming
up this holiday it's available now and
the price is the thing here because
misfit originally had a tracker called
the shine that came out last year that
cost over $100 and it was cool it was a
little aluminum disc that acted like a
mini clock could pop in a wristband or a
clip or even act as a necklace and could
track your steps was waterproof had a
long battery life and could track sleep
automatically at least how restful you
were that type of basic sleep tracking
now the flash does all of those things
too but it's made of plastic and at 50
dollars it's a lot more attractive than
it was before but the ability to track
steps is now in a lot of things you can
track steps on a lot of phones you could
track steps with smartwatches if you
have a SmartWatch so maybe that part
seems a little less exciting but the
flash being waterproof and having a long
battery life with a replaceable coin
battery inside well that's pretty cool
because you could swim with this and
Misfits software does have some swim
tracking software capabilities built
into it in fact it can be used to do a
variety of different activities but
really it's an accelerometer based
pedometer that's the main thing you want
to use it for when you go to sleep it
automatically detects when you're lying
down and will check to see overnight how
restful you were and activate once
you've gotten up and walked
now the flashes design has a cool red
LED readout that not only shows your
daily progress but also blinks its
little lights in the in that twelve dot
circle to show hours and minutes so it
acts like a kind of too-cool-for-school
digital watch and the improvement here
is that it doesn't pop out of this band
as easily as it did before it actually
pops in from the bottom so you don't
have to worry about losing it and it
does come with a clip too in addition to
this band the mist of flash will work
with Android iOS and Windows Phone and
it will sync via bluetooth once you open
up the app and check it out the app is
very nice and cleanly designed and even
connects now with additional fitness
tracking software
like RunKeeper 50 bucks for basic
activity tracking sounds pretty good to
me
maybe however you might be interested in
waiting for a SmartWatch or something
else that has heart rate tracking the
thing that the misfit flash lacks
I'm Scott Stein and that's a look at the
new misfit flash available now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
