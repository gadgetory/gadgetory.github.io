help you make sense of home automation
there's a whole bunch of stuff you can
automate lights locks switches cameras
there's even a connected piggy bank and
you can automate these days but in
general home automation products are
going to do one of three things they're
either going to sense information around
your home to provide context for the
decisions that your smart home setup is
going to make they're going to do things
you know lock is going to turn the
coffeemaker is going to turn on or
they're going to serve as a brain and
kind of organize all that info that's
what these hubs over here do the wink of
the smartthings hub Insteon staples
connect all these can wrangle multiple
devices and give you a single experience
in a single app that will control
everything that's pretty handy now if
you're looking to make your first smart
home automation purchase you'll find a
lot of starter kits out there that are
pretty tempting they'll offer packages
with motion sensors and plugs that can
turn things on and off maybe a leak
sensor those kids can make for a good
starting point but if you want to go
even simpler you can start with just one
or two devices and do a couple of things
that you're specifically interested in a
good and perhaps fairly obvious starting
point for home automation is a smart
switch because so much of home
automation really comes down to things
just turning on and off automatically
I've got a couple of examples sitting
right here one that I like is the Belkin
Wemo switch because it has great
compatibility with third-party devices
you can build off of this thing and also
it's got a low price point below fifty
dollars important thing to remember is
that there's no need to go all-in with
home automation you don't need to feel
pressured to be George Jetson right out
of the gate you don't have to have an
entire home full of devices and work
together and do amazing things and
create a futuristic smart home
experience you can just start simple
have one or two devices build from there
if you want and have a really cool sort
of extra level of functionality around
the home that makes your life easier
saves you time and maybe even save you
some money for more information on how
to get started check out the rest of my
buying guide and check out the other
buying guides are gonna be doing in the
coming weeks to focus on specific
categories like lighting and cameras and
security all sorts of good stuff for
CNET appliances I'm right Chris
