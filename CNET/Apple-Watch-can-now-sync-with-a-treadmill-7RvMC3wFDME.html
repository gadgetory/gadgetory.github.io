question is can Apple watch and gym kit
make it happen
gym kit is new technology that's going
to be available on certain pieces of gym
equipment in certain gyms starting in
2018 and at the end of this year in one
gym in North America in New York City
what it uses is a combination of NFC and
Bluetooth to allow you to tap in with
your Apple watch on the machine and then
sync it to the gym equipment which
allows you to take information from your
watch and show it on the gym equipment
screen but also allows you to take
information on your machine and put it
back in Apple health and on your iPhone
so things like elevation data or other
information like stairs climbed can come
into Apple health but your heart rate
and estimated calories based on
information and Apple health going to
the gym equipment and then get erased
later you tap to start and just begin
working out but if you forget to do that
it also allows you to tap in midway
through and sync all the data
retroactively Lee what's really cool
about gym kit is that it's very simple
to tap and connect and that could
signify where wearables and phones could
go next the ability to instantly link up
instead of having to connect via
bluetooth kind of like what carplay does
but if you could connect that to maybe
home equipment sporting equipment maybe
even things like appliances be pretty
interesting in North America lifetime
athletic and Equinox are gonna be the
first fitness centers to use gym kit and
in Australia it's gonna be Fitness first
gym kit doesn't do everything and I'd
still like Apple watch to coach me more
but it does work very well based on the
few times I've tried it if only I could
find a gym that supports it hopefully
it's a sign of where things go with
fitness next and we're connected
products and wearables will go in 2018</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
