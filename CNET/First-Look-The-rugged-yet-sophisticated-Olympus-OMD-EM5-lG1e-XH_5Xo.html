another beloved film brand and updates
it for the digital age the reincarnation
of the OM film line targets those
enthusiasts who have proven to be either
Olympus loyalists or simply fans of the
micro four thirds interchangeable lens
standard the camera has some really
outstanding qualities including a great
feature set in class leading performance
but I was less impressed with the photo
quality than I would have liked to have
been it has a modest size body built
along the same lines as the e5 DSLR it's
a bit tank like with the magnesium alloy
body that's Dustin weather sealed and
it's weather resistant from negative 4
degrees to 140 degrees the om-d takes
advantage of its ancestors
pyramid-shaped housing here instead of
an optical viewfinder though it uses an
electronic viewfinder plus it puts a hot
shoe and a connector for the bundled
compact flash unit overall I really
enjoy shooting with the camera it's
comfortable to grip and all the lenses
are small enough to stash in a roomy
jacket pocket if necessary the retro
look deservedly attracted quite a bit of
attention and several accidental drops
attested to the camera sturdy build the
EVF and tilting o LED touchscreen
display are bright and usable screen
becomes nearly invisible in direct
sunlight and I always find OLEDs a
little too cool and contrasting for my
taste some of the buttons feel mushy and
some of them are a little too small for
quick and easy access plus there's no
way to lock the front dial which adjusts
exposure compensation without changing
its function entirely one of the unique
features is that you can adjust the
highlight and shadow areas of the
exposure compensation curve while
looking in the viewfinder a little more
useful is the ability to finally adjust
a lot of the parameters you can
customize the display in a gazillion
different ways so that for the most part
you only see the options you want and
while the camera doesn't have a full
touchscreen interface it is a touch
screen so you can perform most of the
operations you really want to do touch
focus with magnification touch shutter
and the ability to swipe to navigate
during playback
though the lens isn't small it does have
a load of nice features including a
macro setting and a quiet electronic
zoom for video plus it's weather sealed
and feels well built it's not the
sharpest or fastest lens and it could
probably use a better class of coatings
but that would also make it far more
expensive I mixed feelings about the
photo and video quality from the camera
on one hand it delivers very well
rendered color and accurate consistent
exposures at iso 200 the JPEGs look
excellent so the camera frequently over
sharpens it retains highlight detail
extremely well too and bright saturated
reds and Magenta's look just as they
should but one stop up to iso 400 and
the noise suppression kicks them for the
JPEGs and it begins to blur out
significant amounts of detail in places
unfortunately that's normal for many of
these cameras but there also seems to be
a lack of dynamic range in the shadows
which makes it difficult to get really
good results from raw files at ISO 1600
or higher there's little detail to
recover and you get a lot of noise and
while I generally like the video quality
from the camera that's what I'll call
consumer good it's fine for shooting
vacations kids and pets but it's
probably not up to the standard of real
video shooters the cameras quite fast in
fact pretty much the fastest in its
class overall the one aspect of
performance I find irritating is the lag
enos coming out of sleep mode I
frequently had to check to ensure the
power was on as I waited for the camera
to wake up the burst shooting is also
surprisingly robust and the EVF
refreshes well enough for most
continuous shooting well you don't get
best in class photo quality with the omd
em5 that's a small trade off for the
rest of the package I'm Lori groanin and
this is the olympus om-d p.m.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
