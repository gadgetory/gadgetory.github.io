tablet isn't for everyone but if you
need the best most flexible
pressure-sensitive tools for content
creation it's probably the best for you
the mobile Studios got multiple
personalities it's a Windows 10 tablet
it's a hybrid laptop when any Bluetooth
keyboard is connected and it's an
additional touchscreen display and
graphics tablet when plugged into a
system via the optional Wacom link it
comes in 13 and 16 inch versions this is
the bigger one with all the frills au HD
display realsense 3d camera and
workstation class graphics among other
things if you're familiar with the
company's intuos pro graphics tablets
you'll recognize the set of controls
downside it's Express keys they can
easily be programmed individually for
each application what I really like as
with the company's new generation of pen
tablets the mobile studio supports 8,192
levels of pressure sensitivity that's
more than any other option out there the
biggest immediate benefit is an insanely
smooth feel with no perceptible cursor
offset or lat most of the time keep in
mind that you won't get the benefit of
the extra levels of pressure until
software applications get updated the
display has some light leakage in the
corners but it's quite glare resistant
it's also got an SD card slot in three
USB C ports plus other typical tablet
amenities and rubber feet
but I don't like it doesn't come with a
stand and ideally it should have a
built-in kickstand as well as a place to
hold the stylus the battery life is not
great and while it's not always the
tablet's fault and it's potentially
fixable in software the performance
varies for instance compute-intensive
brushes and painter display significant
