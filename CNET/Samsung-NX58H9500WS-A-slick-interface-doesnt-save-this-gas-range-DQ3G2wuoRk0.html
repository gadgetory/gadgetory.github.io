about the Samsung in x58 H 9500 ws but
on closer looks this oven leaves me a
little bit cold let's start with some of
the things I liked about the oven now
first this oven looks great it's a 30
inch wide gas model that's a slotted
oven which means it's going to sit flush
against your countertops and show off
that nice backsplash you have at home
the oven also has a really cool control
panel that is in sleep mode until you
touch a little button in the corner to
let it know hey I want to use you the
Samsungs cooktop is also pretty
impressive the double ring burner boiled
water super fast about 11 minutes or so
which is pretty good in our boil water
test but when it came to the oven I was
pretty disappointed the convection mode
that I use for baking two racks of
biscuits produce some really uneven
biscuits that were more Brown on the top
rack than on the bottom rack also the
chicken I roasted in the oven was a
little too pale for my taste and the
Royal Tom's not too good the seven also
comes with some nice accessories that
include a griddle a wok ring a
temperature probe and a splint rack that
goes in the oven for when you really
have to maneuver and bake a lot of
things at once
unfortunately good looks nice
accessories and decent boil Tom's does
not a great oven make this evan is
$24.99 which is a little expensive for
the middling performance that we saw to
