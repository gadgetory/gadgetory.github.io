packed with new AR experiences health
records battery controls and oh yeah new
an emoji iOS 11.3 is coming sometime in
the next few months and one of the
cooler new features will be how apps can
use augmented reality in new ways this
goes beyond what you know from Pokemon
go apps will be able to stick virtual
items on walls and doors not just a
horizontal table it'll also be able to
identify things like posters now this is
coming to most iPhones and iPads unlike
an emoji which yeah yeah I know they're
cool but it only applies to the iPhone
10 and here's something not limited to
iPhone 10 battery controls users can get
details on the phone's battery health
and if you don't want your iPhone
slowing down because of a wonky battery
well now you'll have the control to turn
that feature off you can also keep
better tabs on your own health with a
health records feature it lets patients
see medical data from multiple health
care institutions in one of you and it's
encrypted and protected with a passcode
also not exactly cool but important to
mention is business chat a few
businesses will it chat with customer
service and pay for things inside
messages it's in a test phase now with
companies like Hilton Lowe's and Wells
Fargo but of course some people will
only care about the four new an emoji
now you can be a dragon a bear a skull
or a lion with iPhone 10 spatial
scanning technology rock on let us know
what feature you care about most in the
comments I'm Bridget Carey and you can
