finally ready to replace a laptop I'm
Dan Akron and this is the Microsoft
Surface pro 3 now what makes this
surface pro 3 different than the surface
pro 2 in the original surface well it's
got a larger screen this is a 12-inch
screen as opposed to a 10-point 6 inch
screen it's actually thinner at the same
time it's 9.1 millimeters thick which
you know what is actually pretty darned
thin it's not a famous design but they
say the fan is so is so quiet you're not
gonna hear you're not gonna feel the air
so it's plenty close to being fanless of
course everyone remembers the kickstand
from the original surface that it still
got that although this kickstand goes
out to pretty much any angle you want
between 22 degrees and about 150 degrees
you could stop anywhere and it resolves
just about here which is a good angle
for leaning over your desk and drawing
and the reason why you'd be concerned
about drawing is because it's got a
stylus accessory you can get and you can
use apps like OneNote and other apps to
do some drawing on it and I tried out
the stylus very quickly works fairly
well it has palm rejection so you can
lean your hand on it and not cause any
trouble and you saw I'm hitting the
windows button over here they move that
windows button from down here where it
is on a lot of Windows tablets too over
here this way so they want you to think
of the surface pro 3 really more
portrait mode almost like an iPad and
there were certainly a lot of
comparisons made here's a launch event
for the surface pro 3 to the iPad and
how this does everything an iPad does
but all the productivity stuff you want
your regular laptop computer to do and
the reason you can do a lot of
productivity things is because the
surface pro line of course has these
really cool keyboard type covers we've
always liked these the new version keeps
the excellent keyboard and they've made
the touch pan a little bit bigger so
that it works better with things like
multi-touch gestures and even though
it's got a touchscreen you know a lot of
websites a lot of apps are still not
optimized for touch so having a touch
pad is very important it still snaps on
magnetically like this but the big
difference here is this sort of a little
sub hinge right here and if you fold it
up like this there's a secondary magnet
that attaches so you've got a little bit
of a keyboard angle right there and that
actually makes a lot easier to type on
let you put it on your lap a little bit
better and gives you just you know a
little bit of a lift up
and that makes it feel a little bit more
like a traditional laptop the surface
person he followed the big trend these
days was better than HD displays the 12
inch screen is 2160 by 1440 resolution
now the surface pro 3 starts at 799
they've got a core i3 a Core i5 and a
core i7 version so obviously if you want
the more powerful processors that's
going to cost more and usually the
keyboard touch pads and I am assuming
the stylus are going to be sold
separately I'm Dan Ackerman and that is
the Microsoft Surface pro 3</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
