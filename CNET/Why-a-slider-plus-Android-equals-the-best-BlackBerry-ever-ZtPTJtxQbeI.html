tech company has not had the easiest
time of it in recent years we almost
lost it might completely disappear from
the consumer market but blackberry is
back with a new device it's very
different but is it also very special
with me is my CNET colleague Andrew
Hoyle hi Luke now Andy you've been using
the BlackBerry prove a week and we're
going to talk about your findings so
first of all what is the thing that
strikes you most about the phone well
the headline of this phone really is
that it's the first BlackBerry phone to
run Android Google's operating system
rather than BlackBerry's own bb10 and of
course the big thing is app selection
suddenly you've got hundreds of
thousands of apps to choose from all
your favorite games all your social
networks everything you want on this
phone blackberry 10 didn't have that
this is big news for blackberry and is
it so does it actually make a difference
that it's running Android what's it like
to use it's it's really easy to use it's
very much the same as any other Android
phone you would have used before so
you've got multiple home screens you go
into an app selection folder so you like
the fact that it's running Android I
think it's great so this phone doesn't
look like what you expect a black bear
phone to look like it's got a very very
different very bold design you might say
tell me you've been using it for a week
does the design work or is it a failure
I love a design I think it's great
you've got a big screen 5.5 inches
you've got carbon-fiber weave on the
back my favorite thing though and you're
like this luke is that the screen slides
up to reveal this keyboard beneath the
phone moves it transforms and it's
snappy it reminds me of the old Motorola
RAZR v3 from the early noughties the
clamshell that you can snap shut we've
got that physicality back in a phone
this movement I have missed that and I'm
so glad to see something like that back
would you use this phone a black be
proved ahead of any other phone that's
currently out there that is a difficult
one to say I use an iPhone most of the
time and I'm pretty entrenched in
Apple's ecosystem have been a lot of
money on apps the word I personally
switch to this phone know if I was
switching from another Android phone
definitely and I think a lot of Android
users are going to be very
keen to try out this phone and certainly
people who love BlackBerry's physical
keyboards they're going to love to use
this as well so it sounds like if you
are an Android fan then this might be
worth checking out one last thing though
Andy the name it's terrible
blackberry print it food it's a
ridiculous name though they could have
picked anything else and it would have
been better okay well we have much more
on the blackberry proof at cnet.com so
be sure to check it out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
