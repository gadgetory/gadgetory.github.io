life seeing your child get behind the
wheel of a car but in some ways
technology has your back and your kids
Trouville o is a small device that turns
your car into a connected car by
plugging into the Diagnostics port a
feature that became standard in all US
cars in 1996 every time you start a car
the car goes to a self-diagnostic chat
we get access to that data and we can
tell you something is wrong way before
the check engine light comes up that
data is sent via bluetooth to an app on
your smartphone we have sensors built
within our system that tell you how
you're driving your car so if you do
hard acceleration brakes swerving what
speed you're driving yet things like
that true Volo also provides alerts
based on specific locations so you can
find out when your child arrives or
leaves home school or a friend's place
and yes the app can tell if the device
is unplugged but maybe your kids would
welcome the driving data the most common
feedback was that they're as nervous
about driving as parents are nervous
about the kids driving my son said once
I finished my drive I want a quick
thumbs-up or a thumbs-down did I do well
they not do well
another serious concern for parents
distracted driving
the Android app agent is designed to
make your smartphone smarter what we do
is intelligently make changes on the
phone in the background and
automatically what things that you would
probably do yourself manually for
example when your battery is running low
the screen brightness lowers
automatically it's driving agent is
especially well-suited for texting teens
the automatically detects when you're
driving based off your speed or a
Bluetooth connection and then if you get
text messages it will read out the
messages to you and you have the option
to send an auto response or by voice
dictator response some added safety for
kids and peace of mind for parents in
