spacecraft is running out of fuel and so
to protect moons of Saturn that could
have conditions suitable for life the
spectacular end has been planned for
this long-lived traveler from Earth
guys the seven
your journey ends
as Cassini becomes part of the planet
my name is Linda Stoker I am the Cassini
project scientist I have worked on
Cassini for almost 30 years
and that's the time it takes Saturn to
go around the Sun a single time as
Cassini project scientist my role is to
work with the team about 300 scientists
from around the world to plan the best
possible science for Cassini to plan
those science observations to look at
Saturn or the Rings or the icy moons the
magnetosphere Titan those kinds of
objects and to try and balance between
the different science disciplines and
find the best science possible
right now the Cassini spacecraft is in a
set of orbits called the grand finale
what we did is use a Titan flyby to
propel us all the way across Saturn's
rings
right now we're diving in between the
gap between the Rings and the planet
flying in a place that no spacecraft has
flown before getting back measurements
in particular about the planet itself
revealing Saturn from the inside out
incredibly detailed pictures of Saturn's
rings and then sampling that region
between the Rings and the planet before
Cassini's final plunge and on the final
plunge what we'll be doing is getting a
nudge from Titan we call it Titans
goodbye kiss it's a distant flyby about
120 thousand kilometers and that pushes
us such that we can actually go into
Saturn's atmosphere our thrusters will
be fighting against the atmosphere as we
go in we'll be sending back data until
the very last second from our iron and
neutral mass spectrometer sampling
measuring the composition of Saturn's
atmosphere directly and once those tiny
thrusters can no longer hold against the
atmosphere Cassini will begin to tumble
and very shortly thereafter traveling it
like 75 thousand miles an hour will burn
up in the atmosphere of Saturn be
vaporized basically in Saturn's
atmosphere
probably some of the legacy science of
Cassini involves two of its nose and
Sela despite all much to our surprise
this tiny moon Enceladus only 300 miles
across bright white and I see you
expecting to be frozen solid instead we
found fractures of the South Pole none
of these four fractures that we
nicknamed tiger stripes there were jets
of material going out into space water
vapor and ice particles and these
contain the whole host of constituents
and Cassini could fly through that jet
and taste what's coming out from those
they told us a lot about the subsurface
ocean that's underneath Enceladus this
icy crust we found out it was salty I've
had a pH very similar to the earth and
also we found evidence of excess
hydrogen and these tiny nano silica
grains that could only grow in very hot
water leaving us to conclude that
there's hydrothermal vents on the
seafloor on the rocky core of Enceladus
and we know on earth that around these
hydrothermal vents you can get different
kinds of life deep in the ocean in the
earth where no sunlight penetrates so we
wonder could there be life on this tiny
ocean world and solidus then there's
giant Titan 10 times larger than
Enceladus thick atmosphere thick
nitrogen atmosphere very similar to the
earth we actually landed a European belt
Huygens probe parachuted down through
the thick atmosphere and landed on the
surface of Titan sent back pictures as
it was landing information about the
atmosphere and about the surface as well
and what a supplies was in store because
before all we could see was this hazy
ball of Titan and to penetrate through
that haze now we could see lakes and
seas of liquid methane river channels
methane plays the role on titan that
water plays on the earth we could have
methane rain nothing's going through the
river channels filling the lakes and
seas but methane breaks apart in the
upper atmosphere of Titan forms these
grains that fall
to the surface and possibly form the
giant sand dunes that are around the
equatorial region of Titan itself so
what an amazing place to explore so I
think one of my very favorite images is
this montage of pictures well that's the
backlit Saturn basically Saturn is
covering up the Sun and the sunlight is
shining through all around the disk of
Saturn and all of the Rings the e-ring
the G ring the main rings themselves are
all glowing in this particular image
what's really special about it is that
in this image as well is the earth the
earth is there and if you look carefully
you can see the earth in the moon Mars
and Venus are also part of this giant
montage and it sort of captures our
place in the solar system - you'll be
looking back at the earth and Saturn a
billion miles away I'll see essentially
this pale blue dot as Carl Sagan was
saying where everyone you ever knew and
everyone who has ever lived and what
ever died is on this pale blue dot that
picture is really like on it
oh I think that'll be a very sad day you
know I've worked on the mission for
almost three decades and to say goodbye
to this wonderful little spacecraft
that's returned so much information
about the Saturn system basically really
written the textbooks about Saturn I
think more importantly for me is going
to be saying goodbye to my Cassini
family I've worked with so many of these
people we've gotten to know each other
our kids have grown up together
please take advance together and so kind
of as we all go our separate ways that
will be a sad goodbye as well but in a
certain sense Cassini is growth and
ending and a beginning maybe kind of
like a high school graduation
everyone's have been together focused on
the same goal we've gotten there and now
may profound like seeds we're all going
to go out work on other missions take
our knowledge whether it's in science or
engineering and use it to for missions
like to rope a clipper or Juno or Mars
2020 for missions that haven't even been
started yet to go forward and take those
experiences and that knowledge on to the
next generation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
