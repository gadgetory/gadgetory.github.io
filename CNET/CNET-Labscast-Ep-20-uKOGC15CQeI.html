executed intro thanks to our friends in
San Francisco we're actually running the
live stream for this thing which is
really the way we should do it because
we're just not bright enough to do to
ourselves I don't know Josh Cohen thanks
for joining us today stepping in the
last minute you have some exciting
hardware for us scott also has some
exciting hardware Julie's been testing
some exciting hardware and I have some
slightly less than exciting hardware and
I'm gonna start off with that by by
pointing out that I have right here in
my hot little hands what might be the
world's last netbook remember the
netbook computers got and Josh and
actually julie teeger all too well talk
back it's a time traveler from 2007 or
2010 where everybody thought oh I can
just get a 300 our computer and and and
that was it so I'm going to tell you
about this guy which is brand-new
despite the fact that looks like it
could have come out at any point last
several years it does as God has got the
razor blade super high-end gaming laptop
that we talked about last week and he's
gonna try a little live game demo on it
to see how it actually works as a gaming
laptop that's not gonna be with the
customizable buttons because almost no
games have those customizable button
Ryan playing like the old republic which
is will date that you played Skyrim you
can set up customized albino it should
come with that and there's something
have said that asset sets but just just
to show you how the gaming runs on it
that that's all just don't know I think
the fact that popular games don't have
button sets on it is important yeah you
could you could cost I'm just saying for
those people are going to say I could
turn those buttons on this I could paint
flames on the side of my car too doesn't
mean you know my car comes the flames on
it yeah I gotta do it myself that's true
I'm i think is some sort of like a team
kit sort of customizable uh sure
whatever uh josh has got the josh's got
the very uh buzz-worthy how would you
call it Lytro camera we see that for a
second oh sure here it is it's going to
say photography's god that's right here
ya know
I you know photography's say photography
from the photographers but yeah there it
is I've heard about that camera that um
I yeah I just we were so much about it
and moulds I will hear more about it
from and of course julie has been
testing this netbook that razor blade
and some other fun stuff in the lab and
we'll hear what she has to say with all
that stuff uh I'm gonna start off with
the netbook which Julie just finished
running the second battery test on and
compared to all the netbooks you have to
pant you had to test over the last like
three or four years how was this
experience different Julie it's just as
aggravating as it was the first go
around and actually that sucked well
we're cameras gone um yeah I don't know
what happened there do we accidentally
unplugged your camera I don't know
anyhow yeah that's not the worst way
that really just literally just happened
right I will go to the overhead chef
frustrating that all cameras have gone
dark Josh's cameras gone too yeah all of
our game we're being sniped one by one I
know wow this is this is interest oh
there we go okay great yes folks it must
have been a brownout nothing the power
okay tell me about the netbook oh
nothing I just start sucked worse than
any other nut book that I've gotten in
like the past ever two years two and a
half years um it wasn't it wasn't fun
let's just say that is it was exhausting
than the other atom processor know
anything it was just as frustrating if
not more so in the battery life any
better battery life is consistent with
on that books you know it'll run you
know like this one ran for 10 minutes 10
10 hours and some change um these things
cost less money well they still cost 300
bucks which is about as you can possibly
put a screen and a keyboard together for
it's still the same price range that has
always been so frozen in dollars yeah
well they'll be on the backwards too
because it came with one gig of ram I
gotta say now that you have so many
tablets out there that are a little more
functional and the iPad you dropped in
price 399 versus 299 would you would you
trade up to an ipad 4 I mean look at
line here it's exactly the same as these
things have been for years it is frozen
entire entirely correct you can write on
that with
keyboard but you are yeah the processor
nothing's changed and the price we're
doing more power-efficient maybe there's
a slight improvement performance but
these are still Intel Atom processors
and not doing anything that special and
that's reason why the last Intel Atom
laptop that we reviewed before this was
in june two thousand eleven and that was
actually a Chromebook I you might have
written that review Josh you may you
reviewed us and so no one has sent us in
Intel Atom windows laptop since months
before that probably about a year ago
yeah so it's all surprising that this is
is it does that mean Intel's just like
that no because this is a brand new
version of the atom I think it's all the
money 600 IV trail something trail cedar
trail I don't know it sucks well I got a
sister up there used to be a place for
these because they went out and they
said oh these are kind of like you know
you can get a secondary computer or one
for your kids or travel machine and they
and and and everyone's like all I could
spend 300 hours on a laptop instead of a
thousand that's great and there were no
tablets at that point and or no job or
no I know iPad said actually the first
time I saw and was were kids on a plane
clamwin so but I come as they oversold
it as they always do anything fad like
and and and they try to convince people
that's all you needed you could just do
everything on this and that turned out
not to be the case and people were
disappointed if they kept the
expectations down to what a netbook
should do then the you know it might not
have it was like anything they over they
kind of over saturated the market and
then it crashed I think at this point I
know the margins are apparently as tight
as they can be but still drop the price
if you want these things to exist right
now when get done 250 199 i would say
199 for some of these things forbidden
is like a bio by a thousand our laptop
get one of these for free yeah and i'm
gonna get to why should be but if it's
gonna perform like an atom netbook and
it's not yeah if you've been making the
same thing for five years there's no
point but there's no point in why making
it at that price or making it there's no
point in making it and that's true yeah
there's no point there's no point to
make i'm saying if it exists right now
but this is the only one I haven't seen
another new netbook announcement a long
time this was denied did you ask them
why they
dated or well this is uh because they
were ad yeah CES and had no others who
said no other laptops to announce this
is no this is the only thing they
driving ahead started this that's true
hey Brett the netbook into the world and
they have taken out like I think there
were Walkman for like you know two
decades or whatever how long were there
walkman I mean they're still making
ipods even though most people don't buy
though or three decades yeah so they
keep that brand alive so I'm not super
excited about this particular system I
mean you know it is what it is we
actually try bringing in that book
recently mm-hmm onto a plane because I
wanted to use the iPad and Joanna was
going somewhere else so we had a netbook
kicking around and we actually relived
the experiment she took it with her on
the trip play movies all stuff it's not
doing it again no and then for a hundred
bucks more the same 399 is the ipad 2 is
now yeah you can get one of those AMD 11
inch ultra portables that's a lot better
you bought one of those too yes look at
this you well you are mr. example for
all this thing for all these things no
I've never had a netbook he said you're
not every I ya never had a netbook but
the DM one it was why do you have a team
and you review the last Adam client op
so there ya so yeah no good I don't know
you're done with these but those are
great that's a different beast those
those 11 inch ultra portables that's a
yeah I mean and it got like I said last
time I was on it got me through CES just
fine m would you trust your seat yes to
want to be no no yes senators that we
can I would agree Before we jump to
scotts the laptop let's take a look at
this light row here which I know we all
heard a lot about but I don't know if
we've really done a lot of live demoing
on on shows here but I mean there's
really nothing there's not much to if
you turn it on yeah I didn't take I can
take a light or a photo of damn by the
way nice watch and I must be looking at
that but your watch is also quite
something so everybody I just I just
shot that photo I'm just gonna show up
yeah look at ya nice alright so there
we've got the mmm
so it's gonna focus on that and then
focus on Dan see that everybody see I
can do it right with that person again
well we can and then you can add em out
there go yeah I see that focused on the
mic uh-huh and then tap on Dan and how
does it do that can you explain the the
background here it's a software magic
it's not where magic and ponies you know
I like pony um as yeah it's it like
field technology basically it's a
regular camera sensor but they've fitted
it with these micro lenses and it allows
it took is it essentially taking a whole
bunch of photos at once no just sorta no
no one shot okay but it's pulling light
from all directions so it's it's
gathering all the light from all
directions haha so so it allows you to
do stuff like shoot without focusing
because it has the information that it
needs in order to yes sir focus Lee
that's where the software comes in and
they take the software and process the
images and then you get that whole are
there an infinite number of focus points
uh not infinite but a lot years a lot
okay there's a lot of I mean for your
average photo you're only going to be
able to focus here like three places
because I thought it was sort of like
almost like taking like photo data for
all the different shots at create oh
yeah so it is they yeah but it's not
taking multiple shots it's just taking
one shot it is not but the freedom of
focusing wherever exactly yeah using
software showing those pictures I mean
certain pictures that are embedded like
damn is saying that you can see on a
certain pages that have the dollar bill
stretching out towards you or so it's an
impressive effect at first although you
know a little obviously kind of gimmicky
because how many times you really going
to use that and need it I can see maybe
like sports photography well and in
certain types of shots that's the thing
is that right now and everybody so it's
a one trick pony emits not really a
one-trick pony it does several things
and
fact is that they'll be able to keep
updating the software and do more and
more right the images so right now yeah
it's the you poked in the front you
poked in the back and you get and you
get a thing you got a picture so I mean
I mean it it runs out but basically what
I think will happen at least initially
is you'll end up with a bunch of user
groups that like micro fans like people
who shoot with 3d cameras have a group
you know I know everyone's probably
asked you this already and you've
already probably answered it multiple
times by the question of can you the
feasibility of taking that technology
and putting it into uh yes until point
shoot yes and and but will anyone do it
I don't know or smart phone smartphone I
could say I'm sure I trailerhood
licensing or making their own point
should take the thing is require so much
processing power to do it it's not going
to be so it's really all in the
processing power not so much in the
actual lens right exactly it's in the
micro lenses on top of the sensor and
their ability to process that
information so it's also the combination
of hardware and software you could just
make this a software update to an
existing product right what exactly
would you need a very deep barrel
because of that no why is it why is it
shaped like a couple reasons but for the
the main one that I was told was that
yeah the main one I was told was that no
no was then it allowed you to gather as
much light as possible for the their
first camera too you're holding it wrong
it's like these really not no I'm just
kidding it's a joke but you're not you
have to be about six inches away from
your closest subject for you to get a
good Lee focusing on no macro is then no
there is matters right yeah yeah you
just have to change to a creative mode I
mean if you can shoot macro shots I like
the feel of it though it's got a nice
sort of feel in the hand and it sort of
like yet yes got it actually you can get
that right up to your
object with the macro it does have nice
gadget feel it does have a nice gadget
rubbery smooth here and how nice it's a
little awkward at first but that one
yeah the 16 gig is 499 okay eight gig is
399 and then how do you get the pictures
off if they don't see a plug or a porter
and there is there is a port okay what
it was it be yeah and a software only
works with mac OS right now oh really
yes okay but then but you can still in
bed the this some sort of embedding tool
for embedding the images on their
website yeah actually what you need to
do is you have to use their software to
offload the photos when you upload the
photos this software they give you
process all right we'll throw that
picture you took in our in our podcast
blog post sure you can see it until it's
embedded in my own skull like yes I am
half light row yeah I would we say is
tetsuro the Iron Sky really yes for me I
mean the refocusing thing the you know
the ability to poke around in the images
is fun but for me the real nice part is
the instant shoot you don't have to
focus you can just shoot can I say
outside the box my thought is that first
of all I think ergonomically there's a
little bit of like Oh what am I going to
do with this how am I going to hold it
feel yeah because it's sort of like if
you're out and about it almost feels
like a camcorder but there's no real
palm grip you gonna hold it in your
fingers like a big cigar right perhaps
value I ended up holding it like a
sandwich yeah perhaps got if you were on
either the Nina the Pinta the Santa
Maria right stand on the bow and
Lestrade laceration searching for the
new world pretty much how it but check
out the viewing angle on the LCD just is
a good or not good no it's terrible oh
yeah it's a regular uh bad LCD yeah it's
Terry could be better it's the first
generation products tiny and so there's
yeah there's no there's no the second I
Josh save your photography or cheap
gimmick I don't think it's cheap gimmick
I don't think it's a savior alright I'm
not about why I didn't think that is
because I don't think photography need
saving oh so uh well it's not no no it's
not that ain't kidding no I'm what I
think what I my point would be would is
that more and more people they might be
shooting with their smartphones
but a lot of those people are getting
more interested in photography because
they're showing smartphones so there
they are actually trading up to camera
two real cameras that's a good point
it's almost like a key or smartphone is
like a gateway drug for photography yeah
it definitely is um and you know someone
written that story that's a good story
no but you know the crappy point and
shoots at the low end or disappearing
right people love mega zoom cameras and
they they want 20x zoom lenses and you
can't do that with a smartphone and
there's day that's one of the few areas
that the manufacturers are seeing growth
in is anything with the long zoom lens
very cool at mi to like outside the box
applications in the real world I feel
like for this one security cameras right
it's like me ultimate see everything
later secondly I feel like they could
add a second and build this into a pair
of binoculars because usually when you
have binoculars you are dealing with
depth of field a lot why could they
dealt us or a binocular camera where you
could use it spy something and then take
photos I just like the form factor you
looking crazy oh yeah I really I heard
it's amber mention who you really fly
I'm just bird watchings pretty much it i
mean i don't know you look to me like
I'm insane no no it just I mean I don't
know that it would I'm not sure what you
wanted to do nope not there's a little
we like a better like if you had a this
lecture technology built-in repair
binoculars i just like the form fender
what would be the oath and because
you're dealing with depth of field i'm
often turning the focus on bachelor's or
I'm dealing with right we'll listen you
don't do anything with depth of field in
this you just shoot but I'm saying it's
all about depth of field so if you had
after about that effect right I feel
like the little wheel might be more
efficient yeah yeah I don't you don't
like that idea Oh we'd love that Sony's
got binoculars with cameras in them if
you want if that's not when this be a
better one I'm not sure why all right
gentlemen I would like to see something
else here that's very exciting and that
is this razor blade laptop we talked
about last week I showed up line two we
did now we're gonna see some gaming on
because we had some concern that the
graphics were not powerful enough right
let me see do that Scott's gonna set up
this laptop over here
which is a camera at his screen whole
thing on the back that it does and it's
green yeah automatically you make your
light thing green that I'm all overs
about to go gonna show graphics on it
and you know rich brown was setting it
up to there's a big pc gamer playing
skyrim on here said it to um you know
pretty um bad actually it's better than
a little it was choppy when i was
playing it looks like better net like
pretty high I don't mess with me so
sorry um like not highest settings on
ultra settings but let's play up there
but it's playable but not as good as you
get on a super high-end sister that's
pretty good chopping this but the screen
looks fantastic i mean the clarity the
crispness on the screen really it's like
that yeah meta main man christmas look
it's not Christmas on this during the
Christmas is Christmas like no it's
crispy it is very crisp and I'm it
that's I feel embedded but you know it
or it's not is not a screaming gaming
experience but is absolutely playable um
so there you go i'm a pisce tree looks
fantastic but again as you point out got
the big the big selling point which is
that these custom LED little buttons
they don't have a Skyrim set right now
so if in this game for example you
wouldn't get anything extra out of that
there is no no you well you can map to
anything so I right I know right but
it's not like there's a Skyrim button
said you might call on don't I yet from
what we didn't say phone we saw me a lil
standalone macro keep an innate moments
if I know and that's why I'm that's why
I'm taking the hit for you Scott by
pointing out the the weakness of the
system but yeah there but I said what
they think this about 10 to 15 games
overall there have those and we are
going to how many how many do they have
now and not not that many alright um you
know hey don't we gonna have 10 at some
point that doesn't do any good it should
be around this time but the the number
of well yeah we want to do is install
this and have all this work and frankly
want the second screen of work with the
biggest pc game of the last you know
year to have a custom button set already
and ideally you'd even want that second
screen to pop up and do things in the
game there's a lot of stuff in Skyrim we
could do that yeah but the I have to say
though and I said this before we're
talking my hands on I really thought
that having a screen via the touchpad or
whatever reason i thought would would
make it a non-responsive
it actually is very responsive compared
to other touch pads I thought so it's
not like how the tennis look I mean the
the the lineup buttons that you can put
any kind of graphic image on that's
great yeah but I'd love to have you know
like the skyrim buttons that ready to go
or or whatever else you're playing mass
effect 3 I don't know and let's be frank
um if the graphics I'm just gonna say if
the graphics were up to mmm you could
get the fastest set of graphics with
this type of interface that would be I
still think they'll be the ideal thing
there are people are going to want that
but for a laptop this then that's pretty
good in stock it's not configurable
right it's just I have one model one
model but there are people i think that
will i would bet would trade off the
thinness and say you know what take
something twice as thick give me those
top and grip out yeah for the power yeah
give me an optical drive and high-end
graphics i don't care i like to look at
your laptop I like the cut of your jib
and you know give me the rest I just
think it's I think it just almost forces
an unneeded compromise for the first gen
laptop let me say but the review you
know this all but twenty eight hundred
dollars I'm just saying it's ready it's
good man well then it definitely it
definitely feels nice but it is a
expensive it's a it's almost like lytro
it's a kind of proof of concept in a way
and we'll see what people do with it
well I'm very excited about that
certainly more so than my my netbook
arguably more so than the light Roberto
a slideshow too I i I've another big
topic actually to bring up real fast I
heard you and Dave car no I discussing
the our perspective arrival dates of
your eye death rays uh apparently fedex
has been sending a tracking numbers that
i posted 10 new ipad before mr. new ipad
new ipad yeah you I you I bet that's
what it's called I know I know I'm gonna
wait a minute I'm gonna correct you I'm
gonna read you it's their generation I
do your customer this is an email from
the apple store I'm going to read you oh
dear customer I did I set him up in any
we know it you did not get a guitar
we're happy to let you know that the
items below or on their way to you we
also included delivery estimates and
tracking information next your shipping
address thank you for your time and for
shopping with apple the Apple Store and
the product listed ipad with Wi-Fi 32
gig black parenthesis third generation
good apples website they're calling it
ipad 3rd generation okay so which men
excuse any of the ipod touches that's
what we call them ipad their generation
fourth generation yeah you may want to
zoom deep in my snarling ma ah I
apologize to everyone out there now that
weird moment when you click on the fedex
tracking information it says in this
particular case I don't know what
Scott's says but let's see standard
overnight indirect no that's enshrine
ever heard of fedex they say in
directing i given it to you a ticket
required longest one trip up to Canada
anybody else and they're gonna deliver
all right March 10th shipment
information center fedex march later
march 10th picked up in middletown
pennsylvania yep detail future delivery
requested which means even though it's
in fedex's hands right uh Scott you I
won't get your your ipad 3rd generation
until friday though they're telling
fedex neither rolling I were or anyone
else I'm not admitting or denying is
value so can I admit I your behalf then
and I don't know what you're talking
about but that's next weekend out other
people and then hide behind your blurred
out more information Brazeau the next
week we can discuss what's happening to
people ipad 2 we could share sizes that
we ordered yes that's right we can trade
size sound dirty i do really sighs story
sounds very dirty I i will look I'll go
even go on the record and tell you I'll
tell you that a word I'll tell you that
I even ordered the 64 and that sounds
insane it is probably sendin stupid the
reason I did it is because two years
running I've used the 32 and I've maxed
it out now really I think it's like a
messy death syndrome or anything else if
you're messy your desk is twice the size
your desk will continue to be messy if
you shrink down quarter size where it's
like budget that means you'll get a 64
and you're gonna fill up 64 then
probably now about the cloud stuff now
you can delete TV shows and even ass and
get them and have you want that slot
yeah but I find when it comes to cloud I
know apparently game saves are stored in
the cloud I find a lot of app data gets
funky I do i delete something and
reinstall it it doesn't always you know
a lot of these apps now you're living in
them with downloadable purchases yeah
and and files and everything else and
and so I just I don't know I it's good
point I might regret it the way I'm
saying to myself this is a it's
expensive as a hundred dollar extra
experiment but um we discover so many
games and other stuff I think for most
people though I would agree go to 32 I
think 64 is not the 16 too small I don't
think you should the six I agree know if
you're already paying also I think yes
if you're gonna go with the 16 then just
get the ipad 2 but yeah I know that
person I mean in the sense of life no
I'm saying like your budget your budget
shopper it's terrible but if you're a
budget shopper I think it's there for
you and it'll give you great experience
I think with the file size increases and
everything else I just think it sounds
terrible but I've been look I'm that
kind of person with the kindle I was a
said I was a cheapy I want the $79
kindle I'm not I didn't need to buy the
ad free choice gotta admit you're back I
admitted I was that kind of person with
the kindle I want the ads on my Kindle
so I just think like mitigating it by
saying I'm gonna get the new cool one
but the 16 gig I think it's with the
photos and video editing in the stuff
they're there they're Hawking on this is
think the segment is is scott's advice
for poor people should that that's what
it is are you part of one percent scott
i I just thought you were supposed to I
mean they were doing 16 gig because
you're supposed to store everything on
the cloud man you are but here's the
thing if you're dealing with if you're
well depends if you don't care about
photo a video editing then you're
probably fine but that video editing
stuff like a you know like a on the
iphone 4s a two minute video comes in it
like 370 megabytes yeah if you're going
to edit any significant video I movie on
an iPad if you've dreams of that then uh
especially the footage you didn't shoot
