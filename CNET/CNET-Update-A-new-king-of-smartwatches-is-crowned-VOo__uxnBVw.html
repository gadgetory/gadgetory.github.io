ladies and gentlemen I'm Jeff Bakalar
filling in for Bridget Carey this is
your cnet update our pebble time steel
review has just hit and it's currently
the highest rated SmartWatch on cnet yes
that includes the Apple watch okay so
why is this the best SmartWatch around
well the pebble time seal has a
fantastic battery life that will get you
through nearly an entire week or more
and always-on display and it also works
with Android and iOS phones alike our
reviewer Scott Stein tells me the pebble
time steel does the best job of being an
actual watch which is the reason you're
wearing the thing on your wrist in the
first place right one of the most
popular online stores in the world is
about to get a brand new look apple com
no longer carries a store tab up top and
the store apple com URL will now just
redirect to apple com proper instead of
separating products from the actual
shopping experience the site now
combines the two meaning you can just
click to buy directly from an apple
product page which makes a lot more
sense for this company on numerous
levels the most obvious being the
consolidation of the shopping experience
by streamlining purchasing customers
have that many fewer clicks separating
them from placing in order a significant
Firefox vulnerability has been
discovered and patched so be sure to
update your browser to the latest
version 39-point 0.3 the flaw exploited
Firefox PDF viewer and allow for files
to be uploaded from a user's computer
without them knowing it was happening
and then finally today there was this
it's time magazine's cover story about
the creator of the oculus rift Palmer
Luckey and the future of VR
unfortunately though whereas most tech
visionaries get the epic black and white
headshot treatment it looks like they
made this cover in a wedding photo booth
the big problem here is that the cover
directly conflicts with the message of
the article about how important VR is
and how it's going to shape our future
but instead the cover undercuts that by
making Palmer look like a big doofus
which perpetuates that awkward nerd
stereotype either way it took Twitter by
storm yesterday netting us some of the
most memorable photoshop jobs in recent
memory why is he flying that just about
does it for today's news update you can
