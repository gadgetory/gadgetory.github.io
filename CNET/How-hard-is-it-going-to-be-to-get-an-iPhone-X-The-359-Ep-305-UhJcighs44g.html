it's episode 305 of the 359 podcast my
name is BVG and here are your hosts Ben
Fox Ruben and a homeless at Alfred and
Roger J rhythm I'm sorry it's also
October 25th but that's okay we went
back in time what did I say October 5th
I say October 5th I think yeah so we've
got a stacked stacked podcast for you
we'll be talking about Apple and how
it's boosted supply for the iPhone X
even though that may not be enough we're
gonna talk about Amazon key a new
service that includes a smart cam and
we're talking about Verizon bring it
back full quality video streaming which
they've taken away two months ago
woohoo back but it cost money of course
it does don't things usually yeah well
it was it before it was free before so
as always if you have any questions
leave them in the comment section Brian
will pick out the best we will get to
them in 3 minutes and 59 seconds from 3
to welcome to the 359 I'm Roger Cheng
I'm Ben Fox Ruben
so Apple is desperate to get more iPhone
X's out their latest Bloomberg report
says that they've actually told in
manufacturers to ease off the accuracy
of face ID so they can loose production
right sound good right I mean Bloomberg
was clear to note that even with the
reduced accuracy
they claim it's still more secure than
touch ID the fingerprint sensor but it's
sort of it's another indication that the
iPhone X for the iPhone 10 is gonna be a
really really hard item to get this
holiday do you think that might actually
benefit Apple in some way I mean like
obviously not with their bottom line but
at the same time if it gets so difficult
to get an iPhone 10 the resale market
it's going to be huge if you're one of
you the few friends that actually has
one this will be like the it thing oh
yeah let me could show off it definitely
will be an it thing a status symbol one
of the hot holiday items I don't know if
it's a said good cuz that reseller
market Apple doesn't really get a no
tanzanite no it's more
for cachet right there there's gonna be
a cachet for this thing just because
it's gonna be so difficult to find but I
know Apple wants I mean they want to
boost production they want to get as
many these things out there cuz all the
indications that was seen for the
carriers the iPhone eight hasn't really
sold that well so you know I think
there's gonna be there's this kind of
disconnect where there's huge demand for
the iPhone X but there isn't a lot of
supply it seems like there's a a decent
supply of iPhone a it's panade demand so
they're in a weird position right now
yeah yeah I mean while I'm just sittin
on an iPhone 6 next up we wanted to talk
about Amazon key bet you actually were
you're in Brooklyn for this briefing a
few days ago tell me more about the
service yeah I got to see a demo of this
essentially the way it works is is that
there is a new camera called the Amazon
Cloud cam that Amazon creates and it
helps enable a way of getting in home
delivery in your house and then the
smart cam is it basically taking your
nest here in many ways yeah it would
take on nest and a lot of other smart
cam developers so this is this is Amazon
getting its first major foray into smart
cams as well but the other thing that
this could actually do is letting guests
in future months you could let in a dog
walker or a house cleaner or so it works
with the smart cam and also a smart door
lock to actually enable this thing cool
alright lastly Verizon brought back the
full quality video streaming this is
something that they'd actually was part
of your unlimited data plan until they
took it away in August there was a there
was a bit of an uproar amongst consumers
who felt like they were being
unnecessarily throttled down well
Verizon is bringing back next week but
it will cost $10 extra why so called
streaming yep yep arises really just you
know do they hate their customers I feel
like they're there they look at this as
an opportunity to get a little bit more
money out of subscribers so if what what
did some of the other guys do right now
like I feel like t-mobile probably does
something a little bit more consumer
friendly yeah so a lot of them do kind
of throttle down the video quality you
know usually it's down to a DVD quality
or even less than 720p but there are
there's an option to either pay up for
higher quality I think t-mobile is
actually kind of giving it away mostly
and at least they offered an option for
all the other carriers offered an option
for full quality videos Verizon ahead
took it a while
took it away for a while which people
thought was a sign that they couldn't
handle the traffic so the fact that
they're bringing back at least shows
that you know their network can't handle
this stuff it's important know that a
lot of phones really can't do better
than 1080p like they talked about
questions like how how desperately do
you really need such high resolution on
a tiny screen for a lot of people it's
totally it does make a difference at all
they're like maybe two or three 4k
phones out there like one that Sony
makes so no one buys it and so it that's
a little bit more negligible I think
this is just getting it out there and
having that option for folks who really
care about this stuff it's probably
small part of the customer base but it's
a vocal one so it's just having it out
there all right more of these stories
check us out on CNN I'm Roger Cheng I'm
Ben Fox Ruben thanks for listening all
right so we'll delve into the chat and
I'll start digging out some of your best
comments and questions right out the
gate people borrowing
mr. tongs bad Apple over and over and
over this looks like a mess this is a BS
shortage Wow hashtag our ap Apple Wow
it's tough I we always knew this was
gonna be a somewhat awkward year for
them guys with the iPhone aid it's not a
significant change from the past
yeah years with the iPhone 6 success 7
it really doesn't even look that any
different for the bag I mean I've talked
to folks who have bought the iPhone a or
A+ and these are people who you know
they don't necessarily care about the
latest greatest they just want a new
phone they've had their phone for two
plus years usually just want a new one
and I get their reaction it's been like
mixed to negative a lot of this just
were like this was exactly like an
iPhone 7 I even though with the glass
back yeah and you know one when I met
you though well it's got wireless
charging you know the the response I've
got from a couple people were like well
I've got a really thick case that's
really
oh yeah so like the so far the reactions
been muted it really is kind of you
shown in the sales too right said
absolutely the all the US carriers have
reported earnings spring with the laugh
they did this morning and everyone
pretty much everyone at least hinted at
the fact that the lack of an iPhone X
this quarter made a difference no
customer additions were lower than a
year ago upgrade rates were a lot lower
people weren't moving around and usually
when a new phone come when a new iPhone
comes out that's a time for people to
switch around there wasn't a lot of
movement the last quarter granted I
thought I came out September 22nd so I
was sort of the tail end of the last
quarter yeah but like I remember reading
a lot of like analyst notes there was so
much discussion about the 10th
anniversary being a quote unquote
supercycle new person where a lot of
people were waiting whether two three or
four years to actually upgrade their
older clunky or iPhone games and
unfortunately they're in this awkward
position of either getting in iPhone 8
if they want the latest and greatest
which isn't really that different than
past years or praying that they're gonna
get an iPhone X are we doing X you keep
saying I know I keep miss speaking it's
iPhone 10 no I like X I like x2 it's we
just have to talk about it at every
podcast I never mention it but yeah like
the supplies are gonna be significantly
limited I would say well into next year
that seems yeah obvious yeah the funny
thing is you know even last year Apple
con Telegraph to people through various
media reports are like the big change is
coming next year or 2017 not 26 so a lot
of people knew a lot of people who were
up for upgrades last year probably held
onto their phone a little bit longer
because they were thinking well the the
real big change the real new iPhone is
coming in 2017 fast forward to now and
yet like right now the only option is
the phone that is marginally different
or better than the last version so I
guess it's worth arguing and the changes
coming in 2018 and then 2019 changes are
always coming right Ange is coming next
year I guess could be Apple's new slogan
I'll just stick with everybody take some
questions yeah let's do it
all right so first out the gate pay
Joe is the 256 gigabyte or 64 gigabyte
going to be harder to get space gray or
silver is that going to be harder to get
to those are really specific wiser I
don't know yeah I think the answer is
yes
yes probably I would say specifically to
your question about whether or not their
differences we can't say for sure
I would imagine both they're gonna be
both colors we'll be accepting difficult
to get I don't think there's gonna be
like a limited version in terms of the
memory I would imagine a lot of people
are gonna go for the 256 gig version
since you're already spending that much
so that might just be tougher because
people more people are gonna want to get
that one because right superuser phone
we're spending a thousand bucks already
why not spend another hundred fifty for
the 256 members yeah Thank You Apple
sales and that is for sure
right that and add that's apples logic
that's why they eliminated the middle
option there is no longer that like 128
right the 128 there's like there was
always kind of a logical middle option
that seemed like okay it's not crazy
expensive but you had a decent amount of
memory they limited that option so you
have to go for like either way too much
memory for a higher price or like not
enough memory for the cheapest price no
not a great option either well yeah
that's that's a good insight that the
256 is probably gonna be even harder to
get but yeah you're right it's gonna go
from very hard to super hard to get
either
yes I mean I kind of agree with you if
you're gonna be spending that kind of
coin anyways you might as well go all in
yeah but at this point you're going to
try to go all in and they're gonna say
sorry we don't have any yeah yeah that's
I wonder if people will settle for the
64 gig version if it's just start
waiting in line the chat for people I
know Michael Browns hanging out in the
chat today and I know Michael our boy
Michael mega Apple fan and I'm more out
there too if if you were in that
situation you got in that line and all
they had left was a sick 64 would you
settle or would you wait it out for the
256 I know we'll into bed now you would
buy it you the 64 no I was thinking the
complete I don't know see this is what
you do you'd buy it for a while they
have a pretty I think they have a pretty
liberal return policy mm-hmm specially
during launch time and so what I imagine
you were doing
I immediately either flip it or hold on
to it till there's more supply of the
256 gig and like go back and return it
that way you don't walk away
empty-handed that's a good point
I was waiting in line if I was alive for
a week
well for one thing if I if I don't keep
it I would just flip it right because
that thing would be worth twice right
yeah so there's that remember when the
phones had like four and eight gigabytes
Oh God the Dark Ages it was not that
long first world is problems like 10
years ago 9 or 10 years yeah that that's
it might as well be a century all right
more questions
shining che dumbing down the face ID
accuracy seems like a very uh napple
thing to do what will come back or will
that come back to bite them insecurity
tests I like the pun there yeah I I
don't know it's it's really it's really
in a dependent we haven't obviously
don't have it we haven't tested it yet
and we won't know if they're gonna be
like different batches with different
variations of accuracy yeah I kind of
complicated well not only that but like
during their you know whole stage
presentation they really emphasize the
whole face ID thing so right if we were
if we are gonna believe this Bloomberg
report that they are degrading face ID
in any way at all it's not a very good
look for them right right we got kind of
a two-parter here apart from Derek part
from mwj Davies kind of coming from the
same place and you got to ask yourself
what does Apple oh why does Apple always
have shortages is it not a ploy why
can't they figure this out and would
Apple really have a shortage of the
iPhone X when they plan to sell in more
countries than ever before right from
the get-go do you think it's the
manufacturing problem is manufactured
similarly to you know the shortages of
nintendo's and it's an increasing demand
lowering supply in order to build hype I
would say if this phone wasn't
significantly different than previous
models then yes but you think they
actually drop the ball yeah well if it's
dropping the ball if you read the whole
Bloomberg report it's actually a really
good rundown of all the issues they've
had whether it's supply shortages for
animal
displays whether it's getting the
infrared sensors to work correctly to
fit into the phone cuz it's such a small
part there's so many parts to kind of
bundling together for that front-facing
camera it is a pretty complicated thing
they basically had to like throw away
initial batches they had to shut down
production for a while because it wasn't
working correctly I think there are just
a lot of complications because they did
load a lot of new tech for Apple allow
detect for Apple into these phones and
it's a whole new production way of
producing a phone and that leads
complications I mean if it was just
another iPhone 8 that looked the same
and they somehow magically had shortages
I would be a lot more suspicious but
given the fact that this is so wholly
different than previous models
interesting I die by the fact that there
are supply shortages because they just
can't make enough cuz it's so much more
complicated sure alright thanks to that
insight yeah I think you made sense out
of it I mean it did it right change my
opinion on it my guess is like those
jerks right I mean yes still do we have
any Amazon key questions I figured I'm
not yes I do want to talk about that
personally I'm very interested let's got
the last couple of Apple questions yeah
sure
June buck why didn't a Polly I phone
eight and eight plus with bezel list
displays don't they know if they did
they would be killing the phone game
right now
yeah killing it in the phone I think
that goes back to that the point I just
made it's difficult to produce that many
phones using that particular display I
think four of that dispensary using
AMOLED will inch they're getting from
Samsung they can't get enough of those
that's why we're getting a real supply
shortage with iPhone tens I don't know
if they could have done it with with LCD
which is what they've been using which
was what they've always been using what
with it with the bezel this display I
mean like we've already seen with
Samsung that they went to bezel this
with their all their flagship phones but
those are all using AMOLED displays
right well it taking out the AMOLED
display part and just looking at it from
a design perspective it's obviously been
proven that people are really interested
in that product as the the questioner
mentioned sure has time so he's doing
really well this year and selling a lot
of those phones yeah despite the fact
that they had a phone last year that
blew up sorry that that's definitely
shown that they had a nice
I'm in complete agreement with you about
why didn't they change at the iPhone
eight more like why doesn't it have the
bezel this display doesn't need the face
ID bit they could have gone with gone
with just that redesign and I think a
lot of people would have been happy with
that I don't know the question is I mean
clearly they spent all the resources on
the redesigned iPhone 10 and 10 spent a
lot of time talking about the iPhone 8
right so yeah it's right there there are
some nice additions to it but I agree
with you that it's it's not as much as
you might have hoped for and I mean look
I think Apple and you know I don't know
I don't have any insight to their what
they're thinking about this but they
probably wanted i phone tend to look
completely different from the iPhone 8
they want to they wanted to create that
gap so hmm you know you either get the
standard upgrade the boring upgrade or
you you pay up for like a wildly
different awesome flagship phone and
having that separation probably helps
with what's their pitch to sell yeah I
don't know I guess I I think that with
for a lot of people they might just
decide to go for you know an older model
and iPhone said yeah and save money I
think that's for a lot of people who
don't really care about the latest and
greatest like that flows happens fine
phone greatest objective it's a very
very good phone and for most people
they're not gonna notice the difference
in processor speed I don't you know like
weather all cheering about the 7 as much
as I hear about the SE that's true if
they really want to save money there's
DSD well not only that but like it's
just but it's a nice phone it's a great
although on that side yeah that's all
sevens got portrait mode which is like a
killer app that a lot people and it's
cheaper now right hundred dollars
cheaper than it was a year ago so it's a
more reasonable option for people who
don't necessarily need the best from
ample portrait mode
whispers doesn't care about portrait
Mike it looks super awesome your kid is
awesome anyway true but it okay I like
Ted full I think you sound I'm kind of
short I think you should come back and
see this episode uh no oh he's not gonna
watch this go nah no dad isn't a podcast
yeah what's a podcast that's what he's
gonna say yeah through it all right so
real quick before we move on to
we might need to speculate a little bit
here but let's talk about shipment dates
do we have any speculative concept about
when the next shipment date would be
after launch day and do we have any idea
what the International schedule is going
to be specifically Asia and that's
coming from eg Studios we don't
Seifer like the announced countries we
don't have any updates in terms of
shipment date yeah that's anybody hard
to say but I want to adjust to address
it absolutely yeah yeah it stay tuned
when we learn more you'll learn more
yeah if you're dying to get one of these
phones you'll probably be able to find
it on the secondary market if you can't
get it from Apple but you but expect to
pay up a lot more yeah especially
because of the limited supply so what's
on cuz I was actually really interested
in historic I'm just super interested
personally as someone who's you know
apartment living for some time yeah okay
so never lived in a building with a
doorman or anything like that so a lot
of times I have anything I need to live
or sent to the office yep and then I had
a lot of people do they have to haul at
home but it'd be awesome to be able to
just remotely grant that access when I
know I've got stuff coming and I do it
so here's here's the thing that's that's
interesting that you mentioned that
because that's that's a big use case
sorry for saying use case that's a big
reason why Amazon wanted to provide this
in the first place this is such a thing
as porch pirates yeah things get stolen
all the time
ecommerce companies like Amazon Walmart
you name it they get the thing all the
way to your door and then it gets stolen
like that's the most frustrating thing
ever oh yeah you get an angry customer
calling up so if they could actually
create the peace of mind for customer
and also ensure that the package gets
delivered safely inside your door that's
that's a win on both sides do I do you
really want the delivery guy to come to
your home so that's the other thing I've
been I've been paying attention to like
some chatter on Twitter and reddit and
it seems that a lot of people are like
hell no I don't like this idea it's too
much trust given to any retailer and
it's similar to how a lot of people
respond oh you're not trusting the
retailer you're trusting the delivery
guy right right but the delivery guy
arguably is like working and trained by
the retailer and most the time it's like
guys from UPS
post-office right in this case it's it's
a specific group that they were a little
vague about who exactly is doing the
deliveries but they said this wouldn't
apply like a karate or s it wouldn't be
FedEx UPS US Post Office
they've it was these are like nerve and
Amazon employees I don't even know that
they're Amazon employees again they were
a little vague about it they said that
these are delivery people that you would
normally trust to see get your
deliveries taken so the way that I read
that was these are generally third-party
partners that Amazon works with to do
their deliveries but it's not mean that
it's limited access do you think that
would have a negative impact on like
Prime turn around the whole like two
days are using a cell point there their
argument is no and obviously Amazon has
done a lot with its logistics to make
sure stuff gets to you as fast as
possible so maybe they're doing it
through Prime now or a handful of other
services that they have but no you're
not getting it through USPS FedEx or UPS
so let's talk about the benefits of this
as opposed to somebody just manually
setting this up on their own if somebody
just put their own security webcams not
hard and then you were able to bluetooth
key lock what what what is the benefit
of this Amazon specific application as
opposed to just DIY it yeah the the way
that it works with Amazon key is it's a
whole kit that's set up it starts at
installing over you they install it for
you for free if you want them to and the
way the app is set up is that once the
package gets scanned outside the house
and the delivery person knocks on the
door then the camera turns on and starts
recording and after the package gets
delivered your door gets locked back up
you get a video you can either watch it
live or you can go and watch the video
after the fact to actually see here it
is it gets delivered and then the person
leaves and you even have a specific on
the app this is how long the this is how
long your door was locked for or
unlocked for how much it could be as
much as like a minute your door was
unlocked so it's just an extraordinarily
detailed rundown of the entire procedure
it's a little bit more other than like
outside of a DIY like this is this is a
little bit more
structured and tightly controlled you
get more notifications and how much is
the service the service itself is free
Oh once once you pay 250 that's
basically it if you wanted to get a
subscription for the security-cam so you
have more access like longer access to
video clay you can actually yeah exactly
then you can pay for that that starts at
$7 but and by the way this is us only
for our international watchers yeah
thanks only yeah I'm logistically
speaking I don't know if that really
necessarily would help me in an
apartment situation just because I don't
have carte blanche to have things
installed and drilled and mounted we say
my reception lobby area
not to mention where my apartments
located that wireless camera would never
stretch the Wi-Fi well you would do it
outside your door like if you don't have
a door which defeats the purpose because
I the front door of my building is
locked locked right more useful totally
house yeah if you have a it's generally
for people that have a front door one of
the things that they told me to if
you're really kind of creeped out or
uncomfortable with the idea of giving a
delivery person access to your front
door yeah then you could do it on like a
side door to the garage like I have a
detached garage so arguably I could do
it with that where you just put it in
the side door of the garage I'm like the
worst thing that they could steal would
be my lawnmower which would be a bummer
but still you know like it's not like
giving them access the and and again
like I think that a lot of people were
creeped out about this they have to
recognize the fact that there's a video
of the delivery person showing up and
this is directly connected to Amazon so
not only would that person probably get
fired but they'd probably get arrested
too so they're like cynic assuming
Amazon then would be liable it's
something yeah and and you know I'm not
I'm not suggesting that something like
that couldn't possibly happen you know
every system has its issues but I think
Amazon at least attempted to do a good
job of setting up enough of a structure
for this to ensure that something like
that would be far less likely to happen
James favor and hold on who do we have
here
Jessie gaming brought up a the elephant
in the room
let's talk crack let's talk Wi-Fi hacks
does his smartlock have a problem with
security even more with the Amazon
camera is this going to be susceptible
literally anything that's Wi-Fi
connected could be susceptible to
security hacks we've seen it a million
times or yeah exactly if you have a DIY
set up with a nest cam and smart locks
like August smart locks I mean all that
stuff is susceptible to hacks I mean
that's that is a price you're paying for
the the convenience such a game with
some of these smart devices if you're
not comfortable with it I would suggest
like sticking to a dumb old-fashioned
lock right yeah not having this kind of
convenience it's something I'm like I
would go back and forth on I'm not sure
if I necessarily want to give up my my
privacy for you know for the the chance
that hackers consists or unlocked my
door yeah in addition to that I would
probably say broadly speaking the bigger
companies that provide smart door locks
and cameras you know tend to have a
better software that is less hackable
everything can be or at least offer
updates it's less that they have better
software I think they're more cognizant
of the security issues right and
probably send out updates more
frequently I think it's yeah it's the
ones I like the third-party unknown yeah
like the much cheaper you know security
cams and we've seen it as far as like
you know being able to hack into the
baby cam Network stuff like that it's
it's not as secure as if you were gonna
buy something from Google or Amazon I
think that's about the right place to
leave off for the day you want to send
