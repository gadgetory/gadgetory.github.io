episode of seen at roadside assistance
episode number 49 for Thursday March
29th 2012 so close to 50 yet so so very
far not quite a year not quite a year
I'm antuan goodwin alongside Wayne
Cunningham with Mitchell Chang on the
controls and is the show where we take a
minute to answer a couple of your emails
and we've got a couple of them this week
that I think are worth sort of
mentioning so let's start with the first
one this one comes in from Don and
Pittsburgh e says hello I listen to your
show and they're great but i just wanted
to email you concerning a gentleman you
contacted concerning the jeep radio Jeep
Wrangler radio install one of the
problems was installing the aftermarket
radio and the the Wrangler which uses a
high-speed canbus electrical system he
says actually most Mopar vehicles have
this so when you buy an adapter you need
to buy another adapter for the
electrical system so that it all
functions normally this can cause a lot
of problems with the the vehicles I
guess electrical systems when you don't
use this adapter so the part that done
recommended to our previous listener
with the Jeep Wrangler is PA see as the
company and they have a part called the
c2 R dash C hy for it's a seventy dollar
adapter that you install in the jeep
wrangler that basically takes over and
it allows the standards dairy that the
new stereo that you install in the
wrangler to work without interfering or
causing issues with that sort of
high-speed can bus system that's in the
in the vehicle did you find that adapter
like I'm Crutchfield or something I just
google it yeah I'm pretty sure yeah you
could probably find it at any sort of
like 12 volt shop so or 12 volt supplier
Crutchfield I guess being at the top of
my list I actually found it on amazon or
you can order directly from pack i do PA
SI audio IC yeah i'm looking at the
Crutchfield list here and they got a lot
of stuff listed for PA see
so noise filters even an iPod adapter
USB extension cable satellite radio
adapters all sorts of stuff sorry
because what happens is like a lot of D
the stereo in in the sort of chrysler
vehicles actually does an interesting
thing all of those doors ajar chimes you
left your keys in the car chimes those
come through the speakers right instead
of a discrete sort of like speaker in
the dashboard and so what happens is
when you take the stock stereo out you
lose all of that so if your car has
memory seats the regular doesn't but you
actually lose the ability to store the
the memory settings for your seats the
car just goes holy crap a part of my
brains missing it affect it out so
although not having those chives and
stuff i wouldn't mind not having so the
problem is not having those chimes there
you know could you know it could be
something like you know your the light's
not coming on when you leave a door
partially unlocked and it'd be an issue
when you get an accident or I mean it
could just be something whereas if the
car doesn't get a signal that it's
supposed to get it just throws an error
code and causes all sorts of other
problems it's kind of like you know you
leave your fuel your fuel door off and
you get a check engine light because
your car thinks oh no there's not a
vacuum on the fuel system the car must
be about to explode and it freaks out
over something small yeah the so yeah a
lot of head units these days do connect
to your your vehicle systems a little
more integrated than in the past have
you encountered this much when you've
been swapping out stereos and oh you
know we have the aveo so it's literally
the dumbest car yeah in the in the
history of vehicles the 2004 early two
thousand seven chevy aveo this thing
doesn't even have power windows so it's
pretty easy to slap any stereo in there
the problem comes when you start trying
to do you know obd diagnostic stuff
because that generation of the aveo
actually doesn't output everything that
that some of the systems look for CAD
not non-standard or obd2 right I guess
yeah but yeah other the vehicle we
talked about this before with Honda's
where it's just like you take your
stereo out and the the security system
freaks out yeah so
you know definitely a good tip from dawn
for all of our artists a chrysler jeep
for drivers this next email comes in
from doug roads i think it's actually
hilarious he says hey car tech guys
since you've been talking about phone
and car mounts lately on roadside
assistance i highly recommend highly
recommend the twenty-dollar CD slot
universal mount from mountain calm about
one a few months ago on amazon.com and
it works great with my iphone 4s using
ways and rhapsody in my chevy HHR with a
12 volt USB adapter in a five dollar
Alex out he says that it works great in
rental cars and several people have seen
mine and have also ordered one he also
states he doesn't work for mount tech
but he's just sharing a cool product I
like this one this is funny yeah this is
the equivalent like sitting your coffee
cup on an open cd-rom tray yeah this is
a yeah slides into the CD slot that
you're probably not using anymore
because you have an ipod tooked up to
your system trying to find a good image
of it here actually i just googled it
here's that one that's not bad actually
just almost lost okay let me see if we
can find that photo again because it's
it's kind of funny yeah so this has a
bracket that slides into your CD slot
mmm one thing i was wondering about this
is what does your CD player do does it
go like oh my god i need to play i need
to play cuz something's you know I've
got a CD in me it looks like if you look
at the other photos like it doesn't go
all the way in like it it has sort of in
like a little bit of an upturned lip and
so it may be just kind of grabs on to
the inside of the the CD slot without
actually going all the way in and
triggering the sort of like arms that
let the CD player know there's a disc in
there otherwise you would totally tear
up your 6-disc in-dash change or if you
had one of those oh yeah does it be
constantly spinning motors and like that
and I think it's just a case of like the
product just kind of grabbing on to a
lip that live happens to be the CD slot
not necessarily like there's a gigantic
fake plastic CD in there like the tape
adapters yeah that's used to see that
this is good in some cars although some
cars will have the radio display below
the CD player
and so the phone and braca blend of
blocking that so you don't really want
to do that it looks like he actually has
a picture of his HHR here but yeah it
looks like yeah you probably would
definitely end up blocking the display
but if you're using an auxiliary input
that display and show anything anyway so
that's Tris just showing aux-in so who
cares if you block it yeah all you
really need is volume controls and you
should probably be doing that with your
steering wheel controls if they're
available so but yeah that's actually a
very cool product that I laughed at at
first but kind of makes a little bit of
sense especially if you're going to be
going from car to car because most cars
have a CD slot in them yeah and as
opposed to suction cup in something to
the windshield which you know you have
to reach all the way forward and do that
or there's other mounts that I'll like
mount in the cup holders to which going
to depends on the height and the
placement of the cup holders I think cup
holder mounts are cool yeah de pit yet
but depending on where your cup holders
are if you have like a like a Porsche
and you have those weird like flip out
that holders that you know don't really
lock into place or a BMW has those weird
like clip-on cupholders you can snap
onto the z4 not gonna work but pretty
much every other car that's old America
is like 15 cup holders in it though so
you always find something conveniently
placed I actually usually just toss my
phone in the cup holder just by itself
yeah I did that get phone in the cup
holder yes I'm bluetooth and and I don't
charge my phone in the car yeah cup
holder it's actually the key holder and
the phone holder and the everything else
I really except drinks yeah goes in the
cup holder so that's interesting but
yeah thanks for that Doug we've got
another email that comes in from mr uh
who sent this from his droid razr he
said on a recent episode you were giving
options for seven passenger s SUV at
around 30k with good Kevin teka fuel
mileage why not the kia sorento probably
a lot cheaper than the explorer
definitely a lot cheaper than the
Highlander Hybrid which can probably
cannot be had for under 40 the hilar
driver can be had for around 40 the
correct i was actually looking at the
prices yeah than that but yeah the
cerritos a good option there's never is
that a that is a s 7 passengers in I
think the Sorrento has a full down rear
seat yeah I wouldn't want to sit back
there
um actually take a look at it right here
let me just find some photos of it here
see if they have pictures of the rear
seats awhile since I've been in a store
in Tara yeah they were oh yeah here we
go here's a picture that shows that
there is a there's a third row seating
area the side of the car should open up
like that because yeah getting back
there otherwise you're not getting into
that sir it's cruel the third row looks
very cruel oh yeah I mean hildren go
back there they don't have legs I'm not
all the time cuz you have to put a car
seat there there's no way of course you
could fit in the back there I guess yeah
this is one of those things out to get
back here you have to fold down the
middle row seats and climb over and it
seemed like maybe it'd be easier to get
in through the hatch it could that's how
whenever we take pictures of cars and
you see me in the third row I've usually
climbed in through the hatch and then
flip the seat up behind me that's the
only easy way to get in yeah yeah
definitely don't want to be putting a
grown man back there yeah this is fairly
typical and of course with the third row
up in the Sorento you can't it you don't
have much cargo space you get a very
slim little bit of area there yeah
pretty sure that the the Highlanders
probably about the same yeah it's one of
those situations where you're just you
if you're gonna make the Costco run you
leave two kids at home right you set
them up with the ps3 and walk away
mm-hmm so yeah there's that it's a good
option I don't remember this window
being particularly offensive I just did
pop into mind when we're talking about
this yeah let me just one last thing
check check the price on the weather
they sell these things for it looks like
base 23 is the low shouldn't go in for
that's a 2.4 liter though automatic
transmission thinning view all the way
up to a 34 thousand dollar car so yeah
cheaper then some of the other options
certainly right so yeah I'm pretty sure
we probably missed five other vehicles
yeah they're kind of fit into into that
class but I guess the thing is that
though the car that that we think is the
best is usually the one that pops
straight in mind so there you go we got
another question one last question
actually from
from Keith who's actually sent us a
couple of emails of four he says a
couple of weeks ago we mentioned the
tomtom car dock in the iphone 3gs and he
has a couple of problems related to it
he says first periodically he can't get
his phone to pair with the tomtom dock
until he goes into the settings and
bluetooth menu and tries to pair it and
the second is he's been getting an
annoying message on his phone that says
that this device is not supported but
most of the time it's fine and basically
he wants to know why these things happen
well I've certainly seen the phone is
not supported message from different
different devices lots of times ipod
integration in in cars I've seen that
happen before it's just yeah the vehicle
was set up a certain amount of software
with the circular software don't looks
and checks the the phone and you know
maybe it's not it doesn't realize oh
you've updated the the you know the
software in the phone for example or the
phone company has so it might see that
and go like oh I don't work with you you
know because they'd have an updated the
software in the car the interesting
thing is usually just you can just push
past that yeah and just keep it a little
work fine yeah Frank yeah frankly I've
ignored that message many times and yet
had no problem with the phone you're
working with a car right it with the
tomtom dock it kind of seems like it's
there it's a handshake issue because you
have two things that are happening the
first is that you know the phone's not
pairing straight off and then the second
thing is that it's showing device
doesn't support so what I'm thinking is
you know either there is another
Bluetooth device in the area that the
phones trying to talk to also that
there's maybe a little bit of lag in the
tomtom device actually powering up when
you get into the car and crank your
ignition and maybe the iphones already
passed the handshake point in that
pairing before the tom thumb goes like
oh yeah I'm here it could be any number
of issues but the fact of the matter is
the iphone 3gs and the the tomtom car
kit of the the generation that the
iphone 3gs
are they just the Bluetooth at that
point in history just wasn't great it
was good but it wasn't the you know the
easy pairing you know Bluetooth portato
stuff that we're seeing now yeah there's
some updates in the software to like
Apple did update to iOS iOS 5.1 i think
it is now and they did do some
improvements to some of the Bluetooth
I've noticed in that actually not not
huge improvements and it might not
affect the pairing at all but certainly
when with bluetooth audio is streaming
it's better at showing track information
for example right but I can't make the
Bluetooth chip do something I couldn't
do yeah or you know so if there is a you
know like a fast fast pairing I remember
what exactly that protocol is called but
it's a simple pairing protocol spp if
that's not supported by the phone and if
it's not supported by the device is
trying to pair two and sometimes you
kind of run into those sort of handshake
issues and I mean it did see it you
could pop into the settings hit the
power button and it figures it out I
have the same issue on my on my handset
a droid HTC Thunderbolt Android
Thunderbolt phone but that's mostly
because at any given time there like 15
devices that I'm paired to in five cars
that haven't been in the garage for
months and so I have to periodically go
into my settings and clear those out
completely different issue from the one
that you're probably having and I have
to admit that I'm also a little head
scratchy over the the device does not
support but it sounds like yeah when you
you've got the experience with that and
it's probably harmless yeah yeah usually
it's just yeah the phone doesn't think
it does because it's not recognizing
something or the cars direct or you know
the docs not recognizing you know
something i would think it's strange
that was the same software setup it's
periodically happening that seems odd
but you know if it works it works so he
had easy to enough to ignore that right
guy I do remember at about the time I
was testing the cut the you know the
tomtom car dock I would get the same
issue with the you know plugging the
ipod touch in the car kids where it
would go like sorry and will support
this and I'd go that's nice I play the
music please yeah and they would just do
it so it's prob
just some sort of weird works with ipod
authentication sort of thing that's
happening abscess some film programmer
at some programmer at Apple was probably
thinking it looks better to cover our
butt and say this device isn't
officially supported than to give
someone an excuse to complain about
something it doesn't work right anyway i
hope that kind of helps you out we
didn't give you any answers there but we
did kind of explain why things suck yeah
this is probably the best that we can
hope to do in that case right there so
but that pretty much rounds up the the
emails that we have to answer this week
on the last episode of the last very
short episode of cnet roadside
assistance but as you can still continue
to send them in to us you can send your
emails to our tech at cnet com and we'll
still answer them maybe just not in a
podcast format so you can do that and
it's been great answering your emails
fielding your questions getting your
voicemails and interacting with all of
you guys on Twitter and in the chat room
on the show so that's it show's over
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
