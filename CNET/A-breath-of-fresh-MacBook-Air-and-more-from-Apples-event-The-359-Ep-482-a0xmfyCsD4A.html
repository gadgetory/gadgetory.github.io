g and today we got Alfred and joni
Salzman and Shara Tipton what's up
everybody a well we got a packed house
we also have the ghost of Ben Rubin and
Roger Cheng on the show you can't see
them unless you're using our special
ghost vision filter so but we are
talking Apple today as you know you know
Big Apple was in the Big Apple
great joke but and Shara was there did
you got a hands on on the everything on
all the things so that includes you know
the iPad pro the MacBook Air the Mac
Mini no iPad Mini sadly also Lana Del
Rey was there like I mean she was great
but it was kind of a weird vibe because
right there like an energetic event and
then it was like let's bring it back hey
check out all these great news here
comes some sad song so I don't want to
get started or not but we can stay here
just chatting all day otherwise yeah I
don't know I guess our done let's go
ahead and knock this out we're gonna
come back and see you folks in the chat
in 3 minutes and 59 seconds so get your
questions ready here we go in 3 2
welcome to the 359 I'm Afra ring I'm
Joni Sussman I'm Shara Tipton we're a
little more than 24 hours fresh from
Apple's event in beautiful Brooklyn New
York where Tim Cook announced new iPad
pro and updates to the MacBook Air and a
new Mac Mini so let's start with the
iPad pro there's some pretty big changes
there Shara you were at the Apple event
yesterday in beautiful Brooklyn what
were some updates that we should know
about with it yeah so oh the kind of the
biggest changes that we saw in the iPads
this time was they're getting a lot of
the iPhone 10 technology so the screens
is stretching across the entire front of
the device there's no home button
anymore you use face ID the Apple pencil
was was redesigned and now instead of
charging it you know sticking it out
through the bottom of the iPad charging
plus you it like wirelessly charges it's
like yeah it's like oh great now I know
where to put this thing the way it
should have been yeah from the beginning
I saw that it's USB see now too so what
if you want to listen to music yeah I
don't know it's funny like the like
headphone fragmentation like you're the
new MacBook Air still has has a
headphone jack the new iPads don't have
a headphone jack and so it's USBC
headphones but Apple doesn't make USBC
headphones and then your iPhone is still
lightning and then there's air pods so
basically like you're carrying a lot of
stuff with you all the time it's a
dongle world out there
next up the MacBook Air now it gets an
update with touch ID and it's also $200
more the only thing I was really geeked
out about was the t2 security chip which
it has touch ID now and like it's
encrypted on that security chip and it
also disables your microphone now when
the lid is closed but I'm also a
security nerd about stuff so yeah they
finally did what everybody's been
wanting for literally years which is a
retina
display in this thing like I think we've
been I mean a cent as long as I've
covered them I've been writing like
please people want this people want this
so they finally did it you know they
have different colors - I think there's
a rose gold version you know it's then
it's light it's you know there's there's
not there aren't as many ports so you're
not gonna be able to use like an SD
cards or is a regular USB it's USB see
there is the headphone jack but yeah and
they also have the new redesigned
keyboard so we'll see how that works
because the previous ones there's been a
lot of problems with them there's been
lawsuits they're replacing all of them
basically for free if you've had issues
because if you know if one key with
their butterfly mechanism if one key
gets sticky you're kind of you have to
replace the whole thing so I don't know
if this will solve that but it'll be
interesting to see when like Dan and
people play with these I'm disappointed
and bring out the manila envelope again
Hey look how thin this is I don't really
know like like if they can even get
thinner than that I mean I I don't know
what are they what are they gonna insert
it like imitates paper yeah I mean but
then then like how do you charge it it's
you it would have to be like a
wirelessly charging charge every day is
to charge yeah yeah so I think at this
point it's probably as thin as it can be
but I think people were really really
wanting this kind of the downside is
it's more expensive than the old MacBook
Air so instead of $9.99 which is kind of
like the sweet point for like students
and businesses to you know obviously we
have them I think that $9.99 is really
great so $200 more than that it's you
know it's not insane but it's it's you
know it's it's more and then you know
the smallest news of the day the Mac
Mini getting announced that tiny
computers first update in four years now
starts at $7.99 $300 more than its
previous model and we were talking
earlier you said this was pretty much
expected from Apple that hasn't been
updated in a while and this was supposed
to be coming yeah I think people were
we're hoping for this it's you know it's
a popular computer it's kind of the
this computer you can get from Apple and
you know note it is one it is like the
last computer where you have all the
ports now there's you know there's an
Ethernet port there's regular the old
USB which right now I don't remember
what it's actually called
whatever the regular normal USB
everybody yes yeah so you know I think
this will end up being pretty popular
all right that's all the time we have
for today's show if you'd like to
adjourn check us out and see net I'm
Alfred hang I'm Johnny Salzmann I'm sure
I said Kim never thank them thank you
John for being formal and cordial none
like somebody on the show I never minded
my P's and Q's
apparently alright so as always it's
time to jump into the chat and pull out
some questions and comments from folks
who are interested in what Apple
unveiled yesterday at the big keynote I
would just want to say like I got a kind
of a kick out of their their station for
the Mac Mini how it was kind of like a
music producers booth I was like oh
that's relevant to my interests but
that's about my biggest takeaway from it
let's go ahead and take a question right
up the front from Benjamin he's asking
can the iPad pro run laptop apps know
the difference Apple has said and they
are still doing this that the iPad and
the Mac are not the same software
they're still separate software the big
difference with this iPad is a lot of
those apps that you would get on your
Mac you're gonna be able to get on the
iPad like Adobe Photoshop yeah thanks
for that right yeah it's not it's not
you know what you just have on your
computer it's for the iPad but it's not
like you can just take any any Mac app
and use it on the iPad but they're doing
a lot more with making sure that some of
these more like powerful apps work on
their tablet I completely forgot about
that when they were talking up all the
games that you can play on the iPad pro
now saying like this has better graphics
than like the Xbox one which I don't
doubt but I'm also curious like what
that does for its battery
and just essentially like who's making
all these games I mean they showed off
like NBA 2k but like I don't think
you're gonna see something like
Assassin's Creed but it was not like the
normal assassin square was like these
like little cute versions of these
adorable assassins go plan a murder but
like we also mentioned like AutoCAD for
yeah architects which is really like
it's a really intense yeah kind of
computing program that you can do on
iPad pro but it's not what you would use
if you're sitting at a computer then
there was that deejay thing which I have
like Auto tuning and beat matching for
seven different songs at once or 17
different songs or something I don't
know but yeah I mean I don't know do you
think that do you think that people that
use those programs on a Mac would want
to do the modern iPad I could see like
something like anything where you'd want
a pencil or you know like a Silas to be
able to do that I could see you wanting
to do that you know one of the things
that was kind of cool that they showed
with I think it was photoshopped was if
you you know you can zoom clear into the
pixel level to change things but then if
you like double clicked the Apple pencil
it would jump back out to the full view
and that's nice instead of having to
like you know zoom zoom in and out
constantly
I think that you know i i'm assuming
adobe has put a lot of thought and time
into what it really works on a tablet
and what works with the stylus versus
what works on a computer and you know i
think for a lot of people like using a
pencil is kind of a natural a natural
thing yeah
visually yeah yeah i've never used any
stylus on any device and what is your
experience been using pens and pencils
well on my nintendo DS play a lot of
brain age you can't really just type in
those numbers when you're doing the math
challenges so the stylus is very
important would i pay $130 for it which
is how much the Apple pencil cost no
because you can just get a Nintendo DS
for that much there you go before I move
on with relevant content there are some
people in the chat who want to know what
Alfred's costume is actually do just
dress like this every day
if you notice the pill on the back I am
Canada
yeah thank you Brian yes from the movie
Akira so that's what it is
the only one in the spirit today you
know usually I dress up too but I don't
have the energy anymore wait that's the
same to me some cat ears on the 3d
printer that was in six hours if only
for a while has been doing like if you
on Halloween some sort of promotion it
used to be you get a free burrito now
too many people have taken advantage of
that so now it's just like three dollars
instead Oh too many two people took
advantage of the three I might have to
look into this later but before then
let's take some more questions from Mike
Shaw my only question about the iPad pro
that I love is there a good solution for
editing video on the new iPad pro it
would seem logical for them to put Final
Cut on there right now we were talking
about there there's some semblance of
Adobe available on iOS but it's
restrictive right I honestly don't know
the answer to this question they don't
they only showed off Photoshop yeah on
it there's no like video editing I for
me I would make the assumption that it's
because video editing takes up a lot of
you know memory and in your processor
and you don't really have that on your
on your iPad and if that would be my
assumption though I can't say like
that's why Adobe hasn't really done
something in those terms but there's
iMovie so yeah I mean there's iMovie
there's like the Clips app yeah you know
for making stuff I mean we it doesn't
mean we won't see something I think you
know Photoshop was obviously what they
showed right away and that was probably
the focus but it's you know it's not to
say that this won't come later but I
honestly don't know what there is right
now let's just say it's not powerful and
software wise for me to do the robust
amount of editing on this show just on
the note about the the Photoshop on the
iPad 2 I feel like professionals are
very used to like hotkeys for Photoshop
where like I I know I like memorize all
this stuff to like zoom in and zoom out
that like to do that like I feel like
it'd be more frustrating and I getting
used to if the Apple pencil and things
like that with the USB see you can
connect like yeah you know you can
probably connect alright moving on from
Ricky be do they include a type c2
headphone jack dongle
oh god we're gonna get this question
till the end of time until they make a
USB I don't know if it's included yeah I
think it's on sale for nine dollars or
whatever nine or eleven dollars I do
know that Google stopped including
theirs with the pixel three yeah Apple
doesn't include the dongle with the new
iPhone yeah yeah I mean this is this is
a new one obviously so maybe they do but
I'm not sure we may not know that until
they actually one of the DJ's gonna do
now they can't listen to futures I think
it's kind of entertaining as I'm
watching in the chat how many people are
actually reveling over the design of the
new iPad they say reminds him of the
iPhone 4 similar yeah and the flat edge
sides oh yeah totally and that was what
I thought when I picked it up to like it
felt like you know it looked like the
front of an iPhone 10 but like this
sides kind of the shape of like yeah
like an iPhone 5 or the SE or whatever
they kind of it was funny how they'd
kind of gone from this like you know
kind of like not rounder but you know
just kind of like sleeker side iPad to
this one that's now kind of like
definitely like rectangular with the
sides
how come this iPad pro doesn't have a
notch where's the notch
hashtag where's the notch because they
get started they have enough space at
the door that they don't they don't need
it if the notch wasn't like a it wasn't
like a hey we really like the way the
notch loads yeah hey
we need to have a camera in here and
their knees we need someplace to put
that you know we'll be able to try out
the face ID on it at all yeah because
you have to set it up and everything
yeah set it up they don't really like I
don't know if if anyone else did I
didn't set that up so I didn't try that
when you finally got to the dimmer what
were some of the things that really
struck you when you got to touch and
feel some of these yeah I mean I was
really excited to try the MacBook Air
like I've been you know that's the
computer I've been using for a very long
time and I've needed to upgrade for a
long time as well so I've been waiting
for this and you know it was interesting
it was interesting that they don't have
touch or the touch bar all right which
do you know a lot of people have do not
love scoffed at yeah and you know and
that would have raised the price of it
as well but they were able to get touch
ID which is kind of like the best thing
of the judge bar yeah without but it but
it also is funny to me they're just like
it's so why isn't their face ID and the
Mac if if they're putting that now and
all of their other products but then
this one still has touch ID and then you
can get this one headphone here but not
here and it's just like I don't know
it's just there's just so much feels
disconnected it feels disconnected yeah
yeah from each other like part of the
same family yeah yeah it's an unhappy
family I think yeah universe that we
live in where the MacBook Air is gonna
be the last Apple product that has touch
ID they're phasing it out on all their
phones yeah like obviously the iPad new
iPad doesn't have it but there I mean
there could be a future I mean and I
don't know if they'll go to this but
we're seeing like a lot of the Android
guys going to the fingerprint readers
that are under the screen so one plus
had an event earlier this week and they
had a new phone that has it and it uses
like an optical sensor so it has a light
but then next year there's new
technology coming where it's more like
ultrasonic so it uses sound waves so
there could be something like that that
Apple is working on to bring back
something like the touch ID but they
could also just be going all in on face
ID and you know the next Mac Book Pro
update could have that you know like
let's save something a little more
Premium for bats I don't know I like the
touch ID on the MacBook I think it's
basically a built-in security key you
don't have to buy the little like USB
thing to stick it anymore and you can
use that to login instead I love that I
forget my password yeah yeah
before we move on valuable information
coming in from mark dybul Alfred you can
download an app that will give it a
notch luck what am I not surprised that
is that is exactly what I want
side notch watch that app cost like
$50.00 it's from Apple one thing I
wanted to kind of talk about is those
bezels so alright for me I don't like
I'm still kind of getting used to having
a relatively edge to edge screen on a
phone I don't like having a safe place
to hold it you know I just know it's
exact same conversation with someone
last week where I feel like bezels
almost have a place on an iPad because
you want somewhere to hold on to it
without getting finger prints over your
entire screen or accidentally triggering
something
yeah or accidentally triggering
something yeah but I wish you could put
like a no area that would would not be
touch sensitive I don't know just tap
the screen with a hammer and nail like
it should kill the phones yeah right
that's actually our new screen
durability test that we do here all
right we got a few more questions to
knock out before we call the day from
Christopher Osborn why do you think the
Apple made the USBC change on the iPad
before the iPhone I know the little
MacBook uses it but I really feel like
the iPhone would make best use of the
USBC jump well I think with iPad they're
so they're keeping it separate from
computers but they also want people to
use this as a computer and USBC lets you
do a lot of things like you can add a
lot of accessories and a lot of
peripherals and
faster it's faster and you can do a lot
of things with it I think that they'll
probably move to us BC R I mean I don't
know they maybe they never well but I
would think if they would do it it would
probably be with the next iPhone because
you have to remember this was an S year
yeah and they you know they already came
out with a bigger phone size and then
the cheaper phone and I feel like they
could be saving that for later yeah the
next generation but we were talking Star
Trek now now you have my attention you
can watch on CBS all access that way all
right here's a question from a chain at
the name can anyone tell me if you can
increase the RAM memory after purchase
in the new Mac Mini I can actually
answer this one no not without voiding
the warranty now you can go of course
and take it to the Genius Bar and have
them do it for you but there is no
friendly way to do it that won't
possibly land you in quote-unquote
trouble I'm sure there are plenty people
are more than capable of doing that
themselves but there's no nice way per
se to do it nope never will be never has
been here's a good one
what's the deal would this Mac Mini
stack isn't there a cheaper way to build
the cluster now it took me into the
process what he's talking about but this
is kind of from our friend Matthew -
he's talking about this mess right here
I thought honestly at first glance that
this was a design for the new Mac Pro no
no that but they showed you know servers
farms that are using these so yeah I
mean maybe you know you're not going to
Apple cuz it's the cheapest that is
because it's the cheapest popular yeah
yeah there's a lot of other thing
options that are cheaper out there so
it's it's you know why ever love the fat
stack of Mac minis yeah yeah it's funny
in the video they showed before they
launched it it made it look like it was
gonna be round it's kind of like a
spaceship thing and then it was like oh
no it's actually still I was like they
got me on that one I thought it was
gonna be redesigned but they really
at this same sort of design because they
do know people put these and they need
this sort of configuration alright we
are just about out of time but I want to
stage a an appropriate joke riddle on
our way out the door for for Halloween
what do you call an iPhone that isn't
kidding around dead serious
