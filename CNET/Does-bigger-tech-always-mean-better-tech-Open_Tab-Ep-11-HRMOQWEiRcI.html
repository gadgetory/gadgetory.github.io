thanks for joining us on another very
special edition of open tab I'm Jeff
Bakalar and with me this week is senior
editor Josh Goldman ladies and gentlemen
aight josh is our digital imaging and
drone editor driving editor he's a drone
editor flying things all over the office
sometimes mostly just aggression one
time he hit me in the face I needed
reconstructive surgery it was a shadow
pass anyway he's our drone guy so he
knows all about the latest and greatest
in the world of drones and 360 cameras
and all that junk so if we have a
question stop what you're doing and type
type it out in a little comment section
below and we'll get it to Josh when we
can so we're going to have mike
sorrentino here he's going to be
monitoring the chat room I'm money in
the chat room I am NOT playing runescape
or playing games like minecraft like
seven people to chat thought last week I
am absolutely here watching your youtube
chat which is going right now and we'll
get your questions into the show today
okay we also have Joey in the control
room he's doing something with the
teleprompter not well but he's doing
something ah this week's umbrella topic
is whether or not we want big things big
things big this week what's that big
tech big tect large tech tech you can't
fit in your pocket you can only fit in
your trunk like the samsung galaxy note
7 that was released earlier this week
and there's all kinds of larger tech
rigs coming in and have the office all
the time but let's start with this game
of drugs game addo would be like that
Gary sure you're like some one ever said
if you feel like someone's done that
power so Josh thanks for being here sure
what are the differences between a large
drone like the Phantom
and one of these rinky-dink I found this
in a cracker jack box drone what is the
difference obviously the size that goes
without saying covered sighs all ready
yet but what like if I really missing
out on something cool by just having
this little little guy here um it all
depends on what you want to do with your
drone so I yeah what do I want to do
with my flying around your living room
hitting your cat in the head that's the
one you want right so so pet abuse yes
this is mainly used well I mean that in
child abuse all I cackles the same as
well of course just scare all the castle
a address yes but that one's it was a
toy no camera on that one right and that
one in particular is made to roll up
walls or also just fly okay that's cool
that's an interesting design like that
so you got ones like that that are tiny
and don't don't do all that much right
and then you move up and you got other
ones like I got this one here okay that
one there what's this um that is the sky
Viper sky Viper snakes can't fly uh v
2400 HD should is it is a HEA you plug
it in us i can do anything okay um but
my blink anyway that one's got a camera
flies up in the air that's a little bit
more outdoorsy ok you fly that around
your yard flight around your house too
depending on size of your house I guess
right so what am I getting with like you
know everyone sees these vlogs and
everybody there rocking that phantom
right so things a lot of money the fam
yeah it's a lot of money because it has
a lot more tech in it yeah it's got a
much better camera stabilization for
indoors okay so that you can fly it and
you don't need normally you would need
GPS signal outdoors in order to keep it
hovering in place and not just flying
off so that's what you get with like the
Phantom's you get better stabilisation
better features ability to set it up and
fly a flight path are they harder to fly
uh no actually they
be easier to fly bigger than has your it
is the fun well I mean here this one is
big but it's essentially a toy um it
doesn't have I don't know if they can
see no oh yeah they could see that so
that thing look at this you got that it
this is essentially toy it's it's a
larger drone it comes with a HD camera
on it okay um but it doesn't it's not
just not gonna fit Steve yahoo
stabilization right it's not going to
stabilize the cameras fixed so you can't
do it you can't like pan and tilt it
right it's algo para on there and no
this is cozy mike is a fake ass go pro
baseball no I that keeps in the toy
realm when it's not a full-fledged
camera well no I mean it's a
full-fledged camera but I mean that is
not it's a full pro it's not a great
quality ilike that it's a faux pho pro
there you go pro pro pro i'm just gonna
wear this on my face the rest i like
that but again this doesn't have GPS in
it although it's the same nearly the
same size as a phantom yeah have gps ray
doesn't have anything that doesn't have
like the fans you know everything does
already it doesn't really the phantom 4
is got like collision avoidance system
really yeah how's it do that it's got
sensors in front so that just got
airbags basically I airbags not yet yet
virtual airbags maybe does it have a
parachute no it does not there are
drones a parachute there are well there
are drones that you can attach
parachutes to that they will if I have a
phantom phantoms are like 1,500 bucks
right uh not really we that mean that
highest end 10 K 13 yet so 30 I'm
putting a parachute on my $39 drone okay
you're just like falls out of the sky
I'd like it well ideally shouldn't users
all out of the sky yeah I guess now so
like how does that I do have do drones
have like fail-safes that prevent them
from falling out of this guy because I
feel like what if the battery craps out
well I mean yeah the whole idea with the
Phantom's is that's constantly giving
you feedback on the on what's going on
with its flight okay so if the battery
starts to get low it's telling you that
your battery's getting low you don't
have to worry about that so this is a
great episode because i don't i don't
know
we're searching for the curse word I was
gonna say different word but then I
realize where we were we already have by
the way ROG in our chat wondering if any
of these chats can be any of these
drones can be used for covert operations
Wohlford a word he used is first he said
stalking then he said area 51 what which
is a little ridiculous but all right
joins in general are pretty noisy aren't
they yeah they're loud I can you can fly
one two hundred feet up and still hear
it really yeah they're not they're not
quiet that's why and besides they all
gather a helicopter yeah and for the
most part they all have really wide
angle lenses on them as you know go
further away with a wide angle lens the
things in the get smaller and smaller
it's not like they have all zoom lens
sure you can fly up 200 feet and then
sure you know zoom in on somebody okay
and if you're flying twenty feet above
somebody shooting them in their backyard
pool you know then there they're gonna
know but they're gonna know they're
gonna be like Oh someone's creeping out
and they're gonna take a broom and knock
it down and then probably point maybe
with a shotgun like I've read to ya sir
okay so do we have to register like
which what kind of drones do I need to
register if I live in the US so it's not
the drone you're registering your you're
registering yourself as a drone owner a
drone er a drone er don't think that's a
thing but now it is we coined it here so
anything basically any drone over point
five five pounds so anything over a half
a pound you you have to register with
the FAA why why is it a weight thing um
oh I guess because because if it falls
from the sky or flies into somebody I
guess right I don't know that's just
what they went with this is over this is
probably a pound that feels heavy yes so
so yeah you probably in order to fly
that you'd have to register yourself
with the FAA and throw um you have to
throw your you get a little number right
a registration number you throw there on
the drone or oh really okay just
something fixed inside the drone you can
like put it in the battery cash or
whatever Kenan wants us to fly the drone
but that would not work out well in this
small studio Oh living room no I feel
like we could do we could do it
do you want to just you go for it yeah
okay can this guy know why not that guy
because we as one might knock over every
started up but you're gonna do some
damage with this all right I've seen you
fly friend what do I do power on no
don't do it totoo that would let's do it
tiny shiny ass but tiny one with the
cage on it yeah the one with the UH with
the so go ahead turn it on okay I'm
gonna activate this little there we go
put it down the floor on the floor yeah
put on the floor all right mohabbat is
specializing that it's a quadcopter not
a drone is there a major difference uh
so yeah it's a common thing with with
the people who want to argue such things
ya know technically I guess it's not a
drone what you do I hit the button way
you weren't supposed to hit any buttons
you just must take off and on this
weekend you have you have a lot of
buzzing oh so how does this work how do
I take off um huh how do I don't know
now ok let's do I hit buttons it's not
moving Oh drones up oh ok there it goes
what happened oh hey you know the hang
of the the ball there is kind of great
alright well it was gone now and that's
the story of drones basically you fly
them until they disappear into a tree
right I do so anyway don't find a live
show wait what you were saying what was
the question you had a quadcopter oh
right quadcopter drone yes technically
it's a quadcopter multi-rotor UAV
whatever you want to call it the
basically everybody decided to call it a
drone and for marketing purposes drone
works really well d yeah you know as
opposed to UAV would you have to explain
everything that's like more of like a
militaristic thing yeah but I mean I
don't know I it's there all their drones
so they're all entertainer changeable
terminology yeah
and I don't know that oh look some le
came back to us he came back in when I
got him so you get it down okay I'll put
it to Eleanor fly from here oh boy I
guess man the bouncing part is kind of
great is there I'm venez commenting he
hates a short flight time with these toy
drones do you find that with some of
them yeah that's all of them oh they're
all basic little mosquito it's like a
little redic well now it's stuck okay
well and this is why we don't fly I'll
get fair enough but you mark I have
another anyway wait no wait we for your
quest you sure don't answer the person
square short battery life alright short
battery life so these are all all the
toy ones is it nodes it's doing stuff
yeah it's upset battery life shut that
off okay anyway uh yeah the little ones
they all last anywhere from five to
eight minutes which is nothing no and a
lot of them I mean it all depends on the
model this one's got a removable battery
some of them don't I i go for the ones
with removable batteries because they
tend to be inexpensive sure anyway so
maybe canary a couple with you yeah so
you get like 20 minutes of flight okay
instead of five I mean that's the that's
the main problem with a lot on show so
if you want to fly a drone like flying a
kite probably gonna have if you had the
ability to have multiple batteries oh
boy yeah sorry Jaffa whoa this thing
this is a lot of fun this one's a lot of
fun it goes it goes it's crazy yeah can
you charge them off a like a battery
pack like with Yale phone absolutely um
it's totally doable Joe where are you
with the camera oh I'm doing real good
with this guy there see so when you lose
Michael actually have you already flies
Oh sexy oh my god that's awesome who
catches their own drone this one's fun
man can I have it after after I'm done
with you
yes well there you go this is like chili
ah prepares oh I'm sorry I've roediger
if somebody wants a toy drone versus
professional John what do you think is
the the the the customer level who who
would want what uh I think in general
most people want both mmm um the toy
ones are nice because they're cheap yeah
it also helps you learn how to fly
without blowing a thousand bucks and
crashing it into a tree totally benaam
you've you've crashed it bit me maybe
maybe wasn't mine Oh somebody else we
will have to talk about that well fine
um yeah you can get one I think this
this one in front of us is like a 100
hundred dollars okay so you get that you
fly that around park for a little bit
and you realize okay I'm ready to move
up to something more serious and flying
this one is a lot more like we said
earlier it's a lot more difficult to fly
a phantom because those do just about
the they're so stable and can fly
themselves basically right and they're
there you know as far as Jones go there
they're really sore quad copters
quadcopters there too right mmm they're
easy to set up and start flying right
away as long as you said somewhat
detected tech-savvy okay fair enough um
I've seen this personally myself I've
seen drones show up in places that it
feels like they're not supposed to be
like an outdoor concert I saw him at
fireworks yeah alright that seems stupid
to ya that's to me that's dumber than
the concert because fireworks I feel
like you can get hurt or hurt somebody
or maybe you can hurt somebody to
constitute well what's up shooting the
fireworks of course those legs into them
seems silly but is it I feel like we're
in a very weird time when it comes to
drones and the legality of drones and
can I a drone at a concert what are the
legal ramifications I know you don't
necessarily know
how many years I'm gonna do and I like
to actually how does that work like is
it okay like what are you allowed to do
what are you not allowed to do um you're
not allowed to fly over people no I mean
in general yeah you're not supposed to
fly over crowds you're not supposed to
go to stadiums right the FAA puts out
you know bulletins with no fly
restrictions so if there's a stadium
you're not supposed to be flying over a
stadium um while back somebody crashed a
drone at the US Open like crash into the
stand that's not quite it's not cool
you're not supposed to do that so they
got in trouble yeah yeah and I mean if
you have permission to fly over the
event then yeah if you're part of the
film crew then right recording me of
course and yeah you're allowed you know
but um yeah some somebody just off the
street me you shouldn't be flying over
so I guess the good rule of thumb is if
you're not sure odds are it's probably a
bad idea yeah it will in general a lot
of a lot of things that we you know here
I'm is that they're just generally bad
ideas right you know that's what makes
it so like why am I getting a drone am I
getting a drone to get like really cool
aerial shots of something am I getting a
drunk just to fly I've seen like drone
racing is right and so that yeah like
that's completely different we've been
talking about the camera drones right
order that toy drones but yeah there's
also the racing drones which are all fpv
and you know you put on the goggles and
you that's cool fly through the goggles
we did that around the office yeah real
quick right yeah so all right I want to
bring up my favorite subject that I know
you have a very strong opinion on when
it comes to Drew Josh how soon are we
gonna get drone delivery from amazon.com
how soon is my box of high choose that I
ordered what's up what hi chew chewing
the candies I don't know hide you know
me right I have never heard of those
that sound cheery no not big league chew
as my producer Brian just said I'm
talking hi choose their little little
candies that they're like green apple is
there Jolly Ranchers nope they're chewy
they're gummies their gum
they're the best candy ever I've ensure
the chat room agrees with me chef's you
got great you guys know what high shoes
are let us know right h I dash chuh hi
chu best that that's that's Japanese for
best candy ever yeah would even
seriously though what do we is drone
delivery a real thing uh I'm sure it's a
real thing I just don't don't
necessarily understand why that's the
thing that because of Europe there are
so many good reasons to have drones
there are so many good things I can do
from agriculture to inspection to you
know to even you know how many
helicopters have crashed over the years
shooting a movie where's can do it for
half the cost in no lives at risk so I
mean to have your package in 30 minutes
or less okay fine I get it I don't need
it I don't need my 12 pack of boxers to
get here in 20 seconds I don't know but
I don't know how badly I need new
underwear exactly but what a but what
about like human organ delivery yeah so
for that it makes sense that I mean
delivery of that nature delivering I
they had a test where they flew they had
the first ship to shore delivery of
medication right delivering food to
people who are stranded on a mountain or
something like that that that makes
sense supplies listen we get a chopper
they're exactly the phantom there yeah
well they're not gonna send a phantom
but they'll send something else higher
Harry oh yeah it can carry a load as it
is full yeah that stuff is getting my
package from amazon three minutes
doesn't doesn't show me be honest tell
the world stop with drone delivery no
I'm not boring on so stop I mean I just
don't see the fascination that's all
that's me though I don't write but like
and and let's think about it practically
right you gonna live in a world where
like 75,000 drones are taking up the sky
and just delivering yes socks perhaps
people you know
in 30 minutes there's like you know you
could just wait till the next day this
is your footage we're looking at here
right this amazing drone footage you've
taken is it yes possible yes man you you
know how to fly a drone man look at that
then in our chats warning if you think
we'll end up in drone cabs like
self-driving cars that can be sweet and
a few other people know what the candy
we talked about are the it's like
starburst or square candy it's like
starburst but not crappy this isn't mine
this is uh Andy's it's really good Oh
Josh wants to know how much a phantom
would be the fan room for like I don't
know you're on the Internet okay like
before I want to say cuz I've been
looking around not that I'm gonna I want
to see 1315 bantam for ya that's a lot
of money it's like it's one of the
higher end ones right it is one of that
well I mean yeah MSRP about fourteen
hundred dollars okay so a lot of money
is spent on your funny-looking
helicopter um so but the thing is is
that there's a phantom right there yeah
so there you go that's the thing that's
cool ya know I think they're great
people should buy them if they have
someplace to fly them we has always been
my problem in Jersey there's just really
state parks are off-limits I think
that's a big thing is that before you go
out and sink a thousand bucks make sure
you got some place to fly totally if you
live near a big city odds are you're not
gonna have a lot of choices or options
for flying yeah so just I would do that
first I mean look josh has already been
in jail seven times since he started
reviewing drones no but mark will tell
you we got chased off by by county
county troopers oh that's right um so
yeah it's um it's real it's real
struggles real everybody ah Mike we have
some shoutouts to give to our live
viewers here yeah thank you guys so much
for being a part of our chat today a
couple shoutouts over to Charles wants
me to say hello hi chuck chuck would see
a tech pimp said the four we wanted to
talk about phones which talk about later
but high ranks for joining us
we also had Josh slicing her from our
last question Brandon Prince lemonade
had worked really hard to watch our
street he was having some technical
issues so I'll royalty have your house
Prince 78 and then M gave us a couple
questions as well as 0 nce oh there's a
little bit of a fight going on in the
chat people are being like Oh Mike the
laptop guys so bad so bad stop talking
bad things of how this one person said
so thank you let's see in my know we
were we're not doing live chat expecting
it would be nice get a life nerds but we
want your questions so please keep
talking I don't really care less our
comment from last week we're making fun
of my red shirts so hard there are two
things wrong with your red shirt yeah
now we're on the internet fun even is
wrong Oh get off the inner you hiding
into that catch me maybe I blended into
the background you were just exploding
head perhaps um Oh said that what it was
they're calling me your star trek Eric
maybe that's a compliment though I said
Richards always die ooh oh if you heard
that apparently red shirts always die I
don't know that man is recording our
track Oh guys I know we're like CBS I
don't know I don't know dick about Star
Trek Jones with children says Raj what
Raj would like a drone with a helium
balloon powered by solar using it as
free Wi-Fi as Google lumen project
rather need more people we asked
whatever that is I mean free free Wi-Fi
is always well it don't know for
whatever I like the way you think Raj
yeah um all right I think we're gonna
take a break all right right we're gonna
take a break we're going to watch a
video the new app there's new apple
store at the World Trade Center in that
ridiculous looking I kill this thing
they built down there stay tuned more
open tab coming right at you fade to
black
it was just a few weeks ago we were in
Williamsburg at the opening of apples
very first Brooklyn store today we're in
downtown Manhattan at another apple
store grand opening this time under the
majestic oculus that looks down over the
world trade center transit and shopping
hub technically part of something called
the Westfield Shopping Center the
upscale stores here or more Soho than
shopping mall and this new apple store
has a lot of the updated features apple
is rolling out across its retail
locations including an informal seating
area called the forum with wooden cubes
and a giant hi-res screen and avenues
along the walls of the store where you
can browse a different categories try on
watch straps and phone cases and if you
like them just find them in a drawer or
on a shelf right there and of course
like any apple store grand opening hi
you've got me know they've lined up to
clap and cheer enthusiastically for the
first customers to get welcomed in with
a t-shape
yeah welcome back see you nuts open tab
at the top of the show we mentioned
Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 that's the
company's latest large screen phone and
we're going to run through a number of
bigger devices that are completely real
and in the news this past week and go
over what we think of those so first
with the galaxy note 7 who our own
colleague Jessica dulko dull court
reviewed this week here's what's going
on inside the galaxy note 7 it's got a
5.7 inch curved screen it runs Android
marshmallow come on we all know nougats
new hotness 64 gigabyte agree days away
from nougat I'm sad well I think nougats
next week isn't it I can I guess it
should i do get on it look let's get
that out of the way it should have
nougat on it legally announcement will
but it's just not a who knows when 64
gigs of storage iris scanning that will
scan your eyeball so you can unlock the
phone because that's the thing we all
want an S Pen Stylus water-resistant for
30 minutes in five feet of water and it
starts at the low low price of 850
dollars my god since it's a phone big
big costly expensive phone what do you
guys think about the galaxy note 7 so
personally I'm not into big phones not
really i have an iphone SE cuz i wanted
that exact shape i really really like
having a 4-inch iphone so that when I'm
on the subway or a train I could hold it
with my one hand and not get robbed by
somebody ranking it out of my hand is
that a thing I feel like that's a thing
maybe I'm paranoid I think you are but I
mean you don't yeah but I wanted to take
damage from paranoia I wanted a better
processor but I Scott in our office had
the phone and I held it and it has a
real good grip to it because of its
curved screen okay so even though it's
like a five point eight inch screen I
could actually
see myself holding it right and this is
a year about is if I think it's 5.8 that
has this a five-point let me convert all
the juices um this is a 5.7 mm hmm it's
manageable i also have freakishly large
hands at CS 6 inch that's the six edge
here yeah there's a 6m so the but the
note is significantly larger than that
the note was it's a just a little bit
larger than that but it didn't feel that
way somehow and has the pen inside but
on the whole I prefer I wish more
smaller phones were out with better
specs more and more like reasonable
phone sizes appear to be like getting
the shaft in terms of features sure but
they'll be lower in costs but maybe I
want to watch a 1080p movie on a
four-inch phone I know nobody else does
but I would like to yeah but you you
don't need to watch a 1080p movie on a 4
inch from like you would you could get
away with watching like a 360p movie but
do you know I mean like what what do you
guys know I'm just I mean I get away
from it but like there's still a color
gamut thing going on where it just looks
a little better but you can tell
somebody huh let him have his full i
jest oh I'm not trying to I'm not trying
to like crap on it you are again but you
are you are so alright I guess I
understand what you're saying but like
going back to the notion of like big
tech like yeah it seemed like we were
going in one complete you know up over
the top sort of like phablet direction
for a while and now I don't think what
you want out of a phone is uncommon I do
think people want something that's not
as gigantic as 5.7 enough this thing I
have a hard time with what that's yours
no this is well it's it's our house
iphone that we I do camera testing stuff
right and that's a 6 plus this is a 6
plus yeah success plus 6s plus and yeah
it's just it's i mean i've got big hands
in that yeah it's uncomfortable to use
so but like my point is also this and i
guess like this is maybe a crappy sort
of comparison but like these are pretty
i guess these are pretty much the same
size right yeah they do but the green
looks a little bit my screen might be a
little bigger hmm that's not all
yeah and that's all it is the topic of
today's show is your bigger is better
except for Michael dough yeah never mind
so I guess what is your us what do you
like about having a larger phone what's
the fun that you have again I have a
nexus 6p um I I like it a great deal i
also wish like I know before this I had
an LG g3 which had the same screen size
but wasn't as tall it's like for me you
got to figure out a way to like make the
edge to edge as a sort of tiny as
possible like I want I don't want any of
I don't want any of the front of the
phone to be wasted on like this part the
white part I know that's asking a lot
but uh but that's for me like that's the
next day or is it it's pretty much one
to one like there's a lot of like space
up here that I'm pissed off about so Raj
jumped in in our chat saying that I say
this time a phone company should put
their money on R&amp;amp;D on batteries make
super capacitor batteries smaller in
size so I Got News for a better life
that is what everyone is working on
everyone wants to figure out a way to
improve battery life to me that is the
next big technological Renaissance that
we will hit is like amazing battery life
and we're just not there yet and that's
why the Apple iWatch to that's coming
out I don't think is really going to
impress anyone you know they're talking
about rumors about the watch was
supposed to have a cellular connection
independent from an iphone and now
that's probably not going to happen so
it's battery thing will get there we're
just not there yet and a few chatters
Quincy Brandon and Oscar are talking
about the iris scanner that's in the
galaxy note 7 which is that's it's I
believe new for samsung in that phone
yes one of them saying that people would
like it if it's on iphone I'm creeped
out by iris scanning in general I don't
like the term iris scanning Irish
scanning implies that i need to like
well do this let's do that let's come up
with an apple name for iris scanning
because i'm sure they'll have i scan
that's what golly oh no that's a local
know like when you put the word iris in
it just implies
something clockwork orangey and I don't
want to do that just call it something
else just caught like a pupil looker I
don't know just don't call it iris
baluchre people look here that's
terrible yeah alright let's move along
Josh you recently reviewed the GoPro
Omni 360 it's a $59 rig that assembles
together six cameras to take immersive
video and if you don't have the cameras
it costs five thousand dollars to get it
all in one package what did you think of
this gigantic GoPro omni mr. Goldman uh
it's it's not gigantic okay it's no
that's right it's actually like yeah
it's manageable you can see it does yeah
you see it on the baby it's like the Sun
it's like what would you describe the
size that it slightly did cantaloupe
can't Oh perfect I can totally relate
myron kandel oh ok yeah I'm important
anyway uh yeah so uh I didn't review it
we got a demo of it okay which was great
because we got to see but you know can
demo oh my god so like look at the thing
that's giving you this yeah so it is
pretty incredible because it's got six
cameras and written it's getting all
that and it gives you a resolution up to
8 k Wow not that you need that for most
things anything 4k is nice so does that
it's just it's it's really streamlined
I'd say that instead of worms of like
stitching all that stuff together yeah
so I mean it's a complete product unlike
where they've had mounts that you can
slap the GoPro cameras you're sort of on
your own exactly once you get through
that this keeps all the cameras
synchronized so you're not going in and
like clapping before you start rolling
or you know be so you know where you
have to start editing right or anything
how does it do that it's all day all
plug into the inside of the mount and go
pro allows for like a sort of universal
tethering thing down well let's go pros
rig got it so it's a came up with it
yeah so they designed it it's all really
cool all the stuff synced together you
press you have one master camera right
and you turn that one on all the other
ones come on you pressed record all the
all of them start recording at the same
time right pretty cool yeah no it's
great now
how much is this it's $1,500 oh right we
have you read that part I did I hit and
five grand if you don't have the GoPros
well I mean that five grand all in
package comes with software the color
software that is used for merging
everything together and editing it so
you get the color auto panel software
you get the rig you get the cameras you
get micro SD cards right card readers
they say is that you yeah you get an
external battery get this whole case
that it comes in right it's I added it
up and it's over five thousand dollars
okay so but hopefully someone brings it
to space or your water and I could have
like an immersive underground space well
I wouldn't have that in space yet they
have an underwater rate because there is
there are water shots of it being you
gotcha um I don't know can't do anything
for you right so 15 things you figure
out the space thing 1505 a lot of money
is there a cheaper more affordable way
to get 360 video yes oh it will not be
as good as what comes out of those go
well it's made for professionals sure
it's and that's a nobody should confuse
that as a as a you know consumer or even
a prosumer rig yeah this is it's firmer
super hyah yeah it's for its for
somebody who really wants to produce 360
video right if you want to just mess
around with it yeah there are options
that are ready there for you oh you have
some of them here to just show us real
quick like a cheaper 360 video thing
what's that that iphone edition where
what happened yet I stole it alright so
I don't know he's the camera yeah so
this is the insta 316 a no it's
unfortunately only really good for
iphone users so I'm out of luck with a
galaxy but we've got the galaxy 360 are
the gear 360 anyway but what this is
it's got the little lightning adapter in
the bottom and then you just pop it in
and hopefully it'll come to life
takes a second pop that in and then the
the phone we go launches from 360 really
that's right now even though none of the
lens are directly facing me technically
that's really cool what are you doing oh
he just pull out there oh nice okay oh
right yes I'm gonna put on the front of
my skateboard or that or the drug that
upsets me all these weekend I mean you
can use it handheld yeah it's really
cool though it's like look without the
iphone you have to turn the iphone
upside down so the lock word for what
it's worth man that's impressive like
it's it is and it's only 200 bucks so
that if you just want to mess around and
and share some cool 360 stuff with your
friends right this is totally a good way
to go if you're looking for something
really you want to get in 360 editing
and stuff like shut you're not going to
mess around with this so what do you
think man is 360 here to stay do people
really want that I think so actually had
this conversation earlier today even the
thing of it is is that compared to a lot
of people compared to 3d like when I
like Oh everybody was like let's shove
in 3d down our throats yeah so that
didn't really pan out I think the big
difference is you don't need glasses to
enjoy this right there's no yes you can
throw it in your VR goggles and enjoy it
that way but you and me you're just
sitting here watching 360 on the phone
and you can do it on any phone or tablet
and YouTube has like a sole recipient
claim to Brannigan and Facebook so yeah
they it's just it's there it's it's it's
whatever sharing yeah yeah so in yeah
still in our hand over my phone to
people and I show him a 360 video
they're super impressed with it they
don't care about the image quality right
the image quality for the consumer ones
is pretty bad at this point I mean some
are better than others but yeah it'll
get better all right right now it's
pretty much a play with it donor don't
don't expect great things from it but
play with it very good very informative
we're going to move on to our last story
of the day / week
pepper the robot is a four foot high
customer man four foot for foot high but
it's not a four foot high customer oh no
no it's a four foot high customer
customer service it's not like a four
foot person who's really hot it knows
now stone for foot person let's just get
that out of the way ok so this four-foot
tall customer service robots spent last
week greeting customers at the be eight
ta Tek store in San Francisco the robot
is programmed to talk with customers
follow voice commands and read human
emotions to judge how to react to bed
every time I look at this thing I want
to run away in fear so what's the deal
with this robot do we know anything more
about it it I don't like the way it
looks it looks like it's like scared of
me and humans and I would imagine
walking into a Walmart or summer
department store and this is what you'll
see and this past week in San Francisco
that text or that's what was happening
so sure what was the reaction like I
know Lexi's there what did she say about
it uh I did more but the video I saw
only explained it what it does and that
it's able to gauge human reaction and so
if it was really awkward is that it was
gyrating jar presumably if it senses
you're angry maybe a little dance to try
to calm you down or directly out of the
door I don't know how I don't wind up
kicking I once worked at Macy's for
holiday help yeah and there were
definitely a couple times where you
wanted a rowboat you wish I could deal
with people a robot could have like I
could have folded the clothes when the
robot would have talked to a couple of
people write the robots got endless
amounts of patient or the other way
around I guess the robot could fold the
clothes that I could deal with the
people right okay all right especially
they like high stress levels high stress
high levels of stressful holiday
shopping right the UH but it's
interesting to see how more my robots
could take over jobs more anymore it's
interesting and I guess cosmically
depressing mmm because im sue well
it not I know this is not a serious show
but I think like 15 20 years from now we
might be in a little bit of trouble I
believe we had a conversation prior to a
starting where maybe you would have
liked to have had a robot at the counter
yeah yes exactly maybe robot could work
on the mail that's failing yeah humans
can't be trusted sometimes robots got a
bit maybe robot would have known where
your package may be a robot would've
lost my package after I handed it to him
on it it imagine telling a robot that it
will robot waiter waitress that it got
your order wrong I'm sorry the meat
isn't cooked well enough let me take it
back or just like allow me to zap it
with my break or something like that
that's a different future all right I
keep getting it mixed up yet hey Mike do
we have any other comments in the chat
yeah a few little commenting on the
robot bryan said it reminds him of the
Jetsons yeah Ozzy Scott you are already
out yeah um Oscar so many jobs have been
lost attack a few other people had to
non related questions to robots though
do what I wanted to hear every anything
you know about the Nintendo NX and that
person wanted to thinks that there's a
virtual reality possibility with it but
I haven't heard any groom your guess is
as good as anybody's because no one
really knows a whole lot about that
thing it's probably going to be a tablet
with control with detachable controllers
as some part of it that's really all we
know that's the only thing that's been
widely speculated antenna keeps things
very private and secretive so you can
pretty much guess anything and have it
not sound crazy and then a doctor's you
want to weigh in no you don't have you
know you made a joke you bitch tell me
you're gonna sit there and not have an
opinion on the nintendo ln x ah my dirty
secret is I don't gain that's not dirty
at all what's next the Neil wants to
know if we've heard anything about any
other windows phones this year and I how
long has been was then i can't pronounce
the name correctly unfortunately video
thats of
okay how long have you worked for
Microsoft no I don't know windows phones
are not popular we don't we review them
I've never used one have you ever used
one Josh no no I mean no I'm not as you
aisle yeah I have you what are they like
it's kind of like using a zune in that
as using it as a music player music app
was actually quite great sure it would
sort things out had a really good
graphical interface but ultimately apps
just weren't there yeah I'm a went
really well I'm not trying to hate on
windows phone but like you understand
where we're coming from when we say like
nobody uses that nobody I don't think
there's a huge market in this country
but other countries hours okay there's
people at bottom me personally I don't
know much about them I don't know what's
coming out they're not exactly a crowd
pleaser well I mean they all had at
least some of the Nokia ones had good
cameras in him they did there was that
one with like the 58 megabit was 0 for 4
whatever that was it a 40 what was it I
remember I have something like that
anything else they might then back to
the nes nintendo via actor going an ex
baby mr. Biden exercise if the gamecube
comes back with the nes a freak out like
if there was a gamecube mini that would
be amazing good night was pretty small
if it gave me it was like what this big
it was like the size of the omni thing
yeah it was small I think was tiny what
there's oh they're saying like back I
mean yeah I would like some of those
came cute games to come back like
eternal darkness I was yeah if there's
something package with may be eternal
darkness mario kart Luigi's Mansion this
is one of the Zelda's that could be a
solid thing but if they are doing the
NES first right so they're gonna do I
like you would you would imagine they'll
do a mini SNES you know plug-and-play
sort of thing maybe a 64 I think that
any s 1 is going to kill it this holiday
season is there a PlayStation version of
one of those things riginal playstation
one that's like sanctioned by them
there's just probably I'm sure it's all
layers are probably rip off but maybe
like if the Nintendo does well wait six
months and then there'll be a little
PlayStation device like so the show
think about it like this they'll they'll
release that
mini nes it'll sell what it does i think
it'll do really well then come out i'm
already in line for one totally then
they'll come out with one that has 30
different games on it and it'll be like
blue or whatever that's what they're
going to do and i would imagine SNES
makes its way and maybe we get all the
way up to gamecube i don't know gamecube
though that I mean like that's still
slightly complicated I don't know a lot
of data there to an NES game is like 800
k yeah we're like a gamecube games a
couple kegs yeah and then the chats
pivoting spivey where we'll close out
the Amazon phone is what they're talking
about now but they just talk about
whether they like our funding like yeah
the fire phone that a boy android I
think because we were talking about
windows and then the shadow right there
I remember playing with that thing and
just being like oh this is bad but it
had some cool ideas I remember that
because had all the cameras all over it
yeah cool on paper cuz I had like a
stereoscopic 3d effects by watching your
eyes and face yeah yeah and your 3d yeah
3d on your phone oh well Joey had a 3d
phone yeah Joey buys everything um
that's going to do it for us guys thank
