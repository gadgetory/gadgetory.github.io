innings fun we got you back we got you
back yeah
a technology take one line yeah no
kidding your stance / sorry sorry I
talked about prime rib and ruin the show
it happens to the best of us so where
are we at are we all introduced yeah
we're good okay great um so now that
we've got zombie and prime rib out of
our system which we can focus on the
arts and the sciences uh we're going to
get a little culture today but because
this is the crave cast it's gonna be a
little bit twisted so we'll talk acha
Shakespeare Star Wars the failing of
grant but either failed to take coal old
Oh God there yes okay yes you ready Mark
Zuckerberg and plant its poop literally
I love although posted I love it when
you talk eric is it does actually
exactly so frizzy it's disturbing it's
like a Cylon rap and I'm kind of like
trying to think of what music would go
well with this so anyone out there in
the chat room if you've got some music
suggestions maybe we'll do a remix of
this later into a wrap it's all going to
be arts and culture no matter what we do
so even our mess-ups can be turned into
art this is all art this isn't art
installation called frozen now we'll
just have to let it go oh no that's
earworm okay so listen who wants to take
away I turned off my video okay oh this
is real great right yeah now you're a
disembodied voice just like how I I
turned off I turned off my video can you
hear me now yeah it's much better yeah
okay so I turned off my video so why
don't you just take it away with the the
Star Wars meet Shakespeare story there
Bonnie I was you know I purposely was
trying to bring in the book and recite
some but I'm I am I ambach pentameter
'he's a little rusty so i didn't want to
ruin Shakespeare for everyone but
basically there's these it's a series of
books from quirk books and it's Star
Wars reimagined as Shakespeare plays so
so far they already got their original
trilogy out of the way so those are
available right now you can get those at
your fine booksellers your mom and pop
bookstores or wherever you choose to
shop for books but the most recent one
and we always
the cover reveal because quirk books
love cnet they love crave so they gave
us the cover reveal for the Phantom
Menace so now they're hitting the
prequels um and from what I can tell
from the description of the book and
from what I've been given like samples
and such it's going to be kind of like
Romeo and Juliet so Anakin and padm√©
are Romeo and Juliet in this and but
it's it's you know that Threepio
Threepio were fourth out there Threepio
was their tagline which is great cuz
when you think about c-3po kind of
sounds like he's already in a
Shakespearean play uh it's that lovely
whiny British uh which I love in
Shakespeare it-it's you know when you
can be sorry I don't know go ahead the
structure is very similar yeah there's
the high plateau plan there any when you
break down Star Wars it's very
Shakespearean there's tragedy there's
the two jesters which I guess would be
consider c-3po and r2d2 there are
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern of star
wars in a way the moon is my mother this
stuff is my father what is my shoe yeah
it looks you English degree kicking in
my thermometer where is my dad um so
anyway these are great books have great
illustrations inside of them as well and
and in a way you know I feel like
classes like in high school maybe this
would be a great way to get kids
interested like a gateway drug into
Shakespeare because everything is in
iambic pentameter everything is very
classically written as a Shakespeare
play in those books and they're going to
do all the prequels I don't know if
they're going to hit the Clone Wars I
think that would be great obviously we
have more Star Wars movies coming our
way so that means more Shakespeare
coming our way I personally would love
the holidays special mention here
talking a tragedy man a tragedy yeah I
would love to see that but I I think I
may be the only one voting for that I
have to do a change org position to get
that we've done but we'll see so I think
the Phantom of men discover is gorgeous
with the Elizabethan rough and keeping
with the stuff she wears in the movie
what is this rumor about um the samuel l
jackson part of it Oh apparently his
character is pretty fun to read yeah
I've heard that I haven't I haven't read
the book yet because it's not in my hot
little hands but it is I i do believe
his mace windu is hilarious
I'm excited to read these books and
actually I'm excited to see cosplay from
these books I would love to see some
Star Wars cosplayers do cosplay costumes
of these covers so do check them out we
have stories about all of the books on
cnet com and we also have the book
trailer for the original trilogy
Shakespeare where they actually do a
Shakespearean play excerpt from it in
shakespearean garb and it's it's
hilarious so do check it out the the
author's online to indo i can't
pronounce his last name is like dough
sure sure i'm so sorry and but he's on
twitter as well so you can always like
attack him on Twitter and say hey you
should do holiday special for Bonnie and
quirk books is great for all that stuff
and hopefully they'll do some giveaways
and promotions so if you're following
quirk books on Twitter that's a good way
to find out about more of their books
but anyway so that's coming I think it's
coming out i want to say august by could
be wrong it's april ok so i knew was in
a month um so that's kind of good
inviting jam i defied in chance so it is
coming out soon so do you check it out
ah and yeah I love that I mean there's a
thing without star wars there's Star
Wars stuff everywhere there's Star Wars
fandom and everything you could think of
and it was just only a matter of time
before Shakespeare got hit so yay thanks
quirk books thanks for making me feel
cultured while reading about droids in
the desert speaking I am back pentameter
ok so I have an update i think eric is
restarting he's restarting his computer
calling us back that's like his theme
song now like how you aren't even
smaller screen liked chikis maybe we
should do the next episode on tinder I
don't know snapchat I I did some
experiments on tinder they didn't go
well they weren't great for my marriage
so OH maybe we'll save those there's a
reason it's called tinder yes where
there's smoke there's fire hey there you
go there yeah so did we get through
taking your Star Wars where I'm moving
on moving on so the next thing the next
thing in the in the sciences category
for this month was a
apparently there was a rumor going
around at the beginning of the year that
I wrote about and it's been going around
apparently since 1970 something and
continues to come back which is that
there is a alignment that's always just
about to happen around the beginning of
the year of the Earth Jupiter and Pluto
that will magically make gravity stop
for a couple of seconds and I it made
the rounds like last year and made the
rounds even more strongly this year
during the holiday season it was like
january fourth i believe it was supposed
to happen and yet again it did not
happen and it turns out are you sure
well i don't know did it anyone anyone
was it like four in the morning and
we're all sleeping or was it just like
that one time we're at a bar and we
think gravity's gone for a second and
then it comes back i mean that's not one
day that we all could dunk you know i'm
still waiting for that we feel a little
white we feel a lot lighter I don't know
see my gravity issues are usually it
seems like there's too much gravity like
when I get to the top of the stairs yeah
stuff like that but I haven't noticed
being lighter yeah well thanks okay so
it's supposed to be a prolonged thing or
just like a really fast yeah just like a
couple of seconds and as you could see
like NASA tweeted it clearly so it must
be true must be kind of a big deal with
NASA cuz they don't you know they don't
yeah that any BS yeah I mean that that's
it that's a doctor tweet and okay what
what this what this reminds me of is one
time when I was a young lad I worked
with somebody who was the best liar that
I ever met and what I learned for this
person is the best lies dad um it was a
her and what yeah but what I learned is
the best lie the best hopes is always in
the details and then this is very
detailed it's a very specific alignment
of Jupiter and Pluto and it actually
dates back to a British astronomer who
made a joke on on a british show back in
the 70s I and it comes back around every
now and then on the internet and now it
seems to become an annual thing and it
got I got a fair amount of play around
the inner tubes this this year but yeah
I mean I
pride and I you know I tried to jump I
would like God in the right position in
the elevator and I figured you know I
could go through do some willy wonka
style awesomeness but it didn't happen
oh that's the thing you know I mean I
think this is one of those things
everyone knows can't be true but at the
same time you want to believe it's so
badly that you start considering maybe
maybe maybe I know everything I was just
loiter a second ago every time I hear
something about this is the year that
certain planets line up I'm like oh here
we go here we go like every single
sci-fi doomsday fantasy Wicca movie I've
ever seen that's about lining up planets
and we're supposed to be able to like
time travel and skip over gravity and
hang out at Stonehenge or something so
our tuesdays I like to cover each day
today alright think of every buffy
episode like it's just like one of those
moments are like okay what disasters
thing happens when all the planets lined
up at once and gravity's supposed to go
away for three seconds like what
Hellmouth is gonna open up but nothing
happens it's a wormhole just to work um
well let's move on to what you might
consider the main course of course
perhaps uh Michael why don't you tell us
what you wrote about with regards to
this fine piece of art using the word
main course with this story I don't know
if that's a wise idea special lunchtime
edition yeah yeah it's a portrait of
Mark Zuckerberg that was made out of
poop and it's on displaying a gallery in
New York called the hole which is sort
of equally disturbing and the artist's
name is katsu and he sort of has a thing
out for Zuckerberg he back in 2013 he
put posters all over New York City and
they were pictures of Zuckerberg with a
black eye so this is his latest shot at
him and I actually just found out just
before today's crave cast that you could
buy this painting for 4,500 dollars so
wow what a bargain for a piece of crap
yeah yeah literally no offense yeah and
oddly enough there was their work there
are two paintings in the exhibit and I
made out of feces and the other one is
of a dog so no word on why that is is a
human feces dog feces
like is it the artist own yeah wow
that's putting yourself in your art
definitely Wow yeah Eric I think there's
a question in the live stream is this
the first piece of art that we know has
been made out of no no there is one guy
who like like crap dinner like film cans
or something yeah I think that's not
here is that just Tuesday yeah could
have been a critic I don't know yeah now
that I think using your own bodily
fluids is a very like historic mainstay
of artistic endeavor I think a lot of
artists especially like I know a lot of
artists have used their own blood in
their paintings oh yeah feces it's just
it seems like a weird art investment
because I don't know what fees would
smell like after many many years hung up
on a wall I'm assuming he roses get it
framed with like glass frame like does
that stuff like does the art deteriorate
after a while because you have chemicals
in your I don't know everyone's
everyone's different of what they what
leaves their body but I would imagine
any art that's made with something
that's biodegradable would not last that
long I saw installation was it a
fixative or something okay that makes it
and I don't okay I saw an installation
one time that was made entirely of
fortune cookies and they sprayed that
with a fixative but it did start to
smell it did start to rot and it got
filled with rats oh so it's a more of a
kinetic art piece then yeah yeah that's
an ongoing I mean we are talking about a
lot of fortune cookies it was a mammoth
pile yeah the feces of medium is cheap
at least I don't know I've never I mean
is there are their feces art stores on
etsy like I feel like this is something
we should explore like what does this
mean i think that were limited run art
is another day or two yeah i just i
don't know like how do you display this
art do you burn a lot of incense do you
die is this something you hang in your
bathroom so it just sort of goes with
the territory under a sign that says
freshly square don't know it does have
built-in LED lights though to what part
of it i leave it i think yeah that's we
the mediums described as human feces
with LED light frame so oh so the light
frame okay I see it must have
a lot of fun to get that out the friend
is lit so it's not strategically placed
sparkles or anything oh if only oh it
has this but you know it it's pretty
good yeah did he do this with a brush or
is it hopefully not finger painting he's
really hard to get ahold of yeah he's
not a big fan of the internet and people
like Mark Zuckerberg as you can tell so
I wasn't able to actually find him or a
website or anything about him but I did
hear from the gallery who told me the
asking price is 4500 zakar berg
commented on it do you know that
anybody's i don't know i don't think so
i don't see when you get to that when
you're that famous that people are
making crappy art literally of you there
wait what kind of PR message do you
normally have pre written for that yes
not it's not something I don't know like
I I think the arts actually it's really
well done and I'm wondering how long it
took him to create that piece of any
questions I don't know I'm just so arts
interesting to me what if he is what
media to use like I I just what was the
soom the inspiration was he just really
doesn't like Zuckerberg but uh it's a
great piece of art I mean the fact they
made I'm smiling instead of frowning I
mean that's a great image yeah the
hoodie the shading on the hooding is
perfect so I don't oh I believe that is
technically a the word as shiza eating
grin so this is shirt work I've been
waiting your whole life to say that
haven't you ever since I was 12 yes I
hope I getting you yeah what's your
title of it it's a shiz ahead oh you
know I'm English oh oh right cuz we
can't say just yeah it's not he's not a
hit it's right but with the real word
yeah yeah yeah so just do you know if
this artist has plans to make a whole
series of Zuckerberg and different
bodily mediums or is it I don't think so
I you know I don't know that you know
the rest of his exhibit is actually kind
of interesting he's he did a series that
is a take off of the Maryland series
that he did with drones warhol's
Maryland series that he did
he painted with drones and there's
actually a like a smoke tube in the in
the gallery and that just cloaks the
entire gallery and smoke and that's
called vape he's done lots of drone
graffiti pieces before there's a piece
of him looking kind of like the
Terminator robot that he calls selfie
with different backgrounds so it's a
pretty interesting exhibit so when he's
when you say drone are he's not painting
with drones he's painter drums are the
the subject of his art or does he know
know you're like he's painting with them
he uses drugs so when you said drone
graffiti art I'm just now picturing
rogue drones doing graffiti and like all
the like police graffiti people are like
pissed off you could get that really
high that way I just think you see them
jumping Shepherd I just thinking how
many drones are working for shepard
fairey right now like I just like this
is our the banksy drone brigade like I
think we're on to a whole new art
movement so thank you for bringing that
up his name again Michael katsu tattoo
kk TS something I found something on it
oh let's see what this proceed with
caution to drone paintings oh ok here we
go so it's drone I'll see this is this
is gonna be the future of graffiti Andre
the Giant as a whole of drones I love
this this is awesome it's pretty yeah oh
my god tagging is gonna be to a whole
new level if we can use drones to tag
Wow oh so the the other bit of artsy
science fictiony awesomeness that's
coming up I'm very excited about this
and Bonnie you've kind of been covering
this moving into the mandatory TV
section of the creative cast of The X
Files could be coming back yeah so uh
Fox executives said last week that
they're in talks which can mean anything
I mean this is Hollywood so intoxicating
me bass met at a bar and just said hey
we should do the x-files again that was
good show but they're in touch with
Chris Carter coming back who is the show
creator to bring back the x-files with
the original some of the original cast
like we know that the lone gunman
unfortunately died so hopefully they'll
come back in Ghost form or droid for
more some
but I would love to see an all replicate
lone gunman cast but anyway David
Duchovny says he's on board David to
companies word cuz he's got some other
stuff going on he's got a new show
called Aquarius on NBC that's coming out
where it's a detective show based in the
60s were there chasing down the Manson
Family before the tape murders so he's
doing that but I think that's just a
miniseries I don't know if that's a full
flow like full-fledged actual show that
they're going to meet multiple seasons
for um and he just wrote a book called
holy cow cuz that's what author less
what actors do when they're not acting
their writing I was that about yeah I
haven't read it yet it's a novel but you
know he's promoting it pretty heavily
right now so he's on the press junket
circuit so he's been saying over and
over again yeah I'd love to do X Files
again Gillian Anderson as we know was in
the fall she's a return to Hannibal and
she's got a new I think she's got a war
and peace miniseries that she'll be
doing for BBC and she's also a novelist
which we've covered unseen it because
she writes sci-fi novels for a new
imprint that she's been working on so
they're all busy they've got plenty of
stuff going on however the company did
stay when he said you know yeah I'd love
to do X Files that he's not really
committed to doing a full season he'd
probably do what he did at the end of X
Files where he just showed up for half a
season or he was a cameo or something so
you know he does want to be on board
Gillian Anderson has said on a Nerdist
podcast that she would totally do it so
I think it's possible I mean if we're
getting Twin Peaks again and we're
getting X Files again I'm trying to
think of all the other shows around that
time like I'd love to see Pretender come
back I'd love to see Millennium come
back that's another Chris Carter show
actually millennium yeah um so family
matters hahaha that would be good yeah
we did it's called too many cooks oh
sorry uh yeah so I would love to see XY
let's go back and there's plenty of
fodder for X Files there's plenty of
stories they could be covering and we
sort of saw that with fringe because
everyone thought French was kind of
x-files e in a way but i would i would
love to see that so and by the the
comments section and just
I when we're promoting the XML story a
lot of people were excited for this
possibility a lot of people so here's
hoping that happens soon and here's
hoping that the stories are good and
they get a good cast and yeah I would
love to see it I don't know am I the
only one here that is ok cool yeah yeah
you have files Michaels a lot more
excited you know what I'm gonna
interject this really quickly I'm also
excited for a show that no one's excited
for what's a CSI cyber because I feel
like CSI cyber which is gonna be about
cyber crime I feel like they're gonna
read a lot of our crime cry yet there
gonna be guys they're gonna be reading a
lot of our cnet articles I feel like we
could be in the TV writers room we could
be helping them out because you know
there's so many stories that we write
that could instantly be what least
Simpsons episodes so I mean they could
totally be CSI cyber summon out there
they need any you know help yeah and a
crafty what a sarcastic geeky kind of
i'm just waiting for a serial killer who
uses drones that's why i'm waiting for
that he doesn't mean at her house yeah
yeah personally waiting anyway so
continue with our arts and culture I'm
done talking about x-files and drone
yeah I think we're an agreement that
we're all over that yeah and apparently
everyone is also all over a show that I
don't watch which is which is called
arrow can somebody tell me what the show
is first of all I don't know anything
about agent Carter fast yeah I did yeah
I don't that either yeah Eric you need
to watch asian I know yeah okay so
there's a agent everybody I know love's
agent Carter it's the kind of Fortius
sequel to Captain America so it's a
prequel de agents of shield and it
follows capped America's X Peggy Carter
being a kind of she's got like James
Bond fighting skills but she's stuck in
a pledge Lee Circle kind of situation
which is not allowed out in the field
anymore because no one takes us
seriously cuz women returning from the
war and all that so it's just a very fun
period kind of I mean Webber would
clearly loved 40s movies and we're gonna
be doing a post about it Michelle star
hi haha close-up close-up I've been
tracking the gadgets they use on it
because it has that pulpy sci-fi
background where they have light guns
and lipstick you know knockout drops and
Michelle
I've seen it crave Australia looked at
actual real-life spy gadgets made
specifically for lady spies and we're
making it packaged so that's gonna be
cool enough to be tomorrow and there's a
link so i'll send you guys a link from
collectors weekly calm they did a whole
thing on spy gadgets that people collect
that are four more days that women
agents actually used um and so I I love
the show too i'm a big fan of agent
Carter I love that's a female lead show
I love we get to see Jarvis as a human
yeah yeah yeah you know basically the
British Butler that turns into the
British Butler for Tony Stark but in the
computer form and there's more Howard
Stark there's some so great yeah there's
so many great stark moments and I think
they did a really good job showing what
happens after World War two when you
know we had all this like you can do it
Rosie the Riveter stuff and then all
this all the men came back they're like
yeah we're taking her jobs back go back
to the kitchen so it's kind of like that
mentality that they have to deal with um
the dialogues great the action scenes
are amazing like she really does kick
butt and she is a stuff in her
environment she's very fast very clever
very determined and it just started so
if you haven't watched it yet and if you
have something like Hulu or you have you
know a capability of watching it online
somehow do because it's a great show and
it just started and I I love it and I
fun in fact it doesn't it doesn't really
fall into cliche either you know they
could make the men buffoons and but they
don't like the men have their place and
they're they're pretty good detectives
to you know but and and and you know
she's she's kind of a tough character
through the whole thing not just in
secret you know so i think i think by
not falling into cliche it's an even
better show than i thought it was gonna
be Michael what do you think of Sue's I
believe his name is the guy with the
crutches he's pretty cool I mean I think
he's gonna want to becoming her ally
yeah there's sort of frenemies at the
moment though cuz he seems like the
smartest one and so he's the one that
she needs to outsmart yeah there's
always that he also doesn't treat her
like a secretary yeah yeah yeah so yeah
but it is it's very I mean there's a lot
of 1940s late nineteen forties early
1950s things that pop in like uh you
know all the automat yeah I'm is and
then the hotel are like these living
arrangements for women only men can't
live I'm een we had that in bosom
buddies but I'm just gonna sing this is
that writes itself
and as a result it is a very quite show
I mean it's a white boarding house it's
a bunch of cups yeah but you know they
may bring in race issues in there as
well because that was something that was
in World War two that they had to deal
with when everybody came back and the
only commanders in the movie yeah
exactly exactly so so arrow to answer
your question also is it's based on
economic and it's it's are we in third
season or four season now third season
third season um so it's on netflix if
you want to catch up if you haven't
watched it at all Eric um I'm true okay
I'm try not to arrow shame you but it is
out there and you can watch it um and
flash of course came along and they've
was just so good flash is great too and
they've intersected a few storylines and
it's a great show and you should watch
it but they're starting now to bring in
more and more characters from the comic
book series that we're used to like
Black Canary and such into arrow and
flash is gosh I like because it's got
kind of an old golly gee willikers kind
of moment it's nice it's friendly it's
friendly we're out super dark flash is
light look Sarah bear if you cross over
say kind of illuminate each other in
terms of theme and character development
it's actually they're quite cool
crossovers yeah they're they're great
crossover so if you haven't started
watching yet I'd say CW's got a lot of
great comic book stuff coming up and
it's something you should be watching
but we you should you should talk about
this because you've been writing quite a
bit about arrow lately I did a post
about Black Canary but Michael did a
post about something else that I think
people might actually enjoy more is it
the the lightsabers yeah I mean unless
ya spoiler if fake I don't know yeah be
careful spoilers forever yeah well if
you haven't seen the mid-season finale
uh turn off your your computer now Eric
look away turn off your computer when we
have other stuff talk about I'll read
that plug up your ears or something
stare at the primary bad there's a user
named Dave Jones who did he's done a few
of these kind of fan videos where he
took the epic battle scene at the end of
the the mid-season finale up on the
mountaintop and instead of using metal
swords he replaced them with lightsabers
and he did a really good job of it and
the battles just
so much better with lightsabers as most
of them are all battles are veteran
lights as we know it's like the bacon of
the weapon world yeah it is I really
like how he goes a whole hog for the
intro yeah we're not just doing it we
gotta do the opening Carell Star Wars
fans do this by the way and it's
something I find very endearing they're
like we're not just gonna whip into the
action oh no we gotta do our opening
scroll we gotta do our elite ask for our
focus film logo we got to do the
headline we go to the galaxy thing and
the white and the wipes also that's Ra's
al Ghul's headquarters there that you
just saw and yeah this is Ra's al Ghul
the head of the League of Assassins more
thought it went into this in phantom
menace we have you felt it
pretty great looking very force awakens
voiceover oh yeah yeah i think it was
exactly the first way yeah I think
you're right
that's gonna leave in here actually you
know it doesn't it cauterize it leave
them he's a mark it seals it yeah nearly
time mr. Queen has not yet presented the
guilty how long is this actually pretty
long I could talk about Ariel you just
run the video I did okay guys yeah go
ahead Cal see you guys um the video of
thank you yes yes so I did a post about
the introduction of last boiler e to
know it is known it all season
everybody's known this we know we knew
Black Canary was coming because they're
doing a blob promotion and blogs and on
print so we know what's coming but maybe
don't give too many details away of how
I'd I can't say it's Laurel yeah yeah
okay so here's the thing about Laurel
she was Oliver's ex-girlfriend in the
beginning of the series and they had
lots and lots of love triangles that
were very very boring I'm speaking my
opinion now they her best friend I mean
they basically was all a big live truck
love triangle because she was dating his
best friend he was there are many way on
forever it was very very boring in my
opinion and Laurel is basically the
worst human being in the world yes with
some tight competition from Olly himself
yeah but so they kind of got away from
that they really put her through a lot
and they sort of sidelines her and
things got more interesting and now
they're bringing her back to try and
show how she has actually become the
Black Canary herself and I showed her
working out they've showed her getting
trained they've showed it developing
psychologically while she's still in
character is this incredibly pliny's
self-centered demanding person and so
it's really interesting because they've
made me root for someone I really didn't
like and I'm actually curious to see
while their credit is can they pull this
off is this the worst decision I've ever
made or is it a brilliant gamble and i
will say that it's a huge gamble because
we're in third season and who knew if
the show was going to last past first
season because there was a lot of jokes
at oh I can't believe they're doing this
with green arrow his comic book
character looks more like Robin Hood
than the TV show obviously they made a
lot of risks by having him kill a bunch
of people the first season and not show
remorse and then I guess they decided
okay well we're going to have him show
remorse so he didn't kill people he just
did that thing where he just ties
everyone
up for the police and or just in the
hand yeah I'm really annoying I find
really annoying because I don't have any
I don't have any faith whatsoever and
sent is it central's it what's the name
of the city that's a nice darling I have
no faith whatsoever in the Starling
justice system so I don't Starling
city's justice system's gotta be super
crap so I don't know why he didn't just
kill everyone like you did before uh the
key thing with black canary is her
sister died mysteriously and that's
something that they cover in the season
of arrow of who actually killed her they
think they know but they don't know if
there's mind control involved they don't
know if it's the sister they have no
idea like they don't know if all I
sister they had no idea so it's like one
of those things and I don't want to
spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it
yet but when she dies that's the
catalyst of making um her sister
basically decide oh I want to be black
in there because her sister was the
canary so that's how Black Canary came
about is kind of like avenging or taking
on the role of this Kate like this
crusader for Starling and there always
has been a lawyer a public aid person
she has always tried to help in her own
irritating helpless kind of way and
she's a recovery she's a recovering
addict so she's got a lot of dark side
to her and she's very selfish and it's
and it's very interesting to see a
character that no one liked and I will
say no one liked her through the first
three seasons because we're just like
she's whiny she blames Ollie for all of
her problems there was a commenter on my
blog post who did like her okay ones but
that person but she's finally coming
into this and this is why I've stuck
with arrows because I'm like I know
black Canary's coming I know black
Canary's going to show up I just have to
stick it out and I'm really glad that CW
didn't cancel a show before we had this
slow burn reveal of a character that a
lot of people love in comic books so
thank u CW for not cancelling a share
right away unlike other networks that
usually do three episodes and then
cancel it or not show it at all Wonder
Woman so it's you know it's interesting
so I'm hoping that we get to I hope it's
a good payoff I hope we're not all
eating our words next crave cast I just
honestly don't know it could work out it
could be terrible we'll see okay it's
such a great time to be a superhero fan
by the way in a comics fan because we're
getting all these networks are jumping
on whatever they can and whatever comic
they can both in movies and TV so I'm
excited for this jessica jones
Jones I'm excited for Jessica Jones we
just did a reveal yesterday that david
tennant is going to be playing the main
body which we know him as purple man in
the comics he's known as kilgrave that's
his actual human name a regular person
name yes cuz that's such a regular I
know well purple man you know it can
mean that could be Prince you know no
the formerly known exactly and I talked
about Jessica Jones earlier Krysten
Ritter is going to be playing her it's a
netflix series as 13 episodes it's a
miniseries coming out from Marvel and it
looks great and I loved the comics I
loved her character she's basically the
whole point of jessica jones 'she was a
superhero that's hung up her cape so to
speak after a disgrace because purple
man has this mind control capability so
he basically turns everyone into his
puppets and he basically made her do
horrible things and no the other
superheroes would trust her after that
and she just had a hard time coming back
into the superhero world so she's like
screw it I'm gonna hang up the cape and
I'm gonna be a detective it's kind of
like what's happening on Castle right
now so she's basically a private
investigator aah and she's gonna have
her own agency and she still has all our
powers but she's just basically just
being a human p I and she's brought into
New York City cases that they can't
explain so it's kind of like metahuman
type thing that's happening on arrow and
flash were mostly I guess more like
flash where they're brought in to
uncover what's happening in cases that
humans can't fathom on their own but i'm
excited for David Tennant playing a bad
guy I think most people know him as the
Tenth Doctor on doctor he loves playing
dead he loves playing bad guys and
here's the thing we knew him as a bad
guy on harry potter and he's played bad
guys before in different TV mini-series
and if you're a tenant attic like i am
you've already done your tenant binging
on netflix and found anything and
everything he's even had a cameo in but
we're so used to him being the lovable
doctor that it's weird to think of him
as a villain especially such a vile
villain as purple man who really does
horrible horrible things to Jessica
I hope this doesn't turn into sexual
assault TV show I don't know I know that
it happened in the comic so we'll see
how far they take it I know that a lot
of the geek girl and feminist blogs like
Mary Sue and I know I 09 talked about
this briefly to is how far are they
going to take it you know how far are
they going to make him as evil as he is
in the comics and I think that's
something all comic book shows struggle
with is how evil and believable do we
make these characters so I'm excited hey
tenant yay all right well I'm gonna have
to definitely check out arrow apparently
uh in flash and flash flash for sure man
agent Carter and agents of shield you
didn't want to spend time with your
family are booked until next yeah that's
uh Marvel Marvel marvel so a few a few
more things were bad at a time a few
more things I just want folks to check
out on crave that we don't really have
time to cover definitely look up the
post of the fine brothers post I think
Bonnie wrote about seniors playing grand
theft auto do you want to say something
really quick about this when you watch
the elder its elders react to grand off
of grand off grand off I'm still
thinking style we shall not pass this
again grand up that's right GTA 5 GTA 5
there you go okay so here's the thing
they've never played it the only thing
they were given were the controls and
how to use the controls they know that
it's a controversial show but they've
never played it the best part of this is
they stop for stop signs and they paid
traffic lights and they were very
adamant about that they're like well you
have to it's a stoplight it's like you
have to like that and took them forever
to get out of the driveway but here's
the thing with this game it's so
controversial and everyone's like oh
it's bad you shouldn't let your kids
play up a lot once that they get going
and once they figure out the controls
and everything they love shooting people
they had so much fun randomly shooting
strangers in fact one of them's like I
picked a knife as my weapon cuz it's
more personal classic that's the touch
because extra carry these are our
parents and grandparents playing this
game oh look at her look up
and that is why it's the greatest job
yeah and it's great so that's group
that's totally worth checking out also a
post I wrote about Neil deGrasse Tyson
sharing the meaning of life on stage
with the six-year-old it's like a five
minute long video a but it's totally
priceless so check that out and how
about we give there it is right there
and how about we give the last word of
the creative cast today to Michael and
just tell us briefly about your great
science experiment in the high tech
shirt that you wore for a month oh well
I'm wearing it now actually huh so it's
this kind of like rubbery spandex
t-shirt it's my wife called it the
thundershirt but the the real name it's
from a company called a line med and
yeah I mean you know I just write all
day and you know my shoulders hurt my
wrist hurts my elbows hurt and I was
getting kind of sick of it and came
across this shirt and they were nice
enough to send me a test version of the
shirt and I wore it for about a month
and in about a week the shoulder pain
went away in about another week a lot of
the other pain went away so it's an
awesome thing and you know now I where
it sort of whenever things are acting up
and I'll wear it for a day and feel
pretty much better by the end of the day
it also you know they said that it
improves your energy which I thought was
just a bunch of bunk but somehow it does
I just being squeezed all day keeps you
going just keep it always works for me
oh that's true is it like an acupressure
thing or a war what is it exactly
remember during the Olympics you saw a
lot of athletes putting those kind of
like they look like giant band-aids on
their muscles so it has that kind of big
piece of tape yea big tape so see it's
got that kind of stuff built into it so
it pulls your shoulders back and put you
in better alignment you've you feel
almost feel a little uncomfortable if
you if you slump so well yeah I'm
proving your posture will help
everything right on your hands yeah and
actually chiropractors use that tape
like I'm when I threw out my back I got
all taped up on that tape which is very
adhesive by the way don't pull it off on
your own I learned the hard way and this
I am very intrigued by this shirt so I'm
get one for the ladies I'm going to tear
the ladies version and see if it helps
me because I throw out my back
constantly and I'm writing constantly so
you inspired me to get the other shirt
so I me maybe we'll do a female edition
review of the shirt and I'll let you
know how it worked out for me but I'm
totally going to try this because this
is something i think a lot and this is
affecting a lot of workers right now who
telecommute so not just writers but
anybody who works at a computer all day
long and especially if you're in an
office and you just want better posture
I think this shirts amazing so thanks
for that that doing the hard work for us
so we could test it out or you know you
were a guinea pig so we can do it too so
thank you for that yeah sure my pleasure
and the guys are great the guys who run
it um they have tons of research
information they're happy to share and
you know the guy just kept writing email
after email saying how happy was that I
felt better he wasn't even know sort of
as pleased with the coverage as he was
with the fact that I got better using
the shirt so they're they're a good team
yay mmm awesome thank you Michael time I
check that out as well I think that's
about all the time we have for the crave
cast this month I've been your
technologically inept and barely he'll
informed us for the month but we'll do
it again even a row in February I gotta
go find my internet we're at what one
quick correction um Chelsea's said
something about the worst person in the
world that's actually Bill Belichick and
that's the only comment I'll make all
right well thank you everyone everyone
be safe for Stephen Beecham Kelsey Adams
Bonnie Burton Maikel Franco and Jeff
Sparkman I'm Eric Mack that's been the
crave cast see in February
