there was a lot of information in there
these are the top five google i/o
announcements you should know at number
five is a low it's a smart messaging app
that seems like a facebook Messenger
rival but it's got some tricks up its
sleeve the Google assistant is baked in
so you can find results right from the
app there's an incognito mode so
conversations disappear when you're done
a low also has smart replies that
feature words you actually use since it
learns how you write the smart reply
feature looks so smart you may never
have to have another real conversation
again it arrives in the summer on both
iOS and Android at number for Android
auto if you've wanted android auto you
need to buy a new car or compatible head
unit oh that's changing everybody soon

your phone on top of that Google's ways

app on your watch face it features smart

wear and apps work on their own expect
Android wear 2 point 0 in the fall at
number two Chromebooks get android apps
starting in june android apps are headed
to Chromebooks google's chrome books are
relatively very low cost but we're
really kind of limited with the addition
of over a million Android apps
Chromebooks just got a lot more
interesting apps can be run in a
windowed mode or full screen not every
app will work on Chromebooks but over a
million ain't bad at number one is
google home google CEO sundar Pichai
starters announced me by giving a shout
out to the Amazon echo then Google
showed up Google home a device that will
directly compete with the echo it's
google's personal assistant in your home
that will live in a plug-in speaker home
will work with nest products and google
chromecast
devices it looks really slick in a demo
