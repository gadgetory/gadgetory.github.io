store it starts with the lock screen
it's so gorgeous with its edge to edge
design and precise typography when you
swipe into the home screen get these
gorgeous animations as these icons come
in with their harmonious layout that
precisely chosen color palette but I os7
is so alive with depth and not through
artificial shadows or borders but the
way the device responds to the motion of
your hand with a parallax effect and
this deep layering is conveyed across
every experience of the device so as you
swipe up from the bottom of the display
you bring up control center you see that
layer semi-transparent layer with these
handy controls so you can turn on
airplane mode access your music even
turn on a flashlight this extends as
well to experiences like Notification
Center you can pull down from the top
and now from anywhere including the lock
screen and it's incredibly handy you can
find out where your next need to go and
because in iOS 7 your device actually
learns when and where you commute it can
recommend where you need to go and how
long it will take you to get there with
current traffic conditions it's totally
handy now we've also made search more
convenient than ever before in iOS 7
from any screen on your home screen you
can pull down and search for whatever it
is you're looking for and find it just
like that
now the experience and iOS extends
throughout all the applications a great
example is the weather app you see the
edge to edge design the precise
typography the subtle animations and if
you double click on the home button
you're taken into multitasking where all
your apps are kept up to date you can
just tap like for instance on safari and
bring it out forward and safari in iOS 7
is fantastic we have the new tab you
just tap in the lower right of the
screen you get an overview of all your
tabs pick a tab it slides forward start
browsing and the controls just elegantly
fade away letting you focus on your
content now Siri is massively improved
in iOS 7 just hold down on your home
button go into Siri you can say things
like what's lady gaga saying searching
on Twitter ok here is the tweets so you
see that Siri can now draw on the latest
tweets but you also notice that great
new high quality female voice you can
also select between a new high quality
male voices well here isn't tweets and
in addition to Twitter Siri can now draw
on information from Wikipedia in line
web search and great photo search as
well now the voices aren't the only
place where the sound in iOS 7 is
improved when you receive a call you may
hear something like this or this
or this now you may miss a call do to
your dancing but it's okay we still have
voicemail so it's all good and we've
improved the system alert sounds as well
you have lots of options like this or
this or my favorite it's kind of cool in
addition to these and many others we
have all the old classics as well but
remastered to sound better than ever
before now of course one of the most
important things we do with our phones
is capture memories we do that with the
camera app and in iOS 7 the camera is
better than ever you can easily swipe
between your different cameras like your
video camera a new square aspect ratio
camera you can tap in the lower right
and get access to live photo effects you
can apply them right while shooting or
after the fact when you edit but what I
really love with photos in iOS 7 is the
way instead of a flat camera roll I can
actually get my photos automatically
grouped by moments based on the location
and time when they were taken and if I
want to zoom back those moments are
collected into related collections for
instance an entire vacation
automatically pulled together into a
single collection and I can pull even
further back into the year view it's
just stunning I get to see my entire
year as a wall of color
it's really awesome is that the on a
Retina display you can actually make out
different parts of your photo collection
and you can just hold down your finger
and scrub and find a particular photo
and bring it forward and of course when
you find a great photo you're going to
want to share it and sharing in iOS 7 is
easier than ever tapping the lower left
bring up the share sheet across the top
you can select additional photos to
share you of course can share across
messages I mail iCloud photo sharing but
if you want to share with people right
around you there's nothing better than
airdrop for anyone who has their phone
on nearby they'll appear an airdrop you
can just tap tap on each person you want
to share with and be a high-speed p2p
Wi-Fi your securely sharing it's
absolutely phenomenal now of course at
Apple we really love music and an iOS 7
the music apps is absolutely the best
way to enjoy your own personal music
collection but now in iOS 7 we also have
itunes radio it's the best way to
experience new music now this is as easy
as tapping across the top on one of the
featured stations as always iOS 7 will
be available unbelievably for free
starting on September 18th it's
available for iPhone 4 and later the
ipad 2 and later the ipad mini and the
5th generation ipod touch that's iOS 7
