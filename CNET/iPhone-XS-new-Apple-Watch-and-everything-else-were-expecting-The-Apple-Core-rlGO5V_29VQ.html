Apple event so here's a look at
everything you need to know
iPhones are pretty much a given at this
event and if the rumors are true
we're gonna be getting three new models
this year as shown in this video by Mike
the Detroit Borg a 5.8 inch iPhone 10
sequel a larger plus version with a 6.5
inch screen that you can see to the end
and the one in the middle a 6.1 inch LCD
version of the 10 now for my sanity's
sake today we're gonna be calling them
the iPhone tennis iPhone 9 and tennis
plus although it's highly possible that
the official names will be something
completely different
Apple is rumored to be getting rid of
the plus branding and calling both OLED
models the 10s now with that out of the
way let's focus on the 10 s's and they
may look a lot like this I don't know
how they got their hands on this picture
but 95 Mac seems pretty sure that this
is the real deal and if it is we can
confirm that they have a similar design
to the previous 10 and a new gold color
option they'll both have an a 12 chip
with a second-generation face ID and
upgraded dual camera the plus model may
get a dual SIM support with wireless
fast charging capabilities and Apple
pencil support but that last rumor seems
to be losing steam so I wouldn't bet on
it
they're also rumored to cost around
$8.99 and $9.99 for the base models and
with an option of 512 gigabytes in
storage but perhaps the more interesting
iPhone this year would be the 6.1 inch
iPhone 9 and based on Apple's order
numbers even the company is expecting
this one to be the bestseller the design
would be similar to the iPhone 10 with a
few small differences including more
color options as shown in this mock-up
video by concepts iPhone that LCD
display will have slightly thicker
bezels the frame would be aluminum
rather than stainless steel with a
single camera on the back and
chunkier body now inside it could still
run that a12 processor but it may run a
first-gen face ID and no 3d touch also
maybe in this phone dual SIM option this
one would start at around $6.99 with a
Mac storage capacity of 256 gigabytes
but you'll have to wait longer to get it
if analyst maangchi quote is right on
the money
about the expected production delays now
inside the box they may all be getting a
USB C to lightning fast charger but no
dongle this time around which apparently
is the best selling Apple product at
Best Buy so expect it to continue in its
spot of number one for next year and the
other rumored product that's almost as
much of a sure thing as the iPhones at
this point is the Apple watch series 4
and again thanks to nine-to-five Mac we
have a pretty good inkling of what this
will look like definitely more screen
real estate 15% more with slimmer bezels
and a slightly slimmer design at least
that's what appears to look like on the
photo it also shows a microphone below
the digital crown this time which now
has a red outline instead of that ugly
red dot that I hated from the series 3
and a lot more complications on the
watch face with what seems to be a new
UV exposure reading on the bottom a
feature which Apple had already patented
a few months back now it's no secret
Apple is doubling down on health for its
Apple watch so I wouldn't be surprised
if we see other sensors similar to a UV
sensor in this next version of the Apple
watch maybe an SP o2 sensor perhaps
sleep tracking or somewhere along these
lines
what's definitely a sure thing on
September 12th our software updates
Apple will release iOS 12 watch OS 5 Mac
OS moment eb OS this latest iOS update
will bring group notifications digital
health features sake a screen time
controls multi player AR and mean
emojis to all your iOS devices well
actually that last one is just for
iPhone 10 but group FaceTime one of the
features I at least was most excited
about is not ready for primetime yet so
we'll have to wait for a later version
of iOS 12 to try it out we have a bunch
of content of all the updates on
cnet.com so make sure to check out more
details on the updates coming to your
devices after you finish this video and
after a year-long wait Apple's air power
mat is rumored to make its official
debut at this event now it's not clear
whether they will announce the price and
availability on stage or if it'll be an
update to the Apple Store later on that
day but it really has to happen on
September 12th now according to a recent
report in Mac rumors it will cost you a
hundred and fifty dollars to charge all
these three Apple devices at once we
knew it wasn't gonna come cheap guys now
don't expect second generation air pods
at this event you'll have to wait till
2019 for that but what we can't expect
is the wireless charging case now
personally that's all I'm expecting to
see at this launch event but with Apple
you never know so we do have to mention
the other products rumored to be making
their appearance before the end of the
year
starting with iPad pros this year we
expect an iPhone 10 makeover for the
iPad meaning slimmer bezels no home
button and face ID in two sizes an
eleven and a twelve point nine inch
screen a recent Bloomberg report also
says we can expect a new low-cost laptop
and a Mac Mini upgrade this year now
that 13-inch MacBook Air sequel would
have slimmer vessels with a Retina
display and a similar price point of
around $1000 while the Mac Mini would
get new storage options and better
processor but at a slightly higher price
now my guess is we'll see these products
at another October event but we'll have
to wait and see
we think we know a lot about the
products that Apple has in store for us
but I'm at least hoping for a few
surprises what's the one more thing you
guys want to see you can follow the
Apple event live on Sina calm and on
YouTube starting at 9 a.m.
San Francisco time on September 12 for
all the pre-event details or just tweet
me at Monaghan if you want to
behind-the-scenes look at the event I'll
see you on the other side</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
