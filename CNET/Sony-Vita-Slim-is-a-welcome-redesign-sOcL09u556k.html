rampant success but the company is
hoping to give its handheld console a
boost with this new slim version but is
it worth your time as the name suggests
the Vita slim is thinner than its
predecessor it's only had about three
millimeters shaved off but when you hold
it it does feel noticeably thinner more
striking is the weight difference the
Vita slim is 42 grams lighter than the
first model which should make those
lengthy gaming sessions a bit easier on
your wrists apart from the slim downsize
the biggest change here is a different
display the screen is the same size and
keeps the same pixel resolution but
instead of an OLED panel it now uses LCD
which is a different type of display
technology that was a risky move as we
were really happy with the old Vita
screen we've even said worried though as
the new display is just as good colors
aren't quite as saturated on the new LCD
panel but we found it produced slightly
more natural tones and it seems slightly
brighter too one very welcome change is
that sony has scrapped the Vita's
proprietary charger port in favor of the
more common microUSB which is the same
port used by loads of other gadgets like
Android smartphones or Amazon's Kindle
also new is one gigabytes of on-board
storage that's helpful but it won't go
very far once you've downloaded some
apps and have accumulated a few save
files after that you'll need to buy a
Vita memory card and unfortunately these
are quite expensive costing roughly $40
for a 16 gigabyte card at the time of
making this video ultimately the Vita
slim is a decent improvement but
competition for gamers attention is
still very fierce our advice is to look
at the list of games available before
you buy if there are Vita exclusive
titles you're desperate to play this
might be a sensible purchase but it's
also worth considering other options
like Nintendo's 3ds handheld or the
wealth of cheap downloadable games that
are available on a smartphone or tablet
