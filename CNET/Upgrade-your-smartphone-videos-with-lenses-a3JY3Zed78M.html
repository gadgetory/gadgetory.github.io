filmmaker and welcome to the very first
in our pocket filmmaking webisode series
this week we're looking at lensing for
pocket cameras I want to say lensing I
mean the glass that we put onto our
camera to give it a whole new view on
the world now whether you're shooting on
something like an iPhone or on something
like this old little flip camera there's
so many things you can out add to the
front of your lens to create a whole new
picture now in my hands I've got two
little lenses okay I've actually got
three and I'll show you how that works
in a minute these are optical lenses
they're metal and glass they cost less
than $20 sometimes less than $10 online
when you look on ebay in sites like that
these are fantastic for expanding your
scope when it comes to using your pocket
camera to create whole new lensing
opportunity I'm going to show you how
they work now what these lenses come
with is a very very tiny metal ring with
a sticky back coating may appeal of that
sticker and then you place this little
ring around the lens of your pocket
camera then these these actual lenses
are magnetic so they just simply click
on you don't have to glue them on you
don't have to hold them on they just
stay on like so I'm going to show you a
little demonstration of something filmed
with a conventional lens on say this
flip camera and then if I put on this
lens which is a wide-angle lens
see all of a sudden there's a massive
difference in that picture I can see so
much more of the image area now this
lens it's two lenses in this one little
package fine screw the front element the
back end of this lens becomes a macro
lens now if you've ever tried taking
photos on your pocket camera of things
very very close-up an insect on a flower
or a grain of sand or anything really
really small and close you'll know that
that focus is really really hard to find
that struggles in fact with this thing
beautiful and crisp have a look at this
example
now this lens here this is the Big Daddy
this is a fisheye magnetic lens same
principle as the other one it just
clicks on to that magnetic ring and
straight away it opens up a hundred and
seventy degrees field of view which is
unheard of for a smartphone you can just
cram so much more into the picture if
you're in a tiny space if you're
outdoors I want to get a big scene in
this fisheye lens is the one for the job
so those optical lenses are fantastic
they're really inexpensive they're a
must-have for your tool kit in fact if
I'm going to pick out a must-have
accessory it's a little wide-angle one
because it's two lenses in one wide
angle and a macro I use it every day if
you just google online you'll see that
it's telephoto versions for iPhone now
there's even microscope lenses they're
really really cool so check them out but
here's another jelly lenses now these
are just made of plastic okay there's no
metal parts and no glass Emmys and these
are only a couple of dollars online if
you look for them they come in a whole
range of different effects some 30 40
different color effects special effects
you can put on your lensing this one
here is a polarizer a circular polarizer
so if you want to introduce nice deep
blue skies and your shots or introduce
or eliminate reflections in a glass
surface this polarizer will do that for
you
now one of the criticisms we often have
with pocket filmmaking is we don't get
to use that nice dreamy effect of
shallow depth of field until now this
jelly lens here is a vignette filter so
it gives you that soft dreamy look on
the edge of frame just like it what you
can achieve using shallow depth of field
to really the good I'm going to leave
you with a really cool pocket film to
check out this week online it's called
dot by Arden studios in the UK now you
might know Armand from such great films
such as wallace and gromit
it is some of the best stock frame
animation in the world well they even
made a film and a pocket camera on a
smartphone so it's called dot check it
out and if you get an opportunity to
have a look at the making off too
blow your mind that's about it for me
when we catch up next time I'm going to
run you through how to keep your shots
super steady okay so when it's Steadicam
devices and really simple techniques to
keep those pocket filmmaking shots
nice and smooth see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
