Sumi das joining me as Josh Lowensohn
staff writer for cnet and we are going
to talk about the shake up the
management shakeup at apple today so
Scott Forstall and John Browett are
either out or on their way out why are
they leaving first first let's back up
for a moment here what positions do the
hold sure so Forrestal was basically the
chief of iOS software that's the
software that runs on iphones ipods and
ipads yeah at the keynotes he made all
the announcements about the improvements
to iOS exactly he was a big product guy
you know he was the architect of that
software he put that team together
originally with with steve jobs and they
created the software that's basically
going to run their their mobile devices
for the next ten years okay the other
guy is john browett this is someone who
Apple hired we started back in April and
he's basically a replacement for their
retail chief so he was in charge of all
the retail stores all the comings and
goings of all that product and the
management and the strategy so he's go
he's gone okay so why did they leave was
this a forced departure or what are the
rumors so apples said simply that
they're leaving but there have been
multiple reports from all sorts of
reputable reputable places that say that
these guys work and and brow it sooner
than forestall forestall isn't actually
leaving a company until sometime next
year but we can assume it's going to be
early on now I keep seeing the stock
climb 500 600 700 points but yet people
are unhappy obviously at apples and why
what what's the what's the talk about
why they were asked to leave I mean does
this have something for for style to do
with maps and how it was less than a
stellar launch of their Maps app yeah
there really to kind of things focusing
here one of them is perceived missteps
under forestalls watch in terms of
software one of those is obviously Maps
you have just a product that was not
enjoyed by people at all it did not
delight or surprise know and that's not
to say it's a totally flawed product you
know there's still benefits to it but it
wasn't quite the execution that people
are used to otherwise you know he's
really been known for shipping software
on time they've had these yearly
releases I think at any other company a
lot of people would say that's a success
what's come out since then is it he
really didn't play well with others
behind the scenes others reports that he
couldn't even be in rooms with other
executives at this top level which for a
company like Apple you just can't have
that yeah the apology that Tim Cook
issued after Maps was released and
people expressed their disappointment
very publicly that came out at the end
of September I read a report that said
that forced I'll refused to sign that
apology to issue that apology is that
correct you know we haven't been able to
confirm that but obviously if true
that's huge i mean to not put your name
on something and have cooked do it you
know obviously the top executive the
buck stops there yeah but you have other
executives including Bob Mansfield who
runs hardware and now he's been assigned
some other roles as part of this
restructuring who put his name on
something when the company kind of
retreaded on some recycling and
environmental waste things that they did
earlier this year and he really took the
responsibility for that okay and brow it
were their mistakes that were made at
the retail stores sure so there were
reports of layoffs and cutbacks and you
know for an organization like retail
which is really apples crown jewel
something that builds brings in billions
of dollars and really the kind of the
experience people have with Apple the
first public face of Apple and right
ways you don't want anything tarnishing
that and it didn't happen for the the
ten years that Ron Johnson was under the
watch all right so what does this mean
does this give us any insight into the
post Steve Jobs era of Apple I mean
that's what everybody is wondering about
is this a signal of what's to come yeah
you know a lot of analysts that we
talked to and who put out notes this
morning really say that this isn't a bad
thing they say that change is good and
this is really just Tim Cook kind of
putting his his stamp on the company
right so I mean you know we'll see when
the market opens up again tomorrow what
actually investors think okay Josh
thanks so much pleasure for inside scoop
I'm see me does thanks for watching
