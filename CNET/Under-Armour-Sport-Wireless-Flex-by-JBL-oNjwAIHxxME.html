taking a look at the Under Armour sport
wireless flex a neck band style
Bluetooth Sports headphone that retails
for a hundred and thirty dollars like
previous Under Armour headphones this
one is engineered by JBL truth be told I
didn't love those earlier Under Armour's
they didn't fit my ears great but this
one is well designed and sounds good
although it's not so different from
JBL's other neck band style bluetooth
headphones it has a few sports oriented
features including this built in run
safe led with three flashing modes a
cool safety feature if you're running or
walking around at night there's also a
couple of Bend and stay flexed cells in
the neck band that help you adjust the
fit to your next size a little bit
anyway and like with a lot of these new
bluetooth headphones there's a speed
charge feature that gets you one hour of
play back with just five minutes of
charging time battery life is rated at
12 hours at moderate volume levels which
is pretty good the earbuds adhere to
each other magnetically and there are
controls integrated into the top of the
neck band along with a microphone that
allows you to make cell phone calls the
headphones fit me securely and
comfortably and I was able to get a
tight seal from the largest set of ear
tips that tight seal is crucial for
maximizing sound quality the bass here
may not have the visceral impact of a
more expensive full-size headphone but
it's got some kick to it and these had
decent clarity for Bluetooth headphones
the sound quality is definitely a step
up from what you get from a budget model
while these are sweat proof and being
marketed as sports headphones they work
well as everyday headphones to I'd like
to see them cost less than $100 but the
price is my only real gripe and
hopefully we'll see some discounts down
the road because they're worth checking
out
that's the Under Armour Sport Wireless
flex thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
