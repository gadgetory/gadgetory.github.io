maybe some other things Maya's act on
alongside Bridget Carey and Scott Stein
let's give you a rundown what's today's
plan we're in our New York studio we'll

Rihanna who is at the event in San
Francisco then we'll stream the unpacked

Netcom slash interpol show so hang
around for that if you guys have any
questions or comments about what's
coming up from Samsung let us know tweet
us with the hashtags seen it live and
I'm watching the hash tag so that's
great yeah so I'm really interested what
you guys have to say guys we have seen
so many s-10 leaks for weeks and weeks
and weeks
looks like Samsung even somehow leaked
its own commercial where they show off
all kinds of things with the S 10 we
have a video of that you can see the
actual S 10 plus in its full glory it
appears to be it does in screen
fingerprints sensor there's a wireless
charging feature yeah there it is now so
yeah there's your little cutout for the
camera there's the ultrasonic
fingerprint sensor that we've heard
about and we're seeing all kinds of
different looks we got like a blueish a
camera on the back something about the
camera itself I can't read Norwegian
charging through the phone so the phone
itself is charging other devices in this
commercial
and again this leaked a day before the
actual event because like we've been
saying everything been coming out every
which way Bridget can you break down
what we've heard so far okay so it
sounds like we're getting a lot of
phones talked about this event you got
the s10 a larger s10 plus something that
will be a little cheaper like an s10 II
so I'm curious like how much cheaper
are we talking like you know 700 $800
like is the cheaper version like Apple
does it and then also 5g talked about
Samsung having his first 5g phone
curious if that's gonna come to you know
here first Korea first there's I mean
Simpson has talked about having 5g
phones for the US but is this that model
and then there's even talk of course
about the foldable phone which to me is
the more interesting thing because I
don't know much about that yet
you know Samsung fold is the name people
are throwing around look into the fold
eventually because we know that Samsung
has teased it a lot but this is supposed
to be the s10 event was 10 years of
Galaxy phones we've seen them change
year after year there's a little like
that was the tease yeah I was at in
developer conference or it was shown in
the curious about it and folding phones
are popping up everywhere we're gonna
hear I'm sure a lot more about that also
at Mobile World Congress next week or
over the weekend so it's the new hot
thing but between that and 5g how does
that all get folded in
so that was really laughing does it all
get folded in with with with the current
phone lineup you know how staggered you
know will those be and how much will
those be at ease to the future will that
be next year you know will those be
coming out later this year it sounds
like maybe folding will be later this
year so yeah in that video we just saw
the s10 they fold potentially not only
was it in the dark but they said that it
was in a disguise so we couldn't see the
final form so we don't know if it's
gonna be boxy or exactly the things how
do they keep how is Samsung the
attention on the s10 because that's what
this thing is really supposed to be
about if you got this folding thing kind
of sitting in the background how does
the s10 stack up with s9 and everything
else that's been out there well I think
one thing is of course how much will
people really want something like a
folding phone or a 5g phone maybe what
they want to something very practical
and also price I mean inevitably those
things will cost more so you know you're
already dealing with phones that are
pretty expensive and maybe people want
to get off before the folding 5g
experiences so it makes us have a
spectrum going from we'll probably a lot
more practical stuff now and going to
her
the futuristic you know more
aspirational stuff yeah like it's the
fold gonna eat into you know the
attention for the main one like a little
Chomper folding sorry with the pac-man
face that's it it should be but or ya
know people want a reliable phone that
would you know like like you said and I
think it's more about look what we can
do because we're at a time where phones
are doing the same things and so maybe
the more interesting stuff today is all
right what are the accessories what can
you do with this charging you know and
and and the fingerprint like I I would
like to see how that feels you know like
like like being able to unlock it just
through the screen and we saw a new
technology we've seen in other phones
but still it's something to talk about
from some Samsung that is different I
think it had a really good word there
was which was reliability because this
foldable phone will be a first
generation product and who knows how
well it's going to sustain its
flexibility then you've got the s10
which is the 10th version of this phone
which has been getting better and better
and better as the years have gone on it
just seems like it's it's this is there
a mainstream phone needs to be Samsung
would throw everything against the wall
we'd see all kinds of crazy designs and
they paired it back so much we've got
the S line we've got the note line we've
got this fold line it seems like it's
gonna be a really strange way to make
the SN seem important remember when the
s first came out the Galaxy S is the
four versions of it
yeah there were different versions for
every carrier I mean I played around
with I remember specifically I mean a
lot of them but the t-mobile version it
had a whole different look than the
other ones and some had different
features but it also came with Avatar
pre-loaded because I was at think back
in the day like what movie was preloaded
that sadly is how I watch that movie for
the first time on a four scream four
inch screen in bed so yeah I'm sure
James Cameron really wanted that to be
an experience but yeah now it's now
we're dreaming now we're just yeah I was
like that that did happen did it there
was a for tonight exclusive on one of
the Samsung phones I forgot about that
little wait for it so now housing said
how much of things really changed but I
admit but the folding phone yet for me
it's it's it's question of durability
and also software support you know how
much is Android ready to to move into
that how much can Samsung make that work
in a way that would be great I mean with
that folding there's all sorts of
opportunities I want it to work
seamlessly and to be the kind of magic
futuristic thing that we've all been
thinking about through you know
Westworld and a million other sci-fi
shows for the past 20 years but you know
can that can it do that can it nail that
now or will we have to wait even another
year for the software to grow in total
like like what's the point other than
like hey check out my cool new zoom
which is about yeah I mean I do like
having the cool thing you can show off
because you know now we're just showing
off what our photos can do on social
media speaking of photos this the s10 is
rumored to have three cameras on the
back which they seem to keep adding more
and more cameras we used to have one and
there was got bigger more megapixels and
ends like no we have a bigger sensor now
we have two now we're talking about
possibly three cameras in the back this
report was from June of 2018 when these
rumors started coming up on when what
the Samsung I know they're showing a
long way one but it was a rumor that
it's going to be similar to the Huawei P
20 because yeah flip phones were
relatively new this is hilarious to say
this was a new thing as far back as June
we were getting rumors about Samsung's
phones because I mean it's it's February
now and it's finally coming out do you
think the triple cameras make a
difference to anybody like what's the
big draw with three cameras four of
cameras 15 cameras well I'll point out
the speaking of a huawei mate 20 pro is
an interesting early harbinger of the of
what what happened last year I got to
look at that and that a couple
technology is simile they're now coming
into play with Samsung with other phone
manufacturers that had three cameras so
it was like an extra super wide mode so
you end up with that fisheye mode
I mean arguably maybe lenses like that
or even more important than for a while
dual cameras were about adding depth
effects and you know whether or not you
care about bokeh remains to be seen
depending on who you are whether that
gets simulated like a pixel 3
but I think the lens you know that's a
that's a real physical feature that
camera also an under screwed fingerprint
sensor we're just kind of now you're
seeing more it sounds like it's gonna
come out in Samsung's and the third
thing is that charging that that phone
had was the first I I think that existed
that had the ability to charge anything
else from the back like a reverse
wireless charge but Samsung's is going
to have that for for ear buds that's
pretty interesting and I want to know
how much you know how large that
landscape run can you I think that's
interesting to have like a mobile hub
battery solution I just think like like
I'm barely hanging on the day for my
phone battery like could I spare any
juice for other devices like I guess
it's kind of neat if you forget a dongle
though and you're already fully charged
and yeah you may want to keep it like
plugged in when it's doing that or
something yeah I don't know well how
much of the extra cameras have something
to do with maybe talk of a rfx I mean is
that where we're going next I think it's
a are but you know also a lot of
manufacturers notably you know Google
and Apple who are pursuing a Ark or an
air kit or able to do that stuff with
just one camera mm-hmm and they've built
all that stuff to work with a
combination of the motion sensors and
the camera tech on Google particularly
is really adamant that you don't have to
have more than one camera so I'm a
little hesitant to say that that's
really needed for AR you know for Google
as egos as soon as Google doesn't think
that's the case it could be that Google
might just be better at the software
side of this they've been developing
their algorithms to just identifying
photos be able to tell that's a pet and
that's not a pet that's a stuffed animal
the idea that they can have that kind of
intelligence in their software Samsung
they they do have their own software
side they do have that new one UI that's
running on certain phones and supposed
to make things easier but I don't know
if they're at that level where they can
have the software run in the background
to make these photos work having more
cameras getting more and more
information I think that might be what
they're doing for now I think so
eventually maybe each of those cameras
will be amazing and the software will be
there but you know you're right about
the I'm think about the while is
charging again how much is this device
gonna get like drained by these other
devices I mean it's a V in a pinch if if
you have enough battery to spare but I'm
still not gonna rely on it maybe I'll
time I don't know I just think it is a
cool feature though it's cool but it
could be and yet so I'm gonna it's
debatable whether it's gonna be useful
or gimmicky and we kind of like have to
see I think it's I still like the idea
of reverse charging on devices wireless
or through USB C or anything else versus
not having it because then at least a
suggest that you could have an element
of flexibility with that phone like you
know that you have some way out if you
have them and what I'm saying else is
ran out of batteries and you're like I
just want that bit of charge I feel like
you're gonna do it to me years ago
weren't we supposed to today be living
in the world where we just went into the
cafe and could charge our phone on any
table and that that future never really
happened and happy to the Starbucks Wow
that's a paper show up anywhere like
they appeared briefly and then
disappeared that does exist at least in
the corner by my apartment there's still
at least two charges there and like a
couple down the block like all of our
ikea furniture in our house was supposed
to have it I don't know I just feel like
there was a promise that there and that
kind of didn't really give it that was a
screwy thing I've been covering wireless
charging for a long time it's like like
10 years ago were like when I first see
yes it's like this is charging yep
exactly there was power mat and then
they eventually formed to this wireless
Qi thing and that's great but the
problem that's actually happening with
wireless charging is the speed you got
these large batteries in these these
phones yeah and the trickle charge is
not good enough and the other thing is
like if you want to use your phone you
got to like leave it on a pad you're
like this kind of doing this it doesn't
really work for anything other than I
think like bedside charging put it right
there maybe stack the the buds on top of
that or your watch on top of that maybe
that's the way it works I like stuff
like we're gonna have Jenga eventually
with our devices at table 20 21 charger
the charge the other it's a little chain
of charging it's a good overnight
station and you're at with so many quick
charge possibilities plugging in is not
that hard and sometimes I feel like I
missed the the connector point on the
charger it go like a little off target
and then I get panic that it's there and
I keep shifting I like it for all the
other things though wearables buds like
a common standard no dongles
doing it for that I'm just thinking
about when I put the wireless my note 8
on the wireless charging I'd like I
watch it like a baby like okay he's
gonna come up yeah okay it's on
right okay good nobody touch anything
please don't let it fall off its total
Luci
like I'm it's just like I keep
rechecking it four times so we've seen
so many different leaks and other
products to Scott we've seen images what
appears to be we saw the buds in that
commercial
you've seen these wireless earbuds they
look like they're similar to like apples
at your ear pods excuse me there are
truly wireless headphones what do you
think of well I don't be seen also let
me say - like what's interesting is that
not to be forgotten the Samsung already
had wireless earbuds - so like you think
of these as Apple's answer to air pods
no Samsung had the gear icon X Fitness
buds that were wireless that beat Apple
they they were announced and came out
before air pods that year in 2016 but
who knows how these are different we'll
find out
and we're seeing like some it was seen
on now these are the the versions that
have been leaking out we've seen this
like I think I'm going to feature de you
know I don't know if earbuds can ever
look cool or not cool but like there's
nothing nothing exciting about the
yellow is kind of neat I guess if people
if you had yellow earbuds and maybe
people realize you have them in she says
leave me alone but it just seems like
yellow with my ears though like well
it's not like earwax yeah it's like
golden brown there you go
scram those in now nobody actually that
would get people to leave you alone I'd
imagine the same flash just earbuds I
mean also like I they're dropping in
price there's a lot of competitors and
their anchor makes a pair that we
reviewed on seeing that that are really
good yeah there's a lot of ways to go
with with that stuff now okay we're
gonna be going to the event and live
with Vanessa handle Rihanna in a bit
let's see oh you have watches look at
what we'll get to watch it yeah you'll
get to watch it very soon no vanessa is
at the event if you give us an idea of
what's it what it's like at the big
galaxy event she there on sky you that
says on skype some work will fine oh
yeah I know yeah I think she is here we
go even that's it we're here at galaxy
event worth of Bill Graham auditorium
I'm going to show you around over here
we're just about to take our seats so
I'm going to take you inside the main
events I'm going to flip over my camera
as you guys
to be discussing we're expecting a lot
of products at the event today including
obviously some phones wearables a lot of
things that have kind of already been
leaked but I'm turning it over right now
so you can see the setup it's a huge
huge venue and we're seated over here
I'm personally excited to see the other
stuff maybe that hasn't been leaked
although I doubt that there will be any
surprises at this point based on our the
rumors and all the leaks
here's to give you a sense of the crowds
I'm glad to see Samsung is still going
with their super blue super blue
everything yeah everybody looks at this
event so we're getting ready to take our
seats over here they've told us that
they're about to begin in about ten
minutes and it's hopefully gonna be a
long event based on all the things we're
expecting so we're gonna get comfortable
over here here's the scenic crew hey
guys
have you seen it is that a glowing floor
display I don't think so it might just
look like it's glowing but it's the it's
the reflections from the massive
password so repeating the area Samsung
has amazing stage tech at these like and
they've used secondary displays on the
floors for a number of these so I'm
always curious about what they're what
they're bringing to the table each time
even that's what's the mood like over
there I mean we've seen or we've seen so
many reported leaks on this is everyone
just kind of waiting around is kind of
going yeah we know it's this there's
three of these there's five of these
there's 80 of those what's it like over
there you know kind of and we've also
been standing in line outside for a
really long time we just they just
opened the doors about 30 minutes ago so
by the time we got in here it actually
seemed like we've been here for a while
now so I think that excitement kind of
was left at the door of her a little bit
I'm sure once the Swiss once this event
begins
I'm sure we'll start to feel the
excitement I think even though we do
know a lot about the devices that they
have in store because this is the 10th
anniversary of the galaxy phone and just
because there's so many important
products that are gonna be revealed
today I think there still is going to be
that sense of excitement once the show
begins like I said it's been it's been
kind of a huge build-up over here we've
been here for two hours now so I'm not
quite feeling it yet but I will I will
the excitement will come back from the
door what is that what is the music
that's playing there like just what is
that is that the Samsung song that plays
at the events oh yeah you know it well
it's gotta say what they have a custom
song there is a song that plays it every
if unpacked event I've been to in New
York I've been a bunch of them and it is
this looping hypnotic sort of orchestral
song they include it as like a part of
your phone as a ringtone to so you can
download it and listen to it if you have
a galaxy for galaxy watch I think of
course that makes all the sense in the
world it's sort of calming like you're
in an aquarium is there any teaser
things outside posters language a good
avocado toast like yeah was it was like
coming in there's been no food found it
coffee and tea but I'm kind of starving
other than that no clues unless that is
the clue you know there's a massive ten
over here obviously we're expecting the
es10
so that's pretty obvious but here we go
we're starting oh so we're going live
soon well thank you next look inside of
the event it's so blue and I'm hoping
the excitement does rise at some point
I'm wearing seeing it red so like an
interesting and color contrast effect
it'll look pretty under the lights good
to see you guys later
yeah thanks well a question on the
Twitter's is there time if it does start
we got Fidel Mendez tweeting with
hashtag CNET live hey guys shot
from the dominican republic blow it up
my question is what's your take on the
prices so for a consumer to own one of
these flagship versus the mid-range
phones or you know what do you what do
you what your feeling on that you know
the gradually increase in pricing has
been like just it's happened and
everyone's kind of accepted $1,000 to
what you pay for for the top-line phone
the fact that these companies are also
putting out mid-range phones samsung CEO
it's explaining some of these features
going to the mid-range phones first I've
the first like affinity Oh display was
on a mid-range phone so I think that the
pricing creeping up like this is kind of
just giving us a new standard as to what
to expect because we demand more and
more out of these devices and they're
acting much more like computers than
they ever did something and that's this
is just the harsh realities the price of
a computer now I'm also curious it's a
good question you know what happens is
these phones come out and they'll have a
certain price but you know Samsung
phones especially last year there all
sorts of sales there are things that
happen I'm curious what what
opportunities as a year goes on how
affordable will it get Apple went into
this over the past year to offer and all
sorts of rebates and other trade-in
things you preorder this phone you know
right it was already an offer like save
up to $550 so that's a question like how
much could you save how much how low
could it get maybe in a few months like
what else what else will there be it's a
good question because Samsung does write
it that at that top end on the premium
phone landscape or has been so we'll
have to find out and we seen wireless
carriers just like bogos with s 8's 9s
like pretty close to when they come out
it's really strange because it used to
be no it's not gonna happen for a long
time maybe you get a refurb but this
stuff I guess the price is that maybe
anchoring price idea of like it's a
thousand dollar phone you're getting it
for $7.99 maybe it's a lot better now I
asked you guys on Twitter the other day
what do you guys wanted to see out of
the Samsung event so Mike painter said
he wanted a phone with no notch or hole
he's like transparent screens exist a
second choice we just spread the camera
pixels between the screen pixels the
difference in size would allow it we do
the whole screen is a camera no I've
seen patents on this also comes in this
giant Samsung has patents on
basically Microsoft they each have their
own version of this in between the
pixels our camera lens pixels okay so
the whole screen becomes a camera now I
don't think that technology is close to
ready because if it was I don't see why
we wouldn't see it by now it's like that
definitely someone somebody we've tried
right why we would try let me see it's
interesting we've seen the Flex pie from
Royales like they have a flexible phone
they shouldn't but we haven't seen one
yet with a fully transparent display
maybe only person who liked it was a
xiaomi had that you could slide it in
the camera would be a vote in a nice
little slider phone I got to look at
like a peekaboo yes there's a peekaboo
and it wasn't like a pop-out it was just
like it was a slider it's lit a little
bit that does is it terrible well then
you have a people I don't know and why
would you add a mechanical element to
anything at the end people get a little
nervous what happens when it falls fan
with a crack yeah what goes it's
something goes in between it when a
turns right yeah peanut butter which is
the scourge of so many of our viewers
I'm not even kidding I've gotten this
exact exactly make you one peanut butter
for some reason that seamless several
people comments on these sliding phones
on Alphabet City and they're like peanut
butter it's gonna get in there I didn't
know this is a problem but there was a
number of people thinking about peanut
butter between the sliding I'm learning
something new every day
yeah do like we want phones to be nice
and sealed off so that we don't have any
any stuff to get in they do some sort of
mechanism and then yeah and John T green
said maybe he wanted to a non bendy
phone with 5g under $700 John I think
you're you really we all do you go for
that that sounds that sounds amazing big
fan of that keep your comments coming
with the hashtag seeing that live on
Twitter we're checking that out
Bridget's on top of that yeah right now
I got
Nalani who says she's unpacking her
lunch right now while watching a song
talk about impact so yes keep tweeting
that's to know why you're not bathed in
blue light you should be there's a lot
of people through unpacked who seem to
be packing for Mobile World Congress
you've been waiting all day I just
wanted to say that hacking during I'm
back to
let's get back to the waters you know
yeah because we have images leaked of a
new galaxy watch I'm not sure what it's
called this might be the active the jet
Scott I don't know what they're gonna
call that's what it's called it's called
the Jets so we've seen these now it
looks like Samsung has gotten rid of
their rotatable bezel yeah that was a
really cool design it's a very cool
design element so this is what we could
see today Scott what do you think these
wearables are going or what do you think
of what we've seen so far so Samsung is
stuck with Tizen over where OS now while
that might seem stubborn where OS has
been pretty challenged I'm not saying
that there aren't good examples in where
OS but it's it's not like it that is the
absolute perfect solution in fact
Samsung has comes with really great
solutions on its own for fitness
tracking and that have been superior on
on their watches which have been great
for sleep tracking for data for for
activities and and you know they've been
leading the pack with that and becoming
the go-to so I am super curious about
what they're doing I'm also curious
about whether you know you know what are
they gonna pursue any fda-cleared stuff
like I feel like that all of a sudden
became a thing in health tech and is
that something that's going to happen
here or not that's interesting I'm also
curious based on that that image where
they showed several lines of watches
like how much would it be like Fitbit
how much would it be like competing with
Apple watch how much would they say
whatever work we're making our own thing
that we care about we're not worrying
about anything competition so I'm
interested in those like what are the
things they need to be checked off does
sleep tracking already water resistance
for swimming how about a reason to buy
it misses great smartwatches yeah and
the Apple watch has gotten crazy health
features but like up are buying
smartwatches 16% of the US population
according to like the most recent survey
which is huge
think about it but there's nothing it
does I guess I've been them now just
fall detection that's the big thing and
lots of health left what's the only
thing why is this not the same old thing
yeah why do you need one over a phone
because let's say you want to buy an s10
and it costs like a grand like with like
we think it might be maybe it's gonna be
a $1,500 foldable phone or something
crazy like that what's gonna get you
shot out of another 250 or a device that
just sits on your wrist like it's got to
do
something different I still don't see
the huge reason for it yet yeah I think
fitness tracking has pretty much been
the main reason that in notifications
and that's why I think you're looking
like the pursuit of FDA clearance and
health tech is to try to get past that
wall to try to say it's for something
else but that yeah there's a whole other
wall to climb with that because you know
just because you put EKG on a watch
doesn't mean that it's something that is
really helpful for you in your life
unless that is an issue in your life
right it's a very specific thing it's
not a it's really it's for one
particular use one lead and not can't
detect heart attacks there's so the
whole bunch start with that but then you
get into like you know what is the thing
that people would use that they would
find reliable and you have to wait for
many of those to emerge for your doctor
to feel like that's an essential thing
is mostly doctors don't really care
about like I talk with my cardiologist
about wearable tech and she's kind of
passively interested but I can tell
she's just like you know lose weight go
to the gym Scott you know get your stuff
in gear I you know sure but sure why
don't you get a gear or not right so you
know I think that that's I think they're
always like concerned about the Watchers
like what are they one of those saying
versus what we recommend so I'm curious
about that that's why a lot of the talk
always feels like it's more about
lifestyle than like what it actually can
do like oh you know if you don't have to
look at this in your pocket or in your
purse music isn't my life so much better
that I've just glanced quickly you know
so I don't know I'm certain that I'm
feeling what you're saying here I'm not
feeling the extra stuff yeah the reason
Samsung also has a lot of aspirations so
it's interesting that with them last
year about a s-health and a bathroom
they have a lot of aspirations in
telemedicine which is very interesting
an area that like other companies really
aren't doing to the same degree inside
the SL app whether or not you're using
that there are ways that you could
connect with doctors they really want to
push to have this become a medical
service I don't know when that's going
to cross over to get the health data
that would then go into that but but
some of that is already happening with
SL would people find that that's a
comfortable path for them would they
prefer sign know merge from Google
big question marks but I think you know
I want to see if that's gonna be
something we hear about more today or
are they ready to talk about that maybe
they're not but but the health side of
it versus the fitness side on the
wearable front yeah the health tracking
aspects have really raised their game
when it came to these smartwatches so
there was fitness trackers you got this
separate you know we were talking
aspirational we did talk about the
folding phone a bunch but did you guys
see that today leaked renders popped up
online of the gallon what could be the
galaxy fold have you seen this online
from they had this device and it's got
it opens up and you see this giant
cutout on the top right we have that
video up cuz that'd be really helpful
right now that's a bummer
can we sketch it oh well never mind okay
well you know I'll just give you an idea
what it looks like it kind of looks like
this thing right so you just open it I
have one
yeah just oh right here that's screens
right right with your dad okay and it
plays Nintendo games no this is just a
three-night what's compatible to
intended yes it's just a 3d yes but like
it looked a lot like this and it wasn't
as chunky but it was just we wanted to
hide in the back and sort of have the
glow no it looks like invention is about
to begin
let havoc glasses-free 3d to take you
there live don't forget we'll be back
with our Poe show to recap and analyze
all the news we'll have more info on a
giveaway and remember to tweet your
thoughts and questions with the hashtag
seen that live alright let's get to the
event shall we
come with me and you me you know
take on and you'll see into your
we begin with a spin
if you want to view paradise now simply
look around and view anything you want
the world
there's no
ladies and gentlemen please welcome to
the stage senior vice president of
product marketing Justin Dennison
thank you then hello ladies and
gentlemen welcome to unpacked all right
this is gonna be a great day as you saw
the galaxy fold is a device unlike any
that's come before it at Samsung were
driven to invent meaningful
breakthroughs and these days we
essentially live on our phones right our
screens are the windows to our worlds
but despite all the progress we've made
the size of our screens is still
fundamentally limited by the size of our
devices until now with the galaxy fold
we're creating a new dimension for your
phone and your life we're giving you a
device that doesn't just define a new
category it defies category with the
galaxy fold you get a powerful
smartphone and a revolutionary tablet
all in a single premium package when
it's folded it has a 4.6 inch display
it's compact and perfectly portable but
when the device opens up your world does
too with a massive 7.3 inch Infinity
flex display that transforms the fold
into a tablet thank you thank you it's
gorgeous
now in order to create a brand new type
of smartphone we had to develop brand
new ways to design engineer and
manufacture from the screen to the frame
to every element you can see in touch we
left no stone unturned
one of the biggest challenges was
building the backbone of the device
something that could hold strong even
after hundreds of thousands of folds and
unfolds so we invented a sophisticated
hinge system that allows you to open and
close the galaxy fold smoothly and
naturally and the beauty of it is you
don't even see it the hinges multiple
interlocking gears are hidden giving the
device a seamless elegant look and
that's just one of the ways we carefully
consider the design of the fold we also
gave you four Galactic colors to choose
from cosmos black space silver Martian
green or Astro blue thank you
and depending on the color you choose
you can make it your own by
personalizing the hinge color to all
right they like it the Galaxy fold is a
one-of-a-kind luxury device and there
are limitless ways use it with two
different screens it's perfect for any
situation when closed it fits right in
the palm of your hand so you can send a
message to a friend or make a call with
one hand while you're on the go of
course sometimes you want a larger
screen and the galaxy folds infinity
flex display gives you a powerful
multimedia experience with immersive
visuals and sound buy AKG your favorite
movies come to life in vivid color and
rich audio and the interior screen is so
large that it power is a truly
next-generation experience one never
Bhasin never before seen on a smartphone
three app multi testing yeah thank you
so you can watch a YouTube video of
Hawaii text your friend about it and
browse travel options all at the same
time each screen works perfectly on its
own but the fold is more than two
separate screens
it's a unified device these displays
work together to give you a singular
seamless multi-screen experience and the
key to making this possible is called
app continuity and what that means is
that you can switch between the screens
without missing a beat so when you
stumble across an interesting Facebook
post on the front display you can simply
unfold your phone to see all the details
on the bigger screen it's amazing thank
you
the beauty of three app multitasking and
app continuity is that they let you use
the most important apps to you the way
you want and that's because we worked
with Google and the Android developer
community to optimize apps like whatsapp
and Microsoft Office for the Fuld's
unique dual displays we also worked with
YouTube to give galaxy users access to
YouTube premium thank you
now to ensure that all these apps run
smoothly the Galaxy fold needs
unprecedented unparalleled performance
so that's what we gave it the fold has a
state-of-the-art seven nanometer
processor and 12 gigabytes of RAM making
it one of the most powerful smartphones
on the market
there's more there's 512 gigs of onboard
memory and for the first time on a
mobile device support for universal
flash storage 3.0 which means they know
what it means this means you'll be able
to read data twice as fast as most other
smartphones making it incredibly
responsive now you may be sitting there
asking yourself how did we build a
battery into a phone that folds right
down the middle well the answer is we
built two of them one on each side of
the device our engineers have developed
special technology to combine energy
from both batteries into a single power
source now that is a whole lot of power
thank you the Galaxy fold is incredibly
versatile it's a smartphone a tablet and
a camera that fits in your pocket and
the camera is just as flexible as the
rest of the device in fact it's actually
a system of six cameras three on the
back two on the inside and one on the
front the phone will always be ready to
capture the moment no matter which way
you hold it or you fold it now it's one
thing to hear about all the folds
incredible capabilities for me but it's
another to see them for yourselves
let's take a look hey Josh can you help
me out hey Justin everybody this is Josh
Kim please welcome thank you thank you
I'm really excited to show everyone what
the fall can do as you can see if fits
perfectly in my hand first let's unlock
it all I have to do is place my thumb on
the side and I'm ready to go it's really
quick we have all the usual suspects
here here are my messages here's my
email and my playlist on Spotify pretty
much everything that I already do on my
phone
exactly I find it especially useful
folded when I'm on the go hey Josh can
we show them how to navigate with Google
Maps sure I can easily pull up Google
Maps but here but here's where things
get really cool I can unfold it and
instantly see the map on the big screen
that's amazing
that is amazing as you can see the same
map that Josh was just looking out in
the front display is already inside
waiting for him everything is just like
he left it that is the power of app
continuity and now he can see so much
more the street names the restaurants
all in greater detail okay so how about
we check out another app on the big
screen
how about Netflix sure I'm a huge fan of
Netflix I usually watch it on my tablet
but now I can watch it right on the
fault wow that is a gorgeous display so
I see what you mean the fold is perfect
for watching videos reading your
favorite books or taking a video call
and you can do all three at once oh well
we have to see that so let's say Josh
wants to watch YouTube and chat with his
friend on whatsapp at the same time and
you never know when he might need to
Google something there you have it
that is three at multitasking in action
on the left the YouTube videos playing
on the right he's messaging a friend and
if it needs to browse the web it's right
there in the third window and if he
wants to browse in the bigger window he
can do that too all he has to do is just
drag the browser over to the larger
display it's so simple it's simple and
seamless and the screen is big enough to
fit all three apps now that was great
thank you for all your help Josh Josh
Kim everyone thank you
so whether it's open or closed the fold
lets you use your favorite apps in
completely new ways that's the magic of
the galaxy fold it's unlike anything
you've ever seen the fold comes in both
an LTE and a 5g version starting from
nineteen hundred and eighty dollars
depending on your region and carrier and
you can get your very own galaxy fold
starting on April 26th
now a luxury device deserves luxury
packaging right and maybe a little
something extra perhaps a pair of our
new dynamic earbuds which you'll hear
about later today and in just a few
weeks you can be one of the first in the
world to take home the galaxy fold it
will change the way you interact with
the world around you we've been working
to refine every aspect of the fold we
fine-tuned every detail to create a
device that will enrich your lives and
we know that you'll use it in ways that
we haven't even imagined yet because
that's what you do you give our
innovations new meaning unpacked is a
celebration of our journey together over
the last decade and today we're
introducing a host of devices that will
come to define the next one so let's
take a closer look at where we've been
and where we're going together thank you
very much
it's the largest Super AMOLED screen
available it's comparable to the amazing
dude cool performance inspired by later
mind-blowing LinkedIn whooping Dustin
right distance
the first microphone
the to the pixel we've gone leap on
these fini to display that except dual
aperture for amazing shot
ladies and gentlemen please welcome to
the stage president and CEO head of IT
and mobile communications division DJ
Cole
Thank You Justin
he's my great pleasure to welcome you to
get a look-see unpacked 2019 let me
extend a special welcome again to
everyone joining us from London and
watching by the Samsung livestream hello
London I'll be there soon
what an amazing moment occasionally on
new devices interviews that overturns
expectations and assess this industry on
a new path a device like the gallops
fault
it's quite good couple of days use to
create the galaxy fold we reinvented
that this display from the grounder and
the launches a whole new smartphone
category we pioneered new technologies
created new materials and developed new
fabrication processes I'd like thank
everyone as Samsung who helped make this
possible thank you guys thank you
I'd also like to thank you for
motivating and inspiring us to create
groundbreaking technologies that are
changing people's lives galaxy fold
breaks new ground not just because it
defines categories it breaks new ground
because it answers skeptics who say
everything possible has been done that
the era of smart open innovation is over
and the smartphone is a mature
technology in a saturated market we are
here to prove them wrong today marks a
new beginning a shift let us see the
smartphone's role at the center of our
lives grow stronger as the value that
technology delivers grows deeper it
begins with the full liner of new
gallops of products and services
including a new family of Galaxy devices
that will launch the next decade of a
progress and innovation I'm excited by
what we have achieved but I'm even more
excited by what we have enabled
ten years ago when you introduced the
first galaxy s we had a vision for the
democratization of the smartphone
since then we have delivered more than
two billion galaxy phones thank you
with a bold and courageous spirit we
have created new device categories and
delivered innovative new services we
pioneered large screen phones and
transformed 12 Timothy by launching the
Galaxy Note with the S Pen we introduced
the edge screen and invented the
infinity display to provide deeply
massive viewing experiences and we led
the way in making smartphones truly
water-resistant so people can enjoy the
full power of their Galaxy devices
anywhere and in any weather now billions
of people have used the Galaxy phones to
create connect discover and enjoy and
newer company has done more to put a
smartphone at the center of our mobile
connected lives I'm proud of the role we
haven't played in creating a device that
has made people's lives richer easier
and more fun of course sometimes it's
not so easy these days there's a little
more competition than there was when we
introduced the first Galaxy S
in fact for the last 10 years this
industry has been racing to create the
smartphones that do just about
everything and they have become more
complex to use as Samsung we believe
there's a better way our vision is to be
the innovator of a new mobile
experiences that flow with us
seamlessly and continuously wherever we
go by harnessing the power of a fuji an
AI to pioneer a new generation of
immersive personal and intelligent
experiences experiences that reach
across every device platform and brand
there is only one way to achieve this it
takes open collaboration across a broad
ecosystem of partners who believe as we
do in innovation without barriers
partners who share our vision for
technology that serves your unlimited
capacity to imagine new ways to
experience the world on behalf of
Samsung either I thank all our partners
together we have made the smartphone the
essential tool of our modern lives and
now we are pushing beyond the limits of
today's technology to inspire a new
passion for smart phones and recharge
growth for our industry
it all begins now with the new family of
Galaxy phones and devices today you will
see a simpler more intuitive UI and a
bigger more beautiful display a camera
smart enough to capture ever experienced
and advanced enough to help you explore
everything you see security - Kim new
information safe and your privacy
protected plus the intelligence to the
moon and the power to beat faster
anywhere and anytime
so for those who say everything possible
has already been done I say open your
mind and get ready for the dawn of a new
mobile era - those who think they have
seen it all
I say buckle your seatbelt the future is
about begin
ladies and gentlemen please say hello to
the gallops s10 plus
thank you please welcome Suzanne to tell
you more about these amazing devices
Thank You DJ it's awesome to be here
with the galaxy fold we're introducing a
new category now we're introducing a
next-generation smartphone ten years ago
we unveiled the first galaxy s device
and it kicked off an evolution of
revolution that has redefined the mobile
experience for entire generation of
users and in the decade since we've hit
milestone after milestone we've never
stopped working to make our devices
better faster and more powerful will
never stop pioneering and engineering
new ways to make all our lives easier
for 10 years our smartphones have kept
you connected they've helped you to be
more productive and they've kept you
entertained for 10 years you've dreamt
bigger you've worked better you've
thought smarter you've shared and
discovered and explored but we're not
here today just to celebrate the last 10
years
we're here to lay the groundwork for the
next 10 and that begins with the galaxy
s 10
thank you at Samsung our vision for the
next generation begins with what's right
before our eyes the smartphone display
as you heard from Justin nothing sets us
apart more than our displays and the s10
is no different it's a triumph of
sampling innovation a phone design not
just to stand out but to stand apart now
the s10 screen covers the full front of
the phone from the top to the bottom and
from side to side but don't worry
everything you'd expect to find is still
there the sensors and the front camera
have been seamlessly integrated right
into the display itself to do this we
deliver a groundbreaking engineering
process and created proprietary laser
cutter we needed to be able to carve a
tiny hole in the display with absolute
precision
even a slightest mistake would damage
the surrounding pixels and make the
display unusable with this cutting-edge
technology we're able to defy the
traditional barriers of the display we
packed an array of sensors and camera
technology right into the screen itself
these essential features are floating in
a sea of individually placed pixels the
result a revolutionary new display that
maximizes your viewing experience and
minimizes distractions today we're
introducing the world's first infinity o
display on AMOLED this is the thank you
thank you
this is a truly next-generation
cinematic experience and with the
world's first dynamic AMOLED display the
s10 delivers peak brightness up to 1200
nits and can produce more than 16
million colors at a hundred percent
color volume what that means for you
it's very exciting this is going to be
the most color accurate display ever on
a mobile device
and that's not all this display also
supports HDR 10 plus and that means you
can enjoy your favorite content from
Amazon Prime video including the new
original series HANA in stunning state
of the art detail just like it was
intended to be seen the s10 uses dynamic
tone mapping which optimizes the
brightness levels so that even the
smallest details look beautiful right
down to the wisps of the clouds in the
sky the s10 has a bright brilliant
screen that is two of Rheinland
certified to reduce harmful blue light
of emissions by 42% and that's all
without applying a filter you can even
adjust the color temperature without
making any compromises in picture
quality so from unprecedented color
accuracy to unparalleled viewing comfort
dynamic AMOLED marks a new era and
display technology but this display
isn't the only piece of incredible tech
built into the front of your s10
embedded directly beneath the screen is
the world's first ultrasonic fingerprint
scanner
it's really a marvel of engineering to
use it simply press your finger against
the screen where it naturally rests the
scanner then emits ultrasonic waves that
map the unique pattern of your
fingerprint that wave data is then sent
back to the scanner and analyzed by the
phone's main chipset to determine
whether it's a match
all of this happens in the blink of an
eye and it even works in the most
challenging conditions it uses
ultrasonic rather than optical scanning
so the s tennis fingerprint scanner
performs better in bright sunlight and
wet conditions now you for anything like
the average Android user you probably
unlock your phone around 150 times every
day the ultrasonic fingerprint scanner
makes unlocking your S 10 easier than
ever the scanner also protects your data
with machine learning based algorithms
that are updated automatically just like
security patches and our anti-spoofing
algorithm can identify a fake
fingerprint whether it's 2d or 3d now
what that means is it's going to make it
significantly harder for someone to copy
your fingerprint and gain access to your
data and with the world's first phyto
Alliance biometric component
certification the scanners vault like
security will keep your data safe with a
dynamic AMOLED display and the
ultrasonic fingerprint scanner the front
of this phone is elegant so is the rest
of it the s10 comes in a variety of
stunning new prismatic hues or
you can choose one of two premium
ceramic finishes ceramic white and
ceramic black we can't wait for you to
see them for yourselves when you think
about it isn't it amazing how much
smartphone photography has advanced over
the past ten years just take a look at
some of the stunning photos galaxy users
took as part of with galaxy there is no
denying it smartphones have transformed
photography and here at Samsung we've
invested in cutting-edge camera
technology from the very beginning to
give you the most advanced experience
available on a smartphone
we've given billion
people access to an incredible camera
that fits in the pocket and yet there's
still one thing that all the pros can do
that most smartphone users can't and
that switch to the right lens for the
moment whether you're taking an intimate
close-up a group photo or a sweeping
skyline shot well with the s10 we're
introducing a camera that lets you
capture memories like a pro with a
single device and that's all thanks to
our brand new next-generation triple
rear camera system it's a pro great
camera that you don't have to be a pro
to use for capturing everyday moments
you have the wide-angle camera with a 77
degree field of view you can take
amazing crystal-clear photos day or
night and when you need to zoom in the
telephoto cameras optical zoom gets you
twice as close now finally let's say you
come across a beautiful landscape a
professional photographer would change
the lens so they could take a shot like
this one I'm thrilled to tell you that
this photo was taken in Spain with the s
tens brand new ultra wide camera
it's magnificent isn't it at 123 degrees
its field of view matches that of the
human eye so with this camera what you
see is what you get
it lets you capture the full scene just
as you see it all without having to take
a step back the ultra wide camera
doesn't just make your landscape
photography more beautiful
it changes the photography landscape
completely take panoramas for example
what do you guys think pretty good right
okay all right well the s10 makes your
panama's panoramas even more epic your
shots will stretch from the ground to
the sky so you won't miss an inch of
that incredible
you're not going to take miss an inch of
that incredible landscape that's much
better the ultra wide camera transforms
the way you take all kinds of photos
we've combined the powers of the
wide-angle and ultra cameras to give you
better perspective when using live focus
their more artistic - with new effects
that let you change the lighting and the
background blur you can use the
colorpoint feature to fade the colors
around the edges or mix it up with a fun
zoom or spin effect best of all you can
try out all of these effects in real
time even before you snap the picture
it's like having all the perks of a
photography studio right in your pocket
now creating a great camera isn't just
about squeezing in more megapixels it's
about giving users more utility more
versatility more options and that's why
the s10 has a programmer for every
situation
now there's one area where smartphones
have an even bigger edge with
traditional cameras and that's
intelligence because let's face it even
if our smartphones come with progre
cameras but all of us have been trained
to use them to their full potential and
that means that sometimes we could use a
little help composing the perfect shot
that we've already created an AI camera
that optimizes colors based on the scene
and now we've built on that foundation
by adding a neural processing unit that
makes the S tense camera even smarter
because the S 10 can process more data
it can recognize more scenes than before
so let's say you're taking a hike your
phone can not identify everything you
see along the way the mountain flowers
even the sunrise your phone will use all
of that information to help you take the
best possible photo the s10 can even
provide composition tips for your photo
like where to place a subject in the
frame or whether your photo is level
because even if you never studied
photography the s10 did using machine
learning we analyzed the composition of
over a hundred million professional
photos
that the s10 can give you the best
possible advice this camera is so
intelligent it's going to make every
shot worth sharing now still life photos
are one thing but life is never still
for long and that's why you need a
top-notch video recorder in addition to
the pro grade camera earlier you saw how
the s10 displays HDR 10 plus content by
optimizing the color tones when you
watch a video it does the same thing
when you record a video as well the s10
is the first mobile device in the world
capable of recording video and HDR 10
plus
it's gonna be exciting for you guys
because the videos you take with your
s10 will be brighter and more dynamic
than any video ever taken on a
smartphone and that's because the Pat
camera uses tonal mapping techniques to
go frame by frame to optimize the color
for every scene
do you see how smooth that video shot on
the s10 is now you can finally take
action footage right from your
smartphone the s10 shoots super study
videos on par with what you'd find in
most action cameras the s10 lets you
capture memories like never before but
like most things in life memories are
better when they're shared so sometimes
before you share a video on social media
you probably want to edit it a little
and now you can do that without having
to upload that video to a PC we're
excited to tell you that we've partnered
with Adobe to create a version of
premiere rush optimized for Galaxy
smartphones
adobe premiere rush puts a suite of
powerful editing tools right on your
phone
it supports decks an HDR 10 plus and it
delivers optimized graphics performance
plus it's really easy and intuitive to
use so you can edit and upload your
videos without missing a beat just shoot
a few stunning HD artem post videos cut
them together on your s10 and share them
instantly on social media it is that
simple now we have a couple of special
guests here today to tell you more about
adobe premiere rush their YouTube
channel coy sedan nerd was the first
tech channel in Brazil to reach 1
billion views so they know a thing or
two or more like a billion about how to
shoot and edit video please welcome to
the demo stage Leon Martinez and Nilson
moretta
hello everyone thank you to Samsung for
inviting us back to unpacked
I'm Leon I'm a news and you are youtuber
from Brazil and we'll be working with
some soon for years now yeah all around
the world in Brazil in Barcelona in
Seoul and now in San Francisco last
April in Seoul
we had dinner with DJ ko we told him how
much we love our Galaxy smartphones and
we told him something that would make us
love them even more the ability to edit
our videos is straight from our phones
the Galaxy series has the power to
record some amazing videos we use ours
to record videos for our YouTube
channels all the time but when it's time
to add it we always have to transfer the
rough footage to our PC in order to have
access to more advanced editing tools
well DJ listen to us that night and now
with the all-new Adobe Premiere rush for
Samsung we can edit from our is Mart
phones rush brings powerful editing
tools to Android so we can three more
videos do call a correction in even add
titles on our phones just like we can do
on a PC today we are super excited to
give you a sneak peek of rush on the
Galaxy S 10 here is a project we just
put together in the hotel room rush can
quickly make edits with rush we can
quickly make edits on the go with a
suite of color correction tools we can
set the perfect mood for the video and
combined with the S stands amazing
AMOLED display we know for a fact that
the colors we are editing will turn out
just as we intended now let's see how my
stories coming together done let's do
sherry
Russia lets you share your videos to all
your favorite social media channels from
within the app itself editing videos on
Galaxy will be easier than ever thanks
to a dog premiere rush we excited to
bring you a dog from me a rush for some
songs later this year it can't wait to
see the amazing content you will create
with the galaxy s 10 and Adobe Premiere
Rush thank you obrigada as you just saw
your s 10 can help you shoot and edit
exceptional videos it also helps you
take exceptional selfies because of the
significant improvements we've made to
its front camera we've added dual pixel
technology which lets you take better
pictures in low light and significantly
improves autofocus so now you can spend
more time composing your shot and less
time waiting for your camera to focus
and that's not all with the s 10 plus
you get two front cameras that work
together to capture depth of field
meaning you can take beautiful live
focus selfies just like these we all use
the camera on the front of our fans to
document our lives not just in photos
but in videos to record whenever the
mood strikes us and go live at a
moment's notice and that's why we made
sure that the s tense front camera
supports UHD video so you can capture
high quality content for many of us
sharing our favorite photos and videos
is part of everyday life we wanted to
make sharing easier and better than ever
so we teamed up with a partner who could
help us do just that Instagram to tell
you more about what we've been working
on please help me welcome Adam Missouri
Thank You Suzanne hi everyone
my name is Adam oh sorry I'm the head of
Instagram personally thank you first
thing I use Instagram to connect with my
closest friends to be inspired about
photography fashion design the
backcountry and most importantly most
importantly to me personally to share
stories about my two boys which is why
I'm excited to be here with our partners
at Samsung we've worked together to
rethink the experience of Instagram on
the s10 and the Galaxy S series has a
long history of empowering photographers
all around the world and we think that
that combined with how Instagram
connects you with the people in the
things that you love can make for a
really powerful combination so the
essence camera will have a new mode and
that mode is in we called Instagram mode
so when you take a picture with this
great camera you'll be able to easily
access Instagram stories to be able to
use our creative tools so stickers music
and more and then share with the people
that you care about on Instagram so the
s10 will be the best way to express
yourself on Instagram and so let's take
a look
Instagram and selfies aren't as much fun
alone so DJ do you mind coming up I get
them yes I appreciate you being a sport
instead we're here all right so you just
oh yeah
all right I'll list myself for you ready
big smile yeah okay so just like that
take a selfie we can add maybe a hashtag
and then oh well done just share the
Instagram that's actually shared so okay
I hope that's okay we leave okay thank
you so much yeah thank you for having me
excited about this collaboration and
more to come on the camera good all
right
thank you good job
Wow epic selfie guys thanks Adam and DJ
as you saw the galaxy s 10 gives you the
best Instagram experience available on a
smartphone but Instagram mode isn't the
only improvement we've made we're
pleased to announce that we're opening
up the galaxy cameras SDK so now when
you're in your favorite apps you can
access all of your favorite features
including low-light shots and HDR and
thanks to our incredible partners
snapchat snow and line the photos you
take from within their apps will be just
as good as the ones you take with our
camera we built the galaxy s 10 with a
pro grade camera system that is fits in
your pocket it's versatile enough to
take gorgeous shots in any situation
front or back
day or night wherever and whenever you
want and it's smart enough to help
amateur photo bugs like me shoot like
the pros just like the rest of the s10
this revolutionary camera system is
built on a foundation of premium
performance specs to tell you more about
the capabilities that will define this
new generation of smartphones
please welcome Drew blacker
thank Suzanne great to be here you've
already heard a lot today about the next
generation of mobile technology a pro
grade camera a sprawling into n display
even a whole new category of device and
all these innovations are built on a new
foundation of top-of-the-line
performance capabilities a foundation
that'll lay the groundwork for the
future of smartphones ten years ago we
introduced the first Galaxy S and it had
a class-leading 512 megabytes of RAM and
16 gigabytes of internal storage and a
lots changed since then now we play
console quality games we shoot videos in
4k and we keep all our music and photos
right on our smart phones so along the
way we've worked continuously to bring
galaxy users more power and more storage
and today with the galaxy s 10 plus you
can get up to 12 gigabytes of RAM and
one terabyte of base storage
crazy right
that's laptop level storage without the
laptop and if that's not enough it also
comes with our standard microSD slot so
you can expand your memory up to a
terabyte and a half from expansive
speeds from expansive storage to
advanced speeds the s10 is like having a
supercomputer in your pocket it's new
processor enables up to 29% faster CPU
speeds and 37 percent faster GPU speeds
than the s9 that means that the s10 is
powerful enough for some incredible
experiences take gaming for example next
month our partners at unity are
launching a new feature called
adaptive performance to enhance their
game development platform and we've been
working with them every step of the way
of the thousand most popular games in
the world nearly half are created unity
with unities development platform and
today we're proud to announce that the
s10 will be the first mobile device
optimized to work seamlessly with their
adaptive performance feature you'll get
a smoother more seamless gaming
performance even with the most graphic
intensive games and we're already
working with unity and com2us
to bring new games like summoners war
lost Santeria right to your s10 now
let's talk about another one of s toon
superpowers it's battery the s10 plus is
equipped with an all-day battery lasts
up to 25% longer than the previous model
that's because we added a new layer of
intelligence that delivers even more
efficient power management by learning
how you use your phone the s10
identifies the apps that you use less
often then it automatically optimizes
their CPU settings to consume less power
and it only gets smarter over time the s
tens battery is more intelligent and
more powerful than ever before in fact
it's so powerful that it can power more
than just your phone let's face it these
days we carry around a ton of devices
we've got phones in our pockets wireless
earbuds in our ears and smartwatches on
our wrists it's getting harder to keep
all those devices charged without
carrying around a tangle of cables
everywhere we go that's why we built the
same technology
we use in our wireless chargers right
into the s10 transforming your device
into a wireless charging pad it's pretty
incredible
you just place a watch earbuds or even a
friend's smartphone onto the back of the
s10 and wash the battery fill up when it
comes to charging your own device rs.10
line up supports fast wireless charging
2.0 which can charge from 0 to 100 up to
36% faster than before with a phone this
powerful you want to stay connected
everywhere you go so we made the Wi-Fi
experience on the s10 even smarter with
machine learning your phone can tell if
you're in a place where the Wi-Fi might
be a little unreliable and it can tell
if you're on the move if you're in a car
walking down the street and when the s10
senses changes like these it seamlessly
switches to an LTE network and it makes
that switch twice as fast as before the
s10 can also distinguish between secured
and unsecured Wi-Fi networks in real
time so you don't accidentally connect
to a suspicious Network and when it
comes to Wi-Fi speeds the s10 is built
for tomorrow we're pleased to announce
that the s10 is the first ever mobile
device compatible with Wi-Fi 6
Wi-Fi six this next generation network
that supports speeds up to 20 percent
faster than the s9 and you know when
you're in places like the airport you
can't connect because there's so many
people on the same Wi-Fi network
that's when Wi-Fi 6 will make a huge
difference because it works four times
faster in crowded areas in fact thanks
to our partners at Cisco all of you here
today will have a chance to try out
Wi-Fi 6 on an s10 at the product
experience zone right after the show
from it's always on connectivity to its
ultrasonic fingerprint security from its
pro-grade camera and immersive display
to its wireless charging superpowers the
Galaxy S 10 is a next-generation device
and we've designed three different
models so you can choose which version
is right for you s10 offers a premium
galaxy experience with all the features
you've come to know and love over the
last decade the s10 plus supercharges
that experience giving you more screen
more cameras and more battery and the
s10 II has all the essentials in a more
compact form factor so no matter what
you're looking for there's a
state-of-the-art galaxy that's perfect
for you to help us take a closer look
please welcome back our demo expert Josh
Kim hey Josh hey Joo this is so much fun
I'm honored to show everyone the s10
lineup for the very first time well see
you have all three models there so which
one's your favorite Josh well I love the
s10 II it feels really nice in my hands

Josh yeah all feel these models come in
a range of beautiful colors I like the
black one personally but there's a color
that's right for everyone
awesome and a lot of people have been
asking about the size how does it size
compared to the s9 can you show us sure
so here I have the s9 on my left and yes
10 on the right as you can see the size
of the phone we've kept it really
similar but once you turn on the device
the display you can see the s10 has much
more screen and of course that's because
while the s9 has the infinity display
the s10 has our infinity o display
sonic fingerprint scanner we show them
how it works
sure it's really simple all I do is
place my thumb on the bottom of the
screen that's it top that is really easy
now let's take a look at the camera can
you show us the camera sure let me show
you how amazing the different lenses are
on the s10 comes with multiple cameras
on the back so you have the right lens

thinnest and lightest yet the Samsung
ecosystem grows stronger every year as
we add newer more powerful devices but
an ecosystem is only as powerful as the
connections among its devices which is
why we're thrilled tell you about
another incredible breakthrough a
network that will soon change mobile
connectivity as we know it to tell you
more please welcome back drew Blackard
thanks Selina we've talked a lot today
about the future a future where our
smartphones are more than just
smartphones a future led by a generation
that expects more from their technology
a future where all our devices including
the ones we wear are seamlessly
connected but to make that future
possible we need one more essential
element a next-generation mobile network
that network and the key to our
connected future is 5g now back in the
day first generation networks basically
let us make phone calls without the
cords second generation networks
introduced mobile data and that assured
in an era of texting it changed the way
we communicate 3G made connecting to the
internet on the go a reality it made
mobile email and web browsing the new
norm and over the last decade 4G paved
the way for a new app economy the rise
of social media and streaming music and
video each network evolution has been
accompanied by mobile revolution in 5g
represents our biggest step forward yet
first off it'll be faster than any
network we've ever seen roughly 20 times
faster than 4G second it'll be capable
of just a millisecond of latency which
is the amount of time between an action
and a reaction and that opens the door
for some incredible new possibilities
like remote surgery cloud gaming and
autonomous driving in third it can bring
on as many as 1 million devices per
square kilometre that's 10 times more
than what's possible today
soon network congestion will be a thing
of the past
5g will change everything it'll enable
us to connect and communicate in
entirely new ways it will empower
creators and innovators to bring to life
ideas we never thought possible and it's
true it won't happen
overnight it'll be step by step in the
whole tech industry has been laying the
groundwork for 5g for decades in samsung
we've helped lead the way that's because
we're uniquely positioned to provide
end-to-end solutions for 5g we make the
systems that are bringing 5g networks
online and of course we make the devices
that connect you to those networks
whether they're in your home your office
or your pocket and today we're putting
the power of this incredible network in
the palm of your hand it's my pleasure
to introduce the galaxy s 10 5g
right now normally when you transition
from one network generation to the next
you get a device that's a little bit
bigger and a little bulkier but as you
just saw the s10 5g as is sleek and
stunning as ever and this beautiful
smartphone doesn't just give you access
to blazing speeds and unparalleled
connectivity it also comes with the best
of the best technology so you can get
the absolute most out of this
revolutionary new network the sjs-ten 5g
has hyper fast speeds that will forever
change the way we consume content you'll
be able to download and watch movies at
phenomenal speeds and stream games
on-demand via the cloud all your
favorite content will be accessible in
an instant and for that reason we gave
this device a big screen and a long
lasting battery the s10 5g comes with a
stunning six point seven inch dynamic
AMOLED display as well it's a 4500
milliamp hour battery that's the biggest
screen and the biggest battery ever on a
galaxy s device
your device will charge quickly too
because it comes with a special 25 watt
charger as network speeds get faster
we'll be able to use our phones to do
things we can hardly imagine today to
power these experiences we outfitted s10
5 G with a cutting-edge camera system
that includes a powerful new 3d depth
sensing camera for starters this camera
allows you to take even more amazing
photos and videos for example you can
add things like background blur to your
videos in real-time maps and measures
the world around you in incredible
detail and accuracy and for augmented
reality this is going to be a
game-changer with faster network speeds
and 3d spatial mapping you'll be able to
interact with the world around you in
real time and it will feel more real the
s10 5g charts the path for the next 10
years of galaxy it's designed for a
hyper-connected world where everything
and everyone is right there at your
fingertips we are excited for you to
experience the magic 5g and this is just
the beginning in the coming years we're
gonna evolve from blazing speeds
uninterrupted connectivity and true
mobility to truly connected living to
share more about our vision for the
future of 5g please welcome back DJ Koh
for nearly a decade we have been on a
quest to transform 5g from the dream of
a small group of Samsung researchers
into commercial technology that will
change the world from the first
transmission to a vehicle traveling over
100 miles per hour to hand over between
cell towers to the world's first
residential 5g service and most recently
in Korea the world's first 5g mobile
service we have advanced 5g step by step
but most important we have a build an
ecosystem technologies solutions and
partners we would not be here today
without the great network operators in
Korea Australia Europe and the United
States who are helping us bring the
power of a 5g into the real world I'm
thrilled to introduce the carrier
partners who chose the Samsung Galaxy S
10 5g for the commercial 5g services
congratulations on 10 exciting years
with Galaxy devices Samsung friends
Sprint customers cannot wait to get
their hands on the Galaxy S 10 we know
it will be the best one yet and we're so
thrilled to launch Sprint 5g this year
as we continue our trusted partnership
with Samsung
just imagine the endless possibilities
when we pair out blazing fast 5g network
with your innovative 5g smartphone from
all of us at Sprint
thank you for taking this journey
together
and cheers to the next 10 years of
galaxy Vodafone's always valued its
strategic relationship with Samsung
we've had wonderful devices from you
including the very first galaxy we are
super excited about the s10 its new
design its features its technology and
particularly excited about launching the
first 5g device on our new networks this
year please keep up the great work good
luck on the launch and we are right
behind you happy birthday galaxy from
the entire Deutsche Telekom family I
remember pretty well the first day when
I was trying to sell a samsung phone to
a German customer not easy you launched
the Galaxy S and 10 years later you were
the world market leader what an
unbelievable success over the years we
have built a trustworthy relationship
even a friendship we stick together in
good times and in bad times we have
mutual trust among the partners and we
believe in work hard play hard so let's
rock the future
either I thank all our esteemed partners
who have worked so passionately to help
us to bring 5g to the real world here in
the US our first 5g partner was Verizon
we have been working together to
accelerate the development of a 5g since
2017 today it is my pleasure to
introduce Verizon CEO harness Westerberg
what the show thank you thank you thank
you it's great to be here and first of
all I would like to thank the whole
galaxy family the Sam Soon for the ten
years of unparalleled innovation that we
have seen and and of course we had
Verizon has been enjoying that journey
fantastically and we are also on behalf
of Verizon been extremely exciting to
see the range of products that have come
out today
all of them gonna fit nicely into our
more than 150 million mobile subscribers
here in the US but to be honest I lived
a bit more excited for the 5d phone it's
just amazing that finally we're standing
here at the brink of bringing phi d to
the market and we're also proud to
announce that our customer our Verizon
customers they're going to be the first
to get the five D phones in their hand
because of the collaboration and the
innovation we're doing together with
Samsung they're going to be the first
getting into their hands that's great
as DJed said it's not the first time we
do in collaboration together we have
done that over years and actually the
first 4G LTE galaxy phone was first
launched for the customer a Verizon and
as you heard as a reason at last fall we
launched together the first five-year
service in the world which was the 5g
home the five-year home is a totally new
innovative way of bringing broadband to
the home not with fiber but with foggy
wireless and that tells you little bit
about the collaboration but it also
tells you quite a lot about the
experience about 5g how transformative
Friday will be 4G is fantastic and there
and our network at Verizon is fantastic
on 4G but the bonus it gives you speed
and throughput when you think about 5g
you're gonna have so many other
capabilities we at Verizon we call it
currencies and Feige has eight
currencies everything from enormous
throughput speeds low latencies
as well as millions of devices being
connected at the same time better
battery life etc that is what you can
innovate on and that's what you bring to
the table and to do that you need to be
in the great network that's what we are
good at we build a network with a lot of
fiber edge compute with virtualized
Network and on millimeter wave spectrum
which really can bring the speeds and
the latencies together to you as a
consumer or a business so we are excited
on fire D and we're exciting to build
this together with Samsung and bring it
to the market and I would say if you are
not excited about it
we at her eyes are super excited to
bring this far the phone to the market
and your stay tuned because soon it can
be in the hands of you when we launch
this together with Samsung thank you

phone like here it is it's right it's
here it's $2,000 $1,980 is coming on
April 26 they actually add a date on it
wasn't ice crazy second quarter yeah
second half of the year it's coming it's
right around the corner that's absurd
then you have the inside you have a
seven-point inch 7.3 inch display
outside the four point six inch display
six total cameras which is hilarious to
say there's three on the back to on the
inside when you open it up and one on
the front when you close it up the as 10
plus was next we saw it looked like
everything that leaked said has shown
there was a 10-year $750 the S 10 starts
at 900 the as 10 plus starts at a
thousand and the buds come free with the
10 and the 10 plus if you pre-order they
had wearables before the buds and the
new watches and then we finally closed
off with the s10 5g which is coming to
Verizon first in the United States
iPhones man five six point seven inch
display iPhones any one is one set of
buds all of that let's go all of one
bridge it will be your favorite
announcement out of this entire event
how refreshing was it to get all the
gold about that folding phone in the
beginning and also I was really
impressed with it like okay you see so
many phones all the time this is the
first time I think I was legit excited
about what the future
yes it's a luxury product yes it's too
grand and maybe there's no real need for
it but oh it's cool because I didn't see
a seam on that thing although um you
know I have on my computer here some of
the playback from from from the reveal
for those who want to see it
a few people were making some jokes on
Twitter I think the real innovation will
come from the case maker what do you do
about the case philosophy because it
already folds yeah are you putting like
a skin on it or you I don't know yeah
yeah and then IBD yeah but it is
exciting to see something so different
you know to kind of change things up a
bit but of course you got to see like
like look at that screen right it's very
squarish that that tablet size yes you
like the aspect ratio is 4 point 2 by 3
so it's almost 4:3 it's a little bit
larger than that so it's not exactly a
like an old TV or an iPad Mini but it is
it is squarish I was I was very
impressed with this - what do you guys
think when the device was opened up on
the top right was a massive I don't know
if you won't call it a notch but there's
an area for the cameras and if this kind
of makes it look like a file folder on
the top this is very stretchy shape
there's a yeah it's a tab in the Sun
galaxy
but I wasn't paying attention that cuz I
was it was a gigantic screen so I kind
of felt like I wasn't really looking at
I was looking if I tried but it's it's a
massive display this is really
impressive I agree I think the question
is do do you want that is it ready for
you that is a lot of money but I also
think it's an interesting tactic I
thought this is gonna be coming out
later in the year now it's coming out
right after these phones and and it's
it's crazy expensive on the other hand
it's a luxury product on the other hand
it's not like I mean I've seen like the
$3,000 AR headset so I mean this is more
in the zone you could see yourself maybe
doing that if you that's the one you're
gonna want to show off you're not gonna
want to show off the s10 you're not
gonna be the cool person now with the
s10 with the galaxy fold on the horizon
so I mean that's the super
all phone like the multitasking use drag
your app where you want to be the big
and the small or two on the side okay so
it should be think about the history of
Android tablets because that was a mess
a complete and utter disaster Chrome OS
is really the way that even Google's
like if we got a tablet to run Chrome OS
the Android apps run on it but it's not
real this is the return of Android
tablets and I think this one won't fail
like the first round because the phones
got bigger and bigger and bigger and
with this generation I remember when
Samsung first showed off that foldable
they go we've been working with Google
on this to figure out how to make the
multitasking work we saw what three apps
at one time look pretty smooth and
they're building that into Android q
this is foldable thing is not expected
to go away so I think maybe it's got a
better chance because if it's just a
larger phone that's nice but when is the
point where is the drive I got a six
point seven inch 5g phone or I can have
a 7.3 inch tablet that's not that
tremendous I mean could look it with
that aspect ratio also what apps really
take advantage of exploding out to that
view and also have a lot of questions
about when it's folding like that if
you're really using it as a tablet how
does that feel is that comfortable does
it does it kind of fold in is it lock
into place
I mean classic yeah I mean if you're
like if I'm using it's like file a story
now or I'm like you know using like a
music app where you're gonna be playing
instruments and you're using it for all
the stuff you'd use for a tablet drawing
sketching and stuff will will that feel
fine on a thing that folds is it meant
to be kind of held in the hand like a
book is it does it lock it and become
more rigid oh no they didn't really go
into a lot of detail on that so I'm
curious that Hames look pretty happy
from the back yeah I would hope it would
lock open when you actually do have a
tablet mode it's open yeah maybe kind of
snaps into place and kind of stays there
but we didn't hear anything like like a
snap or anything like that I mean it's
still a lot of big questions it also
does look thick so I mean I think that's
it could be fine and there have been
thick bones in the past and there be
thick those of you sure it's just
another thought of like you know what
would that feel like when you're holding
it will it feel like when you're putting
in your pocket is that you're gonna be
using it fold it up because of that
screen being a little smaller right are
you gonna be always tempted to open it
up just
you could see better yeah well I had
that I'd unfold it all the time it's
I'll just be like on the subway train I
read the newspaper right checking you
know the cover display that's what they
called it the first time it's a 4.6 inch
display it's got a very strange aspect
ratio it's very narrow if you looked at
the video they only showed three icons
in the dock instead of four so you had a
much different approach a lot of space
on top yeah oh yeah when it comes to
bezels we're talking huge bezels on the
front but I think it's mines me like the
old like dumb phones where you have on
the back of my moto I can see this is
the time and the caller ID and for this
I could probably see email slack
messages texts that's what you would
keep the front for but when you want it
to lounge or you actually have the time
to read something you could use that use
the actual full on screen then again if
you want to save battery just fold the
dang thing up because I said this thing
had two batteries which I thought was a
joke at first but it's true yeah you got
a you know not had not been the battery
so we got to manage those and you were
mentioning to like the capacity on it
sounds maybe not as crazy high as you'd
think
the 4,800 4380 milliamp hours yeah so
that's about an iPad or like it makes a
little bit on the same level as the 5g
phone right 12 gigs of ram there's a lot
of interesting specs on this but the
three at multitasking is pretty cool mhm
that's and that's interesting yeah again
just it's that aspect ratio that like
makes me a little nervous like what are
you how good for videos we'll look how
what will you fit in those panes that's
even like with the iPad I've never liked
the multitasking panes and they feel
like they're too rigid sometimes they
don't work for apps as well as you'd
like so anytime you open up multiple
windows will the stuff you want fit
nicely it's a stupid question but is the
question right and that's the number one
thing like that's what makes that stuff
cool and your multitasking like in
really doing it but that mean might be
one of the bigger benefits of Android in
the long term that we had all these
different form factors all these
different shapes all these different
screen sizes we're Google it from the
base level the OS like okay look this
app has to work in this little four by
three things I'd be 16 by 9 18 by 9 21
by whatever all these bizarre
our ass good-bye or going to justify it
no matter what so if stuff doesn't work
right they're not gonna like well this
stinks I'm like well it's still like
what's that where are you from a TV show
where does it come from it can't be real
I kind of wish it had a stylist you want
a stylist coming it's that terrible to
say you wait for the fall is that where
they're going now it's a man this is
coming out April 26 like maybe they'll
have the next version of that until they
maybe come out this year who knows no
version makes a lot of sense and that's
when you scribble on anyway Mike might
it why not have a book that you can
actually write into seems like a time I
just feel also it should be emphasized
that it just shocks me that it's coming
out now it is not very long since we
were seeing the Royal flex
the royal flex PI like things that just
look like they were just kind of made
for the prototype and shown now CES and
now Samsung's like now this will be in
your hands now yeah and look how good it
looks leading the pack to a massive
degree on that
you look pretty slick it looked like
they actually add a real working device
they didn't show too much I'm they did
show a couple of times it working like
with a camera overhead and promo videos
want to be fair there is also a whole
other genre of phones that are the real
flex you know bendable SPF flex I like
things that you know might bend around
your wrist or have a that didn't seem to
be this this is a a folding champane
phone not something that you're gonna be
I don't even know what I would do with
that if I curved a device around but
that occur those will be coming to an
idol landscape well 10 last since
everybody knew almost everything about
that let's talk a bit about the
wearables because yeah there was a
Galaxy buds they looked exactly like we
thought they would look I did have the
power sharing feature so you could
charge it from a phone from wireless
earbuds you know a couple things that
weren't mentioned there that I heard
were cherishing is there they're
promising a new Kinect mode that's gonna
swap between Bluetooth devices not just
Samsung ones so maybe kind of like the
way xB you could have this work with
ever default assistant is on your phone
according to Samsung Google assistant
Alexa so that's good news they didn't
talk about that and it's down they're
also trying to get the size down get the
battery life up those probably matter
more these are also smaller at 30%
smaller yeah they're my kind of stuffing
like an impulse buy but they're
available with the pre-orders that might
get people buying the s10 because again
the yes now these were I think I don't
even know how to describe this because
it wasn't like the wrapping the screen
and I didn't know what was going on it's
got you have any idea what we were
saying well I think that you could
always navigating and it what's
interesting is that so the prices have
really come down that's where it's like
now competitive with price and then I
think they it's almost feels like
they've been trying to do whatever they
can to get into that landscape doing
active things like it's it's not
something you'd have to spin it a bit
but the other one too they my failing
remember that it's called the Galaxy fit
they call the fit it is called it looks
more like other fits on our story they
mentioned stress levels it's more than
that this watch is going to be part of a
blood pressure is interesting because
last year the Galaxy has 9 I didn't get
to sign up for this beta they also had a
blood pressure beta for the phone
pressure now I've been trying to find
out what's going on because it is like
you're gonna go the rabbit hole does I
go talk about it forever but come maybe
this can be nailed for clearance by I
don't know by 2020 is what I've heard
not from Sarah's not mentioned on stage
right at all and that's probably because
you're not going to try to confuse
people about that but we're looking for
a new health tech blood pressure matters
more I think for a lot of people in an
everyday basis maybe then EKG pressure
more people suffer from I'm a faith
appeal a lot of people suffer from it so
I don't want to get into points of that
but I think much more to say on it yet
has a dangerous thing that make claims
on as well because if people are
watching it and they make claims that
you just I mean everyone is has to walk
a very particular line even for stuff
that is FDA cleared then it's like Apple
stuff with EKG it's like you they do not
make claims anywhere beyond the zone
that they're cleared for it's like you
cannot even comment on it so so similar
thing here maybe I want to see a lot
more of that though and I really hope
fitbit's doing that with sleep scores
and trying to measure sleep
interruptions to try to look at
apnoea so their areas for health
clearance and I love that Samsung is
pushing into this and I would love to
see it happen sooner than later you
talked a little bit about the s10 since
that's what this event was supposed to
be a model there's the s10 II which is
it's flat it has only two cameras on the
back oh it's got that hole-punch display
on the front you've got that starts
thing of 750 you got the yes time ten
regular one camera on the front three
cameras on the back they all I believe
have the Snapdragon a 55 processor then
there's the ten plus is where Samsung
spent the most time showing us that
device because it's got the two cameras
on the front yeah three on the back a
$2,000 for a $50,000 phone and at the
end of 5g version which was even larger
that six point seven inch display which
was gigantic I kind of ain't care about
the 5g way because I was thinking about
the fold I felt like the 5g was maybe
the most forgettable phone because it's
like the future you can't really have
yet mm-hmm and the future you could play
around with it be the fold so 5g I'm
like okay yeah there's a race to be
first and and then something that we
have no networks really built out for
totally yet so yeah like when you get it
you know what are the chances that you
can really see its full potential and
what is the AR capability that's like
you kind of they toss that out it's got
a time-of-flight sensor which going back
to google tango the the AR phone that
Google had made yeah yeah there was the
basis for what happened later with you
know a our headsets time-of-flight
measures of distance can be used for air
headsets and things like that but how
does that you know more realistic AR but
that all depends on what after your
making and is it Samsung making those is
that with Google is that an upcoming
it's like to lead the pack on sign
before that's part of Android you just
don't want you to forget that they're
part of the conversation right because
sounds good to be talking about they are
in their phones you're gonna whole year
you're play a are games in the courtyard
we're referring to the fourth camera on
the back of the 5g correct yes that's
we're talking because there's four
cameras on the back of that one because
you got five g's you got four cameras
you got to have that so well five
account on the front yeah yeah oh yeah
from the back to the front but the
better for depth sensing as well for
photos they're mentioning that but it's
like even superior for that stuff yeah
we do have a question it came in on a
hashtag CNET live talked about power
share um so will it work with the last
generation watch Christine asks and if
I'm understanding it right it works with
any like she type of charging right good
question so apparently does work the
last generation Samsung watch which is
great now now this is where it gets to
wearables and the problems of charging
wearables I feel like I have a small
burp coming on so anyway they what's a
rear ran things I apologize he's
everything goes about to burn it's a lot
of people it's live so edit I had a root
beer so you know anyway they were there
went Fitbit has a dongle Apple watch
does not use Qi it's super annoying in
the landscape and I love that Samsung is
using Qi
so anyway that's it and not a future
you're gonna find on other watch
wearable combos that's the answer and it
should work with any cheap thing
including an iPhone we tried it with an
iPhone in the video and seeing that it
might be you can charge oh you put my
phone on the s10 yeah so anything that
is but for phones that's pretty standard
issue for wearables that is not an
assumption that your wearable lots of
proprietary connectors for those if I
get to lay flat on a device like that's
not very easy that's true I don't know
that's when you have to hurt devices and
you have I mean they had trouble with
the demo with the watch itself they had
to put it on there twice so I don't know
if it was just imbalanced or what's
going on there and it's a good thing
that the buds have a nice flat bottom
case because if you have a Fitbit and
they're all curved or something yeah
it's a real pain in the neck getting
that just their little clamp thing on
there let alone a wireless charging
device that's a totally different idea
is just kind of neat you can't count on
it maybe for like a full charge it like
how do I put it like for everyday use
maybe but if you're traveling and you
only have your main phone charger with
you this could be helpful like overnight
for your accessories right I love it for
that I love it for the smaller devices
even workers like you said for a phone
how fast it's a 5 watt Wireless charge
that's gonna be on the back of
mm-hmm so which is slow and how long you
gonna take to charge up your your phone
it's gonna be a long time but a wearable
of a watch that could be done in an hour
or less and so maybe you'd have to keep
your phone facedown and while you're
doing it it would be like at the office
but if you forget your charger mm-hmm
for the other things then that would be
great if Samsung I'll just shut up there
ultrasonic fingerprint sensor which is
supposed to be more secure than the
previous generation using no it's all
optical and now if you have a fake
finger trying to fool this it's not
gonna happen Scott know it so well I
don't
I've yet to do full testing on this but
it is a it's a this would be a 3d scan
so it's an ultrasonic scan of it it's
not it's it's to protect against
spoofing from 2d images that is only in
that zone where the thumb press of so
it's not that sensor is not throughout
the entire screen it'll guide you to put
your finger down and then pretty quickly
it'll it'll scan it
it's Qualcomm's ultrasonic technology
for the fingerprint sensor and we're
starting to see this on more devices
this is a really big mainstream
deployment of it so that's cool I love
that they're putting it on most of the
phones that they're doing and just
saying this is it
you know it's it's gonna be available
yes 10 is going to have a fingerprint
sensor built into the power button so
that using the ultrasonic yeah that's
the difference so if that one's a side
button which i think is actually a
really good placement for it anyway so
then we might prefer it a bit depending
on the person yeah like you might feel
that that's like a nice convenient I've
read scene that's a report on the s10
and they dropped the iris scanner if you
want to do biometrics you've got to use
the ultrasonic fingerprint sensor or the
side scanner that scanner wasn't that
secure face scanner wasn't iris was
pretty good I actually love to actually
make payments with which was totally
different than the face scanning what
was the face scanning was just yeah very
yeah they did have some other
intelligent scan which was a common it
was a face scan plus iris not really it
was a bad combination they wouldn't let
you use samsung pay with it which means
they didn't trust it well they trust
samsung pay with iris scan and unlocking
your phone so that's gone I was the one
person using iris scan apparently I like
a day MANET now we're gonna
do did you feel like it was like easy to
set up on the go yeah it's pretty simple
I mean if you weren't gloves instead of
trying to get your fingerprint in there
it's a real pain in the neck
just look at the thing and it works is
it it's not as fast as a face ID I'll
say that I've found that would be much
faster but this is still pretty dang
secure that's gone that's dead so the
one thing that died that no one will
remember the iris come back it'll come
back and when they open up the folding
one oh there's another higher scanner
awesome to make sense when we got a lot
of feedback uh with the hashtags CNET
live people talking about how impressive
the whole lineup was one to comment the
biggest takeaway for me and s9 Plus user
is the video editor dobby push solved so
many of my hassles they add a lot of
videos on my phone but you know using
third-party apps another comment the
front screen on the Galaxy fold is so
small it reminds me of a dot display I
had an old Sony Ericsson flip okay but
smartphones were not far off from that
size I feel like you know looks inches
yeah yeah larger than the iPhone which
was like three-and-a-half yeah exactly
like you know let's let's be realistic
here so pretty much like a watches
stacked on the top and yeah yeah you can
read plenty of emails on there any final
thoughts I was gonna say one more
question though from Christina for the
one that has the fingerprint scanner
does it have a pressable home button
like this is there any way to like have
something I don't believe there's been a
home button on Samsung devices for a
while the s8 s9 the note 89 they do not
have home buttons I do know that you can
press on the screen and although haptic
feedback thing to wake up the old button
on exactly the home button you know go
back to these like a virtual click and
yes it's satisfying
yeah but overall yeah we talked about
how like man we've going into this
knowing so much and I feel like this was
a refreshing presentation that
definitely has us thinking differently
about I don't know the future foldable
it's like what you said like we were
seeing all of these these devices coming
out they're like hey look we're trying
to fold the screen and now it's like
ba-bam here's how you do it well I think
like I was so ready for this to be a
tease of that phone again like we said
oh hi
curtain when the shadows lurking I have
another foldable phone more to come at a
future date and because this was as much
a launch event for that phone as for the
rest of them it really changed the
nature of all of it I think it was
really this is the Galaxy fold event
with also some views about the rest of
the products in the line and I think
that that's that's really cool that's
not what I think ever anyone expected I
didn't expect that I expected news but I
didn't think it would it would be that
fully detailed and that ready to go so
soon definitely a smart presentation
strategy it's leading off look you guys
want to know about this let's just talk
about it yeah here we go and I applaud
them for that because sometimes you wait
and you wait like our financials this
year we made $8 and when we sold the
dilemonade for some reason so it was
kind of nice even there was a long
presentation I didn't do it for us it
CNET thank you for joining us today if
you've got questions about Samsung's if
then let us know on Twitter if you're
watching us now on YouTube hit that

show is awesome so long from New York
Samsung isn't celebrating its tenth
anniversary of the Galaxy S with just
one phone it's actually giving us four
including the galaxy s 10 plus sir the
galaxy s 10 II the regular Galaxy S 10
and their very first 5g phone with the s
10 phones
Samsung has taken the very best of the
galaxy s 9 and refined it giving you an
extensive screen space and a much
smaller package than you'd expect there
are those curved edges we love an
extremely thin bezels that really pull
you into an all screen experience
thankfully there's no eyebrows shaped
notch on these phones that will
interrupt your view of the screen
instead Samsung has amped up this
expansive screen by cutting out a tiny
hole for the front-facing camera to fit
into the display or in the case of the s
10 plus an oval that fits in to lenses
here's another big feature an in screen
fingerprint reader that unlocks the
phone when you press your finger to the
target this is a huge improvement over
blindly searching for the s nines
fingerprint reader on the back the
galaxy s 10 phones are the first to have
qual comes ultrasonic fingerprint
technology which uses sound waves to
unlock the phone other phones with
fingerprint readers use optical sensors
which are critiqued for being easy to
fool I didn't get a chance to set up my
own fingerprint this time but I will be
all over that in my final review these
phones feel thin light and easy to hold
they have a headphone jack water
resistance and wireless charging support
there's even a mode you can turn on to
wirelessly share power that lets you
charge another Qi enabled device using
the Galaxy S tens battery reserves don't
worry the phone stops sharing when
you're down to 30 percent so you won't
completely run out of juice by now
you've probably noticed that the S 10
phones come in flashy colors like
flamingo pink prism blue prism green and
canary yellow in addition to glossy
white and black the larger Galaxy S 10
plus also comes in white and black
variants made with ceramic backs Samsung
says these are Mordor
than the regular glass packings
unfortunately you can't get every color
in every country but she should have at
least one snazzy shade to choose from
samsung cameras have always been a
selling point and this year at the
galaxy s 10 plus and e have a 16
megapixel ultra wide lens and a 12
megapixel wide-angle lens so you can
take portrait moon shots the s10 and SN
plus now add a third camera to the back
a 12 megapixel telephoto lens with 2x
zoom you can toggle among the lenses
from the camera app all three have a 10
megapixel selfie camera on the front but
only the plus model adds a second 8
megapixel camera for your portraits
selfies the 5g version we'll see later
this year will have a 3d depth sensing
camera on both the front and back but
it's for better portrait shots and AR
not for unlocking the phone like the
iPhones face ID if you like a little
help lighting up shots and optimizing
settings the s10 camera will let you
turn on shot suggestions this is brand
new and it gives you guidelines for
getting the best pic AI software onboard
will also recognize the scene that
you're looking at and apply lighting
settings automatically to help make it
look good you can turn it off with the
tap if it's dark enough the bright night
setting will automatically kick in to
enhance a low-light scene these as 10
phones support HDR in UHD video
recording and they're super steady video
mode as well
still would be good because there's more
our old friend Bixby is back this time
with some routines that you can program
to automatically change her phone
settings as you go about your day so for
example it can turn on Spotify and turn
off Wi-Fi when it senses that you're in
your car these phones are the first to
come pre-installed with Samsung's new
when UI software which runs over Android
9 you care about this because it's
Samsung's attempt to overhaul a
previously cluttered galaxy skin when
you eye is supposed to help make
navigation more one-handed but I did
notice that you still have to reach up
to the top of the screen to engage the
notifications shade still too early to
say how when you eye helps or hinders
but I will say about larger buttons do
seem like easier targets for your
fingers to hit okay so how do you tell
these new Galaxy S 10 phones apart
well the Galaxy S 10 5 G which we
weren't allowed to turn on is the
largest of the bunch with a six point
seven inch screen of 4500 milliamp
battery two cameras on the front and
four cameras on the back including that
3d depth sensing camera we talked about
it will have 256 gigabytes of storage
taking a bytes of RAM and no external
storage
next comes the S 10 plus with a 6.1 inch
screen and those two cameras on the
front there's a 4100 milliamp battery
and you can buy it in 128 512 and even
one terabyte storage options with
expandable storage up to 512 gigabytes
the regular s10 has a 6.1 inch screen
and one main selfie cam the s10 a screen
drops down to a 5.8 inch display all the
galaxy s tends run on the snapdragon an
855 processor finally we get to the
