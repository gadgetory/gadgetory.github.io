Chang I'm Ben Fox Ruben I'm Alfred Aang
it's finally here this super smash
brothers ultimate review is live Alfred
you're all over what's the verdict it's
a hot one it's a pretty good game I
spent a lot of time playing it on the
GameCube controller on the joy con on
the switch itself played it on my subway
ride here this morning played it on like
a two-hour train ride to Queens last
week played at like dance practice with
some friends using just the joy cons
yeah it runs really smoothly you can
tell that like this is actually gonna be
a really competitive game and not like
really watered down to make it easier
for beginners um so I'm a big fan of it
that is a criticism that some people
have though where you know super smash
brothers now with ultimate is just like
diving deeper into itself as opposed to
like making it friendlier for newcomers
really for pros yeah which i 100%
appreciate because i don't want to have
to keep playing with beginners anymore
but yeah it started i was like it has
this trouble of like balancing itself as
like a party game and a you know
hardcore competitive game like you don't
see people playing like Mario Cart
competitively because it's supposed to
be like a fun party game kind of thing
Super Smash Brothers originally was
always supposed to be this like fun
party game like oh hey I threw like a
green shell at you and you died hahaha
isn't that funny but you know people
turned the items off they played on
stages that didn't have any hazards or
anything like that and they developed it
into its own scene for a while Nintendo
was trying to stay away from that but
now they realize the potential and the
competitive scene and like this one is
like very much catered towards that well
not only that but like the physics are a
little bit different it's a it's a
different game right yeah you were
describing that in your review that this
isn't just a port mall evolution or a
port from the previous generation yeah
it's definitely not a port a lot of
people have been liking that it might be
that but yeah they changed the physics
up a bit so like the gravity is a little
bit higher so like you fall to the
ground faster which like leads to a lot
more air combos and things like that
there
more hits done so if I hit you you can't
just get out of it immediately and I can
follow up with more attacks bottom line
the experience how does it differ from
the the previous you know too big
version it definitely rewards more
aggressive play okay and the previous
one and at the same time also look it
meets this kind of middle ground that
like for the GameCube version was really
aggressive and it's like I would argue
that one's even harder for beginners to
pick up okay and for the Wii U version
that made like defensive play more
rewarding so I would say this is like a
good middle ground between the two okay
so next up the EKG feature on the Apple
watch series four will be made available
later today with a watch OS five point
one point two software upgrade our own
Vanessa Han Oriana has an in-depth look
at how this may play a bigger role and
how some owner your health is this
enough for you to buy an Apple watch
therefore I'm not a watch person so no
but I think for folks that care about
this type of information yeah or like
maybe even your doctor would want to
like tell you to buy something like this
then yeah this could expand the
opportunities for for people to start
doing start buying this I could see this
being something you would want to get
for your parents that want so I can
constantly check on their health
condition I'm 19 and I will live forever
so I don't need this right now
yeah I mean it's interesting to note
that you know the rest of testing this
out actually found a an abnormal
heartbeat for her I mean doctors said it
would be fine but like they still need
to look at the fact that actually found
it was probably the perfect illustration
of why you'd want something like this
yeah
also another Vanessa story she went up
to Corning and found out how they're
working on an ultra-thin bendable glass
for foldable phones which were expecting
to come out next year this glass is
about 0.1 millimeters thin and can bend
almost in half like a piece of paper so
pretty interesting to see that Corning
is definitely trying to get in front of
the foldable phone craze that hasn't
quite yet happen
workers it's right now Samsung's showing
off this foldable film but that's that's
like plastic right that's not gasps
that's folding like how does the how
does the Corning thing fit into this
according to Corning their argument is
is that glass is better because stronger
it's yeah it's it's much more scratch
resistant than plastic and it also
doesn't you know yellow as it ages the
same way plastic would so if they're
able to convince a lot of phone makers
that hey this is better than plastic
then maybe we'll see a lot more foldable
phones with class you imagine how
expensive that would be at a replace of
your screen crack oh my god don't even
probably afford to fix it for a full
cover chickens on a CNN IRA motor Chang
I'm Ben Fox Ruben I'm Alfred Inge thanks
for listening but we'll do it on episode
wait what are we doing on episode of
thousand no we just we've realized we
never actually mentioned in the taping
that this was our 500th episode that's
fine people can count no one cares
they should be content that activates
the dialer broadcast that to Phil all
right even though it's 500 we're not
doing anything all that special today so
go ahead and send in your questions and
comments about smash because no one's
gonna want to talk about anything else
although I do have to give a shout out
to Vanessa and rich and Mark and
everybody who went on the Corning trip
what up hometown represent I'm from down
the road in a little town called Bath
all up there in the Buffalo neighborhood
where at school so yeah I just want to
acknowledge Corning is cool and props
for them for doing and leading the
Gorilla Glass attack I mean in Corning I
like Corning I've been up there I wear a
little dorky every Museum is not working
we're all doors it's the museum was
awesome I'm a big fan of their
choreography all right so let's go ahead
and jump in the chat and take some
questions first up from sir enjoy any
early indications of eSports integration
if yes which form factor would you like
the smash bros ultimate to be completed
on I mean there's a very good chance
that like there's opening tournament
opening day tournaments are happening
tomorrow also not from Nintendo so
Nintendo has weird relationship with
eSports where they short history lesson
I guess they like they tried getting
melee like banned from Evo first like
they did not want it streamed at all and
then they kind of caved after a lot of
people were protesting about it online
like they didn't show up and then
tendo's office or anything like that and
then since then like Nintendo's kind of
done like a full 180 on that where they
have been supporting the eSports scene a
lot with Super Smash Brothers like at
Evo this year which is the largest
fighting game tournament in the world
they showed off a teaser for like smash
ultimate this year so they're like
literally cooperating with them now they
invited like top eSports players to e3
for their original showcase so I don't
know if Nintendo themselves are hosting
anything on opening day
most likely they'll be people will be
playing this on a gamecube controller
and TV I would be very very surprised if
they had tournaments that were like joi
con only or switch only yeah but yeah I
mean people can also choose to play in
tournaments however they want like you I
can show up to a turn with my switch and
say I want to play on like my droidcon
or something like that but I I think
most people are gonna be playing with
either a pro controller or a GameCube
controller like there's a reason why
Nintendo brought that like the the
ultimate bundle that they sell yeah it
comes with a pro controller for it but
they also started remaking special
editions of the GameCube controllers
okay specifically for this game like the
game controls like 17 years old and
they're still making them for this game
so yeah the joy cons are really a pain
to use yeah you're doing like two
players we played Mario Kart together
and Mario I've never heard of a game
core memory okay whatever but you know
like I was starting to feel like
arthritis yeah after like the first five
dreams or something because of the joy
consoles yeah so to answer the question
it's most likely gonna be docked on a TV
with a GameCube controllers did you
actually try it though at like a
tabletop with the joy Kahn yes you call
it at least comparable like you could
still enjoy it it's yes if you want to
like play a casual game like with a
friend when you're waiting for a flight
or like when you're just like just have
some downtime it's fine it's annoying
though because there's no C stick on it
which is on like the pro control in the
GameCube controller it's like the little
yellow stick on the right side the
controller is that for blocking no
that's for smash attacks so when you
smash attacks are like the hyper like
high-powered attacks and you have to
like flick your controller really and
press a certain timing for it okay or
you can just flick the see stick it's
like much simpler okay
but you can't do that on the joy cons
because they don't have it so it's like
that's like some of the things that you
miss grabbing is also really annoying
because you can only grab on like the
left trigger whereas on a GameCube
controller or a wire or a pro controller
you have like ZL or Z on the GameCube
controller to do that with so it's much
like faster out of shield and things
like that
yeah so it's acceptable but like I don't
I I could definitely see somebody
complaining about it like oh I would
have won if I had like a better
controller right oh whatever that's just
whining I must say that I appreciate
you're such a purist that you do still
use the game GameCube controller I mean
yeah they I mentioned this yesterday I
really think Nintendo like kind of did
this to themselves when they announced
brawl for the Wii and they made the
GameCube controller available for that
too because if you had to pick between
playing on the Wii mote or a GameCube
controller like you're gonna play on the
GameCube controller and then so that
just kind of continued the the cycle
where all the melee players were playing
on GameCube controllers because they had
to then they moved on to brawl and they
were still using GameCube controllers
then the Wii U comes out and there's
better controllers now but the thing is
like they've had two full games now
where they're so used to the GameCube
controllers that like they will just
continue playing with that Nintendo they
make more money selling you more
controllers yeah but like they GameCube
controllers are like 30 bucks like a pro
controllers like 60 or 70 okay my my
argument is that like I think the pro
controller is actually fine
for playing smash I but I also think
that like they can't compete with like
17 years of muscle memory right right
because like players are so used to the
GameCube controller like that's the only
reason why Nintendo still makes GameCube
controllers is for smash like it's my
own new one you know right I'm using my
old ones oh yeah sweet
yeah worn like a pair of jeans yeah all
right let's take some more questions
Hunter Lee wants to know what alfred's
mains are smash main is and did it
change when you came into ultimate I've
been playing with Pikachu every game and
it hasn't changed only because Pikachu's
like insanely good in this one so they
added a spike for Pikachu which like
it's like a Down hit that like sends you
like all the way to the bots not fair
sure he his recoveries like much better
now too
and they change his neutral air attack
so it's like a multi-hit attack now
instead of like one like hit that like
knocks you far away which
like leads up into more combos but I
have been picking up secondary
characters with ultimate just because
their cousin that and like because
Pikachu's so good in the game like I
don't play Pikachu unless I'm playing
somebody who's like really good so you
give the rest of us Schmucks
yeah handicap that's not fair the
handicap so I've been playing with Vince
in Aurora a lot who is surprisingly fun
that's the big red cat Pokemon that you
saw in the video earlier or in the
article he is like very heavy and like
very slow so like a completely different
place now from that og Donkey Kong yeah
so I've been playing with in sinner or a
lot and you know obviously there's like
so many characters for me to like try
out and I'm sure there's gonna be other
like secondaries I pick up dozen sinner
or have fire Underpants no it's a it's a
title belt okay it's supposed to be a
wrestler got it that's why our
underpants would be pretty fun though
fire bad new metal band
Roger ban do you guys play enough smash
to stay if you have a mane or not yeah
Luigi's brother probably I would say
well let me read Luigi really good he
could chew but I don't I was that's mine
Kirby the one time I played ultimate
airplane Kirby I mean like I survived
you I play I was adorable
I played a ton in the n64 version so I
haven't really played much better since
then actually that was my my main
experience has been the n64 version the
original Spanish and I think my main was
link at that point interesting yeah okay
set the sword I like most was a big fan
of The Dark Knight to Smash Brothers
Nintendo 64's Batman Begins and that's
when I got hooked on Marth from Fire
Emblem oh dude my never even played Fire
Emblem but I loved that character Marth
and smash yeah Marth is insanely good in
melee and then I played with Marv for a
little bit and ultimate it's not as good
as melee he was in melee but like he's
again feasible that I think that's like
a good point that I wanted to make in my
review of it where I don't think any
characters like the front runner like
amazing in the game like it's pretty
balanced yeah I do think it's like
pretty balanced which was an issue
that a lot of like previous match games
had where like you would clearly tell
who was the best character in the game
yeah everybody I played in the n64
version they all migrated to Captain
Falcon yeah like every single one of
them yeah so like I would play with
Mario Mario and there would like every
like the three other characters on the
board would just be Falcon punching
there on through so I don't Falcon is
actually not that good in the 64 version
but I think it's because like when
you're like a kid do I do you think
captain Falcons like really cool right
because you guys like super powerful
like kill moves yeah never really yeah
but like they barely hit like if if you
were smart enough to avoid that
absolutely who was the so Pikachu's
actually one of the best characters in
that game yeah Fox is also pretty good
you knew somebody who was really good at
the game if they could play with Donkey
Kong or that little kid with them Ness
Ness is pretty good in the game if yeah
you could frustrate that thank you buddy
good at the game too yeah beat I mean
yeah but unless also has like an
insanely good back throw when like
throws in the net and 64 version we're
like really rigged mmm if you couldn't
get out of it and they had like no lag
time and there was like no like
disadvantages to using exact 15 years
ago yeah we should end the podcast so we
can play this game unless there are more
that's five couple more quick questions
yeah
keep gaming asks can you invite a friend
and matchmake or is it only custom games
with friends you can invite a friend I
actually I this is just from the
announcements that Nintendo made because
we weren't allowed to try online online
wasn't available yeah and it won't be
available until the release day but from
what I understood from the video from
Nintendo they you are allowed to just
like invite a friend on matchmake okay
you can even play like local like if you
have a friend at your house you can play
online at the same time in like a team
match or something like that against
other teams online and like set it based
on rules that you want to do but if
you're talking about like just playing a
friend online and inviting them I don't
think that's something that you can do
like randomly like I can't like play
with you online and be on the same team
like against random people here's a
great
too bad yeah he has a great question
from Toby Martin how many different
costumes is Pikachu have and does that
include detective Pikachu it does not
every character has eight different
costumes and it does not include
detective Pikachu but it does include
Pikachu Libre from the pokken tournament
series they're like that's a really big
timely miss out on their part yeah I
mean I'm pretty sure they started
developing this game way before like
detective Pikachu was a thing but I will
also say that like there is
opportunities for DLC on that sure ood
hated yeah type 2 Pikachu in the game
and another so detective Pikachu is not
a costume but it is a spirit that you
can unlock in the game spirit modes is
like they're like story mode thing where
you oh yeah okay oh so they do have a
reference to the detective peek they
have so many references in the game in
like the spirit mode like it's it's
insane almost 20 year old legacy game
they better have some used or exhibit
here's one from Hunter and Lee our
hunter Lee how our Link and Zelda those
are my Mane's Zelda's a lot better now
Zelda's like air attacks like have more
of a hitbox so they're it's easier to
hit she's also much faster her side B
doesn't like disable her in the air
anymore so she can send out the phantom
armor and then continue moving after
that and her teleport like is pretty
good at killing link is extremely
different now link doesn't have the
hookshot grab which makes his recovery a
bit harder and but his bombs are better
but you also have to detonate the bombs
yourself now so they don't explode on
impact because they're basing it off
like breath of the wild link that makes
sense that makes a lot of sense yeah
thanks for that I really like the
enhancer I really have understood what
he just said right now I feel like you
just blacked out and listening to Alfred
smash jargon is like listening to the
Qualcomm presentation yesterday no I
don't understand what developers
languages yeah well you haven't even
gotten into frame rates yet so well
we'll get to that eventually hunter Lee
says while Luigi DLC dream is not dead
he's got a point let's move on to
Corning Sergio says great a foldable
corning glass I'm
it's very durable but what about the
digitizer panel underneath it or
digitizer and panel underneath it they
will have to be elastic and good quality
yes absolutely
sir enjoys right that not with with any
foldable device not only does the
display have to be foldable but the
battery has to have some like way of
accounting for it yes and that the
middle Park and fold and a lot of the
components in the middle that actually
bend that would all have to be kind of
bendable and foldable but all the other
stuff that you'd have to keep straight
could be on either end of the device oh
yes yes yeah if I were and I'm not an
engineer but if I were designing this
that's probably how I would do it yeah
that's why it's so complicated to create
something like this because you have to
account for every single component and
every single part of it and creating
something like a bendable glass I think
at least that to me fulfills the promise
of what a foldable device would actually
be mhm as opposed to like what it what
is that like the Nintendo portable what
is that a 3ds yeah that's just that's
nice that's right that's not what people
want out of a fault I think you're
thinking more like an axe on em which
were this there's like the screen there
is a hinge there but there's like two
screens context each other so it looks
like one like that's that's what a
foldable phone looks like right now the
one that's in the market but it's got a
hinge in the middle so it looks kind of
weird right so getting rid of the hinge
and making it seems legitimate yeah we
saw the Samsung the other day the other
week as well as this Chinese startup
that also has a those that was that's
what was like super obvious in those and
that was one the startup one yeah yeah
and I saw a photo of the Samsung one and
like different lighting yeah that like
you could clearly see the crease on that
one too right and if it doesn't start
with a crease after heavy use for you to
one will it develop one how how you know
it's strong is that glass gonna be if
it's gonna be ultra ultra thin there are
a lot of questions or further
those aren't that's not glass right the
Samsung one isn't it probably is plastic
I was talking about the Corning oh okay
but yeah definitely good questions for
enjoy and that's why there's a lot to be
skeptical about with both I find them
fascinating and potentially like really
exciting but I think there's a lot of
kinks that need to be worked out with
that stuff I mean it's a great idea
every phone has some semblance of wear
and tear we just got to be patient and
wait to see where it goes because
everything starts out rough everything
starts out kind of crappy then you can
put like 32 cameras on it 16 on each
side and fold it out exactly we wouldn't
want that that's perfect exactly gross
gross all right
we are almost at a time and we do need
to knowledge it is our 500th episode we
have somehow made it this far largely
thanks to you guys so thank you so much
for me art so anyways thank you so much
but it's really cool that this started
out is such like a loose experiment we
somehow rallied on so long and we have
wonderful people who continued to join
us every single day
yeah and new folks who come out of the
woodwork every once in a while all over
the world just want to express her
sincere thanks to you we said we weren't
gonna do anything special that was a bit
of a lie
so to kind of finish off the show today
I've got something kind of planned here
what though I knew it this is a surprise
for us too but a vvg what is he doing I
don't know he's he's leaving the
microwave I know I'm down whoa this is
happening I don't I don't know what's
happening right this is amazing yeah but
I always yell at you just kind of like I
don't what has been get the crown
mandatory fine that's fine yeah I'm just
gonna put this here all right
I ruined it that's usually Ben's job I
know
alright so 359 Awards we're going to
pull out the award the person goes to
goes to Roger Chang for the most
screwed-up intros yes thank you
like to thank 9 my constant allergies
and inability to speak correctly in
public settings for for this wonderful
award thank you doing great next up -
Ben Fox Ruben aka burger Larry the most
times making the show late I don't get
that many awards and finally to Alfred
egg this one's pretty self-explanatory
self-explanatory I think there's a horse
because I'm like the workhorse of the
show my work speaks for itself
I'm probably not even speaking again all
right so these awards were very special
and I'll be taking the cost out of all
of your paychecks I need something to
accept on behalf of John though couldn't
be with us today most actually just
walked by cameo most times making the
rest of us actually sound like dummies
yeah we will definitely get her that
unless it's about 5 G then everyone's
down but anyways guys it's been a blast
