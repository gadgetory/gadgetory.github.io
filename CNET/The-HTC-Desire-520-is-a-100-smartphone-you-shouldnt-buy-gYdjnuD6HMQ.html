100-hour smartphone and you may be
tempted by such a low price but this is
a phone you shouldn't buy the four point
five inch screen makes the phone pocket
friendly but the resolution is so low
that it hurts to look at it's actually
got the same resolution as the original
Droid which was released back in 2009
and while the battery is user
replaceable battery life is incredibly
short the phone lasted under eight hours
in our CNET video test other
budget-friendly phones typically lasts
closer to 12 hours and don't be fooled
while the desire 520 has a quad-core
processor that doesn't translate into
great performance the low-end Snapdragon
210 and 1 gigabyte of RAM makes even the
most basic activities a hassle playing
games is laggy and there's a noticeable
delay when switching between apps and
scrolling through the homescreen
as for the 8 megapixel rear camera it
will get you by on the occasional social
media post but it won't win you any
awards the one thing I like about the
phone the front-facing speakers can get
quite loud but that's not enough to make
me recommend it
so while first-time smartphone buyers or
parents looking for a device for their
kids may be interested in the desire 520
I recommend checking our phone like the
Moto G it costs almost twice as much but
the extra cash gets you a better screen
faster processor improved camera and
solid battery life for more information
check out my full review over at SIA
comm I'm Dan grazing on 4c net and that
was a first look at the HTC Desire 520
