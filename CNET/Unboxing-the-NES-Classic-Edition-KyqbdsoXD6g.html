Nintendo
I mean nin friendos I'm your Bakalar
check it out I've got the brand-new NES
classic edition hot and fresh out the
oven look it's got the old-school
lettering that you know and remember
from 20-30 years ago it's very nice
brings back a lot of memories but you
know a memory doesn't bring back the
memory of how small this was because
it's teeny tiny and it's got 30 games
packed in for your gaming pleasure I've
never seen this up close and personal
yet I just got it today I'm gonna open
it up and we're gonna play some NES
classic games I'm gonna see what this is
all about you can see my genuine
reaction cuz I like I said have not seen
the classic yet it's a lovely box but we
shan't be needing it anymore alright
some manual situations oh my god are you
serious look at this look at that this
is adorable oh look at that that's a
great shot well you got lot lined up
there very cute this is adorable
it's a teeny tiny NES I will name him
Fred so check it out you got a USB power
right here and this thing's HDMI ready
how about that never thought I'd see the
day but here we are in the flesh alright
let's start playing let's hook this bad
boy up
we got an NES classic controller get a
close-up of that here just as how I
remember get a feel for it yep all this
is telling me is that my hands have
gotten way bigger in
thirty years that's what I'm learning
right now uh-huh and it only comes with
one but I do believe you can buy another
classic controller if you'd like and I
think that I want to see they're they're
ten bucks but what's really cool is if
you recall this port we see this port
here
that's the port that all those we
accessories worked on so I believe you
can use that we classic controller or
that classic controller Pro and hook
this bad boy into the console oh like a
lot all right so let's get this ready
that's how you get hey I'm not gonna lie
Nintendo I don't sit three feet in front
of my TV let's maybe work on this a
little bit look at that this is I'm not
wrong am I asking for too much here I
don't think so
this is really short this is three feet
is anybody talking about this this seems
too short luckily I I literally I'm
gonna be sitting three feet in front of
TV but if I'm if I'm calling something I
don't like right away it's the absurd
length of this wire in a world of
wireless controllers right am i crazy
I'm not crazy right
that's way too short I don't know
call me crazy but that's pretty stupid
all right got an HDMI cable never
thought I'd see today but here we are
I'm sorry this is you know not the most
fun this part you know I think we have
our own let's do that okay now we need
power and we're gonna get that from usb
okay this is going splendidly so if you
do have a question about the classic
Nintendo do yourself a favor and ask
them in the comment section while you
stare at my butt all right are we ready
to go we're ready to turn this on and
experience the magic I can't get over
how tiny this freakin thing is oh this
the lid doesn't work oh hello
look what we got here
they didn't have to do it people
but they put it in alphabetical order
they didn't have to but they did this is
this is why we love this company
okay so again first time I'm ever seeing
this we've got some display options up
at the top let's roll through that a
little bit you can do that a four by
three presentation CRT filter you mean I
could have this look worse I could have
this look worse just what you're telling
me right now let's try that out
um okay some more options I don't know
what any of that is not gonna deal with
it okay um gosh I guess we're just gonna
have to start with the only real game
that mattered in my my childhood right
let's see what this thing looks like oh
wow the CRT thing really is does look
bad right that's not good this looks
terrible let's Charlie I just wanted to
see what this looked like but you know
what I'm convinced now
we have a healthier how do we get out of
it oh I know how we do that so if you
want to back out it at any time you can
hit that little reset button up there
you see what I'm pointing at and that'll
pop you back to the main menu where I'm
gonna change the display because look
that was terrible
oh and we'll look at that so bottom
left-hand corner looks like I can still
continue my game it automatically saved
look at that that is cool sign me up I
like it and now we have a much more
clear shot of this game and let's just
get right into it oh my god okay there's
a little bit of a delay I'm I'm sorry so
if I die a few times that's not me
that's yeah that's on our end not the
NES here that's the way where we're
displaying this for streaming oh man I
already screwed up oh boy oh this is
embarrassing
which was the one where you get the it's
this one right okay good I need to die
so I can need to clearly die so I can
get the whistle because we're gonna jump
all the way to the fourth world right
well so like on blasters thanks chat
room light like on blesses don't work on
HDTVs as far as I'm aware so that's why
not to mention like duck hunt isn't in
this so what wait how did you how did it
work do you remember have the thing
works
put like at the end of the map right
yeah yeah so I think it does work on
yeah it works on any white block if I
recall correctly yep there is you see
I'm just like behind the world now yeah
it wears off I believe yes II so what
we'll need to do yeah I'm gonna fly to
the end I just want to get rid of these
little a-holes
that's a great question why is this
better than emulation um it's oh man
this is not working out you that
question screwed me up it's better than
emulation because it's the original you
know you're the original game on the
original chip emulation is short
I mean look you're probably not going to
know is a huge thing not to mention
emulation is occasionally illegal but uh
it's you're getting that one-to-one
conversion not the way you would get it
in um in a ROM is like the the way I'm
gonna I'm satisfied with explaining it
okay that's good to know actually you
know what I think I have one yeah chat
rooms talking about cable extenders see
I don't think it was this map I think it
was world 3 right
let's say Excitebike okay good because
this is ending terrible this is going
terribly the lag sucks I'm not gonna lie
it's not the best but again you're not
gonna experience that when you play it's
just our macgyvered situation here
Excitebike let's load it up so that yeah
that's not that super contra that's not
the original so people were wondering
the price again this I feel like this is
really gonna do pretty well this holiday
just because of 60 bucks 30 classic NES
games it's kind of a gnome no-brainer
comes out November 11th I feel like this
is the one this is like that stocking
stuffer right just you can't add any
games to it we got a question here on
the floor can't add any games to it but
what you can do is wait for them to do
this again because they will because
this is probably gonna sell real well so
figure in 2017 you're gonna get one of
these with another 30 games on it and
what's to stop them from doing a you
know a Super NES or if Nintendo 64
what's to stop them nothing ok
Excitebike here we go
first let's enjoy this
okay bike the games look like they save
themselves I really didn't force
anything to happen on that Mario 3
playthrough so that kind of just did its
own thing don't want to overheat oh my
god these bikes
I guess these bikes kind of blow right
that they overheat so much
oh holy oh that was a funny joke these
bikes were not made by Samsung I would
always try and like get that smooth
landing there it is it looked like there
was only when I'm done with this
playthrough right here we'll check it
out but I don't think you can do more
than look like five save slots but let's
see or poro maybe five total let's see
Oh Oh No run back
I believe in extra controller people are
asking is $10 I want to say the maximum
is probably 15 I'm killing it him there
it is look at that destroyed it still
got it all these years later still get
it let's back out okay so see yeah it
doesn't look like there's a way to back
out good thing you're only three feet
away you can reach that cord no matter
what you're doing okay so now it looks
like there might be five safe slots for
each what did that say suspends points
are what are created when you reset a
game let's see if the Mario 3 is there
it is so I guess it saves this state
when you reset kind of just takes a
picture of your gameplay session and
pops it in there so it looks like you're
going to get four suspensions slots for
each game you play works for me you can
sort the games by recently played that's
cool times played release date publisher
excellent I love it one last game what
are we gonna do
let's do Megaman Wow 1988 huh
I have to skip that I'm sorry I got
yelled at for skipping that but let's be
honest it takes some time uh I guess we
got to do wood man right he's got the
best sound he's got the best music
food wood man alright here it is let's
see if I can I remember it all
man this game's gonna about to get way
harder because of our our own fault we
introduced some some gnarly lag here my
god this game is relentless
these little bat bomb things I always
found the best way was just like brute
force your way through oh you know it's
so funny how it's just they really did
do a great job of importing these games
over it's just yeah it just feels right
oh my god it is not an easy game yeah
there I mean you gotta imagine Super
Nintendo is gonna get the same
experience right like look I guess it
depends on how well this sells but I
mean come on you know I I just can't see
this this underperforming in fact I kind
of anticipate there not being a lot of
these around the holidays questions
about resolution we right now this is
outputting 720p I don't believe we have
an option to change that I would think
of being the display options it is not
so I'm gonna go ahead and say that 720p
is what it's locked in it was there was
another question oh yeah yeah
so the CRT one is what we saw gave it
that horizontal sort of filter thing
that I thought looked pretty crappy and
then pixel perfect I I wonder I feel
like that might just be a scaling thing
yeah that's just gonna give you like one
to one pixel where the four by three
stretches it out from what you're used
to
oh I could totally rock that Justin
Bailey code but we're not gonna do it
yeah this looks like this just looks
like a one-to-one pixel sort of thing
oh boy it's very cool alright let's
let's run through all the titles before
we get out of here send you guys on your
way okay starting alphabetically balloon
fight Bubble Bobble castlevania
castlevania - Donkey Kong Donkey Kong
jr. Double Dragon - my personal favorite
of the double dragons dr. Mario I try to
say Mario Excitebike Final Fantasy
Galaga ghosts and goblins Gradius ice
climber Kid Icarus Kirby's Adventure the
original Mario Brothers that's like the
rkd you know platforming thing Megaman -
Metroid Ninja Gaiden pac-man punch-out
someone's name seems to be missing from
this I don't I can't quite put my finger
on it star tropics super contra super C
Super Mario Brothers Mario - three Tecmo
Bowl and Legend of Zelda one and two
that's where you have it we're going to
put this through more of its paces we're
going to have a full review up on CNET
so make sure you tune in to that first
impressions I really think they actually
have a winner on their hands personally
I'm probably going to opt for one of the
other controllers for this just because
controllers have come a long way in 30
years maybe we don't have to use this
like antiquated thing it's nice for the
memory for the novelty but those we Pro
controllers are pretty great so I kind
of I'm going to recommend you use one of
those for this if you don't already have
one you could probably get one not too
expensive yeah pretty great stuff $60
November 11th that's it thank you so
much for tuning in really appreciate you
sticking around and we'll see you guys
next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
