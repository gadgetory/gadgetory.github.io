and photos are still somewhat high if
you want an all-in-one model with a
camera longer battery life and GPS and
other sensors for easy
safe stable flight that's why the Ares
Blackbird x10 is an attractive offer at
least on paper
I'm Josh Goldman Luci net and the x10
sells for $600 but can go as high as 800
and is available from electronics
retailer adarama and it will ship them
worldwide it can also be found in white
as the AEE a p10 the x10 has a 16
megapixel camera that shoots Full HD
video at 30 frames per second it has a
flight time of about 20 minutes and GPS
there are two flight modes normal and
GPS unless you're an experienced pilot
you'll want to stay in GPS mode which
the x10 needs to hover in place and keep
from drifting and for its failsafe
return-to-home
feature to work unfortunately even with
the GPS lock and compass calibration it
would regularly do its own thing
once off the ground flying off in
various directions
there were times this didn't happen
though and it did hover in place and was
completely responsive and basically
performed really well when the x10 is
flying right you can use the transmitter
to control the camera including tilting
it up and down but you can also connect
a phone to its wireless repeater so you
can use an app to get a first-person
view from the camera as well as access
to camera settings and controls that's
all the app is used for though and the
video and photo quality is actually
pretty decent but because the camera is
fixed to the body and the x10 is not the
most stable quadcopter you can get some
fairly shaky video and there is a
significant delay between the camera and
what's on your screen which isn't great
if you're trying to set up a shot or
worse flying by that view alone so while
the x10 is ready to fly and simple in
operation it's not one I would recommend
for those starting out in the Hobby
looking for a great out of box
experience for $600 or more you might be
better off saving up for one with more
consistent performance
