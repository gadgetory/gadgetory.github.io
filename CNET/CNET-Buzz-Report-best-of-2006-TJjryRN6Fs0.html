okay here's the deal they packed up all
our stuff and they send it to Las Vegas
for the big Consumer Electronics Show
next week so I can't do the buzz report
I tried but I'm stuck here in my office
preparing for the show and all the gear
is gone so I thought I'd just put
together a few of the best buzz report
clips from 2006 cuz it's the new year
yeah I know
clip show but anyway let's get started
with the gadget of the week the gadget
of the week is the new Samsung sg8
P 300 this is roughly the smallest phone
in the world it's as big around as a
credit card and only 8.9 millimeters
thick
plus it's got a 1.3 megapixel camera
with a flash a built-in music player and
it can record video it's designed for
the person who thinks that the Motorola
RAZR is just a big fat cow I mean look
at that so in 2006 net neutrality became
a huge deal big telcos wanted to tear
the internet and charge more for access
and big content companies didn't want to
have to pay more for access and then the
Democrats and the Republicans got
involved and everything became super
partisan and we also discovered that the
internet is really confusing now I've
been following the net neutrality debate
pretty closely and you know I really
thought that I understood how the
internet works like in 2004 I was
listening to President George Bush and
he was talking about the Internet's so
here's how I thought about it
but then I was listening to Senator Ted
Stevens day from Alaska talking about
why he voted against net neutrality and
here's what he said the Internet is not
something that did just dump something
on it's not a big truck it's a series of
shows huh tubes well ok then it's a good
thing these guys are in charge of the
internet because boy I just do not get
it 2006 was also the year of lawsuits
patent lawsuits RI double-a lawsuits and
of course Apple lawsuits Apple this week
sent cease and desist letters to two
companies trying to stop them from using
the word pod in their names the company
says it's trying to protect the iPod
brand and claims that a laptop case
maker called tight pod and the makers of
a device called profit pod create
confusion among consumers reached for
comment
dolphins peas people seeds casts
streamlined external housings that
enclose engines machine guns are fuel
protective coverings that encase the
eggs of some insects and fish the Prince
of Darkness pieces of data proof of
delivery and the Latin root of the word
foot issued a joint statement saying we
got your confusion right here I have to
admit it wasn't a perfect here for me I
mean there was the snake bite induced
coma and if that weren't bad enough then
my clone took over oh I cannot stand
that idiot
SanDisk has released a 8 gigabyte flash
player whatever that is and now
everyone's starting to wonder if Apple
has fallen behind the curve with it's
pathetic 4 gigabyte iPod Nano what this
is so boring who cares about iPods I got
a funny story for you I was at this
party last night it was a toga party if
you must know
anyway the student was totally doing keg
stands and his toga you could see his
button everything and then his toga
totally got caught on the pole please
stick to the script
right I'm a script that's a genius piece
of work seriously she writes this junk
okay okay
okay that did not work out gigabytes uh
how embarrassing so I handed the reins
over to Veronica Belmont and a few
others this week a private company sent
a Russian rocket into space carrying a
14 foot inflatable space station the
launch may be the first step towards
construction of an inflatable space
hotel but going to space is pretty
expensive so here's an alternative just
head on over to McDonald's and jump
around in the bouncy castle mmm Big Macs
in space I'm Molly wood and this has
