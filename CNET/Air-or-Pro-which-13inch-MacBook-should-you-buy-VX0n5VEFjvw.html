shopping time and it's time for that
age-old question which 13-inch MacBook
should I buy now this is a question
because there are two 13-inch MacBook s'
on the market the 13-inch MacBook Air
and the 13-inch MacBook Pro and it's a
little more of an important decision
than what 15-inch do I buy I think
because these are more affordable these
are the max looks that people are going
to gravitate to when they pay for a
back-to-school laptop and they're more
likely to fit to whatever bag you have
now let's get into the nitty-gritty of
both they both start at 1199 that's
different than last year because the
MacBook Air used to be $100 more
expensive now they're at the same price
so what are the differences well
obviously the 13-inch air is a lot
thinner and it's a lot lighter a little
under three pounds whereas this one is
4.5 pounds that's not bad but it's going
to feel heavier in your hand it's even a
little hard for me to hold in one hand
like this
now the other differences are in terms
of processor this has a lower speed
technically Core i5 processor is a
faster Core i5 processor
they both are third generation Intel
processors code-named Ivy Bridge but in
our tests they both performed pretty
equivalently why well one thing you can
chalk it up to is SSD the faster storage
that's built into this as a base
configuration tends to produce faster
boot times faster load times and that
creates a zippier sense of performance
that puts it on par with this laptop now
you could put an SSD into this MacBook
Pro but it's going to cost you extra
money the other difference here is ports
this has two USB 3.0 ports it also has a
Thunderbolt port and an SD card slot
this has two USB 3.0 ports a thunderbolt
port an Ethernet port an SD card slot
and a firewire 800 port for those who
care about that that's a nice set of
features plus it has an optical drive a
slot loading DVD drive now let's go to
screens they both have 13.3 inch screens
the air actually has a higher resolution
screen 1440 by 900 whereas this has a
1280 by 800 display now that's a small
increase here but higher resolution is
higher resolution and it also has a
nicer anti glare
future at least when I use both of these
it seemed a little less glare prone on
the air than on the pro upgradability
well neither one of them has discrete
graphics you can throw that out the
window they both use intel HD 4000
integrated graphics and they perform
pretty equivalently as far as playing
games or any sort of work you'd want to
do better than last year's models so
bottom line which would you go with well
last year I would have picked the pro
but this year I'm going with the air the
reason is that the air is more portable
it's more forward-looking in the sense
that this is the laptop that I think is
going to be around in a couple of years
and this laptop really represents a lot
of what Apple is pushing in terms of the
speed the ease of use the very quick
instant on type of performance it's a
little bit faster in terms of that boot
up time and in terms of thatthat zippy
instant speed now for back-to-school as
well is going to be a lot easier to
carry around in your backpack and the
battery life is better about a half hour
better at least on our tests so there
you go as far as storage
I consider this although you may want to
consider bumping up to the $14.99
version with 256 gigabytes of storage or
consider investing in a plug in external
hard drive now that there's USB 3.0 you
get a lot of fast cheap ones that do
that I'm Scott Stein and that's a little
guide to this year's 13-inch MacBook
