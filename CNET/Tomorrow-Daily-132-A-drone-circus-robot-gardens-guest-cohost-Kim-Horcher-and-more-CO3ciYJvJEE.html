newest arms and their robots and the
circus is in town in Amsterdam and there
are also robots a whole new breed of
flowers is being shown off and their
robots pound me it's tomorrow daily yes
everyone welcome to tomorrow daily your
source for all kinds of futurology
robots and science news my name is Caleb
animus and ashley is still out caring
for her dogs we wish her and her dogs
well but today we have a special guest
very special her name is Kim horch ur
welcome to show I so you're you're not
any stranger to kind of like this nerd
culture x oh um I also hosts a show
called nerd alert on the young turks
network we also love futurism science
technology also a lot of culture but I
see that on this show too yeah um and
also science fact so that's a lot of fun
yeah so we're gonna nerd out or Debra we
also have like a segment we're gonna
find out what you're into this week and
you pick one of the nerdiest things I
can possibly agree alright well we'll
see let's start with our news stories oh
I like to start by calling the guest out
on their on their on their preference
and their joy yeah so there you go
that's that's done alright so we're
gonna move into theirs it's a robotic
heavy episode but trust me you're going
to love this we're going to start off
with the fact that DARPA has released
their next-gen arms no we know next-gen
consoles but these are next-gen arms
they showed off the newest development
is that they have footage of them
actually being used okay so what we're
going to see in this video error Army
volunteers eating and drinking with
robotic attachments as well as climbing
up the wall this is newly unveiled
footage released just this week of these
new arms that is so if like any of these
are me bill don't have arms they're
going to be basically able to do
anything yeah with them they can pick up
objects as delicate as a grape they're
able to handle very rugged tools like a
hand drill and believe it or not it
actually is the size and weight of a
normal arm so it's not like a big heavy
robot arm DARPA signed a contract with
haptics the hand precipitation and touch
interfaces to advance all react I know
I'm tried that's right 200 the RT most
this is already the most advanced robot
prosthetic ever built and it's named the
Luke arm can you gotta tear after after
Luke Skywalker whores it's also called
the DECA arm looks system but yeah we're
going to go with Luke the goal the goal
of this whole arm thing that they've got
going on here is to build a fully
responsive prosthetic attachment that is
the confuser controls with their brain
and nervous system while receiving force
and touch feedback so closer to what an
actual arm is that the tech is that they
use the the signals come from a my god
electromyogram electrodes which sends
electrical activity on muscles close to
where the prosthetic is attached so
basically wherever your muscle is it'll
sense when you're moving it of course
they haven't fully like in the article
like articles well it goes one way but
not the other what well like they can't
they can't sense what they're touching
correct yeah how would that work though
so what they have right now is they
don't they don't have all of it figured
out into like the arm they have it so
you can also control it with your feet
so like there's like there's a whole
there's some hurdles to overcome but
this is still the most advanced
prosthetic that there is it's really
impressive look they're able to pick up
a spoon guide it to their mouth pretty
pretty well I saw them doing fist bumps
earlier they they can pour like one
robotic I was pouring water into another
guy's cup so it's it's pretty impressive
how I would sable to move so yeah so
there you go DARPA are our own American
government is actually working on these
and they can climb up the wall I'm sorry
that's incredible yeah it is i mean
we've seen robotic arm as before yeah
but generally not that strong mm-hmm not
that strong at least or able to be so
delicate like this one guy was like
picking up like eggs just cuz he can and
wasn't you know squashing them I have
that prize squash legs all the times
maybe you're stronger than you think you
know we're just angrier just kind of
just so ticked off so there you go if
you want to check it out DARPA has a
whole bunch of other things you can look
up let's see you look up the the deca
arm system that's deka arm system
there's a whole bunch of video
of them trying it out so it's pretty
cool yeah that's our first robotic story
how about some robots that are just
having fun for our for our amusement as
our robot entertainment slaves oh da
listen okay sometimes some people such
as myself think the idea of a circus is
a little outdated but what if they're
drones instead of bears and elephants Oh
No so there's no date for this yet it's
called air 2015 it's set to start in
Amsterdam and it is essentially a drone
show so they would be flying around in
formation they would be well there's
light trails they have laser
capabilities not death laser fun lasers
yeah well some would say that death
lasers are fun so this is it looks like
they're just using it for summer arena
show that there has been the amsterdam
arena okay all right so does it like
perform to music or like what's the deal
i get is synced with music oh you know
how sometimes planetariums would have
laser shows yeah for people who may be
enjoying amsterdam well now you can
enjoy ballets and battled battles in
amsterdam how many drones are involved
and they say was it like is it like it
looks friendly looks at me a lot yeah
and they're jumping through hoops is
like Tron over here you know it looks a
lot like if you played final fantasy 13
Oh double its ball no that's final
fantasy 10 crap uh there's there's a
part where there's a futuristic city and
there is a racetrack and they're flying
around in circles through different
light hoops and some things happen with
the plot where that doesn't work out so
well but it looks a lot like that okay
yeah I mean this looks fun I wanna see
this right looks pretty cool so it's
it's not its own show is it's it's own
show or that's like you watch soccer and
then I think you're going just straight
for this straight for the drones it's
not not all the details are out yet
there's no there's no date besides fall
of 2015 so that's a few months from now
right on um you seemed to be not so
pleased with the bears and elephants no
longer being part of the circus yeah I
don't know I mean drones do it for me
but I like bears don't you feel bad for
them I feel bad for the Bears they
shouldn't be in a circus and their
places are very this yeah an antiquated
notion of entertainment like it's tara
march around with this creepy Calliope
music
for my pleasure ya know it's it's it's
weird it's weird maybe they can make
drone bears then we'd all like we meet
in the middle that benjamin button in
the middle I'm into that okay that'll be
into it this week okay so now we're
moving on to robots what I know I was
just as surprised as you so over at MIT
a few a few of the students have made a
robot garden that is more than meets the
eye well it is meets the eye but it was
more than that it's robots so so check
this out what you're seeing is they're
setting up this this robot grid system
it's these flowers that not only glow
but they also bloom on command so this
technology is is its Arduinos that
connects 16 tiles together and we
controlled by clicks to like light up
and bloom and stuff like that or be
controlled by code now the reason I
bring that up is that the goal of this
system is to teach young computer
science hopefuls especially girls no
sexism there that's what they said the
concepts of basic algorithms and
programming so you learn program these
children learn programming by playing
around with these lights and coding it
and and seeing what they can do with it
the flowers have printable motors for
simulated blooming and color LED for
code control there's also sheep robots
that are down there on the floor they
don't really show but they just kind of
like walk around you control them too
and there's also magnet controlled
Swansea there it is blooming see how
kind of like opens and paper closes yeah
they're they're paper their paper
printed they also tried to make it so
that it's very easy to replicate so that
schools can go there they're trying to
make this for school so that the kids
can learn coding very easily mm-hmm so
all this stuff is really cheap and this
is uh by the MIT computer science lab so
they're saying the next step is to make
the garden controlled by multiple
students at once rather than just one
one person controls it right now but I
see there's the students completely
amazed look at him oh my god they're so
shocked no but the MIT students said
that other
students were very excited I don't see
any smiles that it looks it was really
cool i wish they were showing the sheep
but they're hoping to make it so easy
for you know like classes to replicate
this and teach students program and how
to like grow fake flowers i feel like
with raspberry pi and even like MoMA
yeah I mean those are you know they're
pretty simplistic but I think it gets
people interested in computer
engineering or programming it also and
this is a great thing it's better than
learning like necessarily just looking
at a screen and sane ones and zeros it's
much easier just kind of see it in
practice more accessible lights up and
yet like blooms and whatnot so that's
pretty cool speaking of which we didn't
touch on our TV of the day every single
episode we asked you know the audience
and the viewers and the people that are
smarter than us a question we missed it
back but it was for the circus one yeah
so we have 14 it's a TD circus and we
want to know wait what did we want to
know my thing didn't show what would you
like to see pretty drones do in the
circus so you know maybe you've seen the
blue angels before and you could compare
what they do or maybe you've seen a
regular circus and you want a drone bear
like hail does jojo mayer so what would
you like to see the drones do at the
circus so as always we answer so what
would you like to say I would like to
see them kind of sky right but on a mini
level and I want them to make something
more complicated and colorful then you
might see in the ditch fantastic that's
cool so like like archers of you are you
okay of my face of your just of your
faces oh cool who's not does that girl
but nerd alert girl she's a young turks
everybody knows oh no I would like to
see them um bring me cotton candy it was
like little is it dragging like a taco
drone but with treats for the circus
yeah there you go just like flying
around just giving them to me now I
don't have to pay for it so there you go
TV circus please let us know what you'd
like to see the drums do at the circus
we're going to take a quick break and
then we're going to come back and we're
gonna talk about what we're into this
week one of us has a really
really nerdy one whatever and then the
other one of us is it's just amazing and
you'll love it and it's the best thing
ever those are both me alright we'll see
you guys a sec
oh hi we didn't see you there welcome
back to tomorrow daily Thursday is one
of the coolest days for us because we
get to talk about kind of like our own
self this is we're gonna do into it
which is we're going to talk about like
what we're into what we're excited about
this week some of you may be excited too
so let's find out into it that a little
heart you're into the Intuit graphic
well that was a waste okay now you don't
get into it no no I still get a wish oh
forget it this daughter wit all right
well let's see this is gonna happen
alright so Kim I'm gonna let you go
first as the guest um so what is your
into it what you into this week when I
am into this week is x-wing miniatures
so Star Wars released a board game it
was in 2012 but there have been steadily
expansion packs for it there's a new one
about to come out called us scum and
villainy well that's cool so basically
if you're not familiar with this x-wing
miniatures is a board game based it's
like a turn by turn strategy game based
on the dogfights that you may have seen
in the various Star Wars films and
television shows and it's really fun you
can play with a team or just two people
against each other I have a lot of fun
with this I'm you almost always a rebel
yeah there you go that's my side but
with scum and villainy you get the scum
and villainy like Boba Fett and the
mandos and Prince size or I can't miss
pronounce his name every time I only
read it I'm sorry but it is your toast
no I'm not yeah Boba Fett before was on
the Imperial side I'm so don't be mad
I've only read that word I'm on the
internet I'm allowed to be more
opinionated than your hub so ok cool so
way comes out when very soon okay so
what are gonna do to celebrate are you
gonna like have a big party or what
maybe I will okay I don't know I'm used
to being a rebel so I scene with a new
set they're going to be much more tricky
moves that will force your opponents
into bad situations that they'll have to
make tough decisions for which I tend
not to be a fan of when playing board
games because I'm boring like I want to
be the rebels and I I want to be an
x-wing fighter too right usually West
chanson solely
I'm not Luke Skywalker right yeah not
like with those robotic arms from
earlier and mornings on that so the new
york toy fair just announced that in the
future they're going to put episode 7
stuff in the game that's really really
cool yes it's gonna be great yeah that's
a great way to learn about like your
future movies that you're interested in
by the way is look at the toys there are
always hints and spoilers in the toy
yeah they just had a Jurassic Park one
they released the new dinosaur track
yeah that's pretty good oh you knew you
knew the name nice job uh it looks crazy
I love it yep alright cool so what I'm
into this week is also a nerd alert type
you know thing it is Kingsman I mean the
kingsmen I know I'm late to the I don't
like to you know the movie but this is
the movie that came out this weekend up
against fifty shades of grey and did
okay it did okay I think it made like 50
50 mil in the box office but more
importantly what's great is this this is
based off a graphic novel not a lot of
people knew that and that's really cool
cuz Mark Miller makes those kind of yeah
he he made kick ass kick ass too he kind
of sneaks under the radar like like when
they get made into movies people don't
realize that their base I was it like
the same kind of like crazy kind of
super realist not super unrealistic
violence it's over the top it's like it
like there's it's yeah people also arms
get cut off someone gets cut in half
it's not even really a spoiler it's it's
very violent and it's basically it's
such a no mods like Mark Millar's in
love with everything he covers so like
when he did kickass he was like in love
with the superheroes and and he's in
love with spy films in this one Samuel
Jackson plays a character with a lift so
it's it's really great uh but yeah good
all the way to the end it's it's a just
when you think you've figured the movie
out it keeps it takes a right turn this
scene the right I've heard that same is
the same where everything gets turned on
its head oh my god yeah yeah it even
addresses like certain clichés and
stereotypes anyway don't listen to me
anymore just go see the movie it's
really really great and yeah you haven't
seen it no I haven't seen it yet oh it's
so great you had Jupiter ascending
instead so go see the Kings may
that's a review they put on them now
Jupiter said it goes the Kingsmen yes
Kim or trick yeah alright so that's
that's cool alright so now it's time to
listen to what you guys have to say
because we're dumb you don't listen to
us so let's check out you know your
comments we got to today okay cuz we
didn't to comment yeah we got to no no
we got a lot but like we don't
necessarily always want to delve into
the YouTube when it's brag about yeah
today we got it that's my comment on
anything no we had a good several but
these are these are tweets that were
tweeted at us okay um so there's almost
ed Mars this is from yesterday we asked
them if there's like whole Mars
competition Mars one is sending people
to Mars it's going from 100 to 25 224
people but it's a competition so we have
shown yeah fish is so weird so we asked
them what would you do to go from the
124 like how would you impress them I
said that I would tell them I'm really
good at digging because they want to
find if there's water on the bottom so I
just like I'm really good at digging you
remember remember that character
shuffler from mystery man that's me um
