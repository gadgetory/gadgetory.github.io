Oppo UDP 203 is one of the most
anticipated models yet oppose previous
disk spinners have established a company
as a veritable giant in the video file
community the thing that stands out most
about this Oppo though is its lack of
streaming apps no 4k Netflix no Vudu
just you and your discs and maybe some
music you have on your phone
given that 4k discs are likely the last
physical video format will ever see this
approach is pretty brave like the other
Oppo models before it the UDP 203 is
really solidly built and it performs
very very well and it's pretty expensive
it's five hundred and fifty dollars in
the u.s. 649 pounds and nine hundred and
fifty dollars Australian but look at
this thing it just reeks of quality from
the brushed aluminum front to the
gorgeous user interface you are actually
getting what you pay for the Oppo also
offers a lot of connectivity and
compatibility it has support for HDR 10
of course and is one of the first
players to support the rival dolby
vision format and if it really wants
streaming you can connect a Roku into
the HDMI input the player also has two
HDMI outs plus a 7.1 analog audio output
which is great for connecting it to a
legacy receiver or a 2 channel system
but how does the oppo perform very well
video looks crisp and clean from DVDs to
blu-rays to 4k discs Oppo takes its
picture quality very seriously the only
fly in the ointment is that so does its
competitors Sony and Samsung for example
also make excellent video players and
they're half the price speed wise the
competition is also able to load discs
faster
given that the Oppo has an analogue
audio output onboard sound is more
exciting that you'll get from a receiver
at the same price for example though
this may not work for music it is
perfectly suited to watching movies if
you want to buy a video file player then
you're probably already getting this one
and I'm happy to report it does nothing
to disappoint but the Oppo UDP 2 or 3 is
not the player you turn to if you want
bang for buck especially if you watch a
lot of Netflix the Samsung UBD K 8500 is
a much better deal overall</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
