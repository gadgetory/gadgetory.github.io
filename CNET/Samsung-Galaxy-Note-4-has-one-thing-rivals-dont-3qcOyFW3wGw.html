Samsung Galaxy Note 4 is just one of a
whole bunch of really big phones
including the iphone 6 plus despite all
that it has one thing that rivals don't
a stylus that acts like a mouse and that
gives you the ability to write and draw
directly on the screen
this is Jessica Dahl court for CNET and
I'm gonna walk you through the Samsung
Galaxy Note before this year's S Pen is
much more sensitive to pressure than
ever before and it gets a few
streamlined multitasking skills but our
nice additions to the phone's
capabilities you can find out much more
about those and some of my other note 4
videos so check them out
meanwhile the smart phone itself gets a
fresh lick of paint with an all-metal
rim to accent the usual plastic body and
upgraded specs that rate at or near the
top of the industry game it retains its
5.7 inch screen that goes quad HD and a
1440 pixels Ellucian the screen is
bright and brilliant and the phone feels
good in the hand it's also running
Android 4.4 KitKat this time around we
find that a 16 megapixel camera with
optical image stabilization is on the
back it takes beautiful outdoor shots
and indoor an evening photos that are ok
but perhaps a little bit money a few
enhancements just for selfies help
enhance the 3.7 megapixel front-facing
camera and you can even take
higher-quality portraits from the main
camera as well again I've got a breakout
video just for that underneath the hood
you get either a rapid quad-core
Qualcomm Snapdragon 805 processor or in
some regions a 1.9 gigahertz octa-core
chipset and a nice big battery to boot
Samsung has tackled the hot-button issue
of battery life two ways first by
keeping battery life pretty long and
second by making the charger really
really fast so the note 4 is an
excellent large screen phone but is also
pretty expensive if you intend to make
use of that unique stylus as a mouse or
as a pen then you're making a good
investment
otherwise you may want to shop around
for a better deal on phones that are
just about as good be sure to check out
my full galaxy note 4 review and more
videos besides Etsy Netcom</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
