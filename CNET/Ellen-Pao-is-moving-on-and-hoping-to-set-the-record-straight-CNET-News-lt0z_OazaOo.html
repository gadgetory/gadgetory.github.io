include which is a non-profit focused on
bringing diversity and inclusion in tech
and I am the former CEO of Reddit and a
former partner at kleiner perkins
caufield &amp;amp; byers and i'm excited to be
here talking with Connie well thank you
so much for joining us I am really
interested in how the term the POW
effect came to be a thing there's a
wikipedia page and it came out of your
very high-profile discrimination trial
against kleiner perkins but can you talk
a little bit about the path that led you
to become a Silicon Valley icon now for
this concept of inclusion and diversity
in Silicon Valley it was not an
intentional path so it has been more of
a path of trying to do the right thing
so I don't know that I'm an icon but I
think I think a lot of people see
themselves in my experiences and having
somebody actually give voice to them and
having a lot of people support the idea
that this is not the way things should
be has been something that people have
really rallied around so what was the
impetus for project including what do
you hope to do with it the impetus was a
bunch a series of one-on-one
conversations where there are a lot of
people who are just frustrated with the
state of you know what they call
diversity in tech and the lack of
inclusion in tech and what people are
actually doing about it and from our
perspective it wasn't the solutions
weren't matching the problem and they
weren't solving the right problem so we
got together to try to figure out how do
we get more education out there there's
so much information out there how do we
pull it all together and frame it for
people and how do we get people focused
on like doing the hard work of actually
making tech inclusive you are working on
a memoir of sorts about the last few
years in Silicon Valley and what is it
that you want to say that you don't
think has been said in them many many
stories
right about you there are set of
narratives about me and I would just
like to set the record straight about
you know who I am what motivated me to
sue and what motivates everything that I
do so you know here and you may not like
it and that's okay but at least have the
real information out there instead of
the set of information that's been
pushed out there you know I would love
this to be a book that inspires people
to come into tech and to stay in tech
because I think we need to make sure
those voices continue to be part of the
conversation you said you have a
daughter she's eight years old and she's
learning how to code would you like her
to go into the tech industry at some
point I struggle with it I don't want
her to go into the tech industry today
but I'm hopeful that things will change
by the time by the time she gets out
there okay thank you very much Ellen Pao
for joining us today thank you funny
forever</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
