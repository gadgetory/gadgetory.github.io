expected to make an appearance in the
next few weeks will not have a headphone
jack now me exactly adds to that the
fact that Intel has been talking this
week about how they think USB type-c
could be the future of the headphone
port and and you know not the
traditional 3.5 millimeter Jack and it's
looking like maybe this sort of
faithfulness before that we've relied on
for decades might be going away now I
know that Andy you feel quite positively
about this I am quite positive about
this I'll give you a chance to explain
yourself okay that's only fair all right
well you said yourself this the 3.5
million Jack the standard headphone jack
as we know on all phones and Walkmans or
whatever has been around for decades
this is the longest lasting piece of
tech that I think we're probably all
still using on a daily basis I think
that's probably fair to say yeah the
iPhone we've had that we had the long
connector now we've got the Lightning
one we've changed from USB see you have
had so many different things and that
still is there and what that's doing is
making our phones fatter than they could
be we could get rid of that we can it
takes up a lot of space that connector
it's also a very old analog connection
it's based on old technology some
decades ago get rid of that we move on
we get used to it and in a year's time
we won't even remember the old headphone
jack I mean to address those points in
turn in terms of how much fatter are the
headphone port is is making phones you
know could they be thinner if they lost
it yes I mean possibly yes but I mean
well I mean yeah sure okay let's say
that they get two millimeters thinner is
that really gonna make much of a
difference if people really cared about
portability of their phones then they
wouldn't have been getting bigger and
bigger and bigger over the last few
years clearly we don't care I live and
die on that two millimeters Luke no I
don't believe that for a second and as
for the the digital audio thing yes you
are right there are some potentially
very interesting things that could be
done with the move away from the
limitations of the port we have now but
I mean let's be honest most people are
just using the sort of straight out the
box
Apple earphones lots of people like if
they go a step up and that don't want to
spend more than maybe sort of a hundred
pounds hundred dollars on something that
they're probably going to lose or
something going to break so I don't
believe that's the sort of minor audio
audiophile grade increase in sound
quality
oh really worth that you can't blame
people some people still using feature
phones and listen to ocean color seen
like doesn't necessarily mean that other
people won't take advantage of this tag
but we've also seen massive increases in
Bluetooth technology like bluetooth
headphones a few years ago what or fall
and it was this this terrible tinny
sound and now like the new generation
things from like AKG I've got some
amazing ones even a new beat have got
brilliant Bluetooth audio I don't know
what future you are living in where
Bluetooth is good enough now and has
reached an acceptable level of quality
but it's not my universe you don't be
charging up your headphones I don't
think that's what people that's what
people want at the moment the headphone
jack is one of the very few pieces of
technology on a smartphone that you know
is going to be reliable it's been
realized it reliable my breaks all the
time and on most of my devices not
discounting my current phone from this
the the headphone jack is the first
thing to go and ends up being like you
you have to wiggle the cable and
sometimes one channel will cut out and
one won't and you think how is it the
headphone that's at play or is it the
phone is that a problem with the port or
is it a problem with the connector cuz
it sounds like your head for I think
it's both is the problem because they
are both fragile old-fashioned types of
technology a complete disagree it's an
old reliable technology that for decades
has been doing a very very simple job
extremely and other what other piece of
taking your phone is decades old well
there's no other piece of tech because
only one piece of tech this decades old
is still doing its job is about decent
level ante feature I'm not anti future
I'm just anti change for the sake of it
this is change train this is an Apple
like trying to station
September Apple launched no I think it's
a good port and I hope that it stays
around I hope that it stays around
forever anyway Andy and I will have to
agree to disagree but as always let us
know what you think</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
