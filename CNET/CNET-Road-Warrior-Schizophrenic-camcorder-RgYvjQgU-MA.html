cnet.com and welcome to road warrior
where we take a look at the hottest
gadgets for life on the go coming up a
schizophrenic HD camcorder another
Trifield UMPC from sony and an infinity
with a safe rear end let's start with
the NECN 908 it's a touch screen cell
phone so how does that work Nicole you
die by tapping the phone screen like
this and sort of dial numbers with the
key input screen right here if you want
to text just press text able to create a
message you have to go through and click
the text messaging button and then you
brings up a virtual qwerty keep up for
you to tap through it takes a little
getting used to using the touchscreen it
has an SD card but they buried it behind
the battery I hate it when they do that
the sony handycam HDR FX 7 is supposed
to be a prosumer HD camera but it has a
split personality one of the more
disappointing aspects of the camcorder
or is its audio support there are no XLR
inputs and you can't even independently
control the left and right channels of
the audio the video call is excellent
sharp colors are good and it handles
low-light situations pretty well it's
not quite powerful enough for the
entry-level professional and it's not
quite focused enough for the consumer
but it might be perfect for makers of
hi-def silent films hmm speaking of
devices with unclear target markets sony
has a new ultra mobile pc the UX 390 now
how to use an ultra mobile pc well
they're compact easy to carry around in
your pocket when you're ready to use it
slide the screen up there's a full
keyboard under here the keys are a
little flat kind of hard to use even if
you're good at the blackberry style
thumb typing to move the cursor around
there's a pencil eraser dub over here
kind of like that an old thinkpad and
the left and right mouse buttons would
be under your other thumb over here now
if you hate all of that the screen is
actually a touch screen you can use your
finger to a click around on it or
there's a small stylus built into the
back you can whip out and click round
with it does have a built-in a video
card but only two hours of
battery life finally the infiniti fx45
has optional gps navigation and stereo
system niceties but what's cool is
what's standard the other little cute
feature of this LCD that is standard on
all the fx45 is the back up camera pop
it in reverse and you get a rear view as
well as distance markers and also beep
tones if you're about to hit something
and you're not looking at the screen
standard beep tones to stop me from
backing into something I could have used
that at poor azalea bush anyway that's
it for this edition of road warrior I'm
Tom Merritt check back next time for
more gadgets that keep you armed and
dangerously productive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
