the few smartwatches to include GPS
which as a runner I really like it
allows me to measure pace and distance
when running without having to carry my
smartphone the watch also uses a new
display technology that helps keep it
visible whether in direct sunlight or
indoors but really the good ends there
the watch is powered by Android wear so
can display notifications from your
iPhone or Android device and
personalized cards with information on
things like weather or the traffic but
Android wear still feels like a work in
progress as a running watch I actually
like the Moto 360 but the more I used it
I became frustrated the watch features
an optical heart rate sensor and
provides a lot of post-run data and
Motorola's built-in moto body app
handled everything really well including
activity tracking for things like steps
and calories burned but the app is
missing some features there's no auto
pause or interval training there's also
no way to manually create a lap pressing
the side button simply brings you back
to the home screen it's very frustrating
to pause the watch during a run you
actually have to double tap the screen
it's not practical whatsoever the watch
also isn't waterproof so you can't wear
it in the shower or the pool as for
battery life well you will have to
charge it daily period it wouldn't even
last me 12 hours on days I went for a
run which is completely unacceptable
with an active GPS signal you would be
lucky to get four hours many running
watches tend to last more than 10 hours
the Moto 360 sport is available for $300
in the US which is quite high given its
limitations overall you're just better
off buying a traditional running watch
that has some sort of smart features for
more information check out my full
review over at cnet.com I'm Dan graziano
prasena and that was a first look at the
Moto 360 Sport
