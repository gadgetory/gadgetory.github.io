i'm here at samsung space fest the
launch of the new space shuttle
enterprise museum at the intrepid air
and space museum so it's very exciting
we've got some great stuff to see let's
go and check it out the Space Shuttle
enterprise arrived in new york in april
2012 and now resides in a temporary
pavilion on the deck of the USS Intrepid
the Space Shuttle enterprise was NASA's
original prototype and the first of six
shuttles in all it was flown in test
missions in the late 70s but never
actually flew in space it was designed
to be converted to space flight but as
is proved too costly it was instead used
to spare parts right here is the only
place that real tiles were installed on
enterprise and this was for the Columbia
accident investigation as you recall
when Columbia took off a piece of foam
broke off of the external fuel tank
tumbled back and struck the vehicle they
didn't know it at the time but it poked
a hole in the wing so when they had the
hypothesis of what may have happened
after the disaster and they had to kind
of work that out so they actually took
the main landing gear door off of
enterprise and also a series of leading
edge pieces and those were brought down
to the Langley NASA Langley Center where
they have the high-speed wind tunnels
and they blasted him with the foam and
they did determine that a piece of foam
at that velocity can indeed poke a hole
in a space shuttle museum says the
enterprise exhibition is a great way for
school children to learn about space
exploration but my most exciting moment
I got to tell you was this morning we
did a members preview and there was a
lot of kids and I just saw kids walk in
and see their their jaw drop open and
their eyes get so big and to just walk
around and they got to meet astronauts
this morning too
so this is ty pendlebury from cnet
signing off from the final resting place
of the Space Shuttle enterprise</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
