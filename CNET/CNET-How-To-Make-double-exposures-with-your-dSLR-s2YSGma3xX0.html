way to get multiple different images in
the one frame you might have seen some
cool examples of silhouettes with
patterns in them or Clone Wars style
pictures with the same person around
different positions in the frame for
this tutorial I'm going to show you how
to make these two examples in your DSLR
no Photoshop required I'm going to be
using the Canon 5d Mark 3 and the Nikon
d800 find a subject or even yourself to
position in the frame like any
silhouette make sure there's a strong
back light coming from behind the
subject such as the sky or even a white
wall can work set your exposure so the
background is mostly blown out I like to
use the spot meter to do this once
you've got a suitable silhouette turn on
the multiple exposure options on the
Canon press the paintbrush button at the
back of the camera and switch disable to
on function control leave all the
settings on this screen as they are but
make sure you scroll down to the bottom
and choose select image for multiple
exposure choose the silhouette you shot
previously and confirm it on-screen
you'll be taken back to the multiple
exposure menu and then from here turn on
live view you should be able to see that
very same silhouette on the screen now
it's time to find a pattern or filthy or
silhouette such as flowers leaves trees
the only limit is what you can imagine
compose the shot to your liking and try
and fill the silhouette with pattern but
make sure your underexposing
this second image ever so slightly this
is because the camera is adding the
exposures together in camera by default
so if you shoot on the meter
things are going to be overexposed now
I'm going to show you how to make a
clone wars multiple exposure with your
subject in three different positions
around the frame first up grab your DSLR
and tripod and then frame up the shot
using the Nikon I'm going to turn on
multiple exposure press the menu button
and then find multiple exposure under
the shooting menu turn it on and select
single photo now choose the number of
shots you want in the final frame in
this example I need three get your
subject in the first position for
and then expose the shot to your liking
take the photo and then rinse and repeat
for the next two frames so there you
have it a quick guide to using multiple
exposure on your DSLR I would love to
see the results you get using these
