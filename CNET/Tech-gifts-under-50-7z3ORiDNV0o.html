scene that fan has in common is that
you're all incredibly tough to shop for
your discriminating bunch and you
already own a bunch of gadgets so why
would your loved one spend any money for
a new gadget that you won't like or
won't need so to avoid another
membership to the sock of the Month Club
here are five tech gifts that are easy
to give or receive and they're all
priced under fifty dollars these come
from Cena's 2012 holiday gift guide I
rank them by order of their likelihood
to please the geek who has everything
starting at number five an mp3 player
now you probably own a dozen different
gadgets at this point that can play mp3s
your smartphone your Xbox your tablet
laptop TV maybe even a musical kegerator
but there's something special about a
cheap clip on mp3 player whether it's an
iPod shuffle or a sansa clip zip you can
take them to the gym you can leave them
connected to your car stereo or you can
even use it to voice your home brewed
animatronic Abraham Lincoln at number
four the Logitech Harmony 300 universal
remote control this $30 computer
programmable remote makes a great gift
for anyone with too many remotes or even
just one nasty grimy sad worn-out remote
instead of shaming the nerd in your life
into taking a can of lysol to their
busted remote just treat them to a new
one if you can spare sixty dollars an
upgrade to the harmony 650 adds a little
built-in screen and some cool extra
features number three is the least sexy
products on this list but it's also the
product that i personally want the most
the dlink dir 605 l cloud router you
might remember this little guy from the
top five routers under eighty dollars
you get lightning fast wireless and
Wi-Fi speeds and the killer feature an
Android or iOS app that can control it
all from halfway around the world you
can kick freeloaders off your Wi-Fi
monitor connection speeds and even
reboot the whole thing they may already
have a great router but I bet it doesn't
come with a nap coming in at number two
headphones can you ever have enough
headphones you can think of this as an
instant affordable way to make the
gadgets you already have sounds so much
better if you want some peace and quiet
you can try the audio technica ath m34
portability go
the Panasonic her go fit and for style
there's the Panasonic RP HDX 7 there are
tons of great options out there and I've
never seen someone disappointed by a new
pair of headphones now before we get to
number one just in case you have a
little more on the budget here's a peek
at some of cnet's top gift ideas for
under a hundred dollars I'll take one of
each thanks and now my vote for the
number one tech gift under fifty dollars
that's perfect for the gadget nerd who
has everything a bluetooth music
receiver this little box will make
pretty much any existing stereo
Bluetooth compatible now Apple's new
lightning connector has made your old
speaker dock obsolete here's a way to
reclaim it by going wireless works with
Android iPhone windows phone blackberry
tablets you can even use it to upgrade
that boombox you kept from the 80s that
way you'll get the geek cred and the
street cred but mostly the geek cred so
there you have some great gift ideas all
for under fifty dollars but that's just
the tip of the iceberg check out seen
