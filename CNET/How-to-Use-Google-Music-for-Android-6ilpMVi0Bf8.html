to walk you through Google music for
Android with Google music you can access
all your music across multiple devices
and computers without burdening your
phone or computer storage basically the
music is stored on Google servers and
played back over Wi-Fi or your cell
network to your phone to get a google
music account go to music google.com
slash music and request an invite
Google is slowly rolling this beta
software out so be patient once you've
been invited you'll be able to access
the Google music web interface in the
browser and download the music manager
for your desktop
music manager will copy all the music on
your computer to Google servers and make
it all available on your Android phone
or tablet when you're not at home but
even without an invite you can still
download the Android app and get to know
the interface go to the Android Market
and search for music it's the app with
the headphones icon once it's downloaded
and installed select which Google
Account you want to use with the app
it's based on what accounts are already
connected to your phone once you're all
set up the app will automatically load
songs from your online library and your
phone's internal storage if you have a
huge library because maybe you decided
to take advantage of the free storage of
20,000 songs it might take a while but
once the list is populated playing music
is pretty straightforward just tap a
song to begin playing it
or hit the arrow to the right of any
song and press play here you'll also see
other options make an instant mix is
Google's answer to Apple's genius
feature if you select it Google will
create a playlist of songs similar to
the one you selected it's nice for when
you're on the go want to dig up old
music or if you just want to let Google
work its magic you can also add a song
to a playlist in this menu you can
either add the song to an existing
playlist or create a new one all your
playlists are stored in the tab at the
top to create a new one hit the menu
button and select new playlist you can
rename it and begin adding songs albums
or artists through the other tabs each
tabs menu selection is different it
makes experience a little frustrating
but the main thing you should know is
that the playlist albums and artists
tabs have an option called make
available offline so now that all your
music is stored on Google servers
how do you access it when you're not
connected to the Internet this is where
make available offline comes in tap that
option and you'll see pushpins show up
next to the items on the list tap the
pushpins next to the items you want
available offline and hit done the music
is cached onto your phone so the amount
of music you can make available offline
depends on how much storage you have and
you can deselect them later to remove
them from your phone and free up space
you can check on the download progress
by going to menu settings then download
cue there are other useful settings here
to take a look around and contact me on
Facebook if you have any questions and
look if you rotate the phone to
landscape you get a whole different
interface feel free to choose
accordingly send your questions comments
and how-to ideas to how to @ cnet.com
and for more handy how-to videos head on
over to see net tv.com for seen it I'm
Sharon Vaknin and I'll see you on the
interwebs
