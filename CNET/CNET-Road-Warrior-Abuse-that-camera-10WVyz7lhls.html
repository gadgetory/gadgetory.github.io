com and welcome to road warrior where we
take a look at the hottest gadgets for
life on the go coming up a portable
video player that also records video a
camera you can crush and a Nintendo Wii
laptop you heard that but first Bonnie
cha has the nokia n800 it's an internet
tablet but its design makes it good for
at least one thing built in this little
kickstand so you can set it on the desk
and view web pages that way I'm front
you have a beautiful screen it's really
sharp and crisp so it's great to view
the web pages very cool thing on the
device is built in webcam also rotate
180 degrees so you can view in front of
you and invest video conference is hold
on I'll be right back it can surf the
web and can do VoIP as well next Jasmine
France has a new portable video player
from Philips the PMC 7230 with a unique
feature this pm see also records video
which is pretty unusual I don't think
I've seen a portable media center in the
past that records video and it even
comes with the cable which is this cable
here you can just plug it right into
your AV outs on your TV or cable box
Jasmine said the viewing angle is really
good too so it's easy for two people to
watch at once great for Valentine's Day
up next a camera for the water-based
road warrior that'd be a ceiling warrior
anyway it's the olympus stylus 770 SW
when you're diving it has a built-in
manometer which is sort of like an
altimeter only in reverse it lets you
see how deep you are going in the water
among other features and it will
actually record to the information
stored on the image how deep you are
when you shot which makes this really
handy for if you're diving and want to
take pictures it's also crushproof up to
220 pounds and freezeproof down to 14
degrees Fahrenheit that's negative 10
Celsius come on America get metric
finally Ryan block from engadget dropped
by our crave podcast to talk about the
modding of a Nintendo Wii into a laptop
yep a laptop from our regular columnist
name is Ben Heck indoor
and he's kind of known in the console
modding community he actually makes
laptops and portables out of old video
game system so he did so uh he's done
like Ataris he's done like I think you
did a Jaguar he definitely he was really
well known for his xbox 360 like heard
about master yeah I wanted him to do a a
wee laptop and it came out really well i
really like Ryan said Ben actually
integrated the wiimote sensor into the
top so the motion sensing works just
fine that's it for this edition of road
warrior I'm Tom Merritt check back next
time for more gadgets that keep you
armed and dangerously productive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
