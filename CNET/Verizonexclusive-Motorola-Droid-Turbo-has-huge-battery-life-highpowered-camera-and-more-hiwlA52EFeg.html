Motorola's had a lot of phones come out
this is the Droid turbo
somewhere between the Moto X and the
Nexus 6 that's coming out soon this is a
Verizon exclusive phone now what's the
difference this is kind of like the Moto
X with the dream feature set that we
always wanted this a 5.2 inch display
but it's quad HD 2560 by 1440 565 pixels
per inch crazy high pixel resolution but
it's also got the next faster level
processor Qualcomm Snapdragon 805 2.7
gigahertz 3 gigs of ram it also has a 21
megapixel back camera shoots 4k video 2
megapixel front camera 1080p
it's got ruggedized designs on the back
metallized glass fiber or ballistic
nylon red or black comes with 32 gigs of
on-board storage for 199 64 gigs for 249
what does it lack did I mention its
battery life that's the best feature
48 hours of battery life on this plus
with a turbo charger that comes included
you can get eight hours of use in 15
minutes of charging which is a lot like
the type of performance that we've seen
in droids of the past in terms of
software this comes with Android 4.4.4
pure Android according to Verizon and
Motorola with a lot of the moto voice
features that you saw in the Moto X it's
also got a guaranteed upgrade to
lollipop when it's available very soon
this sounds like a dream phone and it's
smaller overall than the Nexus 6 that
could be really appealing to a lot of
people including myself but it's a
Verizon exclusive coming October 30th
stay tuned for a full CNET review on
Scott's time this is the Droid turbo</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
