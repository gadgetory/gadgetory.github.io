cnet.com and I'm here with the Libra
tone zip this is a portable airplay
speaker and as you can see it has a very
eye-catching modern design it looks like
a cylinder a canister whatever you want
to call it it has this little carrying
strap on the side what makes it easy to
carry around what's really cool about it
is that you can connect directly from
your iPhone iPod Touch or iPad directly
to this device via airplay with most
other airplay speakers you have to go
through a Wi-Fi network but this one
connects really like a Bluetooth speaker
but because it's airplay it actually
sounds better than Bluetooth and this
speaker sounds really good for a compact
speaker what's interesting about it is
that you can place it wherever you want
obviously it can go on the floor can go
on a table and it sounds very different
depending on where you place it there's
also a iPhone app that allows you to
tweak the sound a little bit depending
on where you place the device the other
interesting feature is that this has a
removable cover to it you can buy this
in a couple different versions the base
model with this gray model here is $400
that is quite a bit of money but there's
also a $450 package which comes with two
extra covers normally the covers are $50
should you get a little bit better value
by buying those extra covers they're
really only a few buttons on the device
the main power button is on the top you
simply press that to put it in Wireless
mode they're also vine controls on the
top you can also use this speaker in a
wired mode you can connect a cable and
connect an audio device to the speaker
that does improve battery life the
battery life is about eight hours if you
are using it in Wired mode but if you
put it into Wireless mode and use it as
an airplay speaker it only gives you
about four hours you can also plug the
speaker into the wall it comes with a a
C adapter and that's how you charge it a
lot of people will use this in their
homes as kind of a little showpiece but
you can also take it on the road take it
outside take it from room to room
now there are other premium wireless
speakers you have the jawbone big Jambox
for instance that has a built-in
speakerphone then you have the Bose
Soundlink Wireless - that's also a
portable bluetooth speaker and it's a
little bit more durable than this one
but if you're an owner of an iOS device
and you're looking to use this more at
home than on the road I would say this
is the better choice though it is pretty
pricey at $400 it does sound better than
the competition and it does look a
little better I'm David Carr noise and
that's the Libra tone zip thanks for
