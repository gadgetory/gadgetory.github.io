to the Apple buy for everything good and
bad inside the world of Apple lots of
news from Mac books to the Apple watch
and that iPhone 7 thing but let's start
off with the laptop that hasn't seen a
redesign in over four years
now a Bloomberg report by Mark diamond
says the new revamped MacBook Pro models
will have a smaller footprint they will
have a thinner design but they will not
adopt the wedge-shaped style of the
MacBook Air and 12-inch MacBook now the
trackpad will be slightly wider and the
report also confirms the rumored oled
touch strip will replace the function
keys and the buttons will adapt to the
application that is being used at the
time Apple's also playing on bringing
its touch ID tech to the MacBook Pro by
integrating a scanner beside the new
OLED keyboard display the updated Mac
books will feature Andy's Polaris
graphics chip that has the power
efficiency and a 20% thinner design to
fit inside the slimmer MacBook Body
Intel chips are expected but the
specific processor has not been
identified
expect to see USBC for the ports on this
machine that will handle charging and
data transfer and display connectivity
the new MacBooks are said to be in the
advanced testing phase but will not
launch until after apple's iphone event
with reports now pointing to that one on
wednesday september the 7th apple's in
desperate need of a refresh and this
will be a nice boost to reinvigorate the
macbook line and keep their Mac sales
steady I'll write jgi Securities analyst
Ming chief well reports details on the
new Apple watch he claims the Apple
watch 2 will feature a faster tsmc bill
processor and will include GPS a
barometer superior waterproofing and a
higher capacity battery yesplease on all
the above now the new Apple watch will
retain the same size and thickness as
current models and the once rumored LTE
connectivity will not show up until 2017
the report does not confirm if we'll see
an expanded Wi-Fi capabilities or a
FaceTime camera and the new Apple watch
is expected in the second half of this
year now the report also claims that
Apple will upgrade the first generation
Apple watch models with only the faster
TSMC processor and better waterproofing
it will likely launch those in the
second half of 2016 as well
alright apple also released new updates
with the fifth beta for
all of their software platforms as iOS
10 beta gets closer to the final release
the tweets are less significant now
photos will rescan your entire photo
library for facial recognition data it's
been fixed to work with that lovely
iPhone battery case and in the widgets
panel third-party widgets have been
darkened and control center icons have
been updated with a new output icon as
well
TV OS and watch shows trace also get
tweaks and you know who did you forget
about to me already
it's me Marcos Sierra no no we didn't at
all all right on to the latest iPhone 7
stories from Bloomberg that gives us new
insight into two of its standout
features according to the report Apple
is playing to update the home button now
this new home button will be pressure
sensitive and will give you a haptic
feedback response that simulates a click
when it's pressed hard enough the
rumored dual camera lens system on the
larger screen iPhone will produce
brighter pictures with more detail
according to sources both camera sensors
will each capture color differently
simultaneously take a picture and then
produce a single image that's based on
merging the information from both
pictures will also allow users to zoom
in to take photos with more clarity but
again it's exclusive to the larger
screen iPhone and we pretty much know
there's no headphone jack on the new
iPhone and there have been trademark
filings by Apple for what they call air
pods a new report from Forbes says Apple
is developing wireless earbuds with a
custom low-power Bluetooth chip now
Apple has spent the past few years
developing this radio chip that could
possibly launch with the new iPhone 7
the goal to fix a problem that has
plagued Bluetooth headsets a limited
battery life it was planned to launch in
2015 but performance issues stalled its
release so we'll wait and see oh yeah if
you want to see what the rumored a10
processor that will be inside the phone
looks like here you go
whoo ahh and if you're holding on to
hope for an Apple TV streaming service
it's time to let go
according to recode Apple's new TV plan
is a TV Guide what now after giving up
on putting together an Apple TV package
of their own Apple is working on trading
a digital
TV Guide that would work on Apple TV
boxes and others like iOS devices the
iPhone and the iPad now Apple wants to
use networks and content providers apps
to help them direct people to those apps
to watch content and yes that still
requires a cable subscription bottom
line Apple is just working on an
interface that's a launcher are you
serious
like after apples reports of their
inability to work with cable networks
they're blind cockiness the fact that
legitimate TV streaming services exist
from others and Apple loses a revenue
stream by just making an interface this
is stupid and you know what we're
dishing out a bad apple and yes last
week I said iPad nanos socks instead of
iPod nanos socks he'll fine even though
you know what I meant I get a bad apple
too now you feel better about that all
right let's announce the winners of our
air view card tablet mount I asked you
to tell me my Pokemon go pick up line
and the winners are carmine de Matteo on
email and to Frank 1 and Lia salsa on
Twitter she has pokeballs too now I
instantly regret this contest after
receiving hundreds of solicitations by
grown-man asking can I throw my balls at
you even youtuber J specs asked me to
pick two all right that's gonna do for
this week's show you can always email us
at the Apple byte SC Netcom or tweet me

we'll catch y'all next time for another
bite of the Apple
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
