here my colleagues my lovely and
handsome colleagues yep Bridget Carey
and Jenkins in the house and uh you know
we're here for CES in-depth kind of
talking about some of the big headline
news or some of the products or things
that stuck out in our minds you know a
lot of trends happening here wearables
4k HD TVs you know also smart appliances
but I wanted to talk about today we
heard about LG's life man and their
heart rate earphones for you guys what's
your take on the whole fitness band
thing we've really seen it explode now
wearables and kind of the fitness angle
what's your gut which we've got take on
this J wait it looks like a category
that's really a very very short lived
because um your phone can do all this
I've got moves on my iPhone and actually
there's better than these fitness bands
because it knows where I've been and
it's got much better display ice sort of
thing this is something's going to be
absorbed by phones really really quickly
they're really nice products I use a
Fitbit for a bit but that was it really
half a bit what do you think bridget
yeah I mean how much you know are you
motivated actually put it on one that
struck out to me interesting was razor
they have one called the Naboo it's
supposed to be the best of both worlds
the SmartWatch you know capabilities of
a pebble where you get your text alerts
but also your fitness so maybe they're
finding that happy medium you know but
yeah right now I'm curious but I'm not
dishing out the dollars I mean a lot a
lot of Cena editors that are even into
fitness have given the wristband to try
I've tried multiple ones but over time I
don't at first you think it's cool that
you know how many steps you took you
might like that fear at CES but then
after a week or two you're like does it
really matter in like you said samsung
phones iPhones there's apps and also
natively the chips I can track your
movements and without wearing anything
on your bracelet so I do think they're
all jumping you know on board it's
there's some interesting things there
but short live what's the shelf life
guys let's throw out a number let's play
with us let's go 6-6 6100 will be in
landfill okay that's very sad also um
you know we talked about some of the
other things out there's sim oh ok well
we talked about the you know the pebble
right pebbles kind of coming back with
their next-gen
version the pebble steel I think that
one's interesting but again when you
talk about short life you know there's
something in my gut that feels like
pebble was the one that got people
interested in this market and that once
you see the big players come out with
what you know their final polished
generations of the smart watches in
let's be honest whatever Apple puts out
there ah I wonder you know pebble is
gonna just get absorbed by then it's
like they're the ones that pioneer that
but are they gonna be able to stay in
the market and be relevant that's I
think it's a tricky one for them yeah
cuz as soon as bright as Apple comes
along or Google right right the big boys
who remembers pebble but you know they
are making it stylish I mean it doesn't
like a toy anymore looks like something
you would wear as an actual watch and
then you know they're definitely a text
or a success story from the tech space
as well you know Kickstarter's where
they got their start they raised over 10
million dollars from Kickstarter I mean
so we shouldn't just you know poopoo and
also and be like oh they're in trouble I
mean they've had an amazing story just
in itself in the tech space so you know
we'll see where these wearables go with
transitioning over to kind of one of the
cool things i saw that i may not buy the
samsung bendable TV what do you go with
bendable TV did you hear that LG now has
12 hahaha is it is it is bigger because
I know they're like sword fighting all
this oh yeah who's got the bigger one
that's I'm talking about nobody yeah
just change it on a whim with a remote
seems like some of that's cool to show
off to your friends on the big game day
you're a baller yeah you have a lot of
money right yeah I don't know something
different its kind of quirky I can't
help it you know well if you guys are
insistent a curved screen is a better
for you because it's more cinematic cuz
it surrounds your field of business it's
like we did I max thieriot that's curved
on a dome I guess I guess sicamous yeah
slight difference you want a big a curve
you'd be happy if it was round it's
gonna go go hey Jason do you like maker
curves well not sure how to answer okay
buddy your lot you're blushing I don't
know why but you are okay we're also you
know Sony's 4k camcorder I thought that
was pretty interesting we just saw that
from Sony again it's not going to be
very affordable but pushing for K into
the really true consumer space their
pioneering pioneering that i like it i'm
not i'm not going to buy i don't i don't
have a need
4k camera I don't have a 4k TV well they
lost Tommy bought camcorder to use a
camcorder it's just on your phone like
it sits on phones I'm a bit of Sony
that's really successful is the
professional end of the absolute cameras
for everybody I mean that that she makes
loads loads of money so I mean it's kind
of exciting and interesting and well
done them for making a 4k camcorder but
it's not going to say they almost have
to because if they have these 4k TVs and
it's like well we gotta do something to
make content for them so let's encourage
people no more 4k this and 4k that it's
tricky because also you know it's just
shown that people are going to gravitate
more towards convenience if it looks
good enough or even better than good
enough it looks great it may not be 4k
but people are still gravitating towards
what's coming I mean look at our smart
you know point-and-shoot cameras those
are those are almost complete like when
was the last time I don't know do you
guys use plain shoots I just pick up my
phone now these days in then I miss I
miss a point-and-shoot when I don't have
a good flash yeah right that that that's
about it so if there may be a
terminology issue with 4k and ultra HD I
mean are they gonna all use one
eventually and then sometimes they use
both together to mate to make sure that
we all feel good about that also you
know another product that we've seen
here in trend that we've seen here smart
appliances kind of the ecosystem a
samsung smart home LG's home chat you
know we've seen other devices kind of
before the big players have kind of
jumped in here from simple things and
just all these different interfaces to
really control your home do you guys own
any of these things even something like
a nest thermostat or anything like that
no bye I'm very excited about the
potential of it obviously it's very very
early days and yet a lot of this stuff
is very very gimmicky because it's
because it's very new I love my nest
though honestly it's I mean let's be
real it's expensive but I wanted to give
it a try just for the standpoint of you
know we see so much tech coming in and
out of our doors you know at work and so
you know it's it's expensive I it's
definitely not a general consumer thing
yet but it's fun I mean you walk by it
detects you there it turns on the heat
it's pretty nifty but not not at that
not in not even you know what you time
out of twenty thirty dollar thermostat
versus like about 150-200 dollars yeah
for that price but I you know I do like
this whole smart home automation some
people might be maybe for the anal
retentive though like that
you know keep track of every control
your lights control your crockpot a
crockpot are you down with that I don't
know what a cruel boy is that much yeah
oh yes slow cooker thank you thank you
yeah it's slow cooker there you go there
you go those an international basis all
right so um another thing just being
here you know this is the day before CES
takes off just asking you guys what are
you guys really maybe were you looking
forward to sometimes media members and
the press are little jaded hello when
they a little sometimes when they when
they come here year after year but is
there anything that maybe you're kind of
looking forward to here at CES 2014 well
I'm really excited I'm interested by
smart watches as an idea and I've not
seen one that I would buy or where but I
sort of think more phones are getting
more complicated they're getting bigger
and I can see that something that I
where would be really useful i just
don't know quite what it looks like on
what it does somewhat no one's shown you
that thing yeah basically Apple hasn't
come out it's pretty insane but you
never know someone may will be here and
they will come with something this I'm
looking for that I'm the same reason
give me a reason to put it on my race I
mean I also make it a little more
stylish too you know well they haven't
really targeted the female no that's not
what standpoint just I'm just saying you
know I've noticed i know i've noticed as
well so also what we're gonna do here
now guys um you know in depth again
every every day at the end of the day
we're kind of just going to highlight
some of the things that happen but i
have a little special segment for you
guys okay Marco over there can you hear
me Marco we're going we're going to turn
up the music this is a segment you know

little bit in a second okay just um just

guys well you know what we're gonna do
now here thank you so much for coming up
here CES in depth we're gonna take a
break in we're gonna say goodbye to my
lovely friends here bridge and adjacent
but i'll be back with jim funk from Roku
you like that name I like that name I
like that you can tell people from Roku
are here because they are clapping for
that name
they're just brand new announced Roku
TVs we're really excited about that so
we'll take a break we'll be back with
Jim and we'll catch you guys in a second
like dad had a Honda my mom had a Honda
was coming from a 2007 honda accord i
traded in for fusion titanium no joke i
test-drove 15 different vehicles I kinda
was indifferent toward Ford and then i
sat in the fusion for the first time and
I just like wow this is it you have the
power but she had the fuel economy
that's what EcoBoost does I love to help
people look at what board has to offer
all right guys we are here back with
roku zone Jim funk they were they were
doing the wave over in the back if they
do it I Jim and I will continue the wave
guys ready started hurry up Jim whoo
that was fun okay Jim we're here with
you here to show off roku TV I mean this
is an exciting announcement for you guys
finally getting your UI and interface
into a TV set can you kind of tell us
about the products and how it came to be
sure we make set-top boxes now for about
five and a half years and what we did is
we took everything we've learned about
making a good user interface and we put
it inside a TV so we partnered with high
sense and TCO to the five largest TV
manufacturers in the world and this is
Roku TV showing here at CES and shipping
late summer this year mer we September
timber summer September whatever the
retailer's put it on the shelf that's
when we'll have it out there okay
excellent now I'm standing on some
cement blocks I just want to be really
transparent with you guys out there
because Jim is a very tall man can you
show us the UI because a lot of people
that may not know about Roku you know
TCL and hisense these are you know two
companies China china-based really
making inroads in the US and they're not
familiar with you know Roku as much as
over here in the United States so if you
could kind of maybe just talk about what
they're getting and people that have
never really even given Roku a chances
it but I mean it has so much content
kind of show them what they can expect
so the first thing people are familiar
with Roku this is a standard interface
very familiar to people who are Roku
users all the great content there on the
right some TV specific functionality so
the T's are made of a high sense but all
the software is from Roku so just like
normal broke come over here Jim be my
friend because we want to see the TV
right options on the left and on the
right all the different services we have
em go movies we have our search feature
we have news from AOL but I go back up
here and what you'll see are the inputs
or the different options that you have
in the way we designed this when you sit
down to your TV you say what do I want
to do do I want to watch my cable do i
wanted to watch netflix hulu plus you
don't think about input one input to
input three you just want to click so if
i click on cable I'm right into my cable
TV whatever channel I'm tuned to I just
hit back I'm right back to my interface
again I want to go to Netflix it's right
here Hulu Plus Pandora all of that built
into it just like you have on the roku
player but now with a single interface a
single simple remote control right in
your TV and we should scroll up to show
a specific icon here youtube youtube
that's big for you guys and also for
people that are Roku owners right so we
launched youtube on the roku 3 in
december and be coming out on other
models this next couple months yeah it's
great to have it on roku now one thing
that I think is really cool about the
Roku I mean this is just a personal
anecdote is I'm a slingbox user and
you're able to throw your slingbox video
from your device onto a TV with a roku 3
and from what I've been told that also
will be able to work with these TV sets
as well as that correct correct so let's
say you have this TV in a second bedroom
your slingbox is in your living room how
many bedrooms do you have gym three nice
third bedroom so yeah just like with all
the Roku products um all the apps that
available on roku box they'll be here on
roku TV and 44 roku as a company just
seeing how you guys have grown and
evolved I mean this is one of the steps
we have two manufacturers right now are
you guys looking to do any more work
with you know some of the other TV
manufacturers out there yeah we think of
Roku TV is a plat
it's all software and t7 high center our
first two partners but we're really
looking to make the Roku platform as
broad as possible so will still do lots
of boxes one of the lots of TVs as well
okay well you know there you go at the
TCL and hisense Roku TV we have them
right here looking great and that's
really going to do it for us here with
Roku TV thanks so much for coming out
Jim appreciate a man and I appreciate
letting me stay on these cement blocks
okay please join us again starting at
nine a.m. pacific time tomorrow we'll
