little bit of extra apple bite content
that we want to throw out you it's been
less than 24 hours since the pre-orders
of the iPhone 10 dropped so much stuff
so much news and just things came out of
that so we wanted to kind of give you a
little wrap-up we like to call it the
aftermath of the iPhone 10 pre-orders
keeping it with the Apple bite family so
what I wanted to first talk about right
let's talk about the winners and the
losers of the pre-order night now first
of all the winners has to be the carrier
site so we're talking about Verizon AT&amp;amp;T
t-mobile when I was on Twitter and I was
just waiting for my apps we know that
historically the Apple Store app has
been the best and easiest way to get any
Apple pre-order on launch well that
wasn't the case at all in fact it was
probably the worst option to do this
time around and the carrier sites were
the winners we know that Verizon opened
their store like 5 to 10 minutes before
the 12:01 midnight time and so everyone
that was on Verizon was flooding them I
got all these messages like I got mine
on November 3rd I got mine like everyone
is happy that went through the carrier
site so now what I did is strategically
I had web browser on the Apple Store I
had a web browser on AT&amp;amp;T and then I had
my devices using the Apple store app the
thing about is the Apple store app on my
devices didn't even turn over after
15-20 minutes I I quit them force quit
them i refresh them the Apple store app
just didn't work and seem to be in most
cases for most people the last thing
that flipped over I know there were
plenty of people that said oh my gosh I
didn't realize how lucky I was like I
just got through the Apple store app
right away but that wasn't the case for
everyone so without a doubt the winners
were if you went directly through a
carrier site most of those people were
the winners of the iPhone 10 pre-order
now we talk about losers yeah it's got
to be people that did the Apple Store
app we're just 10 minutes and we knew
this thing was gonna be super hard to
get 10 minutes into the pre-order if you
didn't get in front of those 10 minutes
you are instantly gonna get an iPhone 10
pre-order that said delivery time of two
to three weeks
if
you were after 30 minutes the delivery
times that most people said they were
getting was 5 I was 4 to 5 weeks and
then let's not even talk about if you're
here in the u.s. fine those were that's
how long out you would get your phone
out you know at least you got one if
you're in the UK an Australian the wait
time was five to six weeks weeks my
friends like that's a long time so I
told you everyone was saying oh you're
trying to hype this up this is gonna be
shorts this was the hardest iPhone to
get on launch day a lot of people though
that did get through the system some of
the some of the winners were also people
that chose to pick up their phone
in-store some of those people were able
to actually expedite their time that
might have said two to three weeks pick
up an option in-store so it really looks
like to me Apple is trying to supply the
physical Apple retail stores and the
physical carrier stores first and then
online orders this time around kind of
took took second so there was a whole
bunch of different experiences some
people even had message that said Oh
call us back we have your order number
but you need to complete the order later
I was just lucky enough I got into a
tease web site and so first of all my
very first order that I did got it
through one of my web browsers on the
Apple Store app turned over like eight
to ten minutes later I got a phone
that's out two to three weeks but I'm
like I this has got to be better so
because I had launched all these
browsers the AT&amp;amp;T store put me in a
queue and I was waiting for around 15-20
minutes but once I got in they gave me
the option to get an Apple iPhone on
November the third so I pushed through
that and we'll see what happens which
phone gets here first but I was able to
seal an iPhone 10 256 gigs we'll talk
about that in a second through AT&amp;amp;T on
November third twenty minutes after the
time so we'll see what gets delivered
and how that plays out I know we have so
many experiences I want to see and read
about your experiences if you just put
some comments down here on the youtubes
or if you want to tweet us or email us
at Brian Tong as my Twitter the Apple by
that cnet.com is where you can send us
your email responses um we want to know
like what your situation was like but
then it also I think that you you come
out of this you
you get all involved in the hype and
it's all exciting and you come back the
next morning and I don't know about you
but when I had to look at that price
point of like over a thousand dollars
and let's be real Apple didn't offer 128
gig option and instead knew that most
people that take a lot of pictures and
photos were gonna force themselves to
jump up to the 256 gig storage model and
charge an additional hundred fifty
dollars look they're running a business
and we choose to buy that or not but I
thought that that to me that's a bad
apple right there like just knowing like
that's they could have just put 128 in
the entry level they could have it would
have cost them little to nothing but
they didn't they're like no we're gonna
push you higher to me making that option
I know a lot of people that once they
saw that 256 gig price point they said
you know what I'm walking away from this
they're probably smarter than all of us
they've walked away from paying for an
iPhone that much just just to get that
extra storage but like I said you know
we weren't waking up this morning I
think you know some perspective here is
important we are all I talk about this
all the time but we're so blessed and
lucky to be able to buy a phone like
this and you can have the argument that
your phone is now your computer it does
a lot of things that your computer can
or can't do and your computer does more
but I think personally I felt icky I
felt kind of gross seeing a 111 49 price
point on a phone plus tax and I did buy
it I bought it for the show you know I
am an Apple fan I'm a tech fan and I
bought it but I still felt gross about
it like I felt icky about it and I think
part of it is also when you put this in
a perspective like think about and I'm
not trying to be like hey everyone you
you should feel bad about your purchase
cuz a lot of you don't but think about
everything that has been going on around
in this world lately with the natural
disasters that you know the attacks and
you're like I'm dropping $1,000 on a
phone like that just didn't sit right
and I know that this maybe this is just
me speaking but I know that there's
other people that feel this way and I
just think about like how much more does
this $1,000 phone really do compared to
the phone that we have today like it's
gonna look awesome
that's great but how much does it really
really do to warrant that price and you
know you have to think about both sides
the coin the fact that I know many
people who are tech diehards that looked
at that price and walked away tells me
something and it speaks to me and so I
just wanted to offer perspective people
that want to say like oh if you want the
phone you can afford it that's fine you
can pay whatever you want I'm never
telling you how to spend your money but
I know there's a lot of people out there
as well including me
that just felt maybe maybe it's just my
mood today but just felt a little icky
and gross about buying the iPhone 10 and
just dropping that much money it just
didn't sit that right with me so you
know what we'd love to hear your
comments we just wanted to kind of talk
about what happened the iPhone 10
pre-order was as difficult as I thought
it would be
I didn't hypebeast it up like it really
delivered on all of it you know the
scarcity of it how hard it's gonna be
there's people that are now pre-ordering
the next day and it's same their orders
I think um it's sometime in December so
for all of you that got an iPhone 10
that got the pre-order congratulations I
mean that it's fun and it's exciting but
also like just we've got to think about
the bigger picture of how lucky we are
to be like yeah I just dropped $1,000 on
the phone it's wild so anyways we'll be
back with this week later or sorry next
week with obviously all new show content
talking about everything Apple we will
also get some inline interviews we're
gonna go out to the stores and see what
happens on November the 3rd for pickup
day so other than that we'll see you
guys next time a little bit of Apple
bits to the Apple byte you know how it
is Brian song here take care be safe
