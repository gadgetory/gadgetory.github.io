fastest the biggest and the brightest
gadget in town is tempting to write it
off as a failure but this iconic gaming
gadget proves that sometimes less really
can be more here's why
the end of the 80s or Nintendo Sega and
Atari all competing for the handheld
gaming crown of these three Titans
Nintendo's console was the least
powerful by far and yet the Gameboy
blasted past its rivals to become a
genuine gaming icon the Gameboy was
devised by Nintendo's R&amp;amp;D one division
led by gunpei Yokoi a legendary figure
who was the brains behind Nintendo's
first handheld The Game and Watch it was
a series of bold decisions from your
quois design team that made the Game Boy
an unlikely success the Game Boy didn't
have the fanciest tech around quite the
opposite his processing power wasn't
noteworthy it only had a few buttons and
it's tiny monochrome screen could only
handle four shades of grey which sounds
like some very lackluster erotic fiction
and then she kissed his hair or
something but he didn't like it compared
to Sega's Game Gear and Atari Flinx
which both had backlit color screens the
game boys of Durrett wrote even in 1994
what seemed like this consoles
weaknesses were actually its biggest
strengths with their big bright displays
the Lynx and Game Gear each required six
AAA batteries which they drained in just
a few hours the Game Boy by contrast
lasted way longer and by deploying more
modest tech Nintendo was able to keep
the price down
less is more that's the key to the Game
Boy puzzle and speaking of puzzles if
you really want to see what made the
system so popular you just need to flip
it around Tetris was born in Russia but
the rights to distribute the game on
consoles were bought by Dutch born
entrepreneur Henk Rogers Rogers says he
approached Nintendo about using the game
telling them that if they bundled the
Gameboy with Mario that sell it to kids
but if they went with Tetris that sell
it to everyone
indeed while Sega was busy pushing sonic
the broad appeal of Tetris gave the Game
Boy a flying start that left its rivals
in the dust
Tetris got us all hooked on the famous
type a music which is actually a Russian
folk tune and is the source of a mental
phenomena called Tetris syndrome which
can cause hardcore players to see
falling shapes while drifting off to
sleep or in the corner of their eyes
oh hey I just got off the phone with
Cape from finance and this plugin is
very weird with your with your expense
report is it true you actually
commissioned an entire warrants worse
than shoes if you left the office with a
cunning design and a brilliant bundled
game the game boy stormed the world
eventually getting a color makeover in
1998 in the u.s. Nintendo sold a million
game boys in just a few weeks while the
colorful sequels have combined sales to
nearly 120 million units these consoles
paved the way for the Game Boy Advance
and SP as well as quirky accessories
like the Game Boy camera and Game Boy
printer the Game Boy also served as a
launch pad for the Pokemon franchise
which has ballooned into movies trading
cards and TV the Game Boy line has died
out now replaced by the even more
popular Nintendo DS but its cultural
impact is still felt this original model
that was demolished in the Gulf War but
still functions became an internet
sensation while today bands use old game
boys to create 8-bit music
the Gameboy proved you need more than
just cutting-edge text to capture hearts
and minds something would do well to
remember in today's world of bigger and
bigger screens and more powerful
processors one Nintendo made was an
unlikely masterpiece and I loved it so
much I could kiss it but I won't because
I don't know where this one has been for
last 24 years
do you have fond memories of the Gameboy
and can you think of any other gadgets
that have proved to be unexpected
winners let me know and check back next
time for another adventure in tech</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
