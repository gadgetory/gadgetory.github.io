you a public service message to look out
for laptops like veto shiba satellite
l75 five not to say this isn't a
perfectly functional laptop it is this
configuration the s50 166 one of the
constellation of configurations that the
sheba has in its satellite line and in
particular in its budget-minded l series
has a core i3 processor four gigs of ram
maybe even a better-than-average 640
gigabyte hard drive but at a asking
price of $5.99 although you can get it
for less this laptop is simply too
bare-bones too clunky to everyday and
you should be asking for more in fact
there are laptops that offer more even
last year we saw Core i5 laptops for as
low as $500 depending on where you
shopped so is it fair to judge this
laptop that harshly that's the question
I think it is because this laptop right
now is on the verge of sort of being
made extinct because there are new Ivy
Bridge processors that are right on the
horizon that are going to be offering
slightly better processing speeds but
more importantly better integrated Intel
graphics probably at the same price
depending on where you look for the type
of laptops are going to be shopping for
we don't know that yet
but odds are very safe that you will be
able to find an equivalent laptop that
has better punch for the money and this
lock that doesn't even have USB 3.0
let's not get into that the question is
why make clunky laptops like this
anymore the price of ultra books is
going down and those types of thin
laptops be the Intel branded or
otherwise are going down maybe as low as
$700 this year and we'll start offering
larger hard drives in them so if you can
shave that down maybe a bit further
maybe get to $600 perhaps the future of
the cheap laptop is going to look a lot
thinner than this I'm Scott Stein and
that's a look and a little service
message for the DES Sheba satellite l75
5s 51 66
