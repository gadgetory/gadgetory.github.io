now we're taking a first look at the
Fitbit one costing ninety nine ninety
five the Fitbit one is one of the most
advanced pedometers money can buy it
also sits in the middle of fitbit's
current line of personal fitness
products right between the 5995 Fitbit
zip and new 99.95 Fitbit flex just like
typical gadgets like this the Fitbit one
tracks the steps you take throughout the
day and the calories you burn the Fitbit
one can also measure the number of
stairs you climb plus has the ability to
assess the length and quality of your
sleep the one has a digital clock -
something that a lot of fitness trackers
surprisingly lack if you've owned or
played with Fitbit spaz devices such as
the original Fitbit tracker and Fitbit
ultra the one will certainly look and
feel familiar small and oval-shaped
the tiny Fitbit one is easy to carry
even when placed in its silicon cover
and clip the idea is to use the clip to
attach the one to clothing either a belt
pants pocket or shirt once clipped the
gadget records your daily activity
there's just one button on the one
pressing it toggles through the products
various screens the time steps stairs
distance traveled and calories a little
flower icon also graphically shows how
active you've been the longer the
flowers stand the better additionally
you can have the device display a short
personalized reading when you first pick
it up unlike the Fitbit zip which uses a
watch battery the Fitbit one is powered
by a rechargeable battery just slip the
device out of its case and plug it into
its USB adapter to recharge to measure
sleep you tuck the one in to a special
cloth arm strap you wear in bed holding
the button toggles the sleep tracking
feature on and off with sleep recorded
you can see the duration of your
slumbering and how many times you woke
during the night the Fitbit one also
assesses how efficient it thinks your
sleep is depending on how much you toss
and turn the Fitbit one syncs data with
PCs and Macs via a wireless Bluetooth
connection using a Bluetooth adapter
that comes in the box select smartphones
such as I
and Samsung Galaxy s3 and galaxy note
devices can also sync in real time with
the Fitbit Android and iOS mobile apps
