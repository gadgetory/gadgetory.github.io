coming that we call the windows 10
anniversary update and that will be
coming this summer things like Windows
hello so that you can literally lot you
know you can log in today to your
computer with facial recognition or your
fingerprint you can now do that for
websites with Microsoft edge so Cortana
lets you not only actively speak to your
computer and have it take action for you
have it searched for you but also now
there's an intelligence framework behind
Cortana so that as you use it it gets
smarter the apps get smarter so for
example you can imagine you go to book a
hotel room at the westin sometimes you
might see this bot that says you know
welcome what are you trying to do you
need help booking a room you can imagine
now an intelligent framework behind that
that recognizes you who you are and then
allows allows you to say oh we saw that
last time you were here you like the
ground floor room so one of the one of
the nice features that we have as well
with pen support is the ability to use
the pen in microsoft office and within
maps is the ability to track a route
you're gonna go on a hike you live
around the mountain can trace the route
with your pen in a seconds it'll
digitize and now it's digitally aware so
it'll tell you the exact distance you're
going to hike and then as you rotate the
view to say hey what does that hike look
like the actual ink is digitally mapped
onto the map itself but the other thing
that will happen automatically is that I
can pick up my windows phone and if I go
to the Windows Maps app and where you
will see is that all of the custom path
and the annotations we just added I'll
right there roaming across all my
devices</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
