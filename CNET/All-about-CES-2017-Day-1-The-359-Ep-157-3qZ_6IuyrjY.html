at stage at CES 2017 today you're in for
a treat
Amaya Zack Turner I'm joined by Roger
Chang and Ben Fox Ruben for a special
super-sized edition over a bite sized
news podcast at 3:59 if you're new to
the show Roger and Ben break down the
most important tech stories in about
four minutes today we're gonna talk a
lot longer about the Consumer
Electronics Show because that's where we
are
then you seem to have some kind of smart
coffee cup or fellas what is that over
there yes it's quite delicious it's
filled with coffee yeah this is this is
the Lenovo smart assistant it was
announced a couple days ago and this is
essentially an Amazon echo but from
Lenovo it's got the Alexa smart AI
inside and you're gonna be able to do a
lot of the same stuff that you would be
able to do with an echo but this is
provided by Lenovo I have to ask why not
just get the echo so the pricing is a
little bit different this thing starts
at 129 so the echo starts at about 179
or 180 so they make the pricing a little
bit different also it's got a bit of an
interesting different look to it it
looks a little bit more like a Google
home down here but on top of that Amazon
wants to do this and Lenovo wants to do
this to try to sprinkle Alexa everywhere
like all over the place so lenovo is
interested in bringing Alexa to more
places and Amazon was more than happy to
do that we've seen this at the show all
over the place war whirlpool did an
integration with their appliances for
just announced that they're adding Alexa
into their automotive stuff
Mattel I think it did like a smart baby
monitor that's gonna help well your kids
asleep it's great that you bring this up
actually we have on our site a breakdown
of all of the Alexa connected stuff
we've got the cg C by GE lamp weird
circular circular lamp you've got
speakers you've got robot vacuum
cleaners dish is integrating Alexa into
its real control Alexa is everywhere
what for the second year in a row Amazon
has really dominated show without really
having an official presence here right
right yeah and it's it's interesting to
see how quickly this is actually
happened I mean home automation is
thing that's been discussed and
considered for the past couple of years
now but there really hasn't been this
platform to really bring it all together
you know like what was I supposed to do
have like 20 different remotes around my
house to operate the lights and the this
thing and that thing or whatever it's
voice or at least it's been voiced now
and Amazon is really taking advantage
and saying hey look we're gonna do this
we're gonna be the main platform and
that's how you have things like this
where Lenovo and a lot of these other
guys are finding a way to get involved
and get interested one other thing
that's interesting that Lenovo told me
is is that this is really just a first
step for them they're interested in
doing a lot more integrations bringing
Amazon and Alexa technology into more of
their stuff so what do you think
Amazon's Alexa assistants the one that's
actually getting all the traction
there's Google home there's Microsoft
Cortana and there's also people doing
proprietary things like Samsung they
have their why do you think it's Amazon
because the thing is I believe they had
something like 3000 skills about six
months ago now they're about 7000 skills
that's an invoice app so comfy bandwagon
to hop on you've got millions of echo
echo dots out there it was I believe the
number one selling product on Amazon
this holiday oh my god was it ever they
told millions of them including the echo
dot speakers looking to hitch my my
product to a digital assistant I'm gonna
go with the one that's got the biggest
broadest base and right now that is
Alexa sort of right I mean like a lot of
people have iPhones right probably there
is exactly so the problem there is is
Siri hasn't had as many integrations and
maybe Apple will do that there have
obviously been rumors that Apple is
planning to come out with something like
this but it's just rumors at this point
and at this point what is it the Google
home just came out a couple months ago
so I think there's still gonna be a
little bit more time before we end up
seeing something that's gonna be a
platform as big of as Alexa if anybody
actually even does catch-up and we
definitely see some flexibility from
Amazon and like letting a company like
know Lenovo essentially make an echo
clone it's a smart speaker
she runs Alexa and it's cheaper so
they're not worried so much about moving
the hardware they're like look use our
service that's what they're doing Apple
there's no way in the heck they're going
to
let me bring up my favorite Alexa -
great product and that is the LG insta
view refrigerator refrigerator
refrigerator it is yeah there's a Lexus
it is awesome you knock on it that you
knock on the touch screen it actually
goes transparent so you can see what's
inside you can ask it to order milk you
can buy directly from your refrigerator
it's it's pretty sweet where does this
this fridge runs webOS we do that really
old member so they LG bought it it's in
the fridge but it also does have an
alexis assistant you can ask it
questions and it's is that overkill or
that guys or is it it's overkill I have
an echo speaker in my kitchen don't need
it now how much is that fridge well
what's couple thousand your echo speaker
keep your milk cold no no we can know it
God all right fine checkmate on that one
LG I thought really wowed people with
their press conference tons of great
stuff I think the most impressive
product I've seen so far is the the W
television talk a little bit more about
this Bridget alright now we had Samsung
last year was saying hey we have this
family hub right is this giant
touchscreen and a fridge it's gonna run
Android that's what they actually told
me it's gonna have Alexa and then they
backed off of both of those claims
throughout the year they bought viv that
AI company has ties to Syria because I
think the creators of Bates and so they
have their own thing they lost Alexa to
LG essentially which i think is really
kind of interesting the Samsung has
their own thing now yeah say hi Samsung
family they're also here to play
catch-up I don't think they lost Alexa I
think they probably made a conscious
decision right Samsung really likes to
work on their own proprietary stuff they
have viv now and I imagine that in
future versions of this fridge family
hub fridge you're gonna see viv or
whatever they're gonna call it but
you're right it's only a missed
opportunity at this show right you like
come in and LG comes out with an Alexa
powered fridge and Samsung has nothing
to show so Stefan didn't really Wow many
people were there show definitely more
of a restraint show for them but I guess
he kind of had to write her muted they
started off with a not an apology an
acknowledgment of the Galaxy Note 7
I've never heard the Galaxy Note 7 I'm
kidding I'm kidding
it was the story was blowing up
everywhere you know
the story it was a big big deal hot item
you're sure it was alright just keep
throwing the puns out there let's let's
talk about that w television I wanted to
talk about rock you know that that
television it is 2.5 7 millimeters thick
right inches inches point one five
inches it's like a couple coins back
together which is amazing the videos we
have the video for it it doesn't do it
justice you really have to be there a
person to appreciate just how thin this
thing is look at that we're just staring
at the actual video because we're just
so enamored with this so the actual
screen is 2.5 2.5 70 millimeters thin
like we were saying and the way you
really see this in the video they do any
justice if you go around the corner and
you see it kind of looks like part of
the wall because yes only about it's
less than 4 millimeters away from you
actually say the w kind of stands from
wallpaper the idea is this TV blends
into your home blends into the wall
gives us sort of a seamless experience
pretty awesome for one percent we're
like just salivating over this thing
because it's probably the coolest thing
that we've seen so I see yes to see
stuff like this that's that's just cool
the 65 inch television weighs what is 18
pounds
it doesn't require any studs behind it
to mount it so you can put it anywhere
which is nuts but they do have a ribbon
cable to get the television attached to
this big sound but it has all the port
that's the question right like how do
you connect all these power cords into
this super thin computer or TV and
they've got this really thin flat wire
okay so how do we actually make it
better I would recommend you be able to
roll it up put it in your pocket bring
it to your friends house so let's have
LG work on that yeah it is foldable
spoons there I mean I'm sure they have
been working on foldable screens even
screens this big I think the Rio from a
concept perspective they're actually
able to do that I was only half kidding
yes they actually end up seeing that
2027 problem around just like rolls of
screams let's go yep put on the wall and
this this isn't a concept of ice guys
that W is gonna ship in March and LG
hasn't gone with the price yet although
Katz was talking them catch motors are
as their TV guru and it turns out it
might be $2,000 more than the most
expensive thing that LG showed off last
year so the price we're looking at it's
potentially $10,000 and that's what the
65 inch version if you
the bigger one because there's a 77 inch
version that might cause something about
$25,000 in the New York office that'll
be a fun time we're gonna be like get
out of the way I want to see I want to
say I will get no work done that day all
right nice to know did you happen to see
any blackberries while we're out here uh
yes I much to my surprise in this
cluster real moment found myself in a
suite surrounded by blackberry
teleported there yes that's that's how I
travel in Vegas isn't that how you guys
all get around I'm working on that all
right so yes blackberry is once again
making another comeback it defies all
logic it should be dead it should been
dead several times over yet it is back
courtesy of a company that you probably
know for televisions actually TCL now
TCL that makes those awesome Roku TVs
and actually exactly as an aside work
who's liking a lot more than just TCL I
know that I think Hisense has one and so
are they making element TVs what are
they doing also TCL also has a phone
unit it's known as Alcatel most people
don't really know what it is it's really
a budget phone maker they really want to
kind of break into the US market with a
better brand and so using blackberry
it's called the blackberry Mercurius
code never a code name actually don't
have an official code name they just
said that's what the Internet's calling
it so that's what we're gonna call it
for now and we I did get a chance to
hold it build quality is great it's
metal phone it's a full full screen full
touchscreen and it's got touch sorry
it's got a keyboard actual physical
keyboard underneath right like the past
poor like the preview could swipe
through the keyboard and navigate with
that so it's it's a nice looking phone
fingerprint sensor how confident are you
that this is gonna bring blackberry back
or are we gonna be back here next year
talking about BlackBerry's mother come
back not at all I mean very just get
that out these guys have a huge
challenge
you know TCL or Alcatel you know they
have a history of taking very little
known brands and kind of propping them
back up Alcatel is actually done really
well on a bunch of phone market but this
is a different beast right blackberry
has so much baggage involved that it's
really hard to see you know anyone
picking up these phones yeah they say
they're going to go after business
summers first so that they still have
security down that's one right baby so
they're going after banks to go in after
the government customers a lot of folks
who are still using that core audience
already you know like how are they
actually gonna do that any differently
so I think they're gonna they're gonna
put more resources behind at least from
what they're telling me there will be
more resources more effort put the last
year to blackberry kind of checked out
when it came to the phone business right
they were really focused on transforming
themselves into a software and security
business and the hardware side they're
like yeah we still have that but like a
part is in this thing because why would
they bother to get in bed with black
right other than the fact that just
needs the money but why would they
bother to be with this they could be
making their own ready to Alcatel why
would they bother with blackberry at all
well if you look at it no one knows what
Alcatel is no one knows what TCL is
people at least know what blackberry is
it's a brand awareness is not an issue
it might not be to build TCL than to
simply go hey remember blackberry and
have remember Barry's for that well look
it's the same company that I also bought
the palm brand they've done nothing with
it but they did by two years ago at CES
TCL oh my gosh I the guy that they
didn't they didn't do anything with it
that's why you that's why we anything
about it because yeah the heart of palm
was webOS and LG took it then palm is
like hey remember it's just the name so
if you actually go to the URL it doesn't
even exist
maybe TCL is just really nostalgic
that's at the head of the CCO is just
like you know what why don't we do like
that I'm gonna basically TCL's a baby
boomer maybe they just wanted to buy a
blackberry like we just I find what
would get in bed with them so this is an
aluminum phone it's supposed to have
good keyboard yes blackberry keyboard
we're we're expecting an announcement or
at least more information come Mobile
World Congress in February and I don't
know when it'll actually ship but they
promise that they'll have sort of a
portfolio or a line of the product so be
high-end will be a low-end version sort
of meet everyone's needs but again it's
really for business customers you're not
gonna see this in stores for a while if
ever it'll be sold directly through like
an 18th year for Isaac I bet that when
you went to the BlackBerry thing that
they didn't have barf bags available now
Ben though you were at the Intel frob
manga you were at the Intel keynote and
I believe near the leather comfy chairs
their headset this is not related they
offered you a barf bag or this - all the
attendants you got to explain what yeah
they
delicately handed us barf bags we walked
in this was a totally different kind of
press conference than I'd been before
you had these big comfy black leather
chairs and in front of them you had this
high-powered laptop with an oculus rift
VR headset on top and they very
delicately the people walking around
very delicately handed out certain
materials and right underneath was a
barf bag and they told you a couple of
times ahead of time they're like we're
gonna do a bunch of different VR
demonstrations and if at any point you
feel queasy or nauseous take the headset
off immediately do not try to stand up
and by the way we've got these just in
case I don't think anybody used a barf
bag because I think the whole room would
have howled if that ended up happening
so we're looking at video right now
we were transported to rural Vietnam
what was particularly interesting about
this video was that while you're in VR
you could actually like stand up and
kind of look look around what you were
actually looking at so it wasn't so much
a static 360 image but you could kind of
look over or look around different
things which requires this enormous
amount of computing power because you're
not just doing one 360 video you're
doing multiple 360 videos depending on
where your head is so people literally
just started standing up and looking
around and just to just to kind of get
an impression of what it was what it was
like and it was kind of surreal to do
that I tried it out myself to kind of
cool this was an Intel zone project a
load that was they were using oculus
rifts for the specific demo but they
also showed off their own concept called
project alloy which is a cordless
all-in-one VR headset and they're hoping
to come out with that with manufacturing
partners maybe maybe sometime next year
I would say end of year they were
privatizing it that's the word I use for
product eyes means they word productized
by the end of the year so is it look out
let my Scrabble it wouldn't count no it
will now when Intel CEO said it means
it's a word now so they've already
they've already coined the terms right
but what's interesting about project
alloy it it's supposed to enable this
new idea called merged reality where you
take different things like let's say
we've got the desk over here and the
column over there you go and you put on
the project alloy had set and it
integrates all the things in the real
world into a gaming environment or some
other environment where let's say we're
in like an alien shooter game we can
actually hunker down behind this desk
get up and like start shooting the
aliens in the audience or something
which offers mixed reality that's their
term very similar very similar and
you're absolutely right those those
terms you know they're kind of
interchangeable in many ways so yeah it
was an interesting press conference
different when I saw at least my watch
the video you were there but the
difference between merge reality Intel's
version versus Microsoft augmented
reality mixed reality Microsoft you can
still see what's actually around you
versus Intel what it would do like Ben
was explaining that it would take the
physical objects in the room and just
mask them essentially so it would have
the same height so you're not running
into this table when you're gonna go
around shooting aliens it'll change a
coffee table or something else as well
big down point for being in a VR system
is whenever you're in the headset your
conscious constantly aware of all the
obstacles around you like you're just
sort of tentatively moving around you're
like am I gonna run into someone am I
gonna fall I'm gonna trip all right I
was doing that last night well at the
the Power Rangers VR I took it with
whole sack tracker to be a Power Ranger
yesterday I got I got two I wasn't Power
Ranger but I got to fly the Zord the the
dinosaur t-rex Zord for about you with a
ranger and the Mighty Morphin Power Man
was the but from the movies so he's all
amped up you're more emo emo with a
little bit more what did you do what was
in the I basically was in the cockpit of
the Zord a kind of excuse you here the
red red to talk about how powerful and
awesome it is it flies up and then we
think something cool is about to happen
it ends please tell me that was there
anybody else in that experience that was
more after than you then yeah you know
Ranger I'm a Power Ranger which you know
it's really powerful Zordon and he
seemed actually less enthusiastic about
it than I did
Sally in person or like it was he a
virtual but is really just Bryan
Cranston's face that's good weird it was
like Walter White telling you that you
empowers wonderful there I just kind of
got thrown off by the Power Ranger
things sounds crazy but yeah I don't
think actually the same deal with the
position tracking like I was actually
able to move
and this was a wireless headset I was
able to get up move around duck I found
myself actually like 10 feet away from
the Power Rangers and I can actually
walk closer to them so it was actually a
pretty cool experience so the first time
I tried I had reviewer had said I was in
a little apartment on a chair I turned
my head to see something else and bonk I
hit the wall so I do like the idea of
Intel actually saying hey by the way
don't turn into that because I was
wearing one of those
David views well it's an interesting
idea of like you know the merged and
mixed reality like what what exactly is
going to come next with VR and AR and
how are we gonna integrate they I've
heard this said so many times by
different tech executives that the
digital and the physical are merging
together and these are the continuation
of that so we're gonna see more of this
as we move forward and the last thing I
liked I liked about the Intel one is
that you could actually see other
players at the same time so you not just
by yourself
we're gonna have a lot more tomorrow
army guys so I think it's gonna wrap it
