checking out the Acer Aspire au5 620 ub
10
now this PC is an all-in-one running
Windows 8 it's got a touchscreen and
it's available for about nine hundred
ninety nine dollars the touchscreen is
nice and responsive but it's got a 1920
by 1080 resolution that's not very high
but it suits the 23 inch screen pretty
well and things like videos and photos
look great the PC comes bundled with a
mouse and keyboard and they're pretty
standard packings
the mouse is really small and kind of
annoying to use if you've got big hands
the keyboard is full sized and has a
number pad with keys that are nice and
wide
so you won't make too many mistakes
while you're typing inside the machine
are 8 gigs of ram and a one terabyte
5400 rpm hard drive that's not a very
fast hard drive but it's roomy and it's
about right for the thousand dollar
price tag on this PC the machine has a
Core i5 processor but it uses Intel
integrated graphics so most modern games
are going to be out of the question
that said things like streaming HD video
or playing simple casual games that
works great the speakers are fine though
they sound distorted if you crank them
up a little too loud cuz I'm basically a
big kid there aren't too many ports to
spare here there are two USB 3.0 ports
three USB 2 ports and a card reader but
you also get AC mi input and output port
which is a nice touch there's only a DVD
burner but higher models offer a blu-ray
player now this machine standout feature
is well the stem that's propping it up
it's really smooth and you could push it
down to this line just about flat it's
not exactly a tabletop PC which are an
increasingly common style of all-in-one
but it sits at a really nice angle if
you want to doodle or play some games so
you're getting what you pay for here and
you know what that's not a bad deal a
responsive touchscreen plenty of storage
space good performers if you aren't into
gaming and a great platform for video
all for respectable $999 I'm Nate Ralph

over at CNET thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
