quickly discover to how for the sound is
but what are your options for most
people I'd say look at the pioneer sound
bar and sound base but if you've got a
small TV and a lot of money to burn then
the PSB vs 21 might be of interest to
you the PSB alpha v is 21 vision sound
is a very compact sound base at only 21
inches across and 13 inches deep it will
support TVs up to 88 pounds but unless
you have a recent vizio tv you'll find
that the number of tvs that fit on it to
be quite small not even a 40 inch
samsung TV will fit on this small base
the vs 21 offers connection via coaxial
optical digital and analog in addition
to bluetooth with AB decks you can do
Dolby Digital but it doesn't do DTS it
comes with a number of different modes
including a fairly convincing wide mode
a speech mode and simple stereo while it
does offer a subwoofer out unfortunately
there's no tone controls and so taming
the base is impossible which is a shame
as it can get unruly depending on which
mode you use the white mode is good at
low volumes for most material but it can
get a bit too shady at higher levels
with music which is where stereo is
better as far as intelligibility is
concerned it's night and day better than
any TV anywhere near the price but
that's also one of its problems the TV's
that will fit on this stand are about
the same price as the unit it's too
expensive for what it can do especially
when the Pioneer SPS bo3 is half the
price performs to a much similar level
and will hold much larger tvs this
doesn't mean the PSB vs 21 is a bad
product it sounds good and is well-built
but it severely limits your TV choices
and it's not as flexible as the Pioneer
it was a few hundred dollars cheaper
then it would be more recommendable this
