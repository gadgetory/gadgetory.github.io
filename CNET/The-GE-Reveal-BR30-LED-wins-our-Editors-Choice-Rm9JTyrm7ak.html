today we've got a review of a very good
lightbulb for you the GE reveal BR 30
LED hanging right here above my head
winner of our editor's choice now this
ge LED is a floodlight so that means
that it's gonna cast light in one
direction just straight down here it's
gonna bounce any light going up that way
back down so it's kind of the type of
bulb you want to use for a recessed
lighting setup or for track lighting any
situation where you want light to shine
just down now what makes this an
editor's choice winning bulb well for me
it's a couple of things that all stemmed
back to a very good design first off
it's got an emphasis on color quality
the GE reveal line of bulbs all promise
to make your colors pop to make whites
look white blues look blue it does that
with a high color rendering score that
comes by way of filtering out some of
the yellow light that comes out of the
bulb so it filters out that light amps
the wattage up to make up for the lack
of brightness and the result is a very
clean natural-looking light if you look
at this picture of a bowl of M&amp;amp;Ms we can
see that the GE reveal leaves that bowl
looking white leaves those colors bright
and vivid side by side with the
similarly priced cree be our 30 LED you
can see just it looks better it looks a
little nicer it's subtle it might be too
subtle for some but if you care about
colors if you want the artwork or the
design of your home to look right this
is a light that's gonna do very well one
other thing
the GE revealed br 30 LED cost 18
dollars which might sound like a lot but
that's actually 2 bucks less than that
Cree BR 30 LED in addition to that focus
on color quality you're also getting a
bulb that does very well managing heat
and also does very well on dimmer
switches we tested out a whole bunch of
BR 30 LEDs this is the only one that
didn't flicker as we dimmed it up and
down on any of our dimmers it just
looked very very nice as steady it
didn't buzz no other bulb could say that
so if you've got dimmer switches it's a
no-brainer oh no this is just a terrific
bulb and among BR 30 LED is a specific
category of lights it kind of stands
unmatched nothing else is offering quite
the total package that GE has with this
bolt for more of a value play you might
consider the philips slim style BR 30
LED that bulb comes in at closer to 13
dollars but still at 18 bucks I think
this is an exceptionally well priced
bulb very good value very good performer
and an easy winner of our editors
for CNET I'm right Crist</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
