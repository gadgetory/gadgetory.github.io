about this Kenmore dryer is that it is
very sleek and modern looking it has
capacitive controls which engage in a
feather-light touch there's actually no
physical buttons that may not be your
cup of tea but it's definitely modern
and very cool another feature I like
about this dryer is that it has a large
8.8 cubic foot of capacity so that means
you can put in a ton of clothes and do
it all at once this dryer process is
closed very quickly that means shorter
cycle times and less weight for your dry
clothes
it definitely processes clothes faster
than other dryers we've seen so they're
definitely things I don't like about
this dryer number one is that the
controls are mounted on the back that
means you can't put other units on top
of it and you can't even put this unit
on top of a pedestal accessory to save
some space or to create more storage
space in your laundry room and for this
price you're paying eleven hundred
dollars for this machine you'd expect it
to come with more features and cycles
and specialty modes right now you're
getting nine which is pretty good but
not as good as the 14 or even more you
see on other machines so this dryer
makes sense if you want speed and short
cycle times above all else but if you
want to save space in your laundry room
by stacking it on top of other units or
putting it on a pedestal definitely pass
