best of 2014 episode we're retelling our
best news stories pop culture stories
and our favorite video games it's gonna
be great so let's get this party started
swear daily
greetings citizens of the internet for
the last time in 2014 welcome to
tomorrow daily the best ski talk show in
the known universe I'm your host Ashley
scouted join me as always on this final
show of the year kill anonymous I'm
excited they let us out once a year like
yeah one day out of the student they let
us out of the studio it's true so glad
today and that's why we were able to go
and get some clothes they said go get
your fancy stuff and then they with an
escort we had to go to our old homes and
get our nice stuff and bring it back now
or never everybody wanted to go yet oh
if you didn't get to go back home yet
where'd you find that price is right
there's actually yeah this is actually
true picture carry it belongs to Chris
Hardwick we got it we stole it from the
walking dead thanks Chris uh this is our
last episode of the year like we
mentioned we decided we would we would
do a best stuff we'd tell you what our
favorite stuff was we know yeah we
helped we got help from you guys yeah
listen to what your favorite stuff was
and then this is all kind of ramping up
to CES which we'll talk about in a
little bit but I mean I guess they're
kind of had their our own headlines but
let's talk about our best stuff
okay so our first category is best tech
story of the year for me I mean it was
an easy choice it's the rosetta landing
this is oh yeah comet 67p islets we
landed a probe of the feel a we landed
the feet a probe on the surface of a
moving comment we had a slingshot
Rosetta around orbits like a bunch of
times it took so many years to get this
done and it was even though it wasn't
100% successful the way that the ESA had
hoped I mean what a tremendous
accomplishment yeah I am done and they
did say that as it gets closer to the
Sun it might actually get enough solar
power to reactivate feely might
reactivate and they might be able to get
some more data which is pretty great so
that was my that's a hundred percent
like hands down easily my story of the
year I got super excited when I saw all
of the team celebrating when they say
are they are they're super happy are all
excited learning that actually happened
there some pictures that's that's the
feel Islander going down down from
Rosetta they took that picture from the
rosetta spacecraft I mean just what a
moment what a great moment in science
and it's just such an achievement it's
that's easily my favorite what about you
know that was up that's definitely up
there up there for everyone that's a
science geek and whatnot for me it was
bionics people becoming slightly more
robotic and it's just like the future of
deus ex deus ex the game yeah revolution
coming true people cutting off their
arms on purpose first off good arms now
you can run as fast as a notch ostrich
what kind of this guy made bionic Bionic
boots and so he can run 25 miles per
hour really fast and and it's basically
these uh these like like boot
attachments that replicate an ostrich's
Achilles legs yet yeah pretty tendance
so that's awesome that was really good
Lori I like them then it was the man
with the Bionic arms this is recently
too yes last week why so basically I we
have Bionic arms that's the
been done before but this guy has two
and on top of that controls him with his
brain yeah his brainwaves are controlled
the two arms and simultaneous yes I'm
okay free and so yeah there you go I
just eats again huge tremendous
accomplishments and achievements in
science and technology just so cool like
that's like I don't even know JD on that
those are my favorite I mean the other
one would be the the fact that we can
live in the clouds on what was it Venus
yeah the proposal to go to live in the
live in the clouds we have some of their
favorite hobbies yeah we do we do it all
right I myself okay so now what we'll do
well let you start this one off this is
our best pop culture news oh yeah the my
favorite pop culture news was Margot
Robbie and Jack horn and I cornea
whether you include Jack Courtney is
basically they announced the cast of The
Suicide Squad but my favorite was that
Margot Robbie is perfect for the role of
oh we sing this is a joint Jai Courtney
wait let me let me explain about this b
roll here this is a really awesome
Suicide Squad fanch made trailer they
didn't they did an amazing job on this
but yeah Jai Courtney is finally getting
his day in the Sun to be boomerang I
think it was he's day in the Sun like
all year I million everything and then
uh Margot Robbie I can't wait I just
can't wait for she's gonna be pretty
great those what I like it's pretty good
Jai Courtney fancy for me I like for me
the number one thing it was a Star Wars
trailer the team oh my mam that was a
big geek pop culture to choose listen
guys we're all gonna pretend like
episodes one through three never
happened maybe maybe the good parts of
episodes two and three like that's fine
but seeing this trailer made me feel
like Star Wars as a franchise is truly
in the right hands I really like that
for example bb-8 the little robot that
looks like it's riding on a soccer ball
is a fully functional real life robot
that's not cg oh that's awesome they're
doing actual practical effects for a lot
of things that they can do practical
effects for and and miniatures just like
the old trilogy original trilogy and
Star Wars I know a lot of people are
freaking out about this broad sword
lightsaber but I'm really excited about
it i think it's
gonna be great people are going to be
super pumped when the music kicks in and
the Millennium Falcon starts flying
across the screen like you just you get
super jacked up on Star Wars you guys
yes cutting to black sorry about that it
was hard not to get excited after you've
been hurt so many times as a Star Wars
fan plus you bet you've had a pretty you
think they've had a pretty good year for
star wars with Disney it's a pretty good
run I think a lot of people were really
scared when they when they announced
that Disney was buying Lucasfilm
everyone's like up its over guys packing
in like let's go no no this get it up
did you did good with Marvel let's get
that what argument was give them a
chance because look at the great things
they're doing with Marvel they're really
letting them be kind of an autonomous
studio and it seems like they're really
kind of giving Star Wars the the the fun
and also the gravitas that it deserves
yeah and plus you like the the animated
series that they have gone do I like
Star Wars rebels is really good i'm
looking forward to Gary Whitta is
writing a spin-off Star Wars oh yeah
that's right so is there's all kinds of
great Star Wars except for me like it's
a big star wars year for you but next
year obviously to be even bigger they've
got celebration they've got it i'm sure
a whole bunch of stuff planned for the
theme parks and then and then of course
star wars in about a year well less than
a year we're on the countdown the hype
train is leaving the station we're all
aboard yes I think we've all been aboard
ever since that trailer dropped I think
we all just just got right on the train
and bought a one-way ticket to hype town
um okay so favorite video game of the
year we both thought about this a lot oh
we had some runner I'm real disappointed
in this also that this was really tough
for us okay because there were girls
education this one do you want I'll go
okay all right Ashley's video game of
the year it had to be mario kart 8 there
was no other choice for me it was an
easy pick uh-oh he's dead stairs on the
loan well yeah so mario kart 8 in and of
itself is a great game it fantastic
there's me I'm right there this is my
this is from your yeah these are my
these are from my races there's Mike
Mike and I have a long-standing Mario
Kart rivalry that spans ages generations
it's a generational it's it's it's a
long-standing uses me where yeah yeah he
races us as me good he's very good I I'm
better but he's ver
good why do you think this is game of
the year person beyond the fact that you
like it still has my attention after six
months of being out I play it all the
time a great great retention value love
the DLC they really so many new tracks
there is eight new tracks that's crazy
that's awesome I really like what
they're doing with the amoeba so where
you're able to you know have costumes
and stuff like that so I really feel
like Nintendo finally like really did
all the things I wanted out of a mario
kart game and then of course I mean
Luigi yes Sarah rolled in how did how
did we get how are we so lucky to get a
developer who made that face while
making the game it was like people are
gonna love this like that's that's so
amazing it's furious nothing but never
good Luigi's gonna fight you he's like
it's not that you're a luigi anymore
he's furious yeah he's gonna take
everything burton luigi it's luigi
forever so okay go ahead uh so I was on
the fence about what I was gonna choose
what was your what's your second place
my second place was uh god I'd say
shadows in Mordor I think that I think
that was my second like like Assassin's
Creed but like with a little bit of like
oh you you get so angry at that game but
like in a kind of a good way so but in
the end I picked the game I like to pick
a game that I think people if you bought
it you feel like okay not only did I
like the game but I got my money's worth
okay and it's something I'll be able to
share with others shareable it'll be
it'll be something that I'm still
playing once the years over or maybe
I'll come back to well maybe i'll come
back to retention got it so I picked
super smash brothers wii u so we picked
up we both picked a Nintendo one which I
didn't I didn't like that it didn't like
your friend i know that i dislike there
was a lot of your fantasy games out this
year and so I almost link to that cuz I
like dragon age but anyway so for super
smash brothers it was long awaited game
you know it was it was a wii u seller
it's sold we use yeah and they had they
so as far as they added so many modes
you can customize the main characters
now they added more characters they
promised their
is going to be more they're gonna be
unlikely if you have 3s in the wii u it
plays yourself you can play as your me
you can there's so much customization
there's so many extra features it's got
so much replay value there's so much to
unlock you can have you can use the ax
me bows and the one thing I love about
it is it's easy to pick up and play if
you're new my mate who's your main uh
well I go back and forth retain chic I
love bling is she okay like speed
characters I really like playing a chic
and then also uh this is gonna so Chris
but i really like like is the neighbor
from from Animal Crossing sorry I just
wrote it because what you if you're the
girl you should hit people the frying
pan is funny and an umbrella I'm sorry
you have an umbrella it's not frying pan
that's game on yeah you have a even
umbrella and it's really funny I don't
like it made me laugh but chic mostly
that's mostly my main all right who do
you my OD blast I play as king dedede I
plays King Dedede as my as my main is
not an accept now man yes his mallet
will will ruin cuz he's got a hit big
hitbox you know we're getting to you got
a bit big hitbox pls very powerful but
anyway so that's your game yeah right
the only reason why people like some
people be like no this other game is
because a lot of people don't have a wii
u yet that's true i'm gonna kill it your
hashtag of the day yes has nothing to do
with best of it has to do with Nintendo
cnet at CES there's no TV in front of it
that's a really weird cnet at CES is the
hashtag not everybody is gonna be using
Oh every every everybody else see

that's the official hashtag ok see you
at it so what happens if they hash tag
that if you hashtag that you have a
chance to end up on the wall we have a
tweet wall up on the live stage oh we

of you guys wrote in it's so awesome i'm
sorry we couldn't get to all of you and
then of course our very last phone tog
refer of the year oh no so I stick
around we'll be right back
welcome back to the show it's our best
of 2014 episode we hope you're having a
delightful holiday and a good new year
yeah we like to every single week talk
about the things we are into and so I
figured let's let's get into it kill I
really feel like we should dress up all
the time no we look so snazzy yeah we
look great this is resting put that on
your resume so good okay all right uh
what are you into ok so I'm a little bit
behind on this but it's totally fine
because it I'm into fargo the television
miniseries okay uh it it's been over for
a while and people have already kind of
seen it but i binge-watched it sure
nominated for like the most amount of
golden globes of anything that's
nominated right back so yeah I had to
watch it it's great it's Bilbo you gotta
love miniseries oh yeah and then Billy
Bob Thornton plays like a like an
assassin it's fantastic it's kind of
like a one like a whole bunch of drama
and murders and stuff like I'm not
explain it if you've seen Fargo the
movie you'll understand that it Fargo is
such a town where everyone you know it's
talking like this you know and just kind
of like everyone's real nice also they
know each other yeah it's small
everyone's nice so when a murder happens
it really shakes the town up oh you
don't know Oh golly no so there you go
yeah i really recommend checking it out
let me know if you end up watching it
because of my suggestion but yeah we are
I haven't watched the last episode and
watching it tonight so hopefully you
guys have some time off for the holiday
so you can just spin what bend watch it
up if you can if you have access to it
hopefully do what are you into okay so
I'm not a hundred percent sure about
this I just got into this last night I
found it very interesting this is called
plague not plague inc which we discussed
it's it's not plague inc which is that
really awesome game you try to wipe out
humanity the virus no this is uh if i
had fighted say it was something it
would be tender meats reddit ok ok are
you with me kind of ok so here's how
this app work so basically this is very
fascinating you get a piece of shared
information so either you post or you
see other people's post you have a kind
of a timeline but it's one
piece of information or a picture or
quote or whatever it is at a time and
with that information you either swipe
up to share it and it shares it and or
you swipe down to to kind of down vote
it okay and so basically how this works
is if you look at the screen here you
can see it'll show like kind of not
infections but it's like it's basically
like here's the spread of the content
that you shared here's here's where it's
being it's going viral here's or it's
getting exciting so there's not a whole
lot of people using it right now but I
really like this idea of sort of it's
not self policing but it's very similar
to read it which I really enjoy hanging
out on which is you have up votes and
down votes and you can you know
basically the best stuff kind of rises
up to the top so I like this idea that
we can kind of not police what people
are sharing and what gets really popular
but it's like if somebody post something
super dumb everyone's maybe like no
downvoted buh-bye like adios but if it's
really good people will share it a lot
and you'll see this kind of explosion of
you know it going viral and you can look
at a map and see exactly where it's
being shared and it's a really great
time killer it's cool yeah it i mean
like i said it's sort of like tinder
it's like it's a good time waster like
like you were saying but I just I find
that really fascinating it's a really
interesting way to do social yeah just
swipe I'm super easy but that's a good
find that was a good fun interesting
it's a fun little thing yeah something
interesting for you to check out if you
hate it tell us about it I don't care
it's fine speaking of you telling us
about it start for use feedback
all right I'm gonna find a Vista it's
time for best but white why are you
buying a Vista leave it alone yeah I
want to prove to you let it be it's
gonna be the first thing I'm not to PI
poxa first what am I think you shares
the Vista all right use your feedback we
asked you guys use the hashtag TD best
of 2014 to tell us your favorite stuff
all year you guys really rose to the
occasion ultra soup wrote and said my
best of my TD best of 2014 stories blood
sports sorry kale son of up see I knew

after that and said actually my real TD
best of 2014 story would be either the
iphone 6 or mario kart 8 oh yes he's in
my mario party there's yeah you're in my
car exporter soup Mario Kart blood sport
know uh and then Marty wrote to us and
said here's my TD best of 2014 self
drunk goggles self-driving cars oh look
at that little thing that's the official
one that's the one they're gonna be
driving around I love it I'm so excited
about self-driving cars dunno how that
it's he is uh maybe yeah sometimes
they'll have I know BMWs doing really
cool thing where you can actually call
up your car from like a parking garage
and it'll come it like basically like
drives it out for you valets it's a self
like valeting car it's really weird so I
think they might have that at the show
but a lot of times it with cars they'll
do it like off site or behind the
convention center there's like space for
I'm gonna trick one to drive me a Hawaii
so perfect yeah great sure it'll do

tantrum yes one last
Rosen said sent from I'm sorry the
funniest thing of 2014 that I remember
his when Ashley was in San Francisco for
the iphone event thought that Cisco was
dead please play a clip I have been
watching since the first episode keep up
the good work you guys are awesome give
a club of that no I it's like a four
hour livestream that we did for the
iphone 6 event so here's the thing i
scrub through it a little bit but i
didn't have enough time to like find the
clip and then what you have to do
download the entire thing and then you
have to go through it again so i didn't
have four hours to suppose that thang
listen I may have started a terrible
rumor during that live stream that Cisco
had died because I rap yes because the
hong son good yes because i didn't know
and I I really genuinely thought I'd
read a story somewhere that he had Pat
he had like died in a car accident or
something and so brian Tong and dong
bell made fun of me the rest of the show
and our AP Cisco started trending
Twitter because I i accidentally made
that horrible rumor up but he was fine
and he actually released an album like a
few weeks later so you're welcome Cisco
cuz i getcha but really snail before he
died so all I'm saying you could still
not be alive I don't know yeah nobody
wouldn't miss your proof I haven't seen
any paparazzi pictures of his long Sam
that's all call us just go make tell us
to scare your oh come on the show I'll
let you sitting heels yeah replace me
