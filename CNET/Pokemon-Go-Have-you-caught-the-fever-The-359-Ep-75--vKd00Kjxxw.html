the 359 our 75th site of shake things up
we're gonna do it in the studio with me
Ben Fox Rubin what's your own salzman
we'll be talking about what everyone's
talking about today oh come on okay mom
oh we will we will also be talking about
amazon prime so stay tuned if you want
yes some details of your real hard news
episode yeah oh yeah this is Pokemon go
right um yeah so have you guys been
plenty well then I I played I played for
like three minutes over the weekend and
didn't find it all that interesting
because it was nighttime and I wasn't
about to like leave my house to go look
for Pokemon at like 9pm in the suburbs
that's the best time to time for pec
would've been pretty weird and creepy
but I'm sure other people yeah yo
country I moved a bitch you probably
wouldn't run into people yes like in the
bushes moving like their face is
illuminated by their screen in the
darkness get away from my Bulbasaur so
yeah I so I tried it and then it wasn't
that interesting in my house so I
deleted it but then I knew we were gonna
talk about it here so i redownloaded it
and then have since caught another
pokemon there you go in the office show
me what you know yes really yeah yeah um
I don't know like worried about my
license I gotta find this Pokemon yeah
so now i have four and roger has three
yeah bully for baton and i had a missed
opportunity cuz i was biking around the
city all weekend long i was covering a
lot of ground and I could have really
liked hit the German when it comes down
to its a giant scavenger hunt like the
more ground you cover the better off you
are both of us I mean I was driving for
those pearls in a mall actually I
probably would have caught some Piedmont
at the mall but yeah absolutely you
gotta catch them all so that is all
trying them at the mall clearly um but
yeah it's been coming crazy phenomenon
really it's strange I mean we should
probably save some of this for the
podcast but during you want to talk
about another
crazy phenomenon let's talk about this
359 I'm sorry that guy wow that was that
probably just got us cancelled yeah so
I'm really sorry about I just got the
email listen the quran we're done let's
wrap it up all right why don't we get
start with the podcast facebook if you
have any questions about pokemon or
prime day been days are we have offered
resident prime two eggs yeah please I'm
ashamed to admit drop drop questions
products whatever we'll we'll try to
answer your questions at the end of the
podcast so all right so we get started
Brian do you want to comes down or and
audios rolling you are live and 32
welcome to a special episode of 359 it's
our 75th edition and we're doing things
a little differently we're in the main
studio to shoot this for both Facebook
live in our site I'm Roger Cheng I'm Ben
Fox River and I'm Joanie salzman so the
subject is unavoidable talk about
Pokemon go it went live last week and
people are going crazy for it this is
amazing it's not even that good of a
video game you know let's get that great
console I just yeah I just made the
point to someone else it this is the
best worst game I've ever had like the
server server issues abound the game
crashes constantly buggy on its super
delegates but people cannot get enough
of this game and it's it's why wow how
did another thing that's pretty
interesting so Nintendo which is the
company that you know kind of created
the concept in the first place yeah
their stock has jumped twenty-five
percent over Pokemon go or maybe the the
fact that everybody now expects them to
come out with a lot more mobile games
against one was such a huge success no I
think that's interesting point because
Nintendo has been so resistant to being
in the smartphone world for a long time
of whatever we yeah and this game comes
out and it's fuzzier than anything
they've done in the console yeah there
was some data that showed that in the US
five percent of the population that has
an android phone has downloaded it and
all that five percent three percent of
using it every day which means that
people are using it as much as Twitter
that's it that's insane I don't know if
that says more about Twitter that it
does it does something about Twitter
what about the way it's only existed for
yes I mean that's the thing like what's
the longevity of a game like this yeah
yeah we're tired of it I don't know I've
I've caught 3 i'm still I'm sorry gonna
catch more up very early still very
early for me yeah I'll keep trying it
out people seem so excited about it that
I'm gonna I'm gonna keep giving a go and
I think people are especially excited to
see if they're gonna have like a super
mario mobile game yeah legend of zelda
game means yes no this is the game how
this opens up like a lot more potential
for nintendo and now Nintendo is
suddenly much much more relevant as they
turn everybody's smartphone into a Game
Boy is this in the first intersection of
an augmented reality game with a popular
I peed like I think so yeah I mean this
this was based off of the earlier game
called ingress in fact that's where all
the data the location data comes from
you know not a lot people part of that
game but they basically pour that data
into pokemon and all the summit's
they've got a winner on it it's a
phenomenon yeah it's a phenom so Ben
yeah I know next up is prime day at
Amazon's favorite made-up holiday it's
coming on Tuesday with the company
pitching it as an even bigger sales
event than the first prime day ever
which was last year I talked with the
head of prime who said amazon made some
tweaks to the sales event including
making a better landing page so it's
easier to find the sales and also really
amping up the amount of inventory
because a lot of folks complain last
year that all the best feels like we're
gone in like seconds so hopefully
they're gonna have a bigger hit on their
hands my expectation is people are still
going to complain on social media
regardless yeah you know if Amazon sells
a ton of stuff so my question to both of
you what is your ideal primed a product
or discounted no thing I don't know you
want to go first Joan I was I was like
racking my mind before I I couldn't
think of much if I could get a really
great discount without having to worry
about shipping for a bicycle for my
husband that I know is from like a brand
that he would appreciate then that would
be amazing that'd be my ideal one hey
worthwhile I went like a really really
nice fridge for like five not like
like something that is just like
obnoxious to you in two days right to be
not like overnight so social prime now
in actually let's hope let's hope before
delivery Mouse I hear the mic messages
like oh you the frack so yeah probably
not gonna happen but you guys have way
more exciting I mean I just wanted
typers I can get like really cheap
diapers and a side load up right for
your kid by the way yes you're clear not
for me I don't need two pins for my baby
but I'm sure that will be or there may
be a depends a deal well considering how
all kinds of deal the other criticism of
prime day last year was not that not
just the inventory problems but also
like you know rubbermaid was a big
gigantic dlp were like who the hell
cares yeah and they sold out of that so
they were they care about the rubbermaid
they super duper leaned into that I
think that so I've been talking to
Amazon a lot about this and they were
like look it's not a gifting holiday
this is the type of thing where we're
just trying to provide a bunch of
different sales across categories to try
to get people to buy all sorts of stuff
and they're like some people are gonna
think it's really wacky if we're gonna
have like a giant tub of lube or
something we're just gonna we're just
gonna do it again we're gonna do it
again and we're gonna own it this time
and so maybe it'll play off better this
year who knows yeah we'll see y know
more about these stories check us out
cnet I'm rotor Chang I'm Ben Fox ribbon
I'm Joni salzman thanks for listening
for the podcast we're still on Facebook
live yeah you can't think of something
better than diapers you can't there's
not something you really like to buy
cheap Scott diapers on the mind I really
do yeah we go through we don't read by
somebody so what yeah that's a thing
like so far like what's having a kid
like I don't really need anything yeah
you don't have time to do hear anything
thought you would buy use anything the
you away I could go for like an even
more comfortable couch cuz that's what I
pass out on all the time when I untidy
here if way too many kids so that would
be good but that's not the sort of thing
you'd buy names on
I don't think so I mean they probably
sell couches I'm sure but so Brian are
there any questions from Facebook about
pokemon or prime day I mean people are
upset that Pokemon is not available
worldwide yet and yeah it's restricted
um so its own is it only in English
language no it's not even that it's just
us australia and new zealand is that
right thanks own i blame so they went
live in japan reggaeton frightful
version right and it's look it's i think
they're gonna have issues with expanding
cuz they're already having problems here
in the like in the in the markets that
it's already out it's not you know it's
not the best experience it like chokes
out app crashes your i was people wanted
it anyway i know i was like staring at
my phone and just sort of like tapping
at it and nothing was happening as a
come on i'm right at this winner of the
pokey spot don't focus five is what is
it's called the pocus stop stop sorry i
was like frantically like swiping away
I'm like all right give you my students
pokeball nothing nothing cuz this Rose
down it will probably get to a lot more
places pretty quickly even with those
problems just for the simple fact that
like they have a hit on their hands they
want more people to get it really really
fast so maybe hearing all these like
weird kind of side stories about like
the people of the experiences like
people are getting sent over to like
strip clubs and sex shop oh I thought
you were gonna move early found the dead
body yeah yeah there was another one
where they're like armed robberies like
yank will hang out or on polka stops I
guess like in the middle of like parking
lots and then will rob you because they
know that you're coming there you're
like holding your phone you're
distracted it's not really the worst
possible person to run basically look
this is yeah this is first like super
popular augmented reality like in the
world game so there's gonna be like a
lot of those like I don't know learnings
will probably come out with like a story
about like the etiquette of Pokemon go
like at a wedding or something like that
at some point so people need to learn is
someone just like someone found a
pokemon during his wife's in labor yeah
I saw that too oh man Wow amazing
protocol ever does like like last like
20 hours sure so there's a lot of life
on the goring time for the
on in labor person that's true I was by
doing that's very generous of you i was
thinking like world's worst or a world i
guess in my mind it was like she was
pushing if he was like oh look look at
shoes slice guess what you're like dude
that's your that's your kid that's not a
Pokemon put the phone down um I Brian
any other questions um OH wants to know
what team to join when he reaches level
5 in Pokemon go neither of us okay so
level 2 i'm also level 2 we both just
started so we don't know anything about
what teams to join me in psyche matter
team blue I think was it the TV como
ignore these amateurs join team valor
team valor team valor all right I'll
join whatever team brian is on yeah
that's that's gonna be my goal so Brian
our producer has 50 50 Pokemon 50
pokemon right so if you have a quite a
lot of repeaters not 50 originals I'm
sorry so you can catch the same one over

experience points so I have 50 there but
i only have 20 originals oh you have us
beat brian you should just be answering
these questions yourself yeah yeah yeah
you're all fired all right anything else

today everyone's too distracted playing
pokemon go yeah I probably out there
outside well that's the one good thing
about this game gets people outside yes
those are not driving biking or right
for my money to leave I'm still playing
again with her I Oh nobody's talking
about slither i/o anymore but I wasted a
lot of time over the weekend with that
so that's like a like a snake game where
you fight against other snakes and you
try to eat them like it don't intend
making something up and lying to me this
is actually legit like it's liquid where
you have to be real like this have fun
