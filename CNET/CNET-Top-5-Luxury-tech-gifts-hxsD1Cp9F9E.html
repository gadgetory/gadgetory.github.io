loving millionaire for the holidays
you're gonna need some help to come up
with some ideas that are a breed apart
from Roku's and iPhones and that's where
I come in i'm donna bell and this top 5
i'm counting down a cherry picked
selection of some of our most luxurious
tech gifts pulled from our holiday tech
gift guide and sorted by price starting
things off at number 5 the DJI phantom 2
vision plus affordably priced at
fourteen hundred dollars this drone is
equally adept at capturing gorgeous
gimbal stabilized HD video from the air
as well as chasing the less fortunate
off your lawn built-in GPS means that
you can program it with your own flight
path around the golf course at number
four the audis LCD 3 quite possibly the
best sounding headphones in the world
according to our resident audiophile
Steve Guttenberg these are handcrafted
in the USA and use a unique planar
magnetic driver to create their sound
the price is 1945 dollars you can think
of them as beats for billionaires at
number three a mac pro apple's
top-of-the-line computer starts at three
thousand dollars and it looks like a
cremation urn for a supervillain pair it
with a 4k monitor and you have a
workstation that could satisfy any
creative whim you could dream of is it
overkill you bet what fun is being rich
if you can't go over the top speaking of
overkill at number two the kibo mega
with 24 terabytes of storage you'll
never have to delete anything off your
DVR again that's enough to hold four
thousand hours of HD video the price tag
is five thousand dollars but if you
think of it is right a dollar 25 per
hour it almost sounds reasonable but
when it comes to ostentatious high tech
luxury one item Trump's them all at
number one a gigantic TV 4k no less and
as you probably already know that 4k
resolution only becomes noticeable on a
really big screen so let's go with a
really big tie for first place at eight
thousand dollars our modest option is
the unnecessarily curved
28 inch samsung UN 78 hu 9000 I figure
if the size doesn't impress the curves
are there for a secondary WTF factor but
if you really want to see the power of
reckless spending in action try out the
Sony 4k short throw projector for a mere
fifty thousand dollars you can turn a
wall in your mansion into a deliriously
huge crystal clear 4k TV pick that poor
people so there you go six luxury gifts
for the tech loving 1% you can find even
more gift ideas including the best gifts
under fifty dollars over at cnet com /
holiday gift guide and for more top 5s
from me top 5 cnet com Donald Bell
