keeps trying to be a newspaper I'm
Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update Motorola phones will no longer be
made by google the search giant has sold
Motorola's mobile division to Lenovo for
just short of 3 billion dollars google
acquired motorola back in 2011 for a
much larger some pain 12 and a half
billion dollars so that's a big loss for
Google right well some say no and that
it was a positive investment for Google
when you look at the big picture you see
during the time google-owned Motorola it
scooped up a ton of patents to
strengthen and protect the Android brand
and in the process it did create two
very good Motorola phones the Moto X and
the Moto G and now that Android is a
stronger brand Google is passing
Motorola along to Lenovo which is a
company that is really eager to
strengthen its smartphone presence
Lenovo is going to keep using the
motorola brand name in North America and
Latin America but Google kept a few
souvenirs in the deal Motorola's
advanced research and development team
stays with Google and that's the team
that's working on future tech like
electronic tattoos and microchip pills
and even Samsung must be happy about the
deal because it doesn't have to compete
with its partner Google anymore facebook
also has some interesting news the
network said it'll be making more stand
alone mobile apps and on Monday it will
launch a reading app for the iPhone
called paper it's very much like
Flipboard and it's trying to be your
personal newspaper blending your
newsfeed with other stories from major
news outlets it's all divided into
categories like sports technology and
food Facebook members can also write
their own stories to be shared with the
world sony announced that a slim version
of the PlayStation Vita is coming to the
UK next week on februari 7th for about
180 pounds or that's three hundred
dollars which is cheaper than the
original handheld console but Sonny gave
no word on when this will be available
in the US the vita slim has been
sold in Japan and parts of Asia since
last year it's slightly thinner and
lighter but to help increase battery
life Sony downgraded the quality of the
screen from OLED to LCD but it's still a
high resolution display and a very
popular keyboard app on Android called
swiftkey has found a home on the iPhone
and iPad it's called swiftkey note and
it's just a jazzy place to save notes
with a better keyboard that predicts
your next word it also ties into
Evernote that your tech news update but
you can find more details on these
stories at cnet com / update and be sure
