there's also plenty to get annoyed about
even once you get used to Apple's new
operating system it's little quirks will
make you miss iOS 6 faster than you can
say Control Center you can't make it
perfect but here are solutions to some
of iOS 7's most annoying flaws for
starters you might want to get rid of
parallax somewhere along the way Apple's
design team decided it would be fun to
give us all a minor case of motion
sickness by having the background and
icons move as you tilt your phone to get
back in balance head over to settings
then general accessibility and enable
this reduce motion control now
everything will stay in its place
that's not the only poor design choice
Apple made though the entire interface
is blanketed with white backgrounds and
small hard to read font and in typical
Apple fashion we don't have alternative
themes to choose from but there is a
workaround first you can increase the
system-wide font size in general
settings under text size then in the
accessibility settings you can also
enable bold text to really make it stand
out now you can't really fix the issue
of the bright white backgrounds but if
your browsing your phone at night and
you need to tone it down a bit
enable invert colors in that same
settings window
it does make photos and other graphics
look a little crazy but the text will be
much easier to read you probably noticed
that your Notification Center is a lot
more crowded in iOS 7 it can't go back
to the way it was but you can cut back
on the clutter just head to settings
Notification Center and uncheck - Dave
you today summary and tomorrow summary
you can also turn off the calendar day
view if it's taking too much space
now when you swipe down from the top
you'll see only the things that matter
most to you control center is awesome
because it finally lets us get to common
settings without opening the Settings
app it's convenient but also
much too easy to accidentally open when
you're playing games or even scrolling
to minimize that head to settings then
control center and disable access within
apps with control center fixed and all
the other settings adjusted iOS 7's
quirks should be less of an issue if you
have any questions or tips of your own
