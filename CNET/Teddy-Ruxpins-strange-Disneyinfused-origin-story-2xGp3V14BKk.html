Ruxpin was an instant phenomenon when he
came to life in 1985 hi there my name is
Teddy Ruxpin powered by 4c batteries
controlled by programming on cassette
tapes and now this 80s icon is looking
to make his big return with a few
upgrades can you and I be friends
I'd love teddy when I was a little girl
I didn't remember quite how much until I
saw him again at the 2017 New York Toy
Fair and heard his soft voice but so
much has changed since I first called
Teddy my friend what I didn't know back
then was his unusual origin story he has
connections to Disney theme parks the
Atari video game console even the pizza
empire of Chucky Cheese to shed some
light on his world I visited an unaired
condition storage facility on the
outskirts of Los Angeles that houses
treasures from Teddy's past this I mean
it's truly break through and when you
look at it it still fills breakthrough
that he was figuring out you know the
maquette the mechanics to how to animate
a teddy bear Russell Hicks and Mary
Becker were among the first employees at
the company that brought teddy to life
on a table in a cramped hallway they
laid out original artwork blueprints
news clippings spin-offs all of it raw
teddy DNA teddy sweet little world was
an expansive fantasy tale with dozens of
characters there were 60 story cassette
tapes with books but he was also a TV
star with his own live-action movie
special and later he had his own cartoon
series the Bears inventor was Ken 4c he
died in 2014 but these boxes hold the
clues to how he created a best-selling
toy if you wanted to see something like
that you went to Disneyland or some of
the big places that had the huge shows
but nobody had it at home in fact it was
Disneyland that inspired Teddy's
creation in the 1950s forsee worked on
the parks early rides featuring moving
audio-animatronic figures these figures
were commanded by programming on giant
spool
magnetic tape to taking that tape and
saying well I can put that on an 8-track
and put it into a teddy bear no one was
thinking like that in the early 80s for
she started his own company to tinker
with animatronics among his many
projects he consulted for a robot rat
just starting to make it big chucky
cheese's pizza time theatre he also
patented a way to put animatronics in
human costumes the technology inside was
the same technology that eventually over
time was shrunk to go into the toy Ken's
Widow Jan 4 C keeps the early evolutions
of teddy preserved in cases this was the
very first prototype where they're
trying to decide can they take off the
shelf there and put the technology in it
and that prototype became a real toy
thanks to funding from a former
executive at Atari Don Kingsborough was
looking for a new project he fell in
love with the Teddy prototype and
launched the toy company worlds of
wonder he got the bear built and on
shelves in just six months in that time
Teddy's creative team whipped up 13
story books with songs based on the
world that forsee dreamed up years ago
voice actor Phil Baron also wrote up
many of Teddy's song lyrics and stories
what made Teddy unique in 1985 I think
is the same thing that makes Teddy
unique now it had certain technological
advances it had a certain life to it
that other toys didn't have a puppeteer
used a joystick to program Teddy snout
and jaw his I've movements were
programmed last no one had ever seen a
toy with realistic expressions talking
directly to a child
Teddy's flew off shelves parents pains
$70 a pop but the magic spell was soon
broken three years after launch a mix of
business troubles led to Teddy's demise
competition flooded stores with talking
dolls and Teddy's voice was drowned out
since then the original teddy creators
tried to bring him back working with
other toy companies they managed to put
him on shelves three times but he just
couldn't stick Teddy over the years has
had failures
it was always basically because of
management not because of the toy
now another toy company is trying again
this time with a whole new look it's a
brand that is a has an emotional
attachment from people who are who
worked children and now have children of
their own
Jeremy pad or is co-president of wicked
cool toys the Pennsylvania company
launching the new $100 Teddy his company
preserved the original recordings but
made a number of changes like
push-button pause and LCD screen eyes
with wild animations those eyes are
allow you to express more of the
technology I think kids today expect yet
well these digital eyes be a turn-off
there are signs he'll be a hit some new
models are being scalped on eBay for $50
more than retail and Teddy's sold out on
several early morning QVC spots this
summer but will kids today like my
little girl get hooked the same way they
did 30 years ago it's a dream that this
team believes
