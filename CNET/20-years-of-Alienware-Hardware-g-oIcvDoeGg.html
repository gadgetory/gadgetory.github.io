some the key products from 20 years of
Alienware history I think the first one
that stands out to me is not the first
one or two sort of off the self chassis
boxes that you probably made yourself
instead of magazines but really the
first one that was called like the area
51 sort of the first wheel you know and
we're branded the product a sees the one
that had the biomorphic shaped to it
that was near and dear to my heart it
had to represent speed performance and
the brand itself so we really thought
about an industrial design that was out
there and that people that appreciated
performance would would love and sure
enough that was that the first what we
call a predator chassis and that chassis
has really set like the iconic nature of
every product since it it took a good
full two and a half years to come out
that design I mean even today a lot of
gaming boutique makers don't make their
own cases they just to square off the
shelf cases so you know 15 years later
it's still it's still difficult to
imagine with that something like
somebody sculpted of clay for you guys
okay yeah we we had you I mean you dealt
with the industrial design firm well the
first things we did is we had to find
the right industrial design firm to
partners we didn't have our own
industrial design team this is our first
venture in building our own thing from
the ground what do you guys like sketch
it out on paper and go I wanted to look
roughly like the essence an artist yeah
so I sketched it on then we had a 3d
designer that worked on staff and he he
he made some sketches and then we turned
that into the industrial design team
that we hired I always thought that it
should be biomorphic in nature and and
have a real alien-esque feel to it that
speaks to performance
I mean one of the big moves I think was
the first area 51 and which as far as I
closed the first like real gaming laptop
other people who tried you know kind of
high-performance laptops we're not
really built for gaming even though it's
something you'd think people would be
crying out for how difficult was that to
make something like that work
considering the hardware available in
like 2002 well as its dealing with the
the various OEMs and before we get to
that I remember I remember Nelson and
one product planner basically saying
we're gonna go build a notebook and the
companies are saying you're crazy no
one's ever gonna buy a gaming notebook
and barely anybody supported that call
yet when you made that first notebook
what's the number one thing that you
said in the next version we're gonna fix
this or change this thermal thermal
issues I mean just there's so much power
consumption and you need to dissipate
the heat is just it's it was a big
concern it wasn't easy
I forgot that desktops used to get this
big in the front it's not the little
lock on it so nobody can get to your
little floppy drive in here and your DVD
writer with this about is gigantor's the
first one with water cooling right well
the first ever produced with liquid
cooling and that has become such a
mainstay now did you think that every
company on the pint of that made gaming
pcs were to doubt that with some form
never I remember the first time a liquid
cooling system failed on the factory
floor and our production manager calls
me he's like Frank I'm gonna need you to
come out here one of your systems failed
and he goes I don't need you to bring a
mop I knew exactly what he's talking
about but you look at the technology and
how much it's of caulk and we used to
use literally fish tank pumps to pump
the water through the system you know
and these very primitive heat exchangers
and the the the hoses we would use and
the pressure we would use all these
things you know we because we've been
doing it so long today you look at the
liquid cooling systems that we use today
and we co.design them with a partner and
I mean they're self-contained they
require zero maintenance used to have to
refill that thing every six months
tutorials on how to do that and you open
it up and you're super careful
the m11 X I remember seeing this I think
at at CES 2010 if I'm not mistaken and
we were blown away and we were blown
away that you could actually get gaming
level graphics in something you know
this small and it's an 11 inch gaming
laptop and I don't think anyone had ever
done that before
Arthur introduced it at CES 2010 and
this was a lot of different things
coming together and making it possible
to be able to create the m11 x 1.is we
had the netbook kind of revolution going
on and that made the way for some pretty
decent 11 inch screens to finally come
on to the scene in the market mobile
gaming graphics were actually pretty
viable as a gaming solution in TDP
packages or thermal packages that could
fit in type on a form factor inside a
form factor like this and Intel was
making the processor that we could also
fit inside of a form factor like this
when we looked at all of those
components and we kind of started
testing them in the labs we started
realizing this thing is actually a
pretty powerful gaming system we've got
something here
back then we had 12 pound notebooks and
nine pound notebooks and we wanted to
create something that you could actually
comfortably carry all day long and not
get a backache
largely thanks to extreme steam
greenlight effort and the emergence of a
massive library of indie game developers
out there we've seen some incredible
games come to the PC that are better
suited to play and in front of the TV
with a crowd of you're fit you know your
friends in the room on game pads and in
order to extend that experience to the
living room prior to us building this
product you had to pretty much put a big
bulky desktop like the one behind in in
your living room or in your bedroom
attached to your TV and it just wasn't a
comfortable experience it was it didn't
seem natural right we partnered with
valve we created the steam machine
initiative and it's done fairly well we
also created the Alpha the Windows
version of this and that's done very
well and customers are absolutely loving
this product has an 85 percent customer
recommendation rate right now and over
four and a half stars people absolutely
love the product it's not going to
matter so much what platform you're
playing on it's gonna matter what game
you want to play and you'll have the
choice of playing on any platform that
you'd like and now the office turned
into this incredible opportunity and
this really iconic kind of PC console
product in the industry that's just you
know tearing things up yeah exactly
successful because well people have
tried this in the past and it hasn't
really worked out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
