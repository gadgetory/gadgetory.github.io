so convenient you can put down your
phone and pick it up again without
having to fumble around for a cable
however even though it's really
convenient it's not exactly that fast in
fact the fastest wireless charger still
lags behind the fastest cable however
there are advances to the technology
that will make wireless charging in the
future both fast and convenient right
now compatible Samsung and LG phones
charge at 15 watts and Apple's new
iPhones charge at 7.5 watts recently a
company called Power Mac created a
wireless charging standard that could
power phones and one day laptops with 40
watts of energy that will more than
double today's speeds but it's not gonna
happen overnight device makers still
have to make the gadgets compatible to
the new technology so we're going to
start seeing speeds ramping up in the
next year two years and so on the second
development won't require you to place
your phone on a pad at all over the air
or distance charging is the ultimate
convenience because your battery
reserves can get a top-up when the
device is just laying on the counter or
even in your hands over-the-air charging
uses radio frequencies and has to be
declared safe by the FCC one company
energist
has done this with a transmitter that
will charge your phone at 2 or 3 feet
away it's also working on a longer range
charger that will reach your phone from
up to 15 feet away that one has not
cleared the FCC quite yet wireless
charging has been built into phones and
accessories like charging cases for
years so why is this only happening now
two reasons really one is that Apple
support for wireless charging is
starting to give the limelight and
critical mass that it really needs to
develop the second is that rivalries
between two standards power Matt and Qi
have resolved so now that Qi is the
single standard we should see these
advancements picking up the pace and in
the near future you might not have to
unpack that charger cable at all
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
