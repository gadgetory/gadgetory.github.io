we heard the BlackBerry key to events I
might as Axwell with Roger Chang Roger
what's new with the BlackBerry key
- well blackberry so you have to start
by talking about the keyboard keyboards
completely redesigned the keys are 20%
larger they're textured so you got
better touch typing capabilities
it's mats of glossy the old one on key
one was actually glossy like a what like
a little bubbly ones actually slip this
slide on the keys frankly the key one
keyboard felt a little cheap this is
definitely a much nicer feeling keyboard
okay so we've got a four and a half inch
screen touchscreen it's running Android
and we should have said this in the
beginning yes the BlackBerry is still a
thing can you explain the whole
BlackBerry the limited versus blackberry
mobile yeah so a blackberry limited
Blackbird the original blackberry that
we all knew and loved and grow up with
they basically gave up on making phones
they've since license out the BlackBerry
Mobile name - Chinese company TCL they
make televisions they also make phones
in the Alka Dell brand now they're
making blackberry mobile phones they
started a year ago with a key one this
is their follow up this is the second
version with the key - let's talk about
other hardware changes we have a very
similar design like you said 20% larger
keyboard but we've got two cameras on
the back this time yes they're they're
very proud to boast of the first
blackberry with a dual cam set up never
mind that most phones already have this
most premium phones do this they they
spend a lot of time talking with the
portrait mode photos they could take now
obviously these are features that have
been around for most premium flagship
phones blackberries just getting around
to it but you know blackberries a little
slow when it comes to things that aren't
about the keyboard right so we've got
that design change we've got the dual
cameras on the back we've got inside
though it's not super top-of-the-line
we're talking about a Qualcomm 660
processor the major flagship phones
these days are running 845 s that sounds
like a lot to know the numbers sound
extremely different it's at least 200
that must be a big deal right well now
look so blackberry said if you know in
terms of your your normal tasks
productivity tasks running emails
browsing all that stuff you're fine but
if you really want
Multimedia powerhouse this is not the
phone created if some where does this
thing fit in with all kinds of phones
you've got Apple phones you've got one
plus phones you've got Apple Samsung
this is gonna start a 649 dollars or a
64 gigabyte model with six gigabytes of
RAM which is insane so look the the
specs here it's a little weird because
it's sort of priced at that level right
below the super premium phones like your
iPhone or Galaxy S it's really closer to
like a oneplus or an LG Motorola phones
but the specs aren't quite top tier
they're they're a little bit as you
mentioned with the Qualcomm Snapdragon
processor it's a little bit lower than
your standard premium phone even though
they would try they're trying to frame
this as as a premium phone so it's it's
kind of a weird position it's really
it's its own niche product right look
this is going after folks who are just
diehard fans of a physical people let's
talk a little bit about the BlackBerry
ad showing off the introduction of the
key to the ads very self-aware it seems
like they're making fun of themselves a
little bit of people saying oh Black
Bears still a thing without saying black
bears nothing right it's a big I think
it's actually a very smart marketing
move what do you think about that no I
think they're tapping into the idea that
you know I used to love my blackberry
the BlackBerry there's there's a bit
nostalgia involved there it's it's it's
kind of a smart move I'm bringing back
that Blackberry love that we used to
have we used to have this used to have
some I used to have a lot of blackberry
love I mean I wrote whole stories on my
old BlackBerry's so that reminds me
about back to the keyboar situation they
were talking about the click enus that
the designers are worried about how well
these Keys performed the compared to the
BlackBerry Bold 9900 with a very beloved
keyboard they got a lot of people in the
crowds excited about that just the
reference to the bold 9900 I remember
the click enos of those keys I remember
how responsive they were and the fact
that are using that as sort of
foundation for this keyboard definitely
bodes well for it yeah I think they're
trying to reach diehards and I think
this device while not like super
top-of-the-line like a 999 phone or
something like that if you're into
blackberry into an actual keyboard
this is one of the few phones that has a
keyboard on it and it's running Android
so you got thousands thousands of apps I
make millions of apps I guess well they
are saying this is not this is not
mainstream phone this is not a phone
that's going out to the same crowd as an
iPhone or Galaxy S 9 this is really a
niche niche product this is going after
folks who love keyboards and fortunately
there are now a lot of other options out
there so like this is it if you want a
physical keyboard we're gonna see how
this thing performs in a full review so
we'll have a lot more details as
cnet.com Amaya's Akhtar and Roger we'll
see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
