way hippie oh come on is it it's always
doing art of it don't know where he is
hey I'm here I'm here I'm here supposed
to be it
what's up Brian song here and welcome to
the apple byte the place to be for all
things good and bad inside the world of
Apple now let's jump into the show
starting off with Siri it's really
become a household name for voice
recognition thanks to apples mass appeal
even if some of you aren't really using
it now Android has had voice recognition
before iOS but it now trails behind
series more natural interaction the
Android Emmy blog reports that Google is
now working on a serum Pettit ER called
mayil it's named after the wife of Star
Trek creator Gene Roddenberry and she
was the voice for many of the computer
interfaces in the series direction
unclear please repeat request it's being
developed by Google's Google X
experiment labs and their ultimate goal
is to make every piece of computing
experience voice aware it's always good
to see more competition and we're really
expecting a big push with voice
recognition in 2012 and in other rumors
Clippy will be the voice assistant in
Windows Phone 7 in macbook pro rumors
digitize reports that the big a may be
reading an ultra high resolution display
for as early as the second quarter
according to their sources it would be a
double res display at 2880 by 1800
pixels which would presumably be for the
15-inch model the apples already added
support for high DPI modes in lion that
support this resolution ee mode and
ultra-high resolution artwork for
desktops and icons have been found in OS
10 so we can expect to probably see this
now the latest developer build of iOS
5.1 beta 2 was released and finally
includes the option to delete pictures
from your photo stream instead of
automatically pushing every single thing
you take a picture of including those
awkward myspace photos but there was
also more evidence pointing to the next
ipad 3 found in the code but no evidence
of the iphone 5 yet now digit times most
recent ipad report claims next gen ipad
parts have been delivered to
manufacturers and the ipad 3 or whatever
it ends up being called will be
available in three to four months that's
just enough time to enjoy your new ipad
2 from christmas alright let's check out
the app of the week
there were so many to choose from this
week from the updated Netflix app with
its smooth interface that looks great
but come on I've been there I've done
that or check out the open world Grand
Theft Auto 3 that finally brings us back
to Liberty City on iOS but let's get
real the app that I want to show you is
kinectimals it's microsoft's popular
kinect game and first entry on iOS where
you get to pick your favorite big cat
i'll pick a lion and then you can teach
at these really cool tricks you can make
them all nice and clean with this
scrubber you can play jump Ropin and see
how he hops over that's too or just pat
him because he loves you it's 299 and
it's a universal app that's perfect for
the kids and it looks so good that it
feels like the game pops out of the
screen bad lion bad lion told you not to
do that pledge all right back to stories
google has released their zeitgeist list
for 2011 that ranks the most popular
searches of 2011 at number one
everyone's favorite singer Rebecca Black
or not but the top Apple search came in
at number six for the iphone 5 a product
that doesn't even exist now Steve Jobs
was ninth and the ipad 2 came in at 10
making three of the top ten
apple-related it also looks like new
improvements might be coming to apples
Notification Center after a few new
hires suggests apples looking to push
the feature even further most notable
was Jan Michael cart the University of
Georgia student who was hired as a paid
intern for the next seven months thanks
to his mock-up video showing
improvements Apple should implement like
the status bar showing the number of
notifications third-party widgets that
we all want and collapsible notification
list and while they're at it can you
guys fix the horrible jacked-up bad
apple music player that they brought to
the iPad in iOS 5 it's a mess all right
to the quick bytes there's some software
updates that you can take care of itunes
10.5 point2 makes improvements they
aren't telling us to iTunes Match
service and an audio distortion problem
in CDs gets a fix plus the Apple TV and
iOS 5 yet minor updates if you want to
do that and unfortunately my bid wasn't
high enough apples founding contract
sold from 1.6 million dollars at the
Sotheby's auction recently New York to
the CEO of the Sisneros corporation it's
a nice profit for a few pieces of paper
and check this out if you're looking for
a stocking stuffer this could be it it's
the mirror book air that's a compact
mirror designed to look like a macbook
air it's nineteen ninety five euros but
I really don't know any guy that would
want that alright that's going to do it
for this week's show from all of us here

your iPad email us at the apple by the
cnet com i'm brian Tong thanks for
