tracking the effects of speaking to and
around infants and toddlers kids who get
consistent verbal interaction and kids
who don't are divided by a so called
language gap between levels of
comprehension and speaking Starlin by
versa me is a gadget that attempts to
bridge that gap basically this little
device clips to your child's clothes and
listens for how many words are spoken
around and to them the device
distinguishes effectively between real
human speech and the television or radio
plus versa me says Starling works with
any language and they've tested it with
various romantic Germanic and
afro-asiatic languages the problem is
for $200 I want this device to do more
than just count the number of words I
say to my son and track when I say them
I want it to record the language that
I'm using so that it can tell me if I
need to widen my vocabulary I want it to
measure my speech pattern so it can tell
me if I need to increase my speaking
speed or decrease it to help my son's
language acquisition according to the
developers at versa me technology like
this is on the way either via firmware
updates or just new models of Starling
now as a writer I take developing my
son's language acuity very seriously so
conceptually I like that Starling is
helping parents give their kids time and
attention something that's easy to let
slide after a long day at work but as a
millennial still finding stability in
adult life I don't necessarily have the
resources to give him everything that
might make a difference in his
development so at the end of the day I
can't recommend Starling to most parents
unless $200 just isn't that big of an
expense for them but I'm really hopeful
to see where the tech goes in the future</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
