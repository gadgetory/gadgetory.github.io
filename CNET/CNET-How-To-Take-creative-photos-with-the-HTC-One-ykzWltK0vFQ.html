and one of the features we like most
about it is it's camera it's not about
megapixels it's not about the name brand
on the lens it's about the software HTC
baked in a lot of cool tricks on its
camera and today is how to I'm going to
show you some of my favorites
have you ever seen one of those action
shots where sequence of images are all
combined into just one picture the HTC
one makes it really easy to take those
on your own just open up the camera
point out the action hold still and hold
down the snapshot button to take a
continuous sequence of pictures by
default the HTC One will present you
with an option to have it automatically
picked the best shot but that's not what
you want instead hit the back button
next tap the little stack of photos at
the top of the window then hit the edit
button at the bottom now tap retouch
from the side menu and select the
sequence option from the left after the
HTC One does a little processing it'll
give you a composite of what it thinks
are the best shots to make up your
sequence by tapping the photos on the
bottom you can take them in or out of
the sequence but when you have the way
you want tap the done button then tap
the little trio of dots at the top and
select save
for another cool trip like this we're
going to use something HTC calls the Zoe
button to use it we're going to set up
our shot then tap this button on the
left when we're ready to take our
picture tap the camera shutter button
and we'll take a photo along with a
short video from before and after the
shot was taken when it's done tap the
photo stack at the top and you'll see
the video and a white dot on the
timeline that indicates the photo you
took the upshot of this feature is that
you don't have to choose between
shooting a photo or a video you can have
both you can slide around on the
timeline and maybe find a few
alternative frames from the video that
you can export as pictures using the
menu button at the top
so there you go those are some of my
favorite camera tricks on the HTC one
more how to's like this head over to how
to cnet com where you can also find my
how-to on customizing the HTC one's home
screen I'm Donald Bell go out and shoot
some great photos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
