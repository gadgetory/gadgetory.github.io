Chromebook this is the HP Chromebook 11
and if you're not familiar with
Chromebooks they're a little different
than a typical laptop they run Google's
Chrome operating system and who would
want something like this well if you're
someone who does most of your work
online then a Chromebook is pretty good
it's really affordable
this one is 279 and compared to last
year's Samsung Chromebook there are a
few improvements one the screen it's
about 50 percent brighter and it has a
wider viewing angle it's very thin and
light and has a very finished design you
can see there's the edges are very
rounded and if you're worried about
plastic being flimsy they actually have
a magnesium frame inside to give it some
strength and support so you can hold it
from the corner and it's not really
going to bend and wobble on you this
feels pretty sturdy another unique thing
about the Chromebook is that you don't
see speakers anywhere that's because
they tuck the speaker's underneath the
keyboard that way you don't accidentally
muffle the speaker's if you have this on
your lap or if you're sitting on the bed
it's just right there coming from the
keys it also has an interesting charger
it works with a micro USB charger not
that typical unique charger that you
need for a laptop you can use the same
charger on this as you can with a
smartphone a tablet one cord will charge
all your devices if you get it in white
you can have a choice of four different
accent colors the typical Google colors
green blue red yellow if you're not a
fan of the white and the colorful
there's also piano black you find this
as a laptop that's great for families
looking for a second laptop that they
can give their kids and not have to
worry about who has access to what
because it's so affordable it's easy to
get online and it's also something that
Google is pushing to schools since for
the price of one chromebook it's cheaper
than some tablets out there the
Chromebook comes with a few goodies you
get a hundred gigabytes of Google Drive
cloud storage free for two years and you
also get two months of a free trial with
Google Play Music all access and 12 free
sessions of gogo in-flight Internet
someone who's a frequent flyer has two
gigabytes of RAM and a 16 gigabyte solid
state drive inside and has two USB ports
this model connects online with Wi-Fi
but there is a 4G version coming out if
you want wireless internet on the go
that price hasn't been announced yet the
Chromebook may not be for everyone but
it's a great Buy if you do most your
work online because it's just an easy
way to get online fast to start working
you might not be able to download all
types of programs onto this but not
everyone needs that sometimes the family
might want to buy an extra one just for
their kids to get online in the house
and it's more affordable than some
tablets out there for CNET I'm Bridget
