the alpha byte it's what we're talking
about boys and girls guess the ipad
ding-ding-ding you are correct now the
Apple byte was at the event and we only
sent out the best of the best so let's
find out if this iPad thing lived up to
the hype
Brian's talking here with cnet.com and
yes in my hand this is the iPad and I've
got to tell you that it does feel pretty
sturdy it has a nice weight to it it's
one and a half pounds and it's half an
inch thick and when you look at it you
might think well it looks like a really
big iPod touch and it does have a lot of
features very similar but what they've
done is actually rebuilt a lot of the
core apps specifically for this device
so if we look at something like mail and
you can see the layout of your emails
but you can actually view them here in
the right-hand column and you'll see
this in a lot of the other applications
you also find a redesign to iTunes Store
and what also makes this unique is the
store itself is laid out differently
it's really taken advantage of the
larger screen space so you have a really
a better user experience you also have
access to your photos there's kind of a
cool photo frame feature where your
docket and you press a button and it'll
actually turn into this kind of digital
photo frame you also have access to
movie content as well and all of your
applications now some of the unique
innovative features of this device is
the iBooks and the iBooks bookstore so
what this is this is a bookshelf and
much like iTunes you can get access to
books and instantly download them to the
device and then one of the main things
that I think that makes us unique is
sure it's not a Inc but this is a
full-color screen also you have the
touch capability to turn pages you can
even take it nice and slow if you want
to now a lot of the apps most of the
apps that are currently on the App Store
will work with the iPad they do have
this feature that's basically a doubler
that fills out the game to the screen I
can just click right here and it doubles
the pixels so you're still gonna get a
full screen experience there will be
apps that are customized specifically
for the iPad so you can wait and see
that when the actual device releases
another feature they're really pushing
is being able to use some of their
desktop apps from the iWork suite
directly on the device they have also
been redesigned just for multi-touch so
all you do is use your fingers so you
have an application that you're familiar
with like keynote which is a PowerPoint
application and this will allow you to
interact with your slideshow and use it
with your hands now the iPad what's the
price I'm gonna start out well there's
two flavors really there's a Wi-Fi
version and then Wi-Fi wid 3G if you
want the entry-level Wi-Fi model that's
gonna start at $4.99 and go up to $6.99
then if you want a Wi-Fi and 3G version
that's gonna start at six hundred and
twenty nine dollars and go all the way
up to eight hundred and twenty nine
dollars for this 64 gig version now the
iPad overall it is a unique innovative
device I don't feel really super
compelled to buy one at the moment but I
really think that will change as more
media content that you can interact with
that makes a unity unique experience
comes out but overall there's your first
look at the iPad
I'm Brian song with cnet.com okay dude
seriously nice wrap up but we're gonna
stop copying the way I dress and please
dad a haircut don't wait Jamie Jamie is
that you she's watching the show oh okay
perfect
I can't be perfect now we also asked
people what they thought of the
announcement I love your first
impression that it's big per than an
iPod it was interesting to see the fit
and finish on it actually handling it
and it's so solid it's just like a big
iPod touch which is like revolutionising
the whole idea what we do at the
computer and doing it all with your
hands there's no way you can match a
type of a free eye
I like the Apple I'm excited and I don't
care if anybody else in society I am
what I buy it right now would you buy it
500 bucks I buy it and play around yes I
would I try to offer them five bucks
there
I was actually thinking about grabbing
wanted running but I didn't I thought
they'd probably have enough people to
stop all right you gotta remember I just
seemed loves everything Apple makes and
myself I wasn't really that impressed
until I got a chance to play with it I'm
a gadget freak we haven't seen any
product like this but I can't really say
I'm willing to buy it right now let's
get back to the iPad and some things you
may not know it's running iPhone OS
version 3.2 which runs specifically on
the iPad and not on any iPhone or iPod
touches the iPad will have external
video out capability you'll be able to
mount it as a drive to share files
there's still no flash support and
there's still no multitasking and apps
specifically develop for the iPad will
not be compatible with iPhones or iPods
there were also some moans when AT&amp;amp;T
showed up as a partner and even though
the Wi-Fi with 3G version is unlocked
for use internationally Apple
spokespeople could not confirm if it
would work with t-mobile here in the US
so I'm guessing that means a big note
now the Wi-Fi version will be available
in 60 days and the Wi-Fi and 3G version
will be available in about 90 days but
who might get their hands on it first
Jack Bauer and 24
Rodney charters the director of
photography for 24 tweeted that they
would be getting Apple's latest goodie
for an episode I'm just thinking would
he use it to get his latest mission
information would he mess up a bad guy
like he did with that fire axe
I'll be waiting
alright let's check out our half of
these this week's app of the week is the
New York Times app for the iPad it was
the most impressive thing I saw at the
event because it really showcased how
new media content can be consumed in the
future flipping through articles
resizing the text with a pinch viewing
photo galleries within an article and
then instantly pulling up a video
feature that complements the article I'm
getting giddy already now if more
publishers innovate and pump content
like this into the iPad then it really
makes it a must buy for me all right
that's gonna do it for this week's show
we know you have plenty on your mind so
send us your thoughts reactions and
questions about the iPad to the Apple
byte at Cena comm and we'll answer them
next week i'm brian tom thanks for
watching and come back next week for
another bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
