video recording drones and is new model
the phantom 3 makes it easier than ever
to get gorgeous stabilized 4k footage
right from the air
physically it's much the same as before
with its chunky white plastic design
it's very well built and I can say from
personal experience that it can survive
a crash into the side of your house and
a three-story drop on to grass of course
it is still very wise to fly it
carefully it's incredibly easy to set up
and to fly you can learn to fly by a
digital drone in the DJI pilot app
before you decide to take the risk in
taking the real one outside the camera
has been given a bunch of upgrades it's
still slung on a stabilizing gimbal
which smoothes out weird jerks and bumps
in flight but the sensor has been
greatly improved to achieve a much more
attractive image with better dynamic
range bright skies aren't washed out as
I've seen on earlier models and colors
looked both accurate and rich there are
two models available the Phantom 3
professional which shoots in 4k and the
phantom 3 advanced which is functionally
the same but only shoots in 1080 having
4k probably isn't a necessity for most
of you so you can save yourself a couple
of hundred quid and go for the advanced
model having 4k does allow you to crop
into the image in post-production though
while still maintaining full HD quality
so for the professionals among you it
might be the better choice although
you've always technically been able to
fly the drones indoors there are now two
sensors beneath the Phantom 3 which
track the ground helping it keep it much
more stable inside where it doesn't have
GPS even so I do recommend only using it
inside a big space a little living room
probably isn't going to cut it the
controller is roughly the same as on
previous versions it's easy to hold it
only give a basic amount of functions
making it very easy to use and you'll
find dedicated camera control buttons on
the top which let you start with stop
recording change the exposure till the
angle of the camera all while the drone
is still in the air the main downside of
the phantom 3 is still its battery life
DJI reckons you can get around 20 to 23
minutes of flight time although I found
in my own
experience that to be nearer the
20-minute mark I might be fine if you're
flying in your garden but if you're
taking away any distance that short
flight time will be limiting you can buy
spares but they cost over a hundred
pounds each so are probably only worth
considering if you're using it for
professional purposes the DJI phantom 3
doesn't come particularly cheap but it
has a hell of a lot to offer it's
stabilized 4k footage looks absolutely
fantastic and the drone itself is so
easy to fly but a child can do it if
you're an enthusiastic amateur filmmaker
who's looking for a new angle for a
video it's well worth considering
although you should spring for a couple
of extra batteries I'm Andrew Hoyle
fussy net and this is the DJI phantom 3</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
