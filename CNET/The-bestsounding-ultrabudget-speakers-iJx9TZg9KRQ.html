actually sound pretty good has never
been easier thanks to a wave of ultra
budget models from brands like Dayton
audio Micha and monoprice hey I'm
Matthew Muscovy ak for CNET and the
monoprice mb/s 650 is actually the best
sounding ultra budget speaker of the
bunch and more impressively it's selling
for just 32 dollars per pair plus
shipping while they sound good you're
not getting much in the looks department
from these speakers there is generic
looking as they come with a black matte
vinyl finish and boxy sharp edges
they're also pretty big so if you need
them to fit in a smaller space you may
want to check out the competing Micha MB
42 around back you'll find a keyhole
wall mount and a bass board along with
the speaker connectors
unfortunately mono prices spring clip
connectors aren't very strong so if you
find yourself occasionally moving the
speaker's the speaker wire may slip out
behind the speaker grille there's a
half-inch tweeter and a large 6.5 inch
woofer there's not much else to these
speakers there's no built-in wireless
technology like Bluetooth Wi-Fi or
airplay nor is there any kind of
integrated amplification that means
you're going to need a separate
amplifier but luckily there are other
cheap options like the $18.00 lip ILP
2028 plus plug in your phone wire up the
speakers and you're good to go where the
monoprice speakers really shine is their
sound quality this isn't a premium
speaker experience but they outclassed
the other ultra budget options when we
compare them side-by-side
music sounded particularly natural and
there was more detail than you'd expect
from a speaker at this price it even
held its own when we turned up the
volume where the smaller mica MB 42
speakers started to sound harsh
now the monoprice speakers can't compare
to more expensive models like pioneers a
hundred and thirty dollar s PBS 22lr
speakers but to be fair they're also a
fraction of the cost and that's pretty
much all you need to know about these
speakers if you're looking for the best
sounding ultra budget speakers you can't
beat mono prices mb/s 650 although they
are going to work best in a garage or a
den where looks aren't quite
Porter I'm Matthew Muscovy ak4 CNET and
this is the monoprice mb/s 650</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
