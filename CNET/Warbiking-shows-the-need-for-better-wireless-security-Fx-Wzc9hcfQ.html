biking actually is so it sounds very
dramatic war biking is essentially the
evolution of war driving which comes
from war dialing and it's basically
cycling around a city picking up all the
mobile devices all the wireless access
points and building a map that shows the
various levels of security of all those
different devices now talk us through
the kit you've when you're riding around
so it's a fairly Heath Robinson setup
I've got to admit which I enjoy
thoroughly I've got a Raspberry Pi at
the core of everything wonderful little
you know fifty dollar computer designed
for children to learn how to program and
that's connected up to a series of
wireless scanners for different types of
wireless we then connect it up to a GPS
so that we can identify you know where
that particular network was located and
some custom software that exports all of
that into a wonderful high-tech rotating
google maps image that makes security
actually visual which is hard to do and
when you're out there what's the data
you're collecting so at a high level
we're collecting the beacons and probes
that's basically your phone's way of
saying have you seen this network that
I've connected to previously and your
device typically will send out 10 to 15
of the networks that you've previously
seen those in themselves can be
fascinating as it may give away where
you work a hotel you stayed at recently
some cases some embarrassing information
and and maybe personally identifiable we
then have of course the network's
beacons as well so any of the coffee
shops in the area will be broadcasting
out a network name and the security
level as well and that's what we're
collecting now you've been we've been
out this morning having a bit of a ride
round you've war biked around cities all
over the world how does Sydney compared
so Sydney's actually one of the better
cities or as I prefer to put it one of
the least terrible I mean a couple of
statistics for you so about four percent
of the networks in Sydney we're using
wet
WEP is a security protocol that has been
known just horribly horribly broken for
about more than 10 years actually so it
really shouldn't be in widespread use
we've still got thousands of networks
here in in Sydney with that problem but
compare that to London little over six
percent San Francisco the hotspot of
America awful pun at about nine point
five percent so so actually you know
sydney's doing quite well but still
really need to make some changes so when
people are using this sort of like poor
security or non-secured not even just
businesses but in their home what are
they actually risking what can happen to
people if other people can connect to
the wireless internet I mean there's a
whole myriad of different attacks that
can occur let's take the most common
scenario you go to a coffee shop you
connect to the open network or maybe get
the shared password that everyone's
using you go through the little captive
portal and register and thereafter
you're on the Internet of course most
people assume the coffee shop is
securing their traffic but all of that
information is being shouted out for
anyone with a forty dollar transmitter
to pick up several hundred meters away
with readily available software that
means they can see where you're browsing
they can see maybe what you're shopping
for they can see usernames and passwords
potentially of services you log onto
like social media or your email in
extreme cases it could even be used to
distribute malicious code that could go
further to do things like turning on the
webcam on your mobile device or pc we're
talking serious invasion of privacy in
the digital and the physical world so
should people not be using public Wi-Fi
well I'm a big user of public Wi-Fi I
travel a lot and it's it's pretty
important it's a good convenience that
the best thing to do is really to assume
that someone is watching so what I like
to do is set up my devices with a VPN
virtual private network I use an online
account for my personal device and as a
business we have a corporate VPN so it's
something that both consumers and small
businesses can do and that encrypts all
of my information end-to-end kind of
wrapping it in
tunnel so that even if someone is
sitting there listening to that open
network all my information is protected
in a bubble and they can't get access to
it or tamper with anything I do so
preparation really is the best strategy
now you've done kind of the reverse as
well you've written out with publicly
available hotspots to see here connects
what data can you get from that the
other way around yeah this is actually I
think one of the most terrifying parts
of the study because it reveals human
behaviors so this hotspot that we set up
had three names free public Wi-Fi free
internet and do not connect wonderful
name now we did see in Sydney just just
under a thousand people connecting to
those those hot spots that we created
where we then provide a connection to
the internet with a small warning we
didn't with our hotspot do anything
nasty we didn't certainly malware we
didn't hijack any pages but with the
tools we were using it would have been
trivial to do so so when someone asks
for you no internet bank X or X Y Z and
webmail provider we redirect them to a
fake page where we can collect their
username and password easy to do in our
case we just collected high-level
information about the sites that people
were using what was most common and the
security mistakes that were being made
and I can tell you it's a fairly
depressing picture what could've thought
so I think for me that the most damning
statistic was the fact that only one
point two percent of users were using a
VPN so the majority of users were just
connecting to Wi-Fi in a very
trustworthy fashion and going about
browsing very unimportant websites like
internet banking for example I mean what
could possibly go wrong as a security
comedian and general cynic there was one
small beacon of hope in the little over
sixty percent of the websites that
people are visiting we're using HTTPS or
encrypted HTTP which is actually a big
step forward over years previous so not
completely horrifying but again we
need to think about how we behave on
these public hot spots when we connect
with our mobile devices</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
