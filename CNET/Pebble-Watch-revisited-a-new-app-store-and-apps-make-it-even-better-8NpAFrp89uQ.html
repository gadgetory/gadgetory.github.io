Pebble watch yes the original Pebble
watch now a lot of smartwatches have
come and gone you've seen the Samsung
Galaxy gear the Qualcomm talk so many
other weird and semi half-baked
smartwatches and then there's the
original 149 Pebble watch which is still
available on sale why am I talking about
it again because there is a brand new
pebble app store that launched that
enables access to all of the various
apps that were hard to find otherwise
watch faces and new types of funky apps
ones like Yelp Foursquare ESPN new types
of weather apps ways of controlling
smart home things like nest or the
philips hue lighting system gopro
cameras the list goes on and on and on
and these can be loaded onto the
original pebble with a new software
update now there's also the pebble steel
which I'm wearing here which is pebbles
new watch but the 2 $49 new watch really
underneath is the same watch as the
original pebble so what you're paying
$100 for here is the metal and glass
which is admittedly pretty fantastic or
you go with the original plastic design
here which kind of feels like the swatch
of smartwatches it's it's comfortable
it's also still waterproof has the
backlighting they both have a limit of 8
apps being loaded on to them same black
and white screen so to some people you
say hey I saved $100 that's a great deal
others will look at this and think hmmm
maybe it looks a little cheaper I'd
rather go with a nicer fancier watch
design and that's the decision you're
gonna have to make know that both of
these have similar battery life similar
performance and connect with the same
number of iOS and Android devices and
use that app store in the same way so
they're interchangeable and that's the
good news makes it a little bit of a
no-brainer deciding now you decide to
figure out do you want a pebble what
does the pebble do again well before it
acted as a kind of a pager on your wrist
so you could get notifications now
that's been made even better between iOS
and Android so for Twitter Facebook SMS
incoming phone calls you name it if it
appears on the front page your phone
then it can pop up on this screen and I
think that's what it does best now there
are also a number of interactive apps
the new version of pebbles software 2.0
enabled apps and
do a whole bunch of new interactive
stuff play better games interact with
things like Yelp where you can read
reviews and also ping to get your
location use the internal accelerometer
and gyroscope to shake to do various
things but all this is still in
evolution and the more you play with
those apps the more you may think wait a
second why am I not just using my phone
so I think the pinging notifications for
me are still the best reason keep in
mind that the pebble and pebble steel do
not have touch screens they don't have
color screens and they don't have any
microphone or speakers on them or any
cameras needless to say so they may feel
a little down tech compared to some of
the watches like the Samsung Galaxy gear
but the total package of what this
offers and the fact that it's waterproof
makes it the best SmartWatch that's out
there even now although it is really
more like a polished version of what we
expected the first time so the Pebble
watch still around also has
interchangeable wristbands but I think I
would still prefer the pebble steel
really it's a matter of aesthetics
thankfully I'm Scott Stein and that's a
look again at the Pebble watch one more
time with an app store</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
