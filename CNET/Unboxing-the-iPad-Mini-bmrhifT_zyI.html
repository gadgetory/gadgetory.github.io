iPad Mini or as we call it around here
the unicorn let's check it out have some
other tablets for comparison the iPad
Mini as you know is a 7.9 inch tablet
every 29 this is a light box I've heard
people's overwhelming responses to it
seem to be our reviewers saying that it
is very light really unexpectedly light
getting from it so far no time to waste
this box is light this is startling and
it's with all the packaging okay Oh
chicken wow that is a lightweight tablet
it seems like it weighs about as much as
an iPhone here's our packaging Kasich
air this one does come with the power
brick which is nice to see unless you
already have a bunch of them there's a
move away from power bricks that is
environmentally motivated and in some
cases I'm in favor of that but still
it's kind of useful lightning connector
and that's pretty much it a little bit
of a construction stuff in here I assume
let's get to the tablet so it's thinner
let's hold up the old iPad for
comparison here we'll do a screen
comparison later but here's the size
difference between these two guys pretty
distinct it's a little bit thinner than
the old iPad it makes this thing feel
like about a 60 pound brick I mean you
feel like you can't believe you were
carrying around this clunk this is like
possible you have kind of a nice matte
black back here now it is wider than
some of the true 7 inch tablets here's a
nexus 7 by comparison the Kindle Fire HD
of course is about this wide and as you
know I'm not a huge fan of this size it
makes it a little bit hard to hold you
can
with one hand but after a little while
you're gonna get the dreaded seven inch
tablet hand cramp all right but let's
turn it on we do have some physical
buttons on the side and of course power
up here while we wait for it to power up
and do some setup let's get to the specs
the iPad Mini starts at $329 for the 16
gig Wi-Fi version and it goes up from
there the max you could pay is 659
dollars for the 64 gig model with LTE
the iPad Mini comes in two colors black
and white or silver slate and black
slate
it is 5.3 inches wide and points to
eight inches thin it's seven point eight
inches tall and it weighs point six
eight pounds the display is a 7.9 inch
LED backlit multi-touch display it's IPs
and the resolution is a somewhat
disappointing 1024 by 768 not only is
that not a Retina display it's actually
worse than both the Nexus 7 and the
Kindle Fire HD both of those are 1280 by
800 this is also the first iPad with
dual stereo speakers so it should sound
pretty good for movies and games it has
a dual core a5 processor that's the same
as the iPad 2 it obviously runs Apple
iOS and it has the new lightning
connector there are two cameras the
front-facing FaceTime camera takes 1.2
megapixel photos and 720p HD video the
rear camera is a 5 megapixel camera for
taking photos battery life should be
pretty good if it's anything like the
original iPads up to 10 hours of surfing
on Wi-Fi is what Apple States so the
iPad Mini look if you have an iPad or an
iPhone with a Retina display and then
you go look at this thing it's gonna bug
you and $329 is not a lot to pay for an
iPad considering that the last ones were
500 but I don't feel like this is a
great value I think the size the weight
and the apps are wonderful and it's
probably gonna be a great seller but I
would say that it's probably worth
waiting these six to eight months no
more than a year before they release
this model with a Retina display for the
exact same price you know what's gonna
happen
hold out if you can</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
