apartment with the second-generation
Kwikset kevo this is a bluetooth-enabled
smart deadbolt that pairs with your
phone and then lets you get inside your
home just by tapping on the lock now it
won't let anybody touch the unlock only
works if it detects a phone you paired
the lock with outside of the door or if
it detects the key fob that key fob came
standard in generation 1 but now a
generation 2 you have to buy it
separately I'm not a big fan of that one
thing I am a fan of is the locks ability
to distinguish between phones and key
fobs that are outside of the door and
ones that are inside of the door
performance was strong in general too I
tested this lock out in a variety of
different locations and across the board
it was a very consistent performer it
was able to let me in when I tapped on
it and lock when I tapped on it the
installations were all pretty easy the
one big problem that I and a lot of
other TiVo users encountered was that
the iOS 10 update earlier this fall
changed some things with Bluetooth and
the iOS architecture and made it so that
you had to have the Kingo app open and
active on your phone in order for touch
to unlock to work so that's terribly for
your phone out open the app before
touching on the lock I just use my key
at that point
fortunately the recent tweaks to iOS 10
and fixed that for the most part but I
still saw some occasional weirdness
nothing that made the lock too terribly
difficult to use but just the occasional
glitch where I have to tap more than
once maybe a couple of times in order to
get in for those reasons I really liked
the kibo fob that $25 Bluetooth
accessory that you pin on to your
teaching and you use to get in once
you've got that fob on your keychain you
don't need your phone at all they change
things in Android or iOS it won't affect
your lock performance I just hate that
you have to buy extra the other big
thing that I tested was the strength of
the deadbolt
the generation one this was a problem
there is a specific method event
brute force attack involving a
screwdriver a hammer and a little key
boy if you did it just right you could
force the lock open that's not the case
in generation 2 quick set is fixed that
we try to ourselves again we broke one
of the key bows that we were testing in
the process you can't use that attack on
this lock now that's a very very good
fish bottom line this is a good lock and
improved our generation one but you
really have to want that touch to unlock
convenience in order to buy it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
