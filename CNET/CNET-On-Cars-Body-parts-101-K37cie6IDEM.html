four-door a coupe is a two-door
convertible can be converted from
clothes to open regardless of the number
of doors a stationwagon is a sedan with
a rear box but there have also been
two-door wagons and a hardtop is a
four-door with no center pillar but it's
sort of an archaic term now the fender
hood bumper cover grill if your car has
one combine together and called the
front clip I've heard a lot of
explanations for the term none of them
make sense
bender used to mean the kind of outboard
fenders you imagine on a vintage car
they originally were there to keep stuff
from flying off the tires into your face
on modern cars the fender of course is
integrated it's this whole piece of
sheet metal on the left and right front
corners but it is detachable just after
this whole front cliff stuff is
something called the cowl this is very
deceptively subtle a whole lot of the
proportions of your entire car are
determined by this top of the firewall
any given two-door four-door convertible
and wagon of the same model car will
typically share a cowl and get much of
their family identity from it now as you
come around from the cowl you get what's
called the greenhouse that's all this
stuff up here your glass and your roof
everything above the belt line which is
this line along the bottom of the side
glass the greenhouse is held up by
pillars and you letter them going back a
B C and if you've got a wagon or an SUV
you might have a D by the way if the C
pillar or the last pillar is really huge
it's called a sail panel at the rear of
the car is the quarter panel unless you
drive a Model T you don't have rear
fenders you have quarter panels quarter
panels are analogous to front fenders
they serve a similar purpose with one
big difference they're integral to the
body shell they don't come off unless
you've got a torch oh by the way this
piece of glass over here most folks call
that the back window technically it's
the back light because it's not a
movable window at all unless you're
driving a mid-60s mercury with the
breezeway
option that was cool in the rain the
rear window shines Sun warm the styling
shaped the back seat a vehicle's
wheelbase is the distance between the
wheels on the side of the car measured
at the hub centers go the other way
measure left to right and that's your
track it's like 2 feet on this fiat key
but on most cars wider is considered
better this piece of bodywork underneath
the door shut line between the wheels
that's your rocker panel carry that line
farther out beyond the wheels and those
are your overhangs now you know the
names of your cars anatomical parts
helps you in a lot of ways as you watch
and read reviews and it also helps you
decode with the body shop guys talking
about when he does your estimate
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
