hacking there are many controversial
figures hector Montsegur is among the
most controversial as a member of
anonymous and LulzSec he participated in
some of the world's most infamous hacks
however when he was identified by the
FBI they threatened to send his adopted
daughters to Child Protective Services
he turned informant ultimately helped to
prevent some 300 hacks against American
targets however he still participated in
some hacks against international ones
his actions on both sides of the law
have earned in plenty of enemies but
also given him quite a story to tell
he's remained silent since the
sentencing in May of this year but came
out to speak with Charlie Rose in an
interview now we're gonna take the
opportunity to speak with him a little
bit more detail about some of those
hacking exploits Hector thank you for
joining me this morning oh thank you can
you tell me a little bit how you got
started what was your what was your
first computer what kind of system
buzzing well the first computer I ever
touched was like an old Apple forgot
exactly what version was a little square
box we're talking about like early 90s
 Mac classic maybe yeah like
something like that and you know I would
have just sit on in to play games and
all and all of that I wish I have access
to the internet yet but it was like my
foray into computers and you know going
to school and playing uh you know Carmen
Sandiego or whatever you know yeah
eventually in the mid 90s I had whole
different lifestyle alright I was in the
streets family world got a whole
different situation going on and it was
a point where my family specifically my
aunt could afford to buy me a coke
ruining a nice computer at the time it
was a 195 so it was a machine with
windows a 5 on it a Sony Vaio
with like 133 megahertz 60 megabytes of
RAM and like you know wind modem which
was horrible I find out later because I
couldn't use Linux for some things so
basically after that that's where I
really started to get into getting
online and finding like easy ins and all
that by accident I actually started by
getting like online on a well
like AOL came pre-installed with all
those computers that came out the time
so yeah every computer had like a wall
pre-installed so it was like eh whoa 2.5
which some people might argue is one of
the best versions of a well ever so you
know I get online and I'm just whatever
my family or what's a prison and I was
like isolated by myself and like I felt
alone you know everybody had access no
nobody in my family were able to you
know afford some internet for a while in
that timeframe that I was online I was
able to learn a couple of things you
know there was like these wearer's
channels these rooms we could just go
and download stuff and you know what are
the downloading spray right it's a
maneuver like wow this is so cool I
could download all this stuff on I don't
even know what most of this most of this
stuff is there like a download a copy of
you know the Anarchist Cookbook right
and inside there were some scenes some
freaking and UNIX articles alongside the
original Anarchist Cookbook
one of the articles which was inside the
file the zip file was um excuse me um
they had a copy of the hackers manifesto
by the mentor and you could say that's
what really changed my life you know
I've read this man's words you know and
on top of the top of it it says like the
hackers manifesto conscious of a hacker
1988 like you know today's firing
arrested you know like it was or two
days after that arrested and he goes
into the story right of what a hacker is
this is my world
it's my worlds the beauty of the ball
you know and it was really cool
I want aspects of event really attracted
you at that time well I mean looks I'm
in New York City I'm in the Lower East
Side we're talking about like I had to
live near in the Lower East Side New
York City in the 80s early to mid 90s I
dealt with a lot of racism from cops I
have some people but from cops so what I
really liked about this manifesto was
that he said well you know I don't judge
you but what you you know like what you
say what you look like right I don't
just what you
like and that right there won me over
I'm like alright so I've pretty sure
this guy's like a white dude in Texas or
something and you know he's basically
saying you know if your hacker doesn't
matter if you're you know you're black
you're you know Puerto Rican or whatever
it is that you are you know we're all
alike
and there was one line that I loved in
that and as always it always extolled me
and that was uh yes I'm a criminal my
crime is that of curiosity that was
awesome and then you know he ended it
with my crime is that of outsmarting you
something you never forgive me for that
boom that's it so now I'm here I am I'm
12 years old and I'm like wow what did I
just read yes
you know I saved it on my little desktop
and I went back to the a wall and there
was a time where I started hanging
around and certain private rooms one of
the rooms was like PR elites I'm talking
about PR leap back in the nineties mid
90s and there was a guy in there that
was like you know for you news and one
learn how to hack here's going to this
other private room then he asked one
question that's still relevant to this
day how do you bypass the firewall and
that's that got me thinking so now here
I am I'm totally new there 12 almost 13
I'm like how do i bypass the firewall
and as I learned later on in life one of
the best techniques of bypassing
firewalls in reverse shell why try to
infiltrate the the system directly and
this is relevant this what I'm telling
this little story why are you gonna try
to attack a system directly when you
have a system call you innocent had a
similar to wargames you know when Joshua
calls this guy back you know so and so
what was your first hack then based on
that my first hack was a kind of Ronnie
a German where insight
I don't know why this is in German where
his site down I just got access to the
FTP and I just did something stupid like
hey I did like the whole you know I
remember at that time what's a lot the
mid-90s with a lot like hackers for
girlies was out when they hack near of
times and so when you go to New York
Times comm you see like you know this
entire message but written in meat speak
right so it's pretty awesome so
obviously did the same thing I didn't
lead speak defacement and you know the
German is like fixed it and pretty
quickly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
