anonymous chat apps I'm Bridget Carey
and this is your cnet update right now
in social media it's a bit of a trend to
be anonymous apps that mask your
identity like whisper Yik yak and secret
are growing in popularity you could see
this as a rebellion against Facebook
where people don't want to use their
real names but Facebook itself has now
joined in on the trend and created a
separate app they let you chat
anonymously it's called rooms you create
discussion boards on any topic you can
dream up then you invite others to join
and this invite part is key to it makes
rooms different from other apps you
can't join a room unless you know the
invite code there is no search tool for
finding rooms you can keep it private
and only invite select people by sending
a text message or if you did want to
open it up to more random people you
could spread the link around online or
print it out and post the code in a
public place this invite code system
could be a solution to the problems
faced by other anonymous apps like Yik
yak which are being used for bullying
students or sending bomb threats but the
extra step of the invites could also
turn people away as a hassle the rooms
creator has the option to approve every
post or it can be a free-for-all and for
now rooms is only on the iPhone and
speaking of this anti-facebook movement
you remember ello it was the new social
network that had lots of buzz for not
having advertisements well ello is off
to a good start it raised 5.5 million
dollars in funding and the sites
founders say it has more than 1 million
users with 3 million more on the waiting
list to join in other news Apple's
newest iPads have arrived in stores but
if you want buy an Apple store and see a
line outside chances are those people
are not lining up for the iPad in New
York City people are still lining up
outside Apple stores for the new iPhones
seriously and has been a month since the
iphone 6 and 6 plus hit stores and
apples still dealing with huge demand
anyone who wanted a new iPad could just
walk in the store
was no wait there's just not much demand
for tablets these days but that means
companies are getting creative with
tablet promotions ATT is selling
Amazon's Kindle Fire HDX is a 7-inch
screen tablet that came out last year
and it costs one hundred and eighty
dollars but if you get it at 18 tea with
a data plan the price drops to one
hundred dollars you're also going to see
