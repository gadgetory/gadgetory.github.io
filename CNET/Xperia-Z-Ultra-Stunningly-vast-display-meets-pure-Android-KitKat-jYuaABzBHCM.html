right now we're taking a first look at
the Sony Xperia Z ultra Google Play
edition now before I dive into what this
smartphone can do i have to say man this
phone is massive with a capital massive
it is one serious slab of mobile machine
with its humongous 6.4 4-inch display
the Z ultra proves its moniker is no
mere marketing boast at least in the
physical size Department it's gigantic
footprint borders on the comical and
pushes the phone tablet hybrid category
to unheard-of dimensions frankly it
manages to dwarf other devices which
until just recently I thought of as
positively gargantuan that includes the
HTC One max Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and
even the once king of mobile girth the
samsung galaxy mega Sony though does its
best to minimize the impact of the z
ultra's dimensions the phone has an
extremely thin chassis which gives the
device a shockingly flat appearance this
coupled with the z ultra's glass
construction angular shape and dark
black colors helped the device achieve a
very sophisticated and elegant look the
major distinguishing feature of the
xperia z ultra Google Play edition
however is its software while not a true
Google Nexus device the phone runs a
squeaky clean version of Android 4.4
KitKat with all the bells and whistles
that go with it that includes a smarter
sharper looking interface google now
notifications and advanced search plus
access to the company's vast catalog of
digital content apps and services also
this device costs six hundred and forty
nine dollars and is sold directly
through the google play store in the
u.s. unlock the xperia z ultra Google
Play edition is also designed to support
gsm cellular networks and 4G LTE for
fast mobile data inside the z ultra's
components are the same as its global
predecessor just like it's more worldly
doppelg√§nger the xperia z ultra GPE is
powered by a state-of-the-art quad-core
snapdragon 800 processor paired with two
gigabytes of ram there are 16 gigabytes
of internal memory and a microSD card
slot for extra expansion
the only physical controls are on the
right side a silver circular power
button and trim volume bar also here is
a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack to meet
its water resistant rating the z ultra's
ports are all buttoned up under
protective flaps as well the handset can
survive submersion at a depth of 5 feet
for up to 30 minutes on the back is the
phone's main 8 megapixel camera and
flash be warned though like many of
Sony's current Xperia phones the Z ultra
smooth glossy surface is a grease and
fingerprint magnet I'm Brian Bennett for
cnet and you've just taken a first look
at the Sony Xperia Z ultra Google Play
edition be sure to check out our full
