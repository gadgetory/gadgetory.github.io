cool stuff but one of the coolest things
might be something that was actually
announced last year it is the Johnson
Controls glass thermostat are actually
glass by Johnson Controls it's a joint
partnership with Microsoft and Johnson
Controls to basically make the smartest
smart home thermostat that has ever
existed yes it costs 319 bucks but what
you don't know is that this thing has a
lot of built in tech as well as a crazy
cool see-through OLED screen that's
basically supposed to be seamlessly
integrated into your home so if you have
wallpaper or certain paint color behind
that won't actually get lost by the
design of the thermostat iself it's also
super sleek and modern looking I mean
I've never seen a glass screen on a
thermostat before ever so that's really
cool innovative but this thing also has
a built-in VOCs sensor so that's
volatile organic compound so to actually
pick up on internal air quality and give
you a report and trends over time and
hopefully ultimately also suggestions on
ways to improve your air quality inside
your home this thing also has integrated
Cortana so in addition to adjusting the
thermostat you can also use regular
Cortana commands do your calendar or ask
it to tell you a joke and basically
anything you want the glass thermostat
by Johnson Controls will go and
pre-order in March where it will cost
319 bucks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
