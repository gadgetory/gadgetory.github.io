TDK light fun records highly rated 833
Wireless weatherproof speaker which I
thought was an excellent value at $150
this new Trek's max 834 looks very
similar to the 833 and cost the same but
has slightly improved sound and adds a
few new features hi I'm David Carnot and
welcome to another CNET video review of
a portable Bluetooth speaker like the a
33 the first thing you notice about the
trek max is that when you pick it up
it's got some heft to it it weighs in at
2.7 pounds which makes it more of a
mid-sized wireless speaker than a true
mini bluetooth speaker if you're looking
for something really portable this isn't
it but the extra size at least in this
case means better sound well has a
pretty straight forward boxy design I
liked it it's got clean lines and the
buttons on the top of the unit are
nicely indented and clearly labeled with
LED lighting as I said this model has
some extra buttons on top and that's
really you'll notice the main difference
in the design between this and the older
model the speaker is equipped with 21.5
inch drivers plus a 2.5 inch subwoofer
on the front and two rear three-inch
passive radiators on the back its splash
proof has speakerphone capabilities and
its ports are covered by a removable
rubber door that keeps moisture and dust
out behind that rubber cover you'll find
an audio input for non bluetooth devices
a USB charging port for charging your
smartphone from the speaker's internal
battery a power on/off switch and a
12-volt DC in charging port alas like
some of these more powerful compact
speakers you have to charge unit with a
separate AC adapter and not with a
standard microUSB cable the older a 33
sounded very good for its size in price
class but I know that it fell down a
little bit with certain Tunes Welty DK's
engineers apparently read the review and
tweaked the sound for the better and now
doesn't distort on any of the tracks I
mentioned in my previous review which
doesn't seem like a coincidence well
broadly speaking this is a speaker that
plays very loudly for its size has some
nice punch to its base and offers a
reasonable amount
detail though it's trouble performance
isn't all that great overall it's a
fairly pleasant sounding speaker and it
fared better in our tests and many
speakers in this price range to trek max
isn't perfect but at half the price of
the Bose Soundlink Bluetooth speaker 3
it's arguably one of the best portable
Bluetooth speakers for the money
especially one you plan on using indoors
and outdoors I'm David karna and that's
the TDK life on record treks max
bluetooth speaker thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
