something just now three know where
those parts line up one SmartWatch
called the Galaxy watch active which I'm
wearing right now the Galaxy fit which
is a fitness van and the Galaxy buds
which are the use of earbuds that are
completely wireless so I'm going to go
through each one of them to tell you
what's new this is the new Samsung
Galaxy watch active this one is the rose
gold option it is aluminum instead of
stainless steel as previous models and
as you can see it's missing that
signature bezel that we had come to
almost expect in the galaxy watches
before it it's still pretty easy to
navigate but I do miss that clicking
rotating bezel which was just kind of
really satisfying to to control the
watch with it does seem to have a
smaller watch face than its predecessors
but I personally don't mind it if I put
it on the side over here you will notice
that it is pretty thick compared to
other watches but not any thicker than
previous Galaxy watches it still has
those two physical buttons on the side
and on the back over here you'll notice
it has that optical heart rate sensor
that the galaxy watches have had for a
while now and these interchangeable
watch strap these are 20 millimeters
which is slightly smaller than the
Galaxy watch ones so they won't be
compatible or backwards compatible if
you already have galaxy watch bands that
you'd like to try this one with the key
feature over here other than all the
different Fitness features that we found
on the Galaxy watch is the blood
pressure monitoring it's gonna launch
first in beta later on in March
obviously they didn't even mention it at
the keynote so I have the feeling that
it's not active at least on this demo
watch so the galaxy watch active
actually comes in four different colors
with silver that you're seeing here on
screen the rose gold which you also saw
as seeing green and a black so I want to
show you I am actually wearing the
galaxy watch on my wrist right now I
think I'm going to take it off and kind
of show you the differences run you
through some of the differences as you
can see it does look similar but is it
is a stripped down version of it it
doesn't have that rotating bezel over
here and it is quite a bit smaller
considering how thick these bezels are
on the actual screen itself it looks the
display looks smaller than on the Galaxy
watch it is thinner than the Galaxy
watch and it is quite a bit lighter as
well it feels lighter on my hands and I
have the feeling that for fitness it
would be much more comfortable to wear
on the wrist I'm going to put on the
Galaxy watch just to kind of feel it out
and I can already tell you it does feel
a lot more comfortable than the Galaxy
watch I'm not sure if which one I prefer
at this point in terms of looks but in
terms of the fit this one's more
comfortable for sure but the coolest
feature in my eyes that's available
right now is the ability to wirelessly
charge it using your Galaxy S 10 device
so what you do is you turn on the
wireless power share on the device you
turn it over and then you just place the
watch and throw it on the back of the
phone and there you have it wouldn't go
ahead and try on the Galaxy buds and
already they feel pretty comfortable in
my ear I do a lot of running with my ear
buds so
it's having them stay in place is
important and it really does feel like
they would hold up during during Iran
outdoors or on the treadmill they seem
pretty secure moving around yeah doesn't
seem to be a problem I don't know about
the sound quality because there there is
a lot of noise in this room and as I'm
tapping over here on the side it's
playing and pausing the music in the ear
so it does have some kind of controls
manual controls that you can do from the
earbuds themselves from the samson
fibers and then you could just take them
off and they can charge on the case they
do feel a lot lighter than the icon X I
can say that much and the case is really
sleek and slim and you can use your
phone to charge the case as well if you
need an extra charge on the go
you just have to activate the power
share like what you did with the Galaxy
watch and then place the device on the
back of the phone to wirelessly charge
them sadly no galaxy fit at least here
in the demo room today but I can't tell
you that it is a Fitness band with a lot
of the same Fitness features as the
Galaxy watch active so that automatic
workout detection that heartrate monitor
but it is a lot slimmer and it's kind of
more of a cuff it's kind of like the
previous Fitness fans from Samsung
before it it is going to have rubber
bands and
slimmer screen than the watches south of
course and less actual smart
functionalities because it's not running
that full Tizen SmartWatch operating
system so just to kind of wrap things up
over here we have the Galaxy watch
active which is kind of a sporty tape on
the Galaxy watch it now includes that
blood pressure monitoring which is new
to a wearable device from Samsung but we
won't actually see that in action until
later on in March and it's only coming
in beta at first and then we have the
Galaxy buds these wireless earbuds that
are charging in the case and that
compares seamlessly with other Samsung
devices now the Galaxy watch is going to
cost $200 which is significantly less
then the Galaxy watch was at launch and
it's very much in line with other
fitness devices like the Fitbit but a
lot cheaper than others like the Apple
watch whereas the galaxy buzz are going
to cost a hundred and thirty dollars to
put that in perspective they're actually
about twenty to thirty dollars cheaper
than Apple's air pods with a lot of the
same functionality and then the Galaxy
fit that's not coming until later in
second quarter of 2019 and that one will
be around $99 and that's it for today
but you can check back for all the
different Samsung products announced at
the unpacked event on Sina com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
