buzz report the show about the tech news
that everyone is talking about and yes
the buzz report has a new look it's a
work in progress and we're still trying
to make it perfect so please feel free
to send your feedback to buzz at cnet
com and thank you also this week iphone
for pre-order woes the best of e3 and
how to turn your phone into a vuvuzela
but at first it's the gadget of the week
the gadget of the week is the Nintendo
3ds unveiled this week at e3 it's the
first ever 3d portable gaming system and
it has a 3d display that doesn't require
glasses and if anything should stop you
from buying a big ol 3d TV just yet it's
that a couple more years people anyway
the 3ds it sounds like it'll have tons
of games and it also has two cameras
built in so you can use it to take 3d
photos of things oh no stop that nobody
at all will use it to take 3d pictures
of their junk that would just be
incredibly unlikely also from e3
microsoft pimped the motion-activated
controller formerly known as project
natal which is now connect and how
better to debut the name change then by
making everyone wear shiny white ponchos
and treating them to Cirque de Soleil
performers at a strange cult-like
evening press event because after that
flailing around like a dillhole to
control your game character is kind of a
step up I guess
and then there was Sony which debuted
what's being described as a pant
scrapping ly awesome look at Killzone 3
and 3d which is like a lot of killing in
your face Sony is also touting the
immersion aspect of the PlayStation Move
but is ignoring the fact that the
controller wand looks more like the
hitachi magic wand this thing is
fantastic press me on that and in the
other big buzz of the week the iphone 4
well the black iphone 4 not the white
one went up for pre-order on june
fifteenth here's one of the more
succinct headlines from tuesday apple
iphone for pre-ordering is a total
disaster yep that about covers it iphone
for pre-ordering was a meltdown of epic
proportion all the pre-order service
crashed sometimes there was just an
internal server error at the beginning
of the order other times you would get
to the very end of the process and then
it would crash some people got the wrong
order other people got charged multiple
times for one phone some people's orders
just got canceled completely some people
got confirmation emails containing other
people's credit card numbers and
shipping information stores we're using
pencils and paper to take orders and do
you know what caused all of that you
know what the fail point was in the
entire iphone for pre-order rollout AT&amp;amp;T
i am not joking all of that was due to
the pre-order system that was running on
AT&amp;amp;T is network18 T by the way said
Wednesday it was suspending pre-orders
because of unprecedented demand and
concern about inventory no mention of
the epic meltdown or anything
approaching apology yeah they've got
some balls also why are apple and AT&amp;amp;T
still together this is like the most
dysfunctional relationship I've ever
seen in my life break up and finally
it's time for a new segment hear the
buzz report called opportunity knocks
this is the segment where we highlight a
current trend and those clever
entrepreneurs who are all over that and
this week it's boo-boos ayla apps that's
right thanks to the World Cup mobile
apps that replicate the buzz of a
thousand plastic horns are the hot new
thing in the app store and the android
marketplace the most recent was added
like seven days ago and then apparently
vuvuzela 2010 is the number one free
iphone app in basically the entire world
with almost 1.5 million downloads that
is genius annoying annoying genius and
that's the buzz report for this week
everyone I'm Mollywood and thank you for
watching works wonders on sore legs sore
backs it's fun as a scalp massager
