laptop and comes with a bendy straw
style hinge as well as a detachable
tablet screen this surprising product
has generated a good deal of excitement
in its own right but it also gives us a
clue as to Microsoft's broader strategy
using hardware to rescue Windows when it
comes to computers Microsoft Windows
operating system totally dominates with
figures suggesting that its biggest
rival Apple's Mac OS 10 represents less
than 5% of the market those numbers
don't tell the whole story about how
precarious Microsoft's position really
is with most windows owners using
versions that are several editions
behind Microsoft needs devices that
showcase the potential of Windows 10 if
you look at the most exciting launches
of the last few years it's clear that
physical devices like smartphones and
wearables are what get the public's
pulse is pounding with the unfamiliar
and unpopular Windows 8 having left many
shoppers wary of upgrades Microsoft
knows its best chance to get back on
track is with a cool product people want
to own that page just happens to be
running Windows 10 Microsoft is playing
a risky game though when it first jumped
in to own brand tablets with the surface
back in 2012 it annoyed some of its
partners who make money selling Windows
powered hardware the surface book puts
Microsoft in the awkward position of
directly competing with some of its
closest allies so it'll have to tread
carefully three years in though
Microsoft's Hardware efforts don't feel
like a terrible mistake
apple recently mimics the standing
design of the surface tablets with its
smart keyboard for the iPad pro and the
surface book even if it doesn't prove
popular bolsters Microsoft's reputation
as a company that's doing its bit to
push laptops forward rather than just
pumping out software for the masses
which is important but not quite as
exciting the surface book goes on sale
soon so we don't have long to wait
before we know exactly how strong
Microsoft's Hardware game really is and
what the company's gadgets can do for
Windows stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
