frightens you the most about
self-driving cars and a new run at
technology to keep kids from being
forgotten it's time to check the 10 PC
cars differently we love them on the
road and under the hood but also check
the tech and are known for telling it
like it is ugly is included at no extra
cost the good the bad the bottom line
this is C net on cars
welcome to C net on cars the show all
about high tech cars and modern driving
I'm Brian Cooley well hot SUVs are a
real credible category these days and
Land Rovers just decided to get credible
within it not just with a fast new truck
but a whole fast new division behind it
let's learn about SVR and check the tech
you know you're in trouble when a new
model comes to market raving about its
lap time around the Nurburgring that
most enduring of irrelevance II is to
the average car buyer this one does
exactly that but also a lot more let's
drive this all-new 15 Land Rover
Sport SVR check the tech the key thing
to bear in mind about a Range Rover
Sport is that it's not the sport version
of a Range Rover a Range Rover Sport is
its own distinct model and it carries
some of the design cues from the Evoque
particularly what they call this
diminishing diello it's the side windows
that get narrower as you go to the back
of the card when car makers make a
hotter car they always give it a more
aggressive chin with bigger holes in it
to get air in different wheels you get
some lower body cladding here and out
back you got four exhaust pipes that are
very nicely chiseled and what they call
a splitter for airflow management down
the middle this is the first of a new
line of cars from land rover that are
kind of like BMW M if you will they come
from the special vehicle operation of
Land Rover but Ford already has a
trademark on SVO so their s vo is badge
SVR now Range Rover for that matter Land
Rover interiors I'm always struck me as
some of the most handsome it's a great
layout
Urgo is good handsomeness is everywhere
I could do without this two-tone stuff
you also notice we have pseudo sport
pseudo racing seats in both the front
row and in the back row because those
immovable headrests are always there it
can make it a little hard to put the
back seats down so that's a bit of a
sacrifice for sport pretension versus
practicality and as you can see the fold
flat is kind of pseudo flat this is not
optimized for cargo nor is there a third
row available and we've seen this head
unit before in jag Land Rover products
it's a unique interface to them one of
my biggest gripes is the slowness of its
touchscreen response and the fact that
you have to do voice input of navigation
destinations in little itty bitty pieces
two three five two three I mean just
compare how fast it is to tell your
phone to take you somewhere and to tell
this thing to do so ok Google Drive to
235 second Street San Francisco
California
my third gripe is how many screens
interrupt what you're seeing here I
can't say how many warning or
notification screens like God could just
blot out what's on the main screen that
I care about and even when I turn the
volume knob after a moment or two it
brings up a confirmation screen that I
don't need my ears tell me how loud it
is that just gets in the way of what I
care about
and again overlaying all of this is so
much lag and delay it's not measured in
seconds parts of seconds but that's not
okay in a car much brighter spot is up
here in the upper left in control apps
now here's where you get an apps
platform you can decide what you want on
which of these screens very much like
you do on your phone or your tablet and
it's all managed here through the jag in
control apps app on your phone that is
very much a projector app to get things
here up here but obviously not your
whole phone their own curated basket the
apps all come from this control panel on
your phone you've got some new ones that
are called out here like RTO and glimpse
are apparently recent you can add cynic
navigation if you don't like what Land
Rover's got as well as a few other apps
most of which aren't exactly globally
famous and then down here you can see
the ones I do have installed like Parker
pedia stitcher are do and this is where
you set up the layout of your apps on
the car these are flip through screens
on the vehicle I mock them up here first
and then they get pushed out to the car
now the cameras on this vehicle are
interesting you've got a variety of
views and settings parked right now I've
got the junction view I also have a curb
view that looks out to the sides off the
front wings I can set up new
combinations of cameras that you don't
see on any other car so they're very
camera centric on this vehicle
too bad that camera in the rear at least
is so awful but it's so bad I'm pretty
sure it's defective and I'm not gonna
knock it because nobody would ship a
camera with that bad registration of
colors and fuzziness into a production
car
now up here in the engine bay is some
fairly familiar jag Land Rover stuff a 5
liter supercharged v8 but because you
got an SVR badge on it it puts out more
550 horse that's 40 more than without
that bad 41 more pound-feet of torque
gets you up to 502 and of course it goes
up to an 8-speed automatic only but it's
a sport automatic with faster shifts and
that power is all four wheels either in
a trackage mode or in an off-road mode
depending where you have your terrain
response knob set this vehicles heavy 50
100 pounds despite the extensive use of
aluminum still gets up to 60 though and
four and a half seconds or better so
where do you give on the mpg of course
it's rated at only fourteen nineteen but
if you're buying a vehicle like this you
didn't buy it in a shootout between it
three you're the first thing that
impressed me as I got into this Range
Rover Sport SVR was not what it did when
it moved but what it did when it comes
to a stop this vehicle has the best auto
start/stop technology every it starts
the engine almost in the time it takes
to lift off the brake pedal that's very
nicely done and it helps you get the
most out of that pretty poor impeaching
the next thing you notice is definitely
about going
any major car maker right now
jag and Land Rover are obsessed with
obnoxious exhaust systems and they're
fun the power of course is for digis
this Sport Automatic as they say is
definitely tight it's quick
all in the fundamental takeaway I get
very this to one of the hot Cayennes or
an x5 m is it it's less severe and yet
it handles like a very capable car when
you press it though I imagine if I went
head to head it's not as sharp as those
two Germans okay let's price our Range
Rover Sport SVR this is not going to be
a cheap date as you can imagine all in
about 117 3 the way I would do it what
they've done here in this category is to
hit - I think more bases than their
competition it's also a very comfortable
daily driver not all the competitors are
they can be high-strung and it's got
serious off-road cred find our full
review on that Land Rover Range Rover
Sport SVR a whole mouthful awaiting you
at cars cnet.com well you know not
everybody is buying this vision of
self-driving cars now I happen to think
they're in for a surprise but it's
important to pay attention to their
reservations and the reasons that
underlie them that's of interest to the
smarter driver when CNET on cars
returned
we're used to driving we think we're
good at it
and we don't really trust computers
those three things are the main hurdles
that stand between a lot of people and
buying into the self-driving future the
autonomous car that's coming that's not
going to stop it from getting here but
along the way it will behoove regulators
car makers and just about all of us to
pay attention to those who maybe need to
be brought along a little more
researchers Michael sivak and Brandon
shut Lee at University of Michigan has
some early answers they surveyed 505
adult US drivers in June 2015 to take
their temp
on vehicle autonomy for attitudes
bubbled up autonomy itself the most
drivers especially women want no
self-driving followed by almost as many
who are open to partial self-driving and
under 16% interested in fully automated
cars at this point the biggest naysayers
to full automation where drivers 60 and
older just 11 percent of them liked the
idea a big problem for policy makers who
think autonomy is going to allow older
drivers to keep doing so safely longer
control we can't yet imagine the
steering wheel and pedals going away
over 96% of the drivers said keep those
century-old controls even if a car is
fully self-driving interestingly there
was little difference in this response
between age groups or gender interface
here an almost even split between those
who want to tell their self-driving car
where to take them by a voice command
versus via a touchscreen have these
folks tried automotive voice command
only 8% of drivers want to use their
phone for this task and a quaint 3%
thought a keyboard and mouse might work
best
finally notification for decades we're
going to have partial self-driving cars
that we'll need to hand it back to us on
occasion and clearly we don't want to be
surprised
over 59% of us want to be alerted via
sound and visuals and something
vibrating about a fifth said they can do
without the vibration part maybe they've
tried one of those Cadillacs that
already has an odd vibrating alert seat
so it all adds up to a reality check and
it will pay for car makers and
regulators to double check their
assumptions about our attitudes around
self-driving and some of the details of
how we expect it to work rather than
assume that we're all going to embrace
it in some homogenous fashion welcome
back to see net on cars coming to you
from our home at the Mount Tam Motor
Club just north of the Golden Gate
Bridge well all those years and all
those headlines and still there's no
homerun
technical solution to keep kids from
dying locked in hot cars
but even Flo thinks they might have a
way to crack the code on the road to the
future it's sort of odd if you think
about it your car alerts you when your
headlights are left on but not when your
kids are left in
a trickier problem to solve for of
course but also vastly more important
you know what a parent is no she's not
here oh my god
the feds tracked the problem of child
fatalities and locked hot cars but many
people actually follow the work of
meteorologist yon all of San Jose State
University in Silicon Valley he call
aids media reports and estimates that
between 1998 and 2009 494 children about
37 each year died locked in hot cars in
the u.s. more than half the kids who die
of hyperthermia in cars are 2 years old
or younger about half of them were left
in the car by accident by a forgetful
parent 9 come on where's your emergency
we just parked next to a car Walmart
Cadillac Escalade ok baby is been in the
carrier screaming and knowing around a
modern car is unfortunately a very
efficient calorimeter of sorts
it's seals and insulation are deadly
good at trapping solar energy the
majority of heating happens in the first
20 minutes or so cracking the windows
has almost no effect even flow has a new
set of their baby seats out with a
technology called sensor safe it's an
electronic sensing technology to warn
you you've got a child buckled in the
seat in the back especially a
rear-facing one which is another hazard
in and of itself out of sight out of
mind now an electronic sensing baby seat
is actually not anything new the
National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration looked at nearly two
dozen of these things back in 2012 and
decreed most of them junk let's see how
Evenflo seeks to break the mold
now up here in the front of the car you
do a one-time install of this dongle
that comes with the sensors safe seat as
you can tell by that in this is an obd2
port noggle this goes up underneath your
dash now once that's installed that
stays there you're not having to take
that in and out all the time it works on
any car with an obd2 port made since
2008 not since 1996 when obd2 first
arrived so you've got to have a later
car because that's when they implement
it what's called the can protocol an
electronic language that that dongle
relies on okay now here in the back of
the car you install the seat and of
course latch it in safely that's a whole
different topic get your child in here
and then this is the key this is the
little sensor safe clip this green thing
once you clip this across their chest
under armpits and around their legs that
locks in now you close the loop as soon
as you drive above five miles an hour
for more than a few seconds this thing
starts transmitting to the receiver we
just installed that there's a child in
here then the next time you stop and
turn off the engine you get a chime
instantly reminding you this is buckled
around your child in the back don't
forget them
a lot of experts like this approach
better than some of the previous
technologies which were proximity-based
where once you got far enough away from
the car or the seat you then got a
warning a lot of folks say no warn
parents immediately so there's no chance
of them getting far away and forgetting
now a few notes about this apparatus if
you're concerned about EMF or radiation
coming off this transmitter evenflo says
it's about the same power as a car
remote key fob which is pretty low power
and that it barely uses any time
transmitting about one second in two
hours of driving if you want to use this
as a hand-me-down which of course you do
the battery here is not replaceable but
you can get or buy another one from
Evenflo you just replace the whole clip
you'll buy it if it's after the first
year or so of the seat you get a new one
for free if it's before then if you have
more than one kid you're going to have
more than one seat well you can have
multiples of these that report into one
receiver under the dash it's not just a
one to one relationship and if you have
a hybrid or a car with automatic
start/stop technology that would stop
and perhaps throw this thing off you
need to get a separate special receiver
up there under the dash which Evenflo
will send you it's green instead of the
one we have which is black so electronic
sensing that warns you immediately when
you come to a stop some interesting
modern technology innovations for
today's cars that are hybrid and have
auto start/stop and it's from a major
maker at a major retailer Walmart's got
the exclusive on this for one year until
summer of 2016
goes for about a hundred and fifty bucks
now without the sensors safe tech looks
like you can get almost the exact same
seat for ninety dollars so you're
definitely paying a premium here but it
seems to be going down the right path
coming up your email evie our hybrid
which makes most sense for you if either
when CNET on cars continues
people are terrified of handmade sports
cars British or otherwise because they
have a reputation for breaking a lot
mean Lotus used to have the unfair
acronym of lots of trouble usually
serious and this car doesn't feel
particularly handmade I was I came in
expecting it to but actually it doesn't
everything feel something we built it's
a step up from where Lotus used to be

welcome back to see net on cars I'm
Brian coolie here's that part of the
show we take a few of your emails his
first ones coming in from Matt and he
says I'm a keen viewer of yours from
Australia on your program when you
display the car stats and specs on the
screen such as power and torque weight
or fuel economy would it be possible for
you to add the metric figures alongside
the Imperial or the American figure he
says it's difficult to make those
conversions on the fly while I'm talking
Matt I've had a lot of emails about this
topic and we've decided we're going to
make a change in how we present car
specs
let's run now we're going to do going
forward so now in the future starting
with our next episode of CNN on cars
will express horsepower also in
kilowatts which I know is going to make
you happy that's an Australian thing and
also in PS we're going to give you a
torque not just in pound-feet as we do
now we'll also have that in Newton
meters which is pretty much the global
standard everywhere else we're going to
get the weight to you in pounds and
kilograms that's an easy one in terms of
fuel economy this is interesting mpg in
the US gallons per hundred miles is also
a u.s. thing although most Americans
don't even know about it
and of course liters per 100 kilometers
is very much a global standard and
finally when it comes to acceleration
zero to sixty I'm going to stay with
zero to sixty miles per hour
zero to 100 kilometers an hour is so
close and there's no direct mathematical
conversion to really do that accurately
now I want to want to remember I'm
giving you converted numbers of US spec
cars not other market numbers expressed
in these unit
so just know I'm translating a u.s. car
to you not reflecting on other part of
the world market vehicle Paul in Houston
writes in says I was sitting in one of
our Houston traffic jams recently my
condolences I have been in a couple of
those and noticed that the cars around
me reminded me today's car design cues
are very very similar as if every cars
coming out of the same design studio in
particular he says vehicle phases all
have this narrow grille under the grille
and tend to have headlights in the same
place of the same shape and swept back
to a point aiming toward the side
mirrors secondly he asked what about the
fact that almost every car seems to have
a flat arch around the wheel well
openings on the fender he wants to know
if there's something going on some kind
of conspiracy or some reason these cars
have to look so similar let's take these
one by one Paul first of all let's take
a look at these fenders now he's talking
about this area right here this very
flat face car makers do this a lot today
because it creates a very smooth surface
for better aerodynamics they work very
hard to reduce turbulence all around the
wheel opening so that fender is part of
that as well as how they position the
face of the wheel flush to the outside
of the car and also how they design
those spokes to try and flow air over
them even as they're spinning all this
adds up primarily to mpg gains but it
also helps you in terms of noise and
maybe a little bit of top speed now in
terms of the face of these cars you're
talking about this grille down here at
the bottom let's look at that a little
more closely this was pretty rare in
cars a number of years ago now it's very
common as you say and that's because the
noses of cars have been pushed down a
lot sloped down and lowered that's again
for better aerodynamics but once you do
that everything in the engine Bank has
to move down too so now you get a lot of
radiators that are living low radiators
for your coolant for your air
conditioning and for your transmission
fluid as a result they need a real
opening to breathe air down here as
opposed to just having some sheetmetal
also in high-performance cars they'll
often punch a hole in these corners of
the lower chin to flow air in and cool
the brakes and a lot of high trim cars
that's where they'll put the fog lights
like you see on this Chevy in power so a
lot of things are going on
here largely as part of aerodynamics and
a fair amount of it is also fashion it's
kind of a gutsy aggressive look William
in Hong Kong writes in with a question
about electrified cars he says I'm in
the market for a new car should I get a
hybrid or go all the way to a pure evey
electric vehicle says he plans to use
the vehicle for the next ten years which
one he asks with a better choice for
reliability
I'll be honest William reliability is
not the first thing that comes to mind
and the choice that you're trying to
make I'm going to be more concerned
about driving behavior being appropriate
for these two forward technology
vehicles here's what you to think about
when you're looking at an e V this is
part of your checklist first of all
charging do you have access to a charger
and ideally a high current charger not a
household outlet that doesn't get you
very far
and what is the charge time for the evey
you're looking at secondly what is your
range your typical driving in a day
which you'd have to accomplish between
charges and that is going to be a
typical number you can't always predict
it thirdly what's the battery warranty
this is a huge expensive component of
any electric car you want to make sure
that manufacturer has got you covered
against eventual drain down and it
wearing out to the point that it's no
longer practical also take a look at
incentives I don't know what it's like
in the market where you are in Hong Kong
but incentives can take the form of
helping you with the purchase helping
you with the lease giving you some kind
of a rebate or giving you access to
lanes to get around traffic that regular
cars can't get into now if you're
looking at a hybrid car the list is
similar but a little different first of
all look at the payback hybrids tend to
cost more than their gas equivalents so
see how much more in typically thousands
of dollars and then work it out in
number of years to earn that back before
it even begins to put money in your
pocket then take a look at the type of
hybrid there are regular hybrids that
generate their own electricity
there are also plug-in hybrids if you
have one of those and don't drive a lot
of miles you could in theory use it as
an Eevee most of the time and only as a
gas-electric hybrid if you go on a
longer trip after that we get into some
very similar concerns about battery
warranty it's also a key component in
those cars and the same concern about
incentives my other issue is you're
looking to keep this car for 10 years
I'm pretty sure in
years an EEV or hybrid is going to be
ancient technology at least I hope so
because we need some improvements in
those as the market gets hungrier for
them thanks for watching I hope you
enjoyed this episode
keep those emails coming as you can see
there are a bigger and bigger part of
the show all the time I really
appreciate your thoughtful comments and
suggestions and let someone know about
the show if you haven't already on
social media and look for us on any of
your favorite streaming platforms or
channels we're probably there I'll see
you next time we check the tank
