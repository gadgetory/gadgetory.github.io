Oni Seagate bike a plus slash slim now
new because it's not to be confused with
the Oh buy cup plus sling that came out
last year and /li because well actually
that two drives the bike cup was slim
and the backup plus these two drive here
are basically the same with some minor
differences but first I talked about the
similarity they both are quite fast in
my testing with a sustained speed of
some 120 megabyte per second view speed
3.0 they both also work with HP 2.0 and
they both come with a standard USB cable
right here that use for both data and
power connection both of them come
included with the Seagate dashboard
backup software is very easy to use and
effective for home user and both include
a free two-year subscription for
Microsoft onedrive with 200 gigabyte on
I store space now count the difference
is that three of them if you notice here
the to drive the slim and the backup was
here they have the same high and same
width but if I lay them down the slim is
significantly shorter this is basically
the same as the difficulty meet my buddy
JT who is as tall as me but drink a lot
more beer
that said though this new drive here is
not that he was still quite compact okay
the second difference is the backup plus
slim here come in three capacity 500
gigabyte 1/2 by n 2 terabyte and the
backup plus come in one capacity of 4
tailback and in fact this one here is
the largest single volume turbo drive on
a market not to be confused with this C
get back a plus faster either came out
last year now the fast track also has 42
by but it doesn't come with one drive on
the inside but two like this on the
inside you can see a difference between
the two drive here the old logo and the
new logo and finally the last difference
is the Seagate backup plus 40 by here
comes only in black whereas the other
one the Seagate backup plus li as
four color options black silver blue and
red as you can see I have them all now
the good news is these drive you are
quite affordable costing between fifty
five dollars and close to two hundred
dollars depending on the capacity the
bad news is none of them here comes with
any security feature and that means
imagine if you have a two-tier buy or
even 4 terabyte of personal data and
then you lose a drive that can be a
headache which is why I put all of my
personal data on Facebook my safe just
kid don't do that now what you should do
however it check out my full review
Cellcom for more info on these drive and
then go get water maybe two to backup
your computer
immediately as it for me I would go and
get a few more computers because I have
all these drive here and nothing to buy
car really and that's because I'm dumb
well this has been the first look at the
backup + / slim drives from seeking</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
