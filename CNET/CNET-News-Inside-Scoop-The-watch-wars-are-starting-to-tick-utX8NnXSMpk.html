I'm cnet's Cara tsuboi joined by senior
writer Josh Lowensohn and today we're
talking about the category of
smartwatches last night Samson revealed
that they actually are working on a
SmartWatch product which is this is
crazy it kind of but they would reveal
so much right yeah I mean this is a
product that does not exist yet and they
say hey guess what we're working on one
yeah I guess what competition the other
funny thing is that it's 2013 and we're
talking about watches being cool again
how did this happen right who even wears
the watch oh that's kind of a watch
Nikes doing them that's why right
because the combination of a watch in a
fitness band which a lot of people are
doing yeah so the big rumor here is that
this would be possibly a companion
device something you'd have if you
already had a smartphone something that
could connect to the internet but
wouldn't need all that equipment on it
you know it uses your smartphone we've
already seen products like that from
companies like pebble obviously this
ties into products it ties into your
smartphone to use from that same data
and sync over data Samsung however has
built smartwatches in the past they
haven't been available here in the US
and they've been really expensive yeah
so these were six seven hundred dollar
devices in Europe released in 1999 in
2009 and those were really just kind of
like this weird amalgam of like a
SmartWatch and cell phone in one and it
didn't work because it was too expensive
it wasn't a great watch it wasn't a
great smartphone and it was too
expensive and people just didn't buy
them right so what do you think makes
something they can do it this time I
guess like what you said slimming it
down stripping it down a bit yeah and I
think Samsung's also learned a lot about
what people want I mean from their
products they kind of have this tendency
to throw out a lot of stuff and see what
sticks we saw that with the Galaxy Note
you know this is the first phone like in
recent years with a stylist it's really
done well you know like yeah like it's
kind of rebirth that idea that came from
the Palm Pilot so we can't talk about
watch wars without talking about some of
the apple rumors that Apple perhaps is
designing their own watch and these are
just rumors right yeah i mean the basic
idea is that there are hundred people
somewhere working at apple presumably
that some of the same folks that are
working on iOS and what we have on the
iPhone the iPad I'm creating some
wearable technology you know whether
it's a watch or some sort of armband you
know we're not really sure yet but the
whole idea is to really
and that ecosystem from mp3 players
tablets and smartphones I mean that
there's so much room for growth there
yeah at least that's what analysts think
they think there's like billions left to
spend oh all right we'll see watch work
just heating up thank you so much senior
