the USB implementers forum reminds
consumers that USB if' logos are
displayed on certified USB products so
the next time you're shopping for a
reliable USB charger cable or device
look for the logos get the whole story
at an abling USB org good morning on a
solid Jam coming at you live from the
scene at studios in New York City on BVG
this is the 359 podcast episode 445 and
today your hosts are Joanie Saltzman and
Roger Chang how's it going Brian Oh
doing ok I'm excited that we're talking
about phones today I am too because I
love phones I love all things mobile
we're gonna be talking about the
official review of the 9 Jessica told
Court as her final verdict after a
little bit more than a week of testing I
will also be talking about some of the
various t-mobile and carrier
announcements that were made yesterday
I've seen the stuff about customer
service but you know a lot of our
readers care about free stuff so free a
free year Pandora plus and access to
Live Nation tickets and shows will break
it down for you that's why I've Joan on
to talk about what this means and if
this is actually a big deal I don't know
as always if you have any questions
leave it in the comments section I don't
pick up the best and we get them in 3
minutes and 59 seconds kicking it off in
three two
welcome to the 359 I'm Roger Chang I'm
Joni salzman the official CNET review of
the galaxy note 9 is out and our own
Jessica dual court calls it one of the
year's best phone phones but she does
know it's on the pricey side and she
ultimately suggests you might hold off
and wait to check out the new iPhone or
pixel or even next year's Galaxy has ten
before making a call and that's largely
because it's not a lot of huge upgrades
in this phone I mean it's a bigger
battery some camera tricks and you get
the sense that Samsung's holding back
yeah yeah I mean just said that in her
review she had tons of fun it felt like
the most fun
that she's used but do you really want
to pay that much money just to have a
little more fun with your phone
especially when you don't know what it's
gonna be competing against we don't know
what we're gonna see from those it's
nice
I think it's gimmicky I know Samsung
insists that no users love their s-pen
but I had a note I loved my pen it's
like when you like go on to another
phone without a stylus you kind of
forget about it that's true so I don't
know for folks who are hardcore they're
probably already decided you know I said
this last week I think that that is the
dilemma like do you buy this upgrade
film which is arguably one of the best
if not the best Android phones out there
or do you wait for some of the bigger
innovations that are gonna come next
year yeah so next up I want to talk
about t-mobile I know the big uncarrier
event was all about customer service but
I want to skip ahead to the the more
music oriented announcements they
offered customers they will be offering
customers a free year of Pandora plus as
well as access to tickets to Live Nation
events I mean you come from music how
big a deal is it for these companies
well you actually probably have a good
vantage point of what it means for
t-mobile yes I imagine it for t-mobile
it's kind of like another thing in the
potpourri of free gimmies that they give
to their this is obviously this is
another thing for t-mobile Tuesday this
will come as a t-mobile Tuesday
promotion the penor plus thing later
this month and I mean as a as a t-mobile
customer I'm looking forward to checking
out who doesn't like free who doesn't
like free free stuff but for Pandora
it's definitely something that's I
wouldn't say it's critical but it's
definitely helped considering they're
facing such competition with Spotify and
other services you know they were the
biggest service for in the US for a
really long time until in the period
before subscription streaming really
started to hit its stride and right
what's that happen that's when Apple
music and spotify sort of solidified
their lead and and Pandora's had a hard
time catching up I mean I have to
imagine that kind of pressure really
kind of pushed these two to get together
a lot quicker yeah I imagine t-mobile
got some really good discounted rates
for this and I guess yeah they're
banking that
for the year the folks will just keep on
with pend or + or what they're probably
really making on is that those Pandora
plus users will upsell to pain to our
premium which is twice as much and you
get all it's basically like exactly like
all the other services where you get
total library all the skips play
on-demand all the offline listening
anything that you know adds obviously
and you get into their five dollars a
month out of those people alright so
lastly I was down in South Carolina to
check out the latest on Caravan it was
all about customer service it wasn't
about video which a lot of folks were
speculating it like a big over-the-top
video play you can check out some of the
footage from the the call center here
it's that's me walking through what's
what's known as a clap in its how they
introduce guests yeah it's like stroking
gauntlet yeah yes well seeing giant
posters in my face like that right like
that oh my god I did you that was ledger
ledger ledger holding a pile of Rogers
face yeah romance like a serious
bromance that I find I find the twist in
terms of it so it's not the most
exciting thing but that their their
pitch is that they're trying to get away
from BOTS more into dedicated teams that
are that sort of focused on you and your
service like they'll there's a team of
40 people tasked with specific regions
so when you call and you get the same 40
people and so it's an interesting idea
that's kind of like White Glove service
we'll see if it actually makes a
difference I know folks were a little
disappointed it wasn't about a video
that's later this year anyways
Morley story of ships on scene I'm Roger
Chang I'm Joanie Saltzman thanks for
listening
and thanks for the joining us as always
for the recording of the audio podcast
that concludes today's broadcast no I'm
kidding we're going to go ahead and pull
out some questions and comments about
uh-oh what's that phone called the
galaxy yeah let's just see how many
people I trigger in the chat with that
one anyways yes and in your questions
and comments will be happy to floor them
and yeah in the meantime it's okay so
the one thing that kind of struck me
about the the comments that we said from
Jessica's review it's like oh but if you
wait and see what the pixel does then
you wait till you see what Apple does
it's like you're just gonna be waiting
indefinitely and if we've waited for the
next model you like we'd still be
rolling with like the iPhone 3 well so I
think normally yes that is you know
that's a fairly astute observation but I
think the issue is we're looking at 2019
as a potentially big year for
innovations whether it's 5g whether it's
fingerprint sensors embedded in the
display foldable phones there are a
bunch of innovations things are supposed
to get smaller the chips are supposed to
get a lot faster next year there could
be a big leap and so I guess the fear is
if you buy something now you're gonna
miss out on the big innovation next year
if you if you buy next year yeah I feel
like you're you're somewhat future
proofing yourself a little bit better
than you are this year and really this
phone wasn't that different that's the
big issue it's like there's some some
tricks on the camera that are a little
better if you're upgrading from the
galaxy note 5 like a phone that's three
or four years old yeah this is gonna be
huge leap and it's fine but it's like if
your phone's a year to old this is
probably not a great upgrade for you
fair enough and then for everybody who's
kind of citing the price is a bit of a
turn-off like they're all just getting
too expensive okay so well the thing is
they are leading into this Samsung was
like oh yeah we were like they kind of
knows that price was an issue they were
they were kind of hinting that this
would be
more reasonable and and how they've
justified that is through packing in
more memory more storage yeah so like a
we give you more for your money but
still a thousand dollars that's a lot of
money for a phone that isn't
dramatically different from last year's
and and I know folks in the comments of
the world the iPhone 10 is a thousand
dollars and you guys don't reckon we
didn't rag on iPhone
10 for that price they're super
expensive but that phone was also
significantly different from the
previous models and so there was at
least some justification for that huge
price and yeah I'm not found the fact
that we're all paying a thousand dollars
for a phone it's not really even a
thousand like if we want the maximum
storage it's more like 1100 1200 dollars
for these things right
yeah but the note does have what it was
like 500 plus gigabytes of storage
yes yeah yeah the 1250 model has 512
gigs of storage I'm sorry and then it
has annexed you to get a 5 and 12 gig
memory card so you have one one terabyte
phone which is insane but given how many
photos my wife takes of our kid I know
who actually will fill up in a month so
we have to floor a medic question before
we move any form of any further forward
for the for the newbie in the chat Ken
what's up dude thanks for joining us is
a stupid question why is it called the
359 if it's livestream in nineteen
Central Time does it last almost four
hours only once and never again will we
ever do that right its 359 because
essentially the idea is we're gonna give
the best headlines in 3 minutes and 59
seconds for some arbitrary management
reason today it was like we did not use
and we didn't name it for but then after
that we chitchat so clearly we've gone a
lot longer than three minutes
the idea is that's in 59 seconds you can
leave because you've gotten all the good
stuff got it so that ah that's good
Roger Joan that's my elevator music good
stuff no I guess that's the fluff we can
ignore all right let's stick like the
note 9 because everybody wants to Ahmed
asks is it worth it if I've got the s8
plus and I think a lot of what our
takeaway has been so far
if you're jumping a full number it's
worth it in like the lineup if you have
something concurrent you may me wish you
watch I would I would disagree si plus I
mean it's a larger phone it's got well
it doesn't have the weight does it have
the dual camera that was last year's oh
no this year was the first year with a
dual camera yeah I mean yeah it was like
that was last year's model and I would
actually say generally no but I mean the
camera is a significant upgrade from
last year's model in fact it's a dual
lens camera versus a single lens if you
don't care about that you don't care
about photos as much and most people do
I don't think it's worth upgrading cuz
that was last year's model and you're
not getting them that much of a
significant pickup in performance or in
in any kind of bells and whistles you'd
find in a new phone so as with any major
fiscal investment you have to weigh your
priorities that was very practical and
reasonable sounding bright I was I was
evaluating your response because you
were practical and intelligent first so
photo nuts
no.9 anybody else maybe yeah yeah that
fair assessment well no yes if you're if
you're a camera person and you don't
have an S 9 so everyone else yeah yes as
long as you have an S 9 and you were
like crazy and upgrading after a few
months so yeah a side bar from Timothy
do when are we going back to dumb phones
these prices are too much nowadays well
I have a no phone on my desk if you want
it's really just a it's a black slab of
plastic 3d printed plastic it doesn't
actually make any calls it really
doesn't amaura it's no phone camera oh
it might have the selfie mode because
it's got like a reflective surface on it
look at yourself
I mean I think well my dad had a dumb
phone up until like two years ago but
even he gave it up and he's he's got an
iPhone now so I mean the days of dumb
phones are kind of over whether we like
it or not
yeah like we can't even get those retro
Nokia phones in the US that's that's
what it's really kind of disappointing
me I was thinking to myself like wow
like just kind of going back in my brain
I'm
surprise that no one's got the 3310 here
in this office she was like oh wait we
can't yeah doesn't work it doesn't work
in the band's here yeah and I remember
talking to some of the hmd global folks
the startup that makes Nokia phones you
know they kind of envisioned that 3310
as a like a weekend of ice a vacation
device you switch your SIM card you put
it in there and no one can reach you I
mean it's really just for phone calls
but I mean realistically speaking I like
I couldn't do it like I need to be
reached I need to be reachable
so yeah it's hard let's talk about the
micro SD card we brought this up before
have we found anything more about
whether you can install apps on the
expandable media on the note 9 just to
know like how much you're kind of stuck
with if that internal storage which is
beefy enough really um if that internal
storage is where you have to lock in all
of your functionality or if you can
expand that too or if that was strictly
for media uh let me get back to you on
that one I can ask Jess she'll probably
know but she's not here in this office
right now but I won't get back to you
I'm trying to skim through her article
right now to find out myself
this show really needs to have like the
entire staff of Sina on call it maybe
she's awake it's 8:30
okay and you know what while you're at
it shown would you ask her how okay the
first question was questions from
podcast jazz okay the first question was
is the expandable microSD can you load
apps on that or strictly for media
storage okay and secondly how is the
battery been so far I think I can find
this oh yeah you know water is in the
review I've got that interview let's
bring up the stats right here a 9.0
overall shining above all else is the
battery at a solid tent so Bravo I mean
look it's four thousand milliamp hours
that's that's huge so that's a 21
percent increase from last year and it's
why the phone is a little bit thicker
than it was last year so going against
the trend of thinner phones for the sake
of battery that's I like that we should
more phone makers should do that or
battery more battery yes
let's go ahead and take a question from
syringe Oh who always is loaded with
good information
now that Samsung is open the S Pen to
developers are we excited to see some
nifty tricks coming to the apps to be
implemented on the S Pen yes I don't
even know what those tricks would look
like but you know yeah that's totally
the fun of it I mean that the early
demonstrations were pretty cool right
being able to control your music
remotely being able to use it as a
remote camera Roger let's dream together
okay let's do it let's do it
you see what apps do I play with or do I
use constantly mm-hmm Spotify I do well
I guess I mean controlling music would
be nice I guess I don't know they keep
using the PowerPoint presentation
example but I'm like I never use my
phone as a as a platform for a
PowerPoint presentation so when you're
giving your TED talk I said it before
and I'll say it again
mine would be just a quick launch to
play hollow notes on Spotify just that
yeah that is well that would be for a
convenience key right not just the s-pen
like if you had a physical button on
your phone that you could do anything
with that it would be four whole notes
right yeah yeah every button on my phone
would play Halla notes I love it
here's another good question from Storm
King I still have the note 5 are we
expecting great changes for the note 10
trying to decide if you should wait on
the 9 or not yeah I think you're the
perfect example of someone who is in
that dilemma because by normal logic you
should be upgrading like it would be
this phone if you buy it would be a huge
upgrade for you would be a much better
experience longer-lasting phone much
faster get a lot of value out of but yet
the I mean the thinking is that by the
time the note 10 rolls around 5g is
getting prevalent and it's hard to say
how 5 G's gonna look it's gonna be
optimized for different networks and I'm
not sure if you're based in the US
although if you're named storm cam soon
you're somewhat local to here 5g will be
around for certain carriers I believe
t-mobile said New York will actually get
it sometime next year early next year
actually so you have to imagine that by
the time the second half rolls are
around and the note 10 is out there 5g
should should be probably the hallmark
feature for the next phone so that's the
thing like do you want to if you buy now
you're gonna have that phone in the next
few years you might skip out on so that
that 5g revolution but I mean either
it's it's a tough decision I can't make
women make it for you but it's
definitely a pickle there Alex Mitchell
had a great suggestion for the s-pen
triple click to start voice notes I
think that's a great idea I think you
could also probably apply that to a
voice or at voice-to-text
yeah oh yeah Andy what did they put a
microphone right in the S Pen you could
just speak into it like that skinny mic
like it could be a karaoke mic Oh
karaoke phone I mean fortunately no mic
that's that's good
we should tell that to Samsung and then
like who should we should just sell to
sans let's just start our own
development here yeah let's work on it
speaking that APEC wants to know how
long before third-party developers can
get access to be able to use the s-pen
for different features is this gonna be
at launch or postpone for a little while
hey we're a little cagey on the exact
time and they just said that it will
happen I believe it's gonna happen like
in the next month or so but I'm not
entirely sure I know they had their
developer conference and I wanna say
October at that point she definitely out
and when do we think when is he s ten
kind of slated for announcement is that
gonna be in February traditionally it's
February early March
devil's advocate mike shaw desks does
the note nine still have the annoying
Bigsby button if so can it be repurposed
yeah we had this discussion the other
day yes there is a dedicated Big C
button and no you can't change it it can
only call it Bixby we all hate that I
know everyone's in agreement
Samsung no but you're gonna love Bixby
Bixby's awesome no good Halla notes I'd
probably make it
I'll be an email trigger button yes hmm
but yeah all I can think of is Bixby
sorry all I can think of is the Simpsons
meme and Samsung is officially Principal
Skinner versus am I out of touch no it's
the children who are wrong that's all
this brings to mind with the whole big
speak conversation before we go we are
just about out of time
one quick question about Pandora Joseph
asks is the free Pandora Plus
subscription only for new penned or
email accounts or will it also apply to
existing Pandora accounts who don't
subscribe to the no ads service I am not
entirely sure how it's gonna get rolled
out its I believe if you're not if
you're not
is there a grandfather clause
essentially well if you're not a Pandora
Plus user now I think you'll be able to
get access to it I don't know what
happens with existing customers imagine
existing customers can request to have
it switched over to like I'm just I'd be
surprised if Oh
existing like free customers I don't
know what oh if you're saying an
existing Pandora Plus oh yeah if you're
already paying more and you're a
t-mobile subscriber I can't I'd be very
surprised if like they're like sorry you
got to keep paying timo that's true
probably right yeah again this gets
rolled out at the end of the month so
we're not sure how it's gonna work yet
it'll be through your t-mobile Tuesday
app but yeah I imagine if you're paying
for it now you probably get a break once
once it's a rule drive
yeah yeah that's how that's what happens
Netflix right if you already Netflix
subscriber I think they just like
knocked off ten bucks from your bill or
something that would make a lot of sense
we want to pivot back into note 9 real
quick specifically yes pen one more time
from APEC will we see third-party S
pen's being made or could you see
accessories being made to add to
features to the s-pen like a joy con
that's a cool idea
oh wow that's actually a great idea I
don't know well I know for sure that
they're I don't think they're gonna be
making a third party S pen's that thing
is kind of built specifically for the
the known I think Samsung's got a lot
proprietary stuff around it so I've know
not that that lock down but in terms of
third-party accessories to pair with the
s-pen which is kind of funny because
it's S Pen is
self is sort of a an accessory to the no
nine so you're buying accessories to
accessories I mean yeah the doors open I
don't like I don't know how big of a
market that is because I don't know how
many note users are out there we had
their estimates out there but it's
obviously a fraction of like the S
market that's for the market so I I
don't know what the appetite is for
those those kinds of third-party
accessories i imagine given like yes DK
and how open there you can theoretically
build one it just I don't know if I
don't buy it maybe a Nintendo lab Oh
could like get in and go some sort of
like foldable accessory thing that you
stick an S Pen into ooh
Samsung Nintendo team up I'm into it
yeah so before we go there is a pressing
question in the chat from our friends
friend Roy Roger how many spells have
you learned spells my scar there we go
oh yeah there it is
but it's not a lightning bolt I don't
know Alfred I made that joke yesterday
so watch out for a dark wizard that's my
favorite part is that the only guy you
need to jump right in baby I know I know
that only took him five seconds to do
yeah I think Alfred's missed his calling
he's not a reporter he's a graphic
designer
oh don't don't don't even suggest that I
get all cranky on you alright fantastic
conversation is always today folks
