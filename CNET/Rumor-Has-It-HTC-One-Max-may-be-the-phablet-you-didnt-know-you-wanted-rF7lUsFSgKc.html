has it the show that rounds up the
week's biggest tech rumors and you can
vote on what you think about the rumors
too in the interactive player if you're
watching on cnet now today is all about
phones but noticeably lacking from the
hype this week the iphone imagine that
let's get started first up Japanese tech
site RB men discovered a PDF manual on
samsung's website showcasing a device
it's calling the galaxy folder so it
looks like a standard flip phone from
the front but it actually comes with a
dual sided touchscreen and it would
allow you to control it on both sides it
would be a flip phone smartphone hybrid
other than that this seems to be a
pretty mid-range device a 3.7 inch
AMOLED display with an 800 x 400 pixel
resolution screen it'll also run a
dual-core Snapdragon 400 processor and
it would support 4G LTE and of course
it'd be running Android flip phones such
as this one or nothing new to Samsung
though it's been selling devices with
similar form factors in China for years
could this phone possibly make it to the
US I say welcome back e flip phones of
your look I dig my iPhone and all but
you know what i really loved my moto
razr from 2006 there's something really
satisfying about the sound made by
flipping your phone closed speaking of
phones less than a month after rumors
began circulating that HTC was building
a phablet to take on Samsung's Galaxy
Note series images of the purported
device have popped up on the
taiwan-based be priced website we talked
about a similar rumor last year and the
result was the HTC One back then we owed
and odd and laughed about the huge
5-inch screen now if this new rumor pans
out that screen is about to get a whole
lot bigger eprice hints that the HTC One
max as it's known will sport a 5.9 inch
full 1080p screen a two point three
gigahertz Snapdragon 800 processor 2
gigs of ram and
16 gigs of storage according to German
mobile site mobile geeks the one max is
expected to be released next month I
think I'm actually changing my mind
about screen sizes HTC has the one the
one mini and now the max give the people
what they want and if they want a huge
tablet size phone that they need two
hands to use more power to them what do
you guys think will the HTC One max take
on the Galaxy Note what do you think of
phones with 5.9 inch screens don't
forget to vote and leave a comment and
I'll ask the scene at council what it
thinks the cnet council is composed of
five editors who cast their votes
anonymously their opinions are not an
endorsement by Cena or CBS interactive
obviously because these are rumors folks
and the cnet councils verdict is yes all
five editors think that HTC is probably
working on a phablet one editor said
definitely maybe so he's no help at all
that's our show everybody please share
your rumours that rumor has it at cnet
com or call us at 1 800 750 cnet and
tweet us and tune in next week for more
tech rumors
