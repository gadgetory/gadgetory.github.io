my hand right now these are a pair of
apples air pods that are wireless here
but headsets and I've had them for about
four days now but what I really wanted
to do is talk to you about them there's
things that are good about them there's
things that I wish they could improve
but this is kind of my overall take for
you guys to really grasp what makes
these good and bad so first of all the
look I've been hating on them from the
start and I'm not gonna keep on piling
onto them they're the look isn't for me
but it doesn't mean that you know the
way that these look isn't for you right
they have this long stem when you put
them in your ear it can't look like a
q-tip or you know tampon or something
like that but again if you like how
these look you're gonna just like them
and also once you put them in their ears
they're really light you don't see how
you look with them so I know there's
gonna be a lot of people that don't care
so maybe you will like how these work
out now one of the things about this
that is good is the fit if you wear the
ear pods the wired headphones that come
free with your iPhone from before these
are gonna fit pretty much just the same
I think the biggest advantage is that
there are a lot lighter you don't have
the weight of the cables kind of pulling
down on you and I even did something I
bought one of those third-party wires
just to kind of make these look a little
better that just connects them from side
to side and I shook my head all over the
place in fact when you wear them with a
wire they'll pop out of yours but if you
don't they're going to actually stay in
your ears and then another big part
about this is how do they actually sound
now I tested it with five different
genres of music I did like EDM classical
hip hop rock and I was listening to kind
of I mean like a podcast but what makes
these different they're just slightly
they're slightly better sounding they're
a little fuller but if you're in a
crowded area you're walking around on
the street or you have any background
noise you're really not going to be able
to tell but if you're in a really dead
silent area like I was when I tested
these out you're going to hear a slight
slight difference so there's nothing
like game changing the best part about
this is really syncing them to your
phone it has this w1 chip that works in
partnership with Bluetooth literally
when I first pop open this case a panel
shows up on my phone it lets me know
that it's there I can sync them
instantly I was really smooth and then
because it syncs your iCloud account
then other devices like your laptop or
your iPad can then use these as well
just with syncing it that first time
with your iPhone so that was pretty
sweet
but after using these for the past few
I really wanted to talk about what
applicant do to make these even better
than the first thing is functionality
now people really aren't talking about
this when you double tap the air pods
you can either use it for Siri
or you can use it to pause and play
tracks but you can't do both things
people are missing out on this you
actually have to go into the settings
and pick either a double tap for Siri or
double tap to pause and play your tracks
you can't do anything like volume
control you can't do anything like
changing the tracks those things have to
be done directly on your phone so when
you're using these you're actually
losing a lot of functionality alright
the next thing is the tap controls now
really if Apple wants to take this to
the next level they need to add touch
controls and what do I mean by that well
whenever you double tap for Siri you
actually have to tap on it pretty hard
they told me oh you'll get used to the
pressure but still after three four days
when I double tap it's like pushing it
into my ear I don't like how that feels
so if they added touch controls think of
this using that kind of stem on the air
pod to change the volume up and down
maybe on the other side use it to switch
the tracks up and down and then maybe
just touching the top part of it to prom
Siri on one side touching the top side
on the other part just a pause and play
if they added that type of functionality
made it the same that you're getting
from the wired ear pods that will help
take these to the next level as well and
the third thing is syncing these we
already talked about how great it is but
they they have another ways to go for
example when I sync these to my iPhone I
can also use them with my laptop our
iPad but it looks different the
interface that you use looks different
on each device you have to go into the
music player change it if you're on your
iPad on your macbook you have to go up
to the top of the menu bar select the
air pods again they show up there but
the way that you sync them to the
different devices it changes depending
on what device you use Apple can make it
a lot more cohesive look the same and I
just hope they put up something like a
panel that shows which devices are
within proximity you just click one and
you're good to go so although the
syncing is quick and really nice they
can do even better than that overall the
air pods are really nice I think if
you're someone the Apple ecosystem
that's been looking forward to them
you're not gonna be disappointed but for
someone like me look they cost 159 there
I like them but I wouldn't put money
down for them maybe if someone like got
them for me
yes you know uh-huh I see you then
then I'd be all about it but really
these have a ways to go and they're only
gonna get better and I'm kind of really
more curious to see what they do in the
second generation but there you have it
come on my overall take on the Apple
earpods
and what they could do to make them even
better</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
