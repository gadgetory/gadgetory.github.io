first five a funny bone store devised
formula C the five big Thunderball now
the five buddy means you can have a
massive mass storage and the Thunderbolt
means that it can offer very fast
performance and in fact in my testing
this is one of the fastest storage
device on the market the five big here
is not the first that come with many
drive-bys however this package is all
sick right here
good thing I'm strong actually come with
not five but six drive bay but there are
major difference between the two of them
the are sig here is actually a hardware
raid device and by itself offer all
tiebreaker configuration including raid
5 the lucida here on the other hand it
is more like an enclosure box meaning by
itself is offer no read at all it does
provide rate 0 or read 1 when working
with Mac OS however now what the benefit
of not having raid 5 the cost the are
sick up here costs $2,200 and offer only
12 10 by up storage space the let's see
cost is the same but offered 20 turbine
in my opinion that is pretty good
trade-off now the five big come inland
sea signature design which is the
cubical shape with this big blue rail
ball here in front as the power status
if you're wondering why has to be in
this big this rail and this blue you are
not alone my guess is that because let's
see is a French company c'est la vie on
the back the device come with two
Thunderbolt ports and a power on/off
suits right here this suite is kind of
redundant because the drive actually
share the power starts with the mic is
connected to for example you cannot turn
it on without plugging in to the Mac and
when plugged in you would go off if the
Mac is off and go back to on if the Mac
is turned on above the port of the fire
driveway if I become preloaded with five
hard drive but it can easily change them
using a coin right here to unlock the
tray from the bay not how the two tray
over here actually
we come with darker color than the other
three and that's because let's see
suggest that the big file should be used
in two separate volume one in red zero
for fast access and the other two in red
one for data security it's like having
two separate device into one box it's
kind of cool and in my testing that dual
rate setup worked out pretty well
now the 5ik also comes with a 10 to
write version that cost $1,200 that is
good enough for most user me personally
though I would take this 22 by in a
heartbeat and that's because I'm dumb no
and this has been the first look at the
five big thunderbolt formulas see make
sure you check out the full video comm
for more information and if you have a
question which a lot of you do send them
over to me via Facebook or Twitter see
you there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
