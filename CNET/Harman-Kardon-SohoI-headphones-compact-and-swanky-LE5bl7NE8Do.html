Harman Kardon so oh I headphones this is
it on your model and it is a smallish on
your model and that I stands for iPhone
so this is an iPhone friendly headphone
it does have an integrated remote with a
microphone so you can make cell phone
calls with it like Harman Kardon other
headphone models this does have square
ear cups and this has kind of a retro
designed to it it's very sturdy build
that headphones do fold up and they are
pretty comfortable to wear they're
relatively lightweight I would say the
headband is slightly smaller I wouldn't
call them the most secure headphones on
your head but they are comfortable and
they're good for someone who doesn't
want to carry around a large headphone
and have big headphones sticking off
their head their sound isn't quite as
good as some of hardened cartons other
headphones these have a nice
well-balanced sound pretty good detail
pretty decent bass but they're not quite
up to the level or refinement of some of
the the bigger headphones that Harman
Kardon makes and these really don't
necessarily sound like $200 headphones
they're more like a hundred and twenty
dollar headphones so you just don't get
the premium sound from these headphones
but it's pretty good sound Harman Kardon
has been a little bit influenced by
Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins these are a little bit
similar to the Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins p3
headphones those also cost $200 there
are same in the sense that these do have
removable ear pads other adhere
magnetically and you can access the cord
and actually detach the cord from the
inside of the headphone I do think these
sounds slightly better than the p3s they
offer a slightly more clarity
the only other gripe I had about these
headphones is the carrying case that
come with is it kind of hard
clamshell design it can shut on your
fingers and it's a little bit of a pain
to put the headphones in and wrap the
cords up and it's just not the best case
I would rather seen a softer case
because these are a small headphones and
they would be much better served being
any smaller case that's easier to handle
aside from that I did like their styling
I did like the comfort level and I did
like their sound though I do think
Harman Kardon other headphones sound
better I'm David Carr noise
and those are the Harman Kardon so I
headphones thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
