information is likely in the hands of
hackers yahoo reports that a security
breach compromised the login information
for at least a half a billion users
among the stolen information includes
names email addresses telephone numbers
birthdays and in some cases unencrypted
security questions and answers if you
have not changed your password since
2014 now would be a good time to do so
Yahoo is prompting affected accounts to
change their passwords and those old
security questions and answers no longer
will work to retrieve your account
because they were part of the data
breach but even if you changed your
password you still have to worry about
identity theft with birthday phone
number and security answers out there
and it could also be used to access
other accounts on other services so who
is responsible yahoo says it was done by
someone paid by a government agency
although which government isn't said and
it's always hard to really be sure in
these kinds of incidents the hack was
first revealed in August but it's only
now after a two-month investigation that
we're learning how many accounts were
affected I'm Bridget Carey you can keep
