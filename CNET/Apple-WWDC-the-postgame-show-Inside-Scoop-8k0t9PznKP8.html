we just got done with the WWDC keynote
all about software Scott what do you
think was kind of some of the big news
today so I think Apple watch that they
let off with was pretty interesting
because that product needs some fixing
and they immediately address speed so
they were talking about the ways in
which Apple watch can run things faster
run in the background and have activity
functions that are a little smarter
social stuff so and they also change
while the buttons are assigned on it so
if they all do different things they
bring up different types of apps so it
looks like they're kind of reinventing
that yeah well I think they're trying to
make it more familiar to what your
iphone does you'd like the control
center and you know the things you can
swipe just on you know the iphone and we
saw Apple pay coming to the mac now
that's a pretty big deal okay it's kind
of funny you still have to use your
iphone or your Apple watch to
authenticate it right until such ID ends
up on a Mac in the fall probably on all
of them yeah but yeah you can you could
use your Apple watch to unlock your Mac
you could use your iPhone to use your
thumbprint interesting to see how that
works I feel like that's easy if you
have a lot of Apple devices another
really big thing they change those
messages really making it more
interactive lots of emojis what were
they doing here well look like they're
trying to make it more dynamic so you
could send like you just had a message
with a slam and after he gets anyway the
gentle Club whisper like I'm sorry I
miss you it sounds like a new way to
screw up your messages and be ruined the
protocol and there's that there's a
whole bunch of stickers third party
stickers or maybe disappearing messages
disappearing messages to me payments
yeah so they're trying to expand that
but some of that has been around in
others by it's nice to see it arriving
messages Mac OS no longer OS 10 you know
this is the 10th year of iOS so they
talked about 10 big changes that they're
making with it and a lot of notification
changes yeah they have a now and
intelligently waking up screens so it's
kind of like you know androids heads for
a little while where you pick it up and
an ambien
what messages are and a 3d touch so you
could click and do more like widgets I
mean it seems like a lot of what they
were doing catches up to kind of like
Google and Facebook in some ways there
wasn't anything necessarily that I
thought that was really earth-shattering
was there anything just really stood out
to you know I mean one thing I have a
question about is the more they open up
all these different services and
interconnected parts will they all play
well together you know if Siri opens up
to all these different apps on a listed
a ton of third-party apps in your car
and and search and driving and music how
do you how do you summon that yeah
exactly i mean you have to say like oh
play Taylor Swift and Spotify right
specific do you have a car eventually
it's just like I might as well just pull
up the phone and just click buttons
instead of actually talking to Siri I
think the one the best things actually
was was the home kit element finally
they're getting a home app the way to
connect your smart home in an
intelligent way that's easier I think
it's still pretty needed for a lot of
people who are looking at it yeah this
is the first time they've had you know
those four different operating systems
you know they have the launch TV iOS for
iphone and ipad and then they have for
the mac and you know this is the first
time they've really had all of those and
they're trying to get all these
developers to make apps for everything
which is a lot a lot to ask the magic
term of the show is differentiated
privacy just like the one you want to go
home and read about a big deal out of
the importance of that you know
sometimes just a bit of jargon that I
was pops up at these shows that feel
like that's like that was that moment
and yeah how well they also talked about
machine learning and and and and deep
learning which you're hearing talking
about a lot of conferences to understand
photos and objects they said that was
done on device that's interesting
because most other services right now
we're thinking about another class we
believe me an apple is very much on this
on device philosopher 85 and obviously
all of this stuff is coming for
developers today there's also gonna be
public beta for these in July but for
the rest of us will have to wait until
this fall again I'm Shara Tipton with
Cena with Scott sign thanks for joining
us
