the thought of this may give you
nightmares
Samsung has raised the bar and design
with its new flagship phone slight metal
frame curved glass on either side and an
edge to edge screen that'll make you
swoon except unlike the previous s7 the
curves are not optional this time and
while they are beautiful all that glass
could make the phone more fragile both
sides are made with the strongest
Gorilla Glass 5 so in theory it should
be tougher to crack than the s7 edge
with Gorilla Glass 4 but is the s8 tough
enough to survive these everyday
accidents whether you're pulling your
phone out of your pocket for directions
or slipping it back into your purse you
probably had a scare like this one so
for our first test we'll be dropping it
from roughly hip height onto the
sidewalk
looks like it landed on the middle
border so I'm hopeful but let's take a
look you guys can see it first oh we
have the first crack on the back it's
very very slight but no other visible
damage just where it sustained the
biggest hit it sustained enough damage
to make you cry if you just bought this
beautiful new phone but the screen is
still intact
so we're going to continue with our next
test and go take some photos plus your
two selfie sticks you'll probably be
taking most of your pictures at around
eye level and if your phone is as smooth
as the s8 keeping a steady grip can be
tough let's set our next drop at 5 feet
landed face-up and I can tell you now
the screen did survive so let's see you
can take a look at it first
oh so the back continue to break which
is no surprise because it had already
been compromised in our previous test
there are now bigger cracks extending
through the rest of the phone and down
to the other edge but the screen is fine
I am seeing another dent on the side but
other than that all the damage is on the
back you could probably still mask this
with a good case so we're going to see
what kind of damage this next test does
this one is hopefully less likely but it
still happens your hands are full and
the roof of the car seems like a
perfectly good place to set your phone
on while you open the car door what's
not good is forgetting to bring it in
with you our Heights vary but we've set
our next test at 5 feet 10 inches
I really tried to have it led on the
screen but it didn't I can see the
screen and it looks ok I'll show you
first again I'm more concerned about the
camera right now oh it really doesn't
have that much more damage than it
already did and it landed on the street
yeah I can see a lot of the same cracks
I've gotten a little bit worse but not
what I expected I expected it to be in
spider webs and it did hit the screen
there are some scuffs over here on the
screen some dents but no cracks
impressive so yes we broke the phone but
after what we put it through I was
expecting it to end up looking a lot
worse than it did and solely based on
our unscientific tests it seems like the
screen side is better at withstanding
the drops but it could have been a
matter of luck and even if your phone
were to land on the exact same angle
from the same height on a similar
surface you'd probably still get
different results so put a case on that
beautiful phone and definitely don't try
this at home</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
