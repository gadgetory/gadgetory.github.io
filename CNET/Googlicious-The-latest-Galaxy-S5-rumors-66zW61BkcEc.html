after an extended break with Google
Isha's for all the Google we can pack
into a show each week so let's get to it
it's a new year and we're no strangers
to rumors around Samsung 2014 should be
another big year for them and KGI
analysts are already throwing out the
predictions for the galaxy s5 which they
expect to come in two configurations one
being a standard model and the other
being their prime model with a fast
eight-core processor a 5.2 inch quad HD
AMOLED panel and three gigs of RAM even
recently leaked screenshots of the s5s
home screen by of leaks showcase a
Google nowish looking card arrangement
but I've been told these were very very
early versions of the home screen that
will include a connected animating
background when you switch between home
screens now there's still no reports of
any fingerprint scanner 3d gesture
support looks like it will be back while
new iris scanning technology has been
rumored as a possibility for this phone
now more samsung rumours and according
to the korea times an unnamed source
tells them that samsung may be
attempting to beat google glass to a
public launch with its own rumored
Galaxy class samsung hints that its own
smart glass product might be launched at
the ephah show in germany in September
while there's still no official release
date for google glass now this sounds
frightening and I would just offer some
advice to Samsung that they will listen
to because remember how you guys rush to
get the galaxy gear smartwatch out to be
other companies well you might want to
wait a little bit on this galaxy glass
thing until you've really got something
and that's just my two cents because I
care all right according to Russian
blogger elder mortis and he reports that
Google will phase out the Nexus line of
devices in favor of more google play
edition products Google will still
introduce two to three more Nexus
branded products but will discontinue
the Nexus subgrant in 2015 now it makes
some sense with the number of Google
Play edition handsets available if the
software updates can be pushed out
quickly which they have been but it also
seems a little odd they would kill a
brand they've spent five
years working on that has name
recognition with the Nexus line being a
more affordable option as well again
it's a rumor so i'll see you in 2015 and
let you know how it all works out if
Cena wants to keep me working here which
is really the best technology website in
the world and a red nexus 5 just got
leaked on Twitter this week and that
looks legit I'll write to the quick
stories ACC hands off the Android 4.4
update for us HTC One models to their
carriers for certification so an update
could be coming soon if all things go
well so keeping my fingers crossed also
the LG G flex with its curved screen and
self-healing back will launch in the US
on t-mobile februari the fifth AT&amp;amp;T is
currently taking pre-orders and Sprint's
opening up there's January 31st also
check this out the starwood hotel group
has announced its planning to allow you
to check in with their smartphone and
use it as your room key as well using
their Starwood Preferred Guest app for
Android and iOS with just a twist you'll
be able to access your room now this
program will be piloted at a few of
their aloft brand hotels before rolling
it out company-wide and a fun little
video from the crew at Top Gear where
the Stig decided to take on one of
Google Street View cars while he was
driving a mercedes-benz SLS AMG black
let's just check it out
yeah I really thought the street view
car had a chance like I really did all
right that's gonna do it for this week's
show you can always email us at Google
issues at cnet com or tweet me up brian
Tong and i'll respond when i can thanks
so much for watching i'm brian Tong it
will see you guys next week for some
more of that Google Isha's judicious</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
