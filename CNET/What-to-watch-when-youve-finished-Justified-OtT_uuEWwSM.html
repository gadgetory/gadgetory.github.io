outlaws and lawmen set in deepest
Eastern Kentucky has hung up its gun
belt and finished after six seasons if
you're a fan feeling suddenly adrift
here are our top picks of TV shows and
movies to watch when you've finished
justified you are going to tell us where
he is airing on the same network Sons of
Anarchy shares justified's mix of
smoldering drama and reliable
high-octane outlaw action following the
exploits of a tightly knit motorcycle
club this small town crime series aired
its final episode earlier this year
injustice I'd Timothy Olyphant plays a
cowboy out of time if that theme
resonated with you check out 1962's
lonely other brave which does Kirk
Douglas as a roaming ranch and who
rejects modern life and ends up on the
run
if however you'd rather see Timothy
Olyphant playing a u.s. marshal and
actual frontier times Deadwood is the
show for you HBO's acclaimed Western
only lasted three seasons but is packed
with real historical characters and
plenty of grit if you want some less
cerebral and more recent TV to get stuck
into try ban chi this pulpy action drama
follows an ex-con who assumes the
identity of a murdered sheriff and is
notable for its gory no-holds-barred
fight scenes the quirky characters and
snappy dialogue of justified were born
in the short story fire in the hole by
legendary crime novelist Elmore Leonard
there's more where that came from in
1998's crime caper out of sight starring
george clooney at his coolest to
first-time Mirren doing great that
should be enough to tide you over for
now but if you've got any other
suggestions then let us know and happy
