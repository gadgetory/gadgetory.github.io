you and Vidya announced a new gaming
console and here to give us the scoop on
it is you Josh Desai and videos project
shields in front of us so I'm very
excited to finally see this it's very
cool so you can tell us a little about
it and what your goal was to to
introduce and shocked everyone with this
sure so uh you know a bunch of us didn't
video gamers actually a lot of famers we
love playing games so we kind of wanted
to start first with building something
that we would love ourselves so we knew
on the console side you know you got
folks like Sony Microsoft Nintendo
they're doing a fantastic job you know
doing stuff for the console gamers what
about the pc and android gamers you know
it's a huge ecosystem anything from free
to play all the way to premium games so
we said wouldn't be cool if we had a
mobile device you know gaming portable
that was built for open platforms both
pc and android that's what we've got
here in project shield so basically it's
got a built in console grade controller
because as gamers you want to have a
console you know that or a controller
that feels good it's got to feel great
in your hands the xbox controller which
I love I mean yeah you know if it's not
broke don't try and fix it right I mean
so it's got a 5-inch screen but fully
touch enabled so it's got this is the
latest version of Android it's the
latest version of Android we want to
make sure it had pure Android you know
lots of Android purists they don't want
anything on top of it so it's pure
Android and then what we built is this
little application that we call the
shield app and when you go into the
shield a pile just kind of drive from
behind all the way you guys have me
driving it from behind making my life a
little bit data yeah but that is some
skills yes area the shield app is an
application that sits on top it'll have
any game that you've purchased through
Android automatically show up there you
can go to Google Play browse all the
games that they have there as well and
then probably the coolest thing is you
can actually we don't have it here
obviously I didn't drag it over here but
in your home network you could actually
connect to your pc and stream all of
your pc games and play it on here right
which we are saying it's kind of cool
you can prop your you prop up in bed and
play
Creed while you know while your wife
sleeping x3 exactly myself better that's
what guys think about yeah how to have
that you know quality time time with her
but playing a game as well okay I get
that so uh let's see what else can I
tell you well be out of the games yeah
can I well so I'm gonna have to turn it
around I played again okay let me yeah
alright so let's see I'm going to fire
up a boxing game and uh do you want to
play ah sure yeah yeah so I got to turn
that hand that over to you absolutely so
basically the thumbsticks work just like
they normally would you got a B why are
the different you know moves you can do
I think if you hit the right thumbstick
you can do an uppercut let me actually
show you one thing really cool let's
crank up the audio here the other thing
we put in here with these uh these
custom tune ports stereo speakers oh
yeah that are you know kind of like a
jam box so it's fully built in oh I
heard the bell go off oh yeah I hadn't
really connected yet but oh that was me
getting punched a lot you know don't
feel badly I picked me up as well are
you taking to your kind of like
intuitively yes so you know what the
controls like I said feel alive the xbox
360 controller the joysticks pretty
intuitive feels good and the graphics
are pretty impressive okay yeah so
inside i should mention that's got a
Tegra 4 which was our other big
announcement here at the show so it's
our brand new mobile processor that we
announced it's got a quad-core a 15 cpu
in it but it's also got our custom 72
for GPU in it so those are all the
graphics that are processing what you
see on the rogers taking an interview
and game and SSA attention world in his
journals and career maybe perhaps yes
this is definitely a highlight or
milestone for my career the thing i love
about the devices you know you could
play games on it but because it is pure
Android you know I log in with my gmail
account i can play music i can watch
movies I can read books on this i can
read magazines you know so YouTube
anything
I think you could do on an Android
device anything you do on an Android
device you can do here here lets you
know crank up the music here so I'm
systems a portable stereo yeah it's like
a cleaning ipod touch base yeah we're
just like an ipod touch it okay this
fragrance or with a hooked into it the
bill get an ipod touch doc right like so
I have to ask okay is this what is the
purpose of this of this project shield
are you taking on Nintendo is this your
take on console games because they you
know had us for one thing it was very
impressive look I think that the crowds
were very surprised I think very pleased
to see this during the press conference
because it's just sort of it doesn't
really fit in a category so I'm just
curious foreign video what's the intent
behind this device the intent was to
build something that we wanted to use
ourselves it's nothing more nothing more
than that I mean you know a lot of times
people try to put you in boxes you know
that's a console gamer you know and then
when you know sorry it's a pc gamer and
then when a console comes out every year
you see this when the Refresh happens oh
this is the year pc is dead and it just
never happens pc gamers you know still
play on pc right now i see a lot of the
tech reports going man look at all these
tablets and everything you know second
screen i think now the console is dead
and that's not true either right on my
gamer i got two consoles at home a
tablet a phone a pc I just like playing
games anywhere so I think this
absolutely looks sexy when can i buy it
so we're targeting the project shield
right now it is a product we are going
to bring it to market and right now
we're targeting q2 of this year and how
much will have to pay for it we are
going to disclose that as we get closer
to you about product availability it's
going to be close and ranged to what you
would typically pay for a portable
gaming system I mean something and that
you know we got to think through it
because as we just talked about right
now it's an ipod touch with a you know
built-in doc it's got the console
controller it's got you know speakers
equivalent to like a jam box it's got
not only your android games your pc game
it's it's a lot for us to think through
right now we just wanted to build a
great product I gotta ask um you know
with this being a giant leap into like
selling Hardware what do you think it's
going to be the biggest
challenge for the company to focus on or
that you might are worried about coming
across because you haven't been in that
zone before that's a great question i
think you know the biggest thing is we
are now going you know we've always sold
product to consumers you know through
our partners but this is pretty much our
first direct to consumer product so we
gotta really raise our game and that's
why we're making sure you know and it's
one of the reasons frankly we called it
project shield is because we want to
make sure it's ready you know we're all
going to have an extensive internal beta
test that i got to tell you the company
is really looking forward to so we're
going to really you know take our times
make sure we get it right make sure the
controls feel well the thumbsticks the
d-pad all the buttons make sure the
speakers are good no more importantly
make sure the streaming is flawless
because that's a main value proposition
for the product so we want to make sure
streaming from your pc you know and it's
basically a geforce gtx pc is what you
need on one end and that would stream to
here so we want to make sure all of that
you know works flawlessly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
