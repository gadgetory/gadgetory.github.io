Tran pg9 172 G H and power adapter now
don't let that quasi name scare you it's
actually a quite sexy product for one is
the fastest power adapter on the market
with the sustain real world speed of
more than 330 megabit per second in my
testing that's some four times the speed
of a regularly Ethernet connection and
close to the speed of a gigabit
connection and secondly is very easy to
use now take a look here it looks just
like a three prong power adapter you can
plug into a wall socket very easily but
underneath here there's a gigabit
network port now to make the first power
connection you need two units the first
one right here connects to an existing
network such as a router and the second
unit I do have it right here you use
this to connect to a Ethernet ready
device such as a computer a printer or
even a Wi-Fi access point as the far
corner of the house after that you plug
both of these into the world socket and
you are done the electrical wiring
between the two unit will now work as a
network cable connecting the two
basically these two will save you from
having to run the actual network cable
from one room to another and they're
fast speed means you don't have to
compromise the performance either now
they'd have to have these indicator
lights right here too so start us and
over here there's a config button that
enabled the security feature this
feature is very important because you
want to keep your network safe in case
you live in a multiple unit building
such as the condo but if you live in a
single family residence just the need to
use that feature okay so it's fast and
is easy to you now the question is how
much does it cost
well this new adapter here has a
suggested price of $70 for one unit or
$130 if you buy two at the same time a
year ago that's quite good price but now
that's a bit expensive so maybe should
wait for the street price to go down
before getting you Oh in the meantime to
find out more check out my full review
at cnet.com and by the way if you're
wondering what's those
see about this one well that's not until
I started talking about it that's chosen
and that's because I'm Doug Miller and
this has been the first look at the very
easy to you and very fast power adapter
