I'm Bridget Carey and this is your scene
at update cyber monday is over and as
you could expect it broke last year's
online shopping spending records IBM
tracks spending from hundreds of
retailers and there was a 30-percent
jumping online shopping from last year
and the peak shopping time if you're
interested was 1130 a.m. eastern time
the biggest product was the kindle fire
tablet amazon cut the price by thirty
bucks and amazon says it was the most
successful cyber monday deal ever aside
from sales there was quite a bit of
hoopla on facebook with people posting
status messages full of legalese about
how henceforth they hereby own the
copyright to all the material they post
on facebook well here's the truth it's a
hoax it means nothing and posting legal
statements on your page does not in any
way change with rights you have when you
use facebook what you agree to in the
Terms of Service when you signed up yet
that's what matters Facebook does not
own any of the content you post to your
page but if you use Facebook they do
have the rights to sell data about you
to advertisers for example if you like a
company page or a product that info
might be shared with others if you use
Facebook be smart with what you shared
go through your privacy settings and go
to the section on facebook ads you can
decide if you want Facebook to use your
name and your actions with ads that your
friends can see apples voice-controlled
assistant Siri will work with cars next
year starting with the Chevy spark and
sonic owners with an iphone 4s or iphone
5 could wirelessly connect to Chevy
MyLink to give siri commands while
they're driving like sending text
messages making calls and accessing
calendars but drivers won't be able to
ask Siri a complex question that
requires displaying a web page since
that would just encourage drivers to
take their eyes off the road and the
iphone screens won't light up to
distract the driver either Apple set a
sales date for its new 21.5 inch screen
imac the all-in-one desktop goes on sale
this friday november 30th at Apple
stores and online the larger 27 inch
model will be available to order online
and will ship in December Apple first
unveiled these new models last month
which have Intel's latest processors and
the thinnest display you'll find in any
all-in-one the 21.5 inch model starts at
thirteen hundred dollars and a heads up
for those of you with an android device
if you want to post a review about a
book a nap or anything in the Google
Play Store you now have to use your real
name with a Google+ account so if you
have some terrible things to say you
better stand proudly behind them on the
good side it could cut back on fake
reviews on the bad it could just
discourage people from writing any
review that's your tech news update you
can find links to all of these stories
