favorite jerk sauce on a piece of
leftover pizza but some jerk already use
the last of it well with the Amazon one
you can scan the barcode to add more to
your shopping cart then have more sense
straight to your door
it's the latest brick and Amazon's
ever-expanding online retail fortress
and the idea is to grease the skids and
make it as easy as possible for people
to order their groceries online for
delivery to that end it only costs $20
and even pays for itself thanks to a
twenty dollar online grocery credit that
comes as part of the deal the most
interesting thing about the wand though
might be the fact that it's an Amazon
Alexa enabled device and the most
inexpensive one to date at less than
half the cost of an Amazon echo dot it
isn't always listening for a wake word
like the echo dot though you have to
press a button to say your command like
this a lexan ad toilet paper to my
shopping cart in addition to shopping
you can ask Alexa for the weather to
tell you a joke or even to access any
one of the thousands of Alexa
third-party skills you can also control
compatible smart home gadgets just like
this turn off the kitchen lights there
are some limitations though you can't
stream music with the Amazon wand and
you can't ask Alexa to set reminders
either you also can't ask Alexa to set a
timer or an alarm which is a bit of a
bummer since that timer feature is
really popular for people who use Alexa
in the kitchen and this is primarily a
kitchen gadget something else I wonder
is this thing too kid-friendly I have
two nephews up in Ohio who love Star
Wars they love the lightsabers the laser
blasters all of it and I can just
imagine them running around the house
playing with this thing scanning every
barcode in sight there's also a question
of whether or not people are ready to
dive in deeper with online grocery
shopping Amazon is making big waves here
with the recent acquisition of Whole
Foods for almost 14 billion dollars but
it's unclear how the wand might tie-in
still the wand is really easy to use it
works reliably well and it's
tantalizingly cheap even if you ignore
the barcode scanner altogether and just
keep it on your fridge as an extra alexa
access point to turn your lights on and
off I think it's well worth 20 bucks and
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
