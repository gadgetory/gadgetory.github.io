house in beautiful and sunny Las Vegas
they're gonna give us a home tour and
let's walk in and check it out right now
right on time hey come on Hansy no need
to hang out on the strip have I matched
your beard game even more even more so
yeah well done sir
welcome to the Scott family compound
this looks pretty impressive
I look to Vegas just over ten years ago
and I looked for quite a long time
perhaps that would work for us because
we wanted to have the ability to have
all the family over everybody's day but
we'd we like to entertain so I wanted
somewhere with a grand central space and
as soon as I send through the pictures
of this place he's like oh yeah well he
wanted grand and also wanted medieval
Harbor and swords
yeah we've been collecting since we were
kids like the the Claymore that the
armors holding that's from when we were
10 years old same with the broad swords
that Armour Jonathan actually had sighs
to himself so that if he ever feels like
it he can strap it on and walk around in
it if there's a zombie apocalypse I'm
cool so how much of this did you change
when you moved here how much of it is it
like have you altered I'm assuming this
was created by you guys yeah it's a
really so oppressive piece here we're
always about you know repurposing as
much as you can so the actual
architecture of the home is what it was
we built these cabinets in because it
was just these weird little angled
alcoves where the TV was supposed to go
so we tore that out did that replant the
fireplace in the tile I mean this is the
original travertine a lot of it is
original the most dramatic change was
ripping the whole back wall out of the
house here and putting in the clocks
little doors because in the spring
summer fall you can just leave that wide
open walking it out it wasn't dumb house
though when we bought it because there
is no smart tech at all and the whole
thing so we everything we put in this is
all everything from the surveillance
security system all the entertainment so
anywhere in the world wherever we are we
can control every aspect of the home
from the access to the lights to the
sound you name it also and you know for
me I like to harass people so if my wife
is here at the house and I'm out of town
I like to just turn on TVs in other room
so she hears voices just to mess with
her I'll be married very long
welcome to the pool deck this was all
dirt when we bought the house it's a
half acre there was nothing out here so
we developed everything we developed the
pool swim up bar you can actually sit in
the water and sip mai tais and be served
right at water level everything here was
put in it's a little nicer than what's
before I mean before you just had dirt
technology anywhere we can incorporate
it is important so in Vegas it's very
dry a lot of people have dead lawns so
we have artificial turf but if you get
high quality artificial turf is great
and what we have is also underneath the
grass we have we've used a sand and it
has a chemical coating on it that
actually keeps the service cooler so
when the pups around here they're not
going to burn their feet it actually
reduces by how much yeah 40 40 degrees
yeah it's a polymer covered sand granule
and yeah so what we'll do is we'll put
on the irrigation system much like a
diaper it absorbs all the moisture and
then over the next week it just slowly
evaporates that cools the surface the
house is totally wired not just to
control the entertainment and the lights
and stuff but also solar we are
completely offset with solar
we have enough panels on the top of the
half that offsets the main house
completely I mean in addition to that
there's just some cool features too like
who doesn't like watching the football
game from a hot tub check this out
projector comes down over here and then
we've got a 15-foot movie screen on the
left here it is the perfect place to
watch any movie or any any sports game
something that I love though whether
you're watching a movie from the hot tub
or the pool you can also use the slide
we have a turret up over here on the
right side and there's a water slide
that comes down from there into the pool
awesome it's clap activated go ahead
clap are you sure no but there you go so
it's so much yes if anything is when
they first designed this they're like
yeah we'll have a jet at 70 gallons a
minute
and then Drew's like we need more jets
and so he doubled it so it's like 140
gallons I made it pumps down this is the
ultimate hanging pad with family friends
coming over they use it more than we do
but also we have the game room inside
brother versus brother yes guys look
pretty jacked the cartoon version
totally accurate like a 44 inch by so
yeah obviously this is Jonathan so
growing up our parents always put
Jonathan in blue and they always put me
in every other color so anytime you see
there's a there's a tribute for us
anytime you see baby photos look for the
non blue that's true do you play I mean
I do now alright you have one chance to
defeat the twins we have the Jonathan
has the Jonathan doll and his friends
watching you oh that was a gentle touch
yeah that's right you know what we will
clearly how dare you guys this is a
really cool house and I super duper
appreciate you guys showing me around
here oh you're not done by the way
you're staying once you enter this house
you never leave I'll get the drinks and
you find the next game Bruce and pop car
- oh yeah all right I will school you at
all of these kings all right I look
forward to the new brother you moved in
yeah you wanna try the suit of armor</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
