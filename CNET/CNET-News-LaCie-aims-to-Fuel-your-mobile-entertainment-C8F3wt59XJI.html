only lossy fuel but before we get to it
has something gonna show you this is the
Seagate wireless plus one of the best
mobile start device on the market and it
has a lot of features great performance
and very long battery life in fact the
only thing I have to complain about it
right now it's the fact that it's not
exactly square and it has no hold in it
if you want a white one hole and square
well why not
but if you one way I do that's when the
Lissie comes into play take a look here
it is totally square like a floor tile
and take a look over here yes it has a
hole in it in fact this random desire is
the about the only big difference
between the two devices because like the
wallet plus the fill right here is a
mobile device it comes with a built-in
Wi-Fi network that up to five devices
such as tablet or smartphone can connect
to it and then they can stream content
store on the field like the wireless
post the film right here comes with one
terabyte of storage space some 10 hours
of battery life
and the two share the exact same Seagate
mobile apps and that's because this
device here is the first collaboration
between the two company Elysee and
Seagate ever seen let's see became Park
CK's a few years ago now as a mobile
start device the field come with a
built-in Wi-Fi network up to five
devices that just tablets or smartphones
can connect to it
and after that they can stream content
store on the field right here the
content can be photo document video or
music as you can see the content
playback is quite smooth even when you
playback an HD movie
note that the Seagate mobile apps can
only play back the content type
supported natively by your mobile device
for other type you have to download the
fibers and playback using a third-party
app apart from playing back content you
can also backup content from the mobile
device onto the fuel such as video and
photo shot by the tablet are you phone
you can also use the app to make the
field connect to another Wi-Fi network
to share the Internet
with the devices connected to it out
Wi-Fi network and the device here is
actually very smart on power because it
allows you to turn off services that not
being used to have a longer battery life
unless I hear the fuel has a power but
you have to press and hold for a few
seconds to turn on off on this side
there's only one micro USB 3.0 port for
charging using the included cable and a
power adapter you can also plug this
device here to computer and in that case
it works exactly like a bus power
portable hard drive a very fast one in
fact because in my testing it offers
some 100 megabyte per second copying
speed it also work with USB 2.0 and the
idea is that you can load a ton of
content before your long road trip and
one terabyte is a lot more than any
internal storage of any mobile device
you know the feel is a great companion
for mobile user and it's totally worth
the price of $199 and what you can do
with this hole right here is a burner
ladies may I recommend using it as a big
earring or very trendy like lace for
more check out my full review Cellcom
and if you're wondering what I'm gonna
do with this hole why it's very simple
I'm gonna use the whole thing here as my
key fob somehow it goes really well it
might be opening here and now I cannot
least place my keys anymore that's
because I'm down low and this has been
the first look as the few mobile storage
