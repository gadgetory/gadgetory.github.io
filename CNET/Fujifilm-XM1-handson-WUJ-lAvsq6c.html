xm1 the company's $800
interchangeable-lens camera kit is the
stellar photo quality you get for the
money the camera incorporates Fuji films
aps-c sized x-trans sensor which uses a
non-standard color filter array layout
so that can drop the softening
anti-aliasing filter and combined with
really good JPEG processing delivers
excellent photos as high as ISO 1600 and
really usable ones through ISO 6400 it's
got great dynamic range and good color
to flip side however is relatively poor
video quality with a lot of edge
artifacts that the anti-aliasing filter
usually deals with the camera has a
really nice design as well I like it's
Big Brother the XE ones body better with
its electronic viewfinder and more
photographer friendly physical controls
but this camera straddles a good middle
ground between consumer comfort and
retro style highlights include two
adjustment dials a tilting LCD that can
operate at 90 degrees downward as well
as upward and it's pricing ly good on
camera flash that you can tilt back to
bounce or reduce intensity the grips a
lot shallower than I like but it's not
bad it does offer Fujifilm standard
confusion of auto modes a dumb auto a
smarter auto and the tradition select
Essene auto but it also has a custom
settings law my only real quibble with
the interface is the lack of a direct
access option for metering and a
physical auto exposure lock button you
can program the function button for
either but there's no way to program
both operations so you're stuck going
into the menu system to change the
metering it doesn't even appear on the
control panel or going without the auto
exposure lock entirely the cameras
performance while sufficient lags its
competitors and though it can burst at
about 5.7 frames per second it can only
do so with fixed focus and exposure in
the feature set which includes Wi-Fi for
connecting to a mobile device to upload
or tagged with GPS coordinates also
ranks is sufficient
but not outstanding if you're looking
for the best photo quality you can get
for the money the xm1 is it it's just
not the most well-rounded option of its
cobourg I'm Laurie grunion and this is
the Fujifilm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
