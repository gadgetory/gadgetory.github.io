a great way to discover and share music
and with their mobile app and a premium
account you can take their huge library
of songs with you anywhere you want to
go but every once in a while you'll
think of a song you want to hear that
isn't available on Spotify but you know
it's on your phone somewhere on an
Android phone you can use the Spotify
app to play any of your locally stored
music but on the iPhone or iPod touch
Spotify can't peek into any locally
stored files you transfer through iTunes
but with a little extra work you can
meld your music collection into the
Spotify app and leave the iPhone stock
music app behind for the first step open
up Spotify on your computer and check to
see that you have a premium account by
going to your name and clicking account
you'll see the account status here if
you don't have a premium account and you
really want this feature now is the time
to upgrade next head over to your local
files this is going to show you all the
files on your computer that you can sync
over to the Spotify app there's a total
at the top and if it seems a little off
go into the Preferences menu and make
sure that the folder where you keep your
music is included on the local files
checklist
I had my iTunes Music folder in a
location other than the default one so I
had to add it manually now here's where
the magic happens make sure that both
your iPhone and your computer are
connected to the same Wi-Fi network open
up the Spotify app on your phone and you
should see it pop up under the devices
here on your computer Spotify app from
this view you can tell Spotify to
transfer your entire music collection or
individually select which playlist to
sync over
Spotify will now sync your files over
Wi-Fi and you'll see a running tally of
how much space is available on your
phone at the top once transferred you'll
see your tracks pop up under the local
files listing on your phone and now all
of your favorite songs are all available
in one place and you can listen to them
here without having to leave the app so
there you go that's how to transfer your
music files into Spotify for the iPhone
for more tips like these head over to
how to see Netcom and for any how to
requests you can find me on Facebook and
Twitter for cnet.com i'm
