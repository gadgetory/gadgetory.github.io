oven Kenmore think so
with its Kenmore Elite nine seven seven
to three with this can more elite model
the company gets rid of burner knobs
entirely and instead goes to touch
controls for the burners now Kenmore
says this creates a more precise
temperature control mechanism and also
creates a nice clean sleek finish now I
will agree about the finish of the oven
it looks really sharp but the touch
controls for the burners turned out to
be trickier to use than I thought they
would be it's hard to figure out what is
the equivalent of medium or high or low
when you just have a number scale you
have to definitely make sure that you're
reading the instruction manual to figure
out how to use the burners as they
should be used you know after a few
tries you will eventually get the hang
of using the burners and once you do
this oven delivers very good cooking
performance there's a turbo boil a Flex
burner that can boil 112 ounces of water
in less than nine minutes which is
pretty fast here in the Test Kitchen the
double oven cavities also provide a lot
of room for you to multitask while you
bake and I love having that option
however this oven comes at a pretty
steep price tag $2,600 to be exact so
I'd rather have my burner knobs back in
exchange for a cheaper price for this
