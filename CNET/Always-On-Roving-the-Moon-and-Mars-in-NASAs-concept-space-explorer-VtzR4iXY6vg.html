manned space flight missions but that
doesn't mean we're giving up on sending
astronauts to space NASA is hard at work
right now on missions to the moon by
2020 asteroids by 2025 and Mars by 2030
this is NASA's Space Exploration vehicle
weighing 6,600 pounds
it's a futuristic concept designed by
engineers to explore the surface of the
Moon and Mars let's take a look the goal
of this vehicle is to be able to explore
the surface of Mars the moon or any
other plants and make observations
through the front of it right so you can
be scouting out different parts of the
brain and looking for you know either
geological things or signs of life or
whatever the science happens to be and
you pull up to something you say that's
interesting I want to get out and
explore it further which is easy to do
when you consider all the tech built
into this vehicle first its all-electric
with a lithium ion battery the power
zinc and it's controlled with this
steering stick there's also a dozen
cameras attached to the exterior and the
12 wheels can each pivot 360 degrees so
can drive up and down most slopes so can
we take it for a ride absolutely all
right let's do it I'll give you a ride
and I'll turn it over to you and you can
drive I can drive you can write I could
drive I'm so excited
next stop
oh my god
oh my god that's amazing what we call
the crab mode so we're actually blending
a wide command with a little bit of yaw
and it allows you to go around and keep
your optimal window of you for what
you're trying to look at all right
moving to Mars we're going up
we're just rotating like it's nothing
it's so fast
NASA has also designed the vehicle so
astronauts can venture outside there's a
space suit port integrated into the back
hatch that makes it possible to step
into the suit right from the cabin and
go for a spacewalk
but if astronauts just want to explore
from inside there's also a specially
designed window for better viewing this
bubble who has made for astronauts to be
able to actually stick their face in and
observe rocks up close while staying
inside the SAV he can actually pitch it
down so that we can look right up close
next to the rock how cool is that
pilot select okay you have gotten
vehicle all right here we go oh my god
I'm going into the crater oh my god it's
amazing it's the coolest video game
you've ever played in your life all
right I'm gonna try to crab okay now
start twisting this stick
there we go you've actually gonna point
it thank you I played my fair share of
sticky this is insanely steep faith in
the vehicle
incredible I'm driving the space vehicle
I'm driving a space vehicle on the
simulated lunar surface right now ten
year old me eat your heart out nASA has
also developed this prototype for deep
space exploration it's for missions that
can one day explore near-earth asteroids
this vehicle lets astronauts check out
the surface of those asteroids surveying
and collecting geological samples to
study later so where is all of this
headed are we going to be mining
asteroids the more we know about
asteroids the better position we'll be
in to deflect them because someday maybe
a hundred years from now or 100 million
years from now a big asteroid is gonna
hit the earth so we want to find out how
to make that not happen exactly and as
some people have said if the dinosaurs
had a space program they wouldn't be
extinct alright so I got to drive the
wheeled one right give this one a spin
yeah let's go inside
alright I'm gonna follow my commander
and go towards where the laser pointer
is pointed on the asteroid it's just
like the video game asteroids there's
momentum I mean I have a lot of
experiences but all joking aside this is
no video game and NASA is serious about
using vehicles like these for future
space missions whether it's to the moon
Mars and yes even near-earth asteroids
