one
not sure what's gonna get winged at me
for this bit of sacrilege it's top five
reasons Android is better than iPhone as
laid out by the team at Caen it's
Android Atlas weekly podcast yeah I know
that sounds like we're comparing an OS
to a product line but you get it we're
going to compare the universes here os
devices apps and carriers between the
two hottest smartphone platforms in the
world here we go number 5 Android is
open source the folks behind it don't
care if you hack the phone you paid for
and they don't play games trying to
outfox the way you did it instead they
have lives and the Android Marketplace
that's pretty much the Jezebel of apps
welcoming one and all with wide open
listings add in the alternate Android
marketplaces and it all adds up to AB
democracy now yes that does mean you can
get some lousy buggy scamming apps but
you and developers are treated like a
bunch of grown-ups in the Android world
not like you're going to a day care
number for real multitasking yes iOS
does multitasking now but not to the
true degree Android does apps there are
free to do their thing like programs on
a personal computer and yes as with a
computer it means you can run into some
conflicts but see note one above about
day care number three Adobe's Flash
Android phones support it Apple's don't
and won't it means your Android phone
can hit the web all of it with a browser
not a custom app for each website you
want to run well on your phone website
apps aren't always cool innovation
sometimes they're just baggage and with
Android you don't have to use them
number two handsets lots of them there's
something like 80 Android phones and
Counting
Apple has two really one and a half
simplicity's worked well for them but
then again there's that choice thing
Android has choice of features through
all those handsets features you want
features you don't choice of a real
keyboard or just a pretend one on the
screen choice of a device
with removable battery memory expansion
slot you get the idea as we see everyone
adopting smartphones can one or one and
a half devices really fit all before we
check out the number one reason Android
makes iPhone look like the phone for
sheeple let's look at why we're even
talking about this Androids on fire in
the US market it outsold iPhone in q3 of
2010 to grab 44% of smartphone shipments
against Apple's 26% that comparison
unthinkable a year ago globally Android
shipments are up thirteen hundred
percent in a year to 20 million
worldwide Apple still dominates on the
number of apps available but where do
you think that trend lines gonna be
going and finally the number one reason
Android is better than iPhone really is
carriers that pesky choice thing again
Android phones are on a bunch of
carriers iPhone is and always has been
just on AT&amp;amp;T and even if you're one of
the six people who've never heard the
constant complaints about ATT's network
you still might not want to move to it
maybe you just like your carrier
well they've probably got a good Android
phone waiting for it so if you're now
thinking Apple might be more 1984 than
not you'll want to check out scene
