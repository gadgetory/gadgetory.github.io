look at the HP Pavilion 14 Chromebook
that's right even though this looks and
feels a lot like a regular mid-sized
laptop it's actually a Chromebook that's
one of a very small group of laptops
that runs Google's Chrome operating
system which is essentially the Chrome
browser and a couple of very shallow you
know onboard features a very rudimentary
file system you can see some apps right
here Google calls and apps a lot of
times they're really just online
versions of of popular software or
websites that are specifically designed
to work with the chrome operating system
now some Chromebooks we've looked at are
less expensive $300 $250 this is 329
before that you get an Intel Celeron
processor you get 16 gigs of online of
on-board storage which is not really a
lot but some Chromebooks are also much
more expensive Google has their pixel
version which is like $1,200 with a big
Retina display screen this guy kind of
sits a little bit uncomfortably in the
middle not the least expensive not the
most fully featured but it is probably
the easiest to use in terms of having a
full sized keyboard and a full sized
screen although it's not a touchscreen
and a touchpad that's you know okay good
for scrolling but not but not super
high-end because this is a 300 hour
laptop so the keyboard is gonna be kind
of classy touchpad is not going to be as
responsive as on a more expensive system
the big question you have to ask
yourself moving to a Chromebook is can I
handle having to be online 99% of the
time and doing everything through the
browser if you use let's say iTunes or
Photoshop or very specific apps like
that a lot then this is not the system
for you if you're using Facebook and
Twitter and Gmail and Google Docs and
other tools that are already online then
there's a much more compelling case to
be made that said much like netbooks a
couple years ago or even tablets a
Chromebook does make a better secondary
or travel system then your main one I
think if you're using this is your main
laptop every day you would be kind of
frustrated by it but for 329 for a 14
inch screen and a decent web browsing
experience you know it could be worth a
look as something to take with you on
the road I'm Dan Ackerman and then is
the HP Pavilion 14 Chromebook</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
