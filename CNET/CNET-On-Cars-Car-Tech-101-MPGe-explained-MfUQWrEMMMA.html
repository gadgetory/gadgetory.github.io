in mpge that's the easy part
but that little lowercase e at the end
that's actually surprisingly powerful
let's break down the acronym first of
all mpg e stands for miles per gallon of
gasoline equivalent now the equivalent
part is what we're talking about energy
in a gallon of gas as opposed to the
volume of a gallon of gas which is what
mpg basically refers to here's how they
work that out numerically the EPA says
that a gallon of gas has 115,000 BTUs or
British thermal units of potential
energy in it and that they say is
equivalent to thirty three point seven
kilowatt hours of stored electricity
kilowatt hours is typically how you
measure the capacity of a battery now
the math isn't simple as you can imagine
and this is part of how they actually
pull that equation together but let's
take a look at how the cars that use MPG
are sorted out a battery electric car
can have mpge
like a Nissan Leaf or a Tesla Model S
all you do is plug them in that's their
only source of power then you've got
plug-in hybrids those are vehicles that
have a gas engine and a bigger battery
and can still run in a blended or
separate modes you've also got hydrogen
fuel cell car which is also electric but
using a different source to generate the
volts what you won't find an MPG rating
on is a conventional hybrid because the
epa has just deemed those to be too
conventional
now if you look at the stickers it's an
interesting story here's a battery
electric car all that has is an mpge
number because it doesn't run in any
other mode there's no gas involved go to
a plug-in hybrid and it gets very busy
here's your mpg II on the Left which
shows the pure electric running on the
right here's the blended system number
that shows the fact that it also can run
on gas that's your mpg number what I
also want you to notice is what's in the
fine print on these new stickers look
underneath either the mpg or the MPGe
and you now find a european-style
gallons per hundred miles or over here
kilowatt hours in hundred miles this is
not just semantics if you do this you
can avoid what's called the mpg
illusion which basically says that if
you measure a car that improves from 10
to let's say 15 mpg that is not the same
as a car that improves from let's say 50
to 55 you might think those are
equivalent gains in fact the lower
number improvement is vastly more
significant than the higher number
improvement of the car that started at
50 but if you measure in energy per
hundred miles its linear the distortion
is taken out mathematically and of
course the gas engine car doesn't get
MPGe at all you'll see your traditional
number there on the sticker still
because all it does is run on gas more
