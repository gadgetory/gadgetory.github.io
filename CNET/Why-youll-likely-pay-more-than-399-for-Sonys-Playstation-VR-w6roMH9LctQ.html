Sony's PlayStation 4 compatible VR
hardware we now know its price $399 in
the US we know that it's coming out
October 2016 keep in mind that that
price does not include this which are
the PlayStation Move controllers and
where does it include that in the back
which is the camera which is needed to
track your movement now you may have one
of those PlayStation cameras or you may
not chief to pay up a bit for that the
rest of it is included which is wires
and headset and will enable you to play
games on any ps4 now how many games they
say 50 games by launch which is a lot
and there are 22 play here at the event
much like oculus rift and HTC vive the
PlayStation 4 is psvr allows you to move
around in space if you have those move
controllers you can grab things and the
resolution is a little bit of a step
down but it works on the game console so
you don't need a PC however we don't
really know much more about the other
entertainment experience so sony says
there going to be other experiences that
are going to be coming about October is
a long way away right now we know about
the games and we also know that you can
play anything on your ps4 mostly on a
little virtual screen to navigate within
it while wearing the headset would you
get one of these there's a lot of VR
Hardware coming this year this might be
one of the most affordable packages
would you consider the low price of the
ps4 if you're gonna be paying up for a
lot if you don't and you want the entire
bundle and by October who knows what's
gonna happen with oculus and HTC as far
as other bundles and pricing so it's
gonna be a big year for Hardware stay
tuned as we try out more of this here at
GDC in San Francisco</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
