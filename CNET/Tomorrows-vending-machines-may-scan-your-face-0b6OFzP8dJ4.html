at the National Retail Federation show
in New York City where the big tech news
isn't about what cell phone or tablet's
coming out it's about what tech is going
to end up in your mall so can this tech
actually make your shopping experience
any better we're going to take a look
and see this is a company called face
taking a product called swivel that lets
you virtually try on just about anything
whether it's in a store or even at your
house here on the side different
categories like ties and formal wear I'm
wearing a scarf right now how about
let's put on a wedding dress and it will
custom to you as I walk around it
adjusts and you can even get an
all-in-one look instantly now if you saw
this in a store you certainly couldn't
ignore it this is the plan our look
through LCD screen here they have it in
front of a fridge and it's simply a
PowerPoint presentation on a computer
screen pretty cool let's say next time
you go into a drugstore and you want to
ask what I'll the hemorrhoid cream is
but you don't want to actually say that
to somebody will you might want to ask
her the 10 state or virtual assistant
even self checkout machines have gotten
a tech boost here's a machine you could
be seen the u.s. in April instead of
having to find where the bar code is and
scan it yourself you stick it through
the conveyor belts and the digital
imager will be able to just see what the
product is it can tell its fruit loops
by the image of toucan sam here's a new
concept that Macy's is trying out with
their help from Intel if you ever go to
macys there's a lot of different makeup
counters how about going to one screen
that will just give you a suggestion all
the different brands that might work for
you so it can even go by the type of
skin you have or even the look you want
tonight maybe I want to go for a glam
look and it will provide suggestions and
also give you a printout of all the
products you selected also with intel
crack is working on these vending
machines of tomorrow where here's a
promotion where for marketing sake
there's a camera that can detect your
age your gender and if you're old enough
you can get one of their adults
temptations jell-o pudding
hey so there you have it there's some
sweet tech coming to your mall in the
future with seeing a TV I'm Bridget
Carey and I got to say I can't complain
about this sweet assignment</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
