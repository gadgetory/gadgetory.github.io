you so far when you want to sit down and
watch a movie or listen to some music
but if you're not looking to give up the
convenience of portability well that's
where the world of small tablets fit in
and Huawei just introduced the new media
pad m3 that marries both in a really
beautifully designed package the m3 is a
serious upgrade to the m2 both inside
and out the 8.4 inch Android tablet is a
metal unibody design with beveled edges
and a smooth curve that fits easily on
one hand it's a real pleasure to use and
it has a solid feel to it that makes a
big leap from the company's earlier
devices there's a fingerprint sensor on
the bottom that also acts as a shortcut
to display the apps you have open and
the bottom edge has room for a SIM card
for data access on the go
the device comes with either 32 or 64
gigabytes of storage and you can expand
that using the SD card tray on the
bottom the m3 is bright high resolution
display is easy to read in all
conditions including outside in the Sun
at night you can also engage I protected
mode to filter out blue light that
tricks your brain into thinking it's
daytime which is great for late night
browsing the octa-core processor and
four gigs of RAM is plenty fast for most
media needs and while you probably won't
be using this for heavy gaming sessions
it's perfectly responsive for movie
watching and accessing apps the dual
eight megapixel cameras on the front and
back are great for video chats and light
photography if it's a last resort Huawei
partnered with Harman Kardon to build
one watt stereo speakers onto the top
and bottom of the device when you have
it in landscape mode the speakers can
get up to a respectable volume but
you'll want to use headphones to take
full advantage of the high res audio
support so far only European pricing has
been announced the Wi-Fi only model with
32 gigs is 349 euros which is about 390
US dollars or you can bump up to the 64
gigabyte version with 4G LTE for 449
euros or 500 bucks if you're in the
market for a tablet with a stunningly
clear screen the m3 is a great contender
and you can pick it up in Europe on
September 26 this is the huawei media
Pad m3 thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
