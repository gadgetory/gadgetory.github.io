I'm Brian Tanya and this is the place to
find the hottest piece of app in the
mobile space
now this one's for iOS users and podcast
listeners and it's called downcast on
iOS devices you can download a podcast
through the iTunes Store by each
individual episode but you can't
subscribe to the podcast and have it
automatically download on your mobile
device the only way to do that is if you
use iTunes on your computer subscribe
through the iTunes app and then sync
your phone with your computer what
genius thought of that
well they might fix it in iOS 6 but
downcast for a dollar and 99 cents
allows you to automatically download and
listen to all of your podcasts without
the need to sync with iTunes at all now
you can add any of your favorite video
or audio shows check out the top
podcasts that people listen or watch
there's a really good one I recommend
called the Apple buy it now you can also
search for specific ones or manually add
the feed link for the podcast now I like
the ability to create specific playlists
for your different podcasts so I'll
break mine out into topics like sports
news and comedy and there's a variety of
settings for each playlist that you make
now during playback you'll be able to
listen at different speeds and scrub
through the episode like you can with
iOS is media player but one of my
favorites is the quick skip buttons that
allow you to jump forward or backwards
through the podcast easily plus you can
even set a sleep timer on the podcast
now you also get iCloud syncing so all
of your podcasts subscriptions and
playlists will be synced up across
multiple iOS devices Booya so see
there's really no competition and
downcast is the best podcast player app
on iOS that you never heard of until now
now if you guys have any other apps
you'd like us to tap send them to tap
that app at cnet.com I'm Brian Collins
for watching I'll see you guys next time
