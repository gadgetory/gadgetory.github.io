phones but of course you know there has
to be a catch right in this case several
catches first up you have to be an
amazon prime subscriber which runs about
$100 per year
second you're limited to a couple of
phones there's the blue r1 HD
normally costs about $100 with the deal
it's $50 you may not have heard of the
blue r1 but Amazon is also offering a
discount on the fourth generation moto G
it normally goes for around $200 the
reduced price is a hundred and fifty
dollars both of those devices are
unlocked so they're not tied to any
specific wireless carrier sounds pretty
great so far right there's one more
massive catch you have to agree to
receive personalized ads on the devices
lock screens yeah Amazon already has a
similar feature on its Kindle e-readers
and Fire tablets for the phones the ads
will appear full screen unless you have
notifications then the ad will shrink to
the size of notification ads can be
dismissed there is no requirement to go
further with an ad to use your phone the
phone will also be preloaded with the
Amazon apps like Amazon's main shopping
app and Kindle googles apps are still on
both the blue r1 HD and the Moto G these
are still Android phones they do not run
Amazons fire OS this is the first time
Amazon is bringing its special offers
discount to phones and the first time
those offers are coming to non Amazon
devices both phones are available for
pre-order now and will ship on July 12th
on Mayas actor and you can keep up with
the hottest tech news at cnet.com slash</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
