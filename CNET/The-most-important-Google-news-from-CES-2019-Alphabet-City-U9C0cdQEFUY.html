show that covers everything to do with
alphabet alphabet happens to own lots of
companies like loon xwy Moe and Google
I'm your guide Aya's Akhtar
you are the wonderful audience and we
are at CES 2019 today we're talking
about the galaxy s 10 way Mo's new
partnership and your comments but first
up let's talk Google at CES on to the
garden of Google Google's every word CES
to help us out to get a handle on
everything that's been going on we've
dragged in CNET's editor seen that
editor Andrew Gephardt he's been going
from place to place seeing all kinds of
things okay Andrew let's get the ball
rolling what were the most important
developments so Google is everywhere at
the show yeah they're plastered on the
monorail they have a ride like a small
world style ride it's pretty fun they're
trying to make a big presence and
they've made some pretty significant
announcements their interpreter mode is
a really cool piece of tech that's gonna
be built into their home hub and all
their smart displays and it's gonna
allow basically if it's like set up at a
hotel a person can speak one language
speak one language to it it'll translate
and then the concierge at the hotel can
speak an entirely different language and
it acts as the interpreter between those
two people so that's rolling out to
Google home hub and third-party displays
as well as other Google products but
it's not gonna be on phones right away
right III think it's just smart displays
to start ok they want to bring it to
phones they want to bring it to
everywhere that Google assistant works
but smart displays is where it's getting
kicked off it seems like a pretty
brilliant idea actually but that makes
sense for that screen because you could
also correct it if something goes wrong
yeah right you're able to sort of see
and then you know I was having a demo
with it in the Google booth and somehow
it interpreted something and the guys
speaking in Italian asked me if I was
pregnant so I'm pretty sure that wasn't
what he intended to say well I believe
we gotta find out are you pregnant
and not that I know of ok but yeah it's
would be a really cool thing and it's
gonna speak 27 different languages they
obviously got to polish it a little bit
but some of the demos have been flawless
it's looked really cool that's that's
pretty impressive so far Google with a
lot of different products we've also got
a system connect so basically making it
way easier for third parties to have
Google assistant built-in right yeah so
they had an ink display they had a
button those are just concepts those are
prototypes in theory we're not gonna see
those on store shelves the idea is that
someone can make a piece of hardware and
then have Google handle all of the cloud
stuff handle all the processing handle
all the setup so the hardware is gonna
have like a chip built in or something
that sends a query or a signal to a
nearby Google Mini and then the Google
mini sends that question to the cloud
and sends it back to the e-ink display
which shows traffic or weather or
whatnot so the e-ink display itself
isn't pulling that info it's the Google
assistant or the Google whole mini
that's nearby so it's almost like a
client those devices are the clients for
this this piece that actual makes
everything work that's pretty
interesting like that looks like those
eing displays remind me of those price
tags you would see in certain like fancy
stores when their retail stores but
that'd be great to have a bunch of these
little displays around the house because
they're not bright not lighting up like
a smart clock or anything like that yeah
right you don't want necessarily
something super bright in in some places
of your house but Google actually did
introduce a smart clock but it
thankfully has adaptive brightness
this is Lenovo though right no but the
smart clock it's it's the Lenovo smart
clock with Google assistant built-in
that's the full name I think it's just
called the Lenovo smart clock but the
Google assistant parts pretty important
they worked with Google it's integrated
and has all the voice commands of Google
assistant right in there this thing
intrigues me the most out of all the
Google stuff so far actually because
it's really tiny version of Google Home
Hub but it doesn't work the same who's
what watch the video it says you said
there's not the Home Hub controls you
have a an interface set for a nightstand
yeah I thought it was just gonna be a
shrunken yeah
whole numbers shrunken like Leno has a
smart display called the Lenovo smart
display so I thought it was just gonna
be that but small it's not it has no
videos on it it has no camera the Lenovo
smart display has a camera and no smart
home touch controls you can do all the
things with voice that you could do with
a Google how many but they trimmed off a
lot of the extra stuff in order to bring
the price down and to really focus on
what info you would need when you're
going to bed when you're waking up in
the morning this is an $80 device $80
and it seemed that didn't seem
outrageous to me for some reason I said
like something like the echo spot I'm
like this is kitschy and nice and round
but I don't see the purpose of this the
way Google is integrated with all kinds
of calendars and all kind of of your
data right seeing your agenda ahead of
time when you're waking up that seems
like it's a built-in perfect match so
the price fits nicely between Google
Home Hub 150 and Google home Mini 50
which makes sense it's a little more
robust than the one a little less than
the other and yet so this thing can
suggest when to set an alarm based on
when your first appointment is which is
kind of cool it's gonna gradually get
brighter as your alarm gets closer to
speaking of having bright things in
there try to wake you up gently
speaking of smart displays KitchenAid
came out with their first smart display
as far as I know maybe I have not been
paying attention very much to KitchenAid
to display technology but I think this
is a first smart display and the kitchen
has always been an incredibly hard place
to get a computer in there because it's
dirty it's messy what's their solution
water resistance they it's full-on
splash proof water resistance and yeah
it's the first smart display it's
actually the first time kitchen aids
been at CES at all.they so whirlpool
they're their parent company is at CES
all the time but this is the first time
kitchen aides made a presence and yeah
this smart display is pretty cool so
it's gonna have a lot of the same
functionality of the ones we've already
talked about Google Home Hub Lenovo
smart display the water resistance sets
its apart and then it also has yummly
built in which is a food app that they
own for making really specific recipe
recommendations now I know in your
previous reviews of Google home
Smart displays you've called it like
this excellent assistant for recipes
yeah that seems to be that a killer
feature for these displays right which
is why I'm slightly worried about the
KitchenAid smart display standing out
because the Google Home Hub is already
great at recipe assistance like it walks
you through step by step you get
multitask you can play videos and all
that sort of stuff and then when you
want hop right back into the recipe
where you left off so KitchenAid is
doubling down on that which is cool and
if you use youngly anyway this product
could make sense and jelly's pretty
smart about making recipe
recommendations and they have a new
advanced service we're like a celebrity
chef can show up and walk you through a
few steps so there is gonna be some cool
extra stuff for working in the kitchen
on this one so on the outside we saw the
Sonos one working here with both Google
assistant and Alexa compatibility but
it's not exactly all it's cracked up to
be it's not like you can just choose one
or the other anytime you want right
supposedly you have to pick whether you
want Alexa or Google assistant at the
start like when you're first setting up
the device you might be able to get
around that with a factory reset but
still so their Google and Alexa are in
everything except the one thing they
haven't learned how to do I think is
share they could literally be in the
same box as long as you reset the thing
over and over again that seems absurd
there must be some kind of weird
contract issues where you can't simply
go hey Alexa or Alexa I hate Google and
I'm really sorry for setting off
anybody's smart home devices right now
by saying that but yeah it seems like
we're gonna get there eventually but
we're still not there I have to imagine
it's Amazon and Google dragging their
feet I mean they've been at a fierce
competition for taking over their smart
home space as represented by all the
stuff we're seeing at CES but and for
the most part that competition has been
good for customers it's pushed like
features and stuff forward but it's also
meant that something like a Kohler smart
mirror you have to buy a separate mirror
if you want Alexa and you have to buy a
separate mirror if you want Google
assistant and again I'm sorry if I'd set
off your smart I just realized it's a
dual boot machine that's what it is you
can't have these concurrent systems
that's so wrong real quick you were in
the Google booth you weren't on the ride
what was the ride like it was called the
ride yeah it's just the ride it was sort
of
like it's a small world but thankfully a
little less creepy it tells a story
about like a dad who needs to rescue his
family because the moms out of town and
he needs to get a cake and everything
and how their their pitch for it is how
Google assistant can take you through
the twists and turns of life it was kind
of corny but in a in a self-aware way it
was fun so last year they had to slide
this time they have a ride so the next
one's gonna be a thrill ride it's gotta
be a roller coaster or a freefall
freefall that's gonna be the next one
that's my guess nervous I vote for
roller coaster all right so thank you
Andrew that was really helpful you wanna
stick around the rest of the show sure
I'll be here all right let's go to
uptown updates
Samsung has made it official these
companies holding an unpacked event for
the Galaxy S 10 on February 20th in San
Francisco the invite shows two gradient
colors meeting in the middle with a
black line separating them is it two
different phones being butted up against
each other I don't know a Wall Street
Journal article says Samsung would show
off its foldable phone on the same day
guess we'll see yeah what in February or
ever wait xx that's correct
meanwhile the s10 looks like the s10
might have leaked Evan blast posted this
picture on Twitter what she says is the
s10 in the wild take a good look at this
picture it looks like that looks like
what you've expected there's a nice
little infinity Oh display very thin
bezels obviously everything is blurred
out this would be the standard s10 not
the plus or the light
excited about the s10 I mean kind of I
mean Samsung has to up its game now with
Google making their own Android phones
so they've got to find something new and
interesting to do the foldable might
help do that if that's true folding
phones whatever no bezels either way
something's happening on the xx way Mo's
partnering up with a number of companies
including GM and Toyota to form pave
pave stands for partners for automated
vehicle education the group has several
goals one to get the public and
policymakers in cars that have
self-driving tech to pave will hold
education workshops on the tech for
lawmakers and three offering educational
materials to car dealers and serve
centers let's go to comment Co this is
the part of the show will be shining a
spotlight on the most amazing audience
of the world
