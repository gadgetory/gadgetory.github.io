to the cnet mailbag the show where we
take your feedback and answer your
questions about all the stuff we do here
at seen it we're doing a lot you have a
lot of questions but first I have some
exciting news high-definition streaming
is now live at seen at tv.com and we've
even got this handy button here so if
you think your machine can handle the HD
you can toggle it to on but if you're
not quite ready to go there just keep it
off you'll continue to see the standard
definition video and you don't have to
worry about a thing except maybe get a
new computer because it looks good all
right you have a lot of questions this
week let's dive right in the burning
question of the week comes from
Christopher and many others who asked
what happened to planet seen it yeah
planted Cena has been on a short hiatus
while cars do boy basically trotted her
little butt all over well not the planet
but the u.s. covering the Democratic and
the Republican presidential conventions
and then the TechCrunch 50 madness and
the apple announcements here in San
Francisco but we can assure you planet
cnet will be returning in full glory
this week speaking of planet cnet gatlin
wanted to know is it ever going to be a
podcast I checked at podcast cnet com
but there is none for all I know cnet
has every other show in podcast form is
planet cnet different love the show
Gatlin I asked her podcast producer
jason howell about this and he said ha
no but it should be i wish we had
someone to do that type of thing oh wait
i'll add it to my list it'll be done
moving on richard is a little miffed
with us he writes i love bol as much as
the next guy and know that since i lived
without vol video for about a year i
could live but seriously what the frak
happened this is so irritating I've been
waiting feverishly each and every Friday
for a new video to appear in itunes and
what do I get nothing come on guys if
you're canceling it at least tell us
Richard methinks you might not have been
listening lately because we did finally
get around to announcing on buzz out
loud that were no longer producing the
big Friday video version but we haven't
been great about communicating that so
here's the deal if you don't already
know we stream a video buzz out loud
every day
at watch bol calm today is Monday
September 15 2008 I'm Mollywood I'm done
racing her and i'm jason howell welcome
to buzz out loud to nuts podcast of
indeterminate length it is episode 809
and it's our plan to get some good
cameras in that studio and create a
daily live stream that goes up on cnet
TV and that you can maybe even download
so it didn't make a lot of sense to do a
different video version on Fridays
therefore hold onto your hats more bol
goodness is coming next dan rights
download com was always one of the first
sites i tell people to check out when
looking for free music online because
it's legal but i can't find the music
section anymore is it gone or just hind
if it's not gone could someone please
put a link to it on the download com
homepage dan some changes are happening
the music's still going to be there but
it's not going to be right there but
it's not where it's going to end up yet
I can't really say much more than that
but for right now you can still find all
that good free music just go directly to
music download calm and I'll keep you
posted in fashion male gen rights in OMG
Molly I love the top that you are in
September night's episode of mailbag
where did you get it or where did the
wardrobe department get it probably I'm
a mom too and sometimes it's hard to
find clothes that are not too revealing
but not totally matronly and that top
super nice Thank You Jen you know who
else love that shirt markless saya he's
so nice anyway I got it a banana
republic last season and it's funny that
you should ask because this week it
found its way into the dryer bled all
over itself and now it's ruined so feast
your eyes because it's the last you'll
ever see of it so tragic and finally a
new segment on the mailbag the spell
checker special someone wrote in with
some crazy talk about Google Chrome
saying you can't copy a from terre URL
bar that sucks so bad M so mad at Google
they should know about copy A&amp;amp;F paste by
now God you can even highlight it i'm
like WTF that sucks anyway love the show
but why come you guys got rid of Ted
what's on TV thing you know with the TV
screens in the top right corner that
thing was to bum Brian tongs faux hawk
will one day ruled the world since early
angery German monkey trainer whoa
also you totally can cut and paste from
the google chrome URL bar I don't know
why that doesn't work for you maybe it's
because of the rage or that it's a beta
just give it another try and relax okay
talk to you later buddy and that's it
for this week everyone keep that
feedback coming mailbag at cnet com or
send me a postcard to 35 second street
san francisco california 94 105 see you
