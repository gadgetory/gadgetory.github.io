it's the actual physical world why else
would we have spent years trying to make
virtual reality a success for as long as
we've been able to render
computer-generated world we fantasized
about transplanting our minds into the
artificial realm but for all our decades
of dreaming the history of VR in the
real world is essentially a story of
failure the early 60s audiences with
immersive theater such as Mort inhaling
smell producing Center AMA or telesphere
masks but V I've got its first proper
airing when respects its computer
scientist Ivan Sutherland described what
he called the ultimate display a
head-mounted room filling one two
gadgets that Sutherland hopes would
prove a looking glass into a
mathematical Wonderland Sutherlands tech
was truly mind-bending but as we know
the public's appetite over the next two
decades was for computers that were a
little more two-dimensional nevertheless
VR was growing behind the scenes
industrial since crude wireframe
environments it can only be the mid 80s
a time when systems like NASA's virtual
visual environment display were proving
the potential of they are outside the
consumer sphere shown off in 1986 two
tiny LCD screens and a helmet-mounted
sensor promised a final frontier of
remotely controlled space Hardware back
on earth the 80s all virtual reality
become a familiar term one popularized
by Jaron Lane EA of vpl which developed
the data Club an ancestor of the
infamous power glove from the Nintendo
Entertainment System I love the power
glove it's so big public interest flared
and suddenly the VR Revolution was just
around the corner the focal point for
that enthusiasm was to be the games
industry and in the mid-90s VR started
to creep into our homes there were
outliers like Forte's VFX one
but Sega Nintendo at the time the
biggest names in gaming also had a go
the Sega VR made it to arcades but the
console version was canceled a decision
Nintendo should have learned from before
building the Virtual Boy released in the
u.s. in August 1995 the Virtual Boy
which offered monochromatic 3d gaming
through a boxy headset had nothing going
for it it was expensive the games look
terrible
Nintendo stripped out head-tracking from
the prototype and most worryingly
gamers complained of headaches and
nausea when using it a critical and
commercial failure the Virtual Boy was
kin to the next year marketing aside the
Virtual Boy was VR only in the weakest
sense but as a poster child for the
concept its failure soar Virtual Reality
take a big hit this is the oculus rift
today with vastly improved Hardware were
once more ready to give VR a tried in a
new virtual reality flair ignited by
oculus rift which in 2012 stormed
Kickstarter earning over a million
dollars in crowdfunding in only a few
days since then Microsoft Samsung Sony
HTC valve and many more have thrown
their hats into the VR ring will be our
finally stick or not well there are
signs that this time things could be
different
today's we are is being pioneered by
tech makers like Samsung and HTC
who desperately need a next big thing as
heat from the smartphone boom calls so
there's plenty of enthusiasm and
resources in the water make VR work then
there's a social web which opens up a
new frontier for VR beyond gaming we've
already seen VR social networks and with
Facebook now in charge of oculus the
virtual worlds to come could be a lot
chattier than we anticipated what VR has
never ever done though is win over the
public so if you really want to know
whether this stuff could ever take off
all we have to do is ask yourself do I
want this in my life so do you
