it's kind of like a post holiday
hangover where most manufacturers just
sort of hang back maybe live out a phone
or two but in spite of that you guys are
coming to Cena in droves right now got
me wondering what you're looking at
Donald Bell and this top-5 I'll be
counting down the hottest new products
on CNET whose pages went live between
December and March starting off at
number five so many PlayStation 4 now
this one I understand Sony's
next-generation console is really the
first major tech announcement we've had
so far in 2013 it's also the first shot
fired and what will be an epic war
against Microsoft in fact I kind of
wondered why the ps4 wasn't taking the
number one spot until I remembered that
no one really knows what it looks like
yet or how much it costs or when it will
ship all we know is that there's an
updated game controller and some new
specs considering that coming at number
five isn't too shabby I'm number four
Microsoft Office 2013 now I wasn't sure
whether or not to include software and a
product roundup but I think it's too
interesting to leave out these lists are
always dominated by phones and tablets
and TVs here's a Productivity software
suite breaking into the top five most
viewed pages on SEANET it's kind of
unheard of but I guess when a company
like Microsoft we invents the operating
system and their bread and butter
software everyone wants to see if they
pulled it off or fell on their face it
looks pretty good to me but you guys
have some very strong very divided
opinions on this one we returned to
normal with number three HTC One as in
HTC's one last chance to take some share
back from Samsung now this is HTC's
flagship Android phone it's due out in
March and there's a lot of pressure here
for the company to deliver a big hit so
just like office 2013 all of you are
stopping by and giving this thing a
sniff it does look gorgeous and it's a
fast phone there's also a lot of custom
software on here
maybe they'll nail it maybe not
speaking of underdogs check out number
two the blackberry z10 and I'm not sure
if this list says more about you guys or
the state of the industry but every one
of these products so far feels like a
Hail Mary pass from a company that
desperately needs a win but the z10 in
particular feels like that perfect
meeting of longshot product and a
fanatical expectant audience honestly it
seems like a pretty great phone but the
stink on blackberry right now is enough
to knock you down now before we get to
the number one hottest product on CNET
right now let's take a look back at our
most popular products for last fall now
this is a very different list and now
that the iPad Mini in the iPhone 5 or
old news I can safely say that this list
has no Apple products on it whatsoever
kind of refreshing isn't it so that
leaves us with number one our number one
hot product for winter the Microsoft
Surface pro boom that's two for
Microsoft
maybe they're really turning the ship
around now the surface RT was a good
shot at the iPad crowd but those of you
looking for a full fledged Windows
laptop replacement you want the surface
pro now it has its drawbacks especially
when it comes to storage capacity but
overall it's a pretty cool little
machine so there you go a snapshot of
new products that you guys have been
checking out the most over the past few
months now I'll be back again next week
with another top 5 but until then you
can catch up over top-5 cnet.com I'm
Donnell Bell thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
