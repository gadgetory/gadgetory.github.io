we check out clean exhaust on Mercedes
bluetec engine a great approach to
wireless internet with some helpful
greeting tips from our green tech expert
the green show starts now
you
Mercedes has a special diesel engine and
converts emissions into nitrogen and
water it's a green technology called
bluetec and brian cooley has more
Mercedes calls their diesel scrubbing
technology bluetec here's how it works
you've got a diesel engine here putting
up pretty nasty exhaust first stage is
they've got what's called an oxidizing
catalytic converter very early after the
exhaust manifold the next thing that
happens is a particulate filter grabs a
lot of the actual physical suit we
associate with Diesel's trap zip and
cooks it off at a very high temperature
but you've still got a lot of nitrous
oxide coming down in the exhaust stream
that's where you do an injection of add
blue liquid urea in a vapor form in the
exhaust pipe now after the particulate
filter you've got this flow of the
exhaust and the urea vapor working its
way down the exhaust pipe and it gets to
another catalyst toward the rear of the
vehicle which creates a chemical
reaction making it basically nitrogen
and water vapor and that's primarily
what comes out of the exhaust tip in
fact even smells different kind of like
a propane vehicle pretty clean stuff
again 50-state friendly that's how the
blue tech system works i'm brian cooley
for the green show there's a new
networking device from Hercules called
the e plug it provides an internet
connection between the two adapters over
your home power line and then wirelessly
to your computer the e plug 200 has a
bandwidth of 200 megabits per second and
the e plug 85 will give you 85 megabits
per second it uses the latest generation
intel on 6400 chipset that claims to
reduce energy consumption by fifty
percent in standby mode of course if
this isn't green enough for you you
could just use a 50 foot ethernet cord
the e plug 200 duo and e plug 85 duo
should be out this month for 150 and a
hundred dollars respectively no word yet
on a US release date if you obsess over
your energy bill or just want to make a
few simple changes to save power our
green tech expert Martin lamonica has
got you covered hi mark and welcome back
to my house some people wonder about
greening their home the first thing they
should think about is your heating &amp;amp;
cooling costs what you should do is get
an energy audit with someone who can
tell you how to weatherize your home
that means better insulation and ways to
suit up all the cracks up with the cold
and hot
another thing you can do is to dress
your vampire load a good way to get a
read on how much electricity different
devices use is with a power meter this
is a kilowatt and it's telling me that
my computer here is using 136 watts of
electricity now my laptop uses about 35
so I use that to save some power the
kilowatt also told me that my printer
uses to rewatch electricity even when
it's off so what I've done is put my
computers and my printer on the power
strip flick it on when I want to use it
and flick it off when I'm done so how
much electricity is my whole house using
that's what this is for it's home energy
monitor it basically displays what's
going on your meter inside your house
tells you how much electricity you used
over time and what it costs you
utilities are start using these gadgets
and web-based programs as part of smart
grid trials the big point with greening
your home is to start with a plan and
then make little changes every day a
Mart lamonica would seen it thanks for
watching if you're looking for a gadget
that combines the outdoors with a little
bit of espionage this is for you it's
the solar briefcase and power hub that
claims to add an extra three to six
hours of battery life onto your laptop
the briefcase looks very James Bond but
it weighs 12 pounds plus the power hub
that houses the batteries in power
socket adds an extra nine pounds not to
mention the additional weight of your
laptop and any other electronics you're
carrying and while it's labeled as a
briefcase you can't actually carry your
laptop or anything else inside it's also
three hundred and fifty dollars so both
your wallet and your muscles should be
comparable to that of a double oh and
that's it for this week send your
