show that covers everything related to
alphabet Inc the company that owns lots
of other companies I'm your guide Aya's
Akhtar and you are the festive audience
today we're talking about Google app
updates holy phones your comments and
more before we get to our top story
Google CEO sundar pichai is testifying
before the US Congress as we are
recording this episode so let's circle
back to that later
speaking of circles let's talk about
Google Plus on 2 + place Google Plus is
dying sooner than expected Google
announced that a bug in Google Plus
affected 52 million users you might be
thinking hey didn't Google mention a
Google Plus bug a few months ago and
you'd be right because you are very very
good with the memory that bug was also
paired with the announcement that Google
Plus was joining Google Wave buzz and
reader in the great offline in August of
2019 so for this huge bug news Google
did it again it says that Google Plus is
taking a dirt nap in April instead
Google also said that all Google+ API s
are going to put within 90 days of its
announcement let's head on over to
Android Avenue Samsung introduced these
Samsung a8 s it's the first Samsung
phone using the Infinity o screen that's
the one with a punched hole the a8 s
might give us a hint as to what the
Galaxy S 10 could look like using that
holy display the a8 s also got rid of
the standard headphone jack is that
another hint of the future as anybody
who watches the show knows Samsung
respects our opinion so much that they
listen to every word we say so listen up
Samsung don't kill the headphone jack on
the s10 just don't do it
Huawei showed off its honor view 20 it
also has a hole punch designed for the
front-facing camera it was announced a
few hours before the Samsung one so it's
the world's first phone with that kind
of feature woohoo way to go while with
on the back the honor of u-20 has a 48
megapixel camera and for giggles let's
compare hole sizes the honor of u-20 has
a four point five millimeter hole the a8
s has a
six millimeter hole while we managed to
make the hole smaller by making part of
the display transparent and now it's
time for uptown updates google lense for
iOS got an upgrade instead of having to
take a photo and then have lens do the
work
iOS users will get a live view finder in
the Google app iOS is also getting the
for you tab in the Google Maps app
google fit has some updates it now
includes a widget so you can see your
steps at a glance fit also has a
breathing exercise function if you've
got a wear OS device assistant is also
getting a new trick an audio News
playlist that google says is assembled
in that moment for you
it seems similar to Amazon's flash
briefing feature where you can get a
rundown of pre-specified recordings
Google says audio news will roll out
first to a limited number of people in
the US and in English let's go to
comments code this is the part of the
show where we shine a spotlight on the
most amazing audience in the world and

of others are helping me out with my
pronunciation the development side wakka
Labs is working on it's pronounced key
side

live with your mom or do you live with a
bunch of cats it's gotta be either one
or the other well Alejandro nope and
nope Pavan ater asked which Android
phone would you buy pixel 3 or galaxy
note 9 as you are all aware I'm a very
weird guy who owns no cats
I like the note line because I like to
write out my thoughts using a pen or
stylus if you don't care about using a
stylus I think the pixel three is a fine
phone Thanks to everyone for writing in
