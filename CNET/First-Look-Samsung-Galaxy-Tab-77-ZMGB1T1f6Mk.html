and today we're taking a first look at
the Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.7 the Tab 7.7
AMOLED screen delivers gloriously deep
blacks and super bright colors the
tablet is the thinnest small form tablet
yet it includes expandable memory and
impressive gains performance it also
includes both a front 2 megapixel camera
and a back LED supported 3 megapixel
camera the seven point seven ships with
honeycomb 3.2 with Samsung's TouchWiz UI
but neither Samsung nor verizon has yet
to officially announce a date for an ice
cream sandwich update the tablet also
includes an IR sensor that turns it into
a smart remote control using peels smart
remote app 4G speeds fail to match that
of dedicated Wi-Fi but we're still
satisfyingly fast although not quite up
to iPad 4G standards unfortunately
there's no HDMI or USB port we looked at
dead space on both the Tab 7.7 and the
new iPad while each version of the game
appear to be using identical geometry
for models in the same level of effects
complexity the game on a 7.7 look
brighter and much more vibrant this
vibrancy however is tempered by the fact
that the texture color transitions of
background objects are anything but
seamless and unfortunately noticeably
stand out compared to the same art on
the new iPad from strictly a design
standpoint the sin point 7 is the tablet
all other small form-factor tablets
should aspire to the lack of hdmi and
dedicated USB is disappointing but not
deal-breakers unfortunately the price is
for most five hundred dollars in
addition to a two-year contract is a lot
to ask for especially when the tablet
market is still in its nascent form and
no one really knows what the market will
look like a year from now you could pop
down seven hundred dollars for a
non-contract version but no one should
be paying seven hundred dollars for an
eight inch tablet with 16 gigabytes of
storage I don't recommend signing up for
a two-year contract for any tablet but
if you really feel you just have to do
it this is the tablet you want to
once again this is eric franklin and
this is in a first look at the Samsung
Galaxy Tab 7.7</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
