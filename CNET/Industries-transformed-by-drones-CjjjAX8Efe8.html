general population can be trusted not to
fly drones into the White House the age
of the drone is here and there's no
turning back there's too much money at
stake and it's not coming from hobbyists
it's coming from big business commercial
drones flown by licensed accountable
companies will transform the way
business is done around the world so
let's go beyond the toys with the top
five industries that are already being
transformed by drones starting off at
number five journalism whether it's
covering the front lines of the
battlefield or the red carpet of the
Oscars journalists and news agencies are
increasingly using drones they're like a
news helicopter for a fraction of the
price and because they're autonomous all
they need are some GPS coordinates and
they can be on the scene before reporter
can even load up the van at number four
mapping if you're surveying a
construction site or creating a 3d map
of Chichen Itza the high-resolution
cameras and sensors being packed in the
drones can capture an insane amount of
data from their environment imagine an
architect or an engineer being able to
watch the daily progress of a building
being constructed halfway around the
world with a 3d model that they can zoom
around that's pretty cool and it's
already here coming in at number three
transportation not for people but for
our stuff though you could make the
argument that self-driving cars are type
of drum for aerial drones transportation
of goods can go two ways you got your
heavy payloads using big expensive
drones we're seeing the military already
doing this to supply soldiers in the
field with unmanned full-sized
helicopters that can carry up to 6,000
pounds and then you've got your last
mile deliveries of small goods your
Amazon diaper delivery service or as
we're already seeing bags of crystal
meth which brings us to number two law
enforcement aside from leading counter
drones to take down
eisenberg helicopters expect to see more
local police and security firms use
drones for monitoring and first
responding in one way it's kind of cool
to know that if you're in trouble a
police drone could reach you in minutes
or scare the pumps off your lawn but on
the other hand the buzzing sky full of
police video cameras sounds like an
Orwellian nightmare either way it's time
to bring your pot farm indoors unless of
course your farm is legit because the
number one industry is set to be
transformed by drones is farming and I
mean real farms everything from organic
beat farms to big Agri ranches and
livestock even fish farms drones have
already proven useful for monitoring
crop growth chlorophyll density soil
quality even counting livestock
populations just crazy amount of data on
big stretches of farmland allowing
farmers to make smarter decisions and
more food for us so there you go five
industries that are poised to be
transformed by the use of commercial
drones many of which are already getting
started but that's just my opinion let
me know what you think send me a message
