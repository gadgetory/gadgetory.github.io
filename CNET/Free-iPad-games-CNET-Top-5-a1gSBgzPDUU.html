to download some games without spending
a dime you're cheap but I like it I'm
Donald bell with the top five free ipad
games picked by our Cena editors and
ranked by the may 2012 itunes download
charts starting off at number five is
bejeweled blitz popcap has been churning
out versions of this game for over a
decade and we still can't get enough
it's free it's shiny and it's extremely
addictive I think it connects with some
part of our caveman brain number four is
temple run here's another one that taps
into our primal brain but instead of
just collecting pretty shiny things
we're also running for our lives in an
ancient Mayan temple I'll download this
one just to experience the thrill of
running my ass off from the comfort of
my couch number three angry birds HD
free this thing won't die how many hours
have you spent playing suicidal birds
that green pigs and just because it's
free doesn't mean you won't be ready to
pay anything just to have the theme
music erase from your brain number two
words with friends HD free you can thank
Zynga for this one EA made a proper
license version of scrabble for the ipad
but who cares Zynga's corner of the
facebook gaming market and this app is
essentially an extension of their words
with friends facebook Empire now before
we get to the number one free iPad game
let's take a look at the number one paid
ipad game currently for may 2012 it's
bejeweled HD they want four dollars for
this game and you're downloading it like
crazy Jules first came out in 2001 under
the title diamond mine according to
wikipedia the name change was suggested
by none other than Microsoft and now the
number one ipad game as chosen by our
Cena editors and ranked by itunes is
draw something free this is a new spin
on pictionary that really takes
advantage of the iPads big friendly
scream it's a little silly not to spend
the dollar 99 for the full version but
like any good addiction sometimes you
need that free taste up front that's our
top five for this week for more like
this head over top 5 cnet com i'm donna
bell thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
