get to your message get your question we
will throw you in your show we got a ton
of people for this week as well you guys
keep on filling up our voicemail box so
we appreciate that a lot yes okay we
know tons of news this week in the Apple
world but we start off with the big one
right the Apple versus the FBI right
these two large entities and pretty much
you've had to have heard something about
this the latest in the story is that
Apple is getting a little more time to
argue against a court order that would
force it to break into the iphone of the
shooter and a terrorist attack right
this is the San Bernardino terrorist
attacks that killed 14 people an iphone
is one of the key pieces of evidence
there's like an 18 minute window of time
where FBI official officials and
investigators want to know what happened
in that window of time and they want
Apple to basically get into the iphone
so the FBI is ordering you know the
ordering Apple
to help them and basically they're
suggesting that Apple build a backdoor
into iOS which does not exist right now
in order for them to gain access to data
like this and in future situations Tim
Cook right you I'm not sure did you see
the letter Stephen of how he said no
we're not going to do this yeah he said
no we're not going to do this because it
would endanger the privacy of every
customer who has a smartphone it makes
sense to me Tim Cook's argument you know
but it is it's a slippery slope like
once you unlock one phone then they're
going to be able to unlock all phones
but the FBI's argument is that they just
want to unlock this one phone so that's
you know that's kind of that's that's
how they're trying to frame frame their
argument but you know still in the
letter Tim Cook even points out like
look we've been working with the FBI we
have people that would that work at
Apple that are dedicated to helping the
FBI when they have these kind of claims
and stuff like that so especially after
the San Bernardino tragedy so it's very
interesting what's going to happen and
they're just Apple saying no we're not
going to do it and we all know into the
right to privacy of your own information
that is a right and the whole argument
really is once you do this once you can
always say you can do this once but it's
it's never going to stop there and
here's let's just kind of like a little
history of what Apple had to go through
previously that really informed Tim Cook
of why he chose to speak out on behalf
of keeping our digital devices private
so let's say before iOS ever had any way
to get access to the data we're talking
about you know iOS 5 iOS 6 Iowa 7 there
were times where government officials
they basically would send a request to
Apple to help them to extract data from
the phones and then it would it be that
easy though right Apple would have to
bounce it back with a legal team decide
the merits of the request and what was
asked of them on a case-by-case basis
and then say okay we will work with you
on turning over this phone's data they
used to do that but as they kept on you
know
as it became a more gray situation then
it really informed them to put in
encryption that is done by the actual
user right you and me we all have a
basic right to privacy now some of the
other things that really kind of
heightened why people are sensitive
about this including Apple is everyone
knows about Edward Snowden and how he
leaked information about what the NSA
was doing but some of that information
revealed was that they had hacked you
know they were hacking into our
computers making like a kind of a their
own kind of versions of a Apple software
to try and compromise the products to
get access to the data they were
embedding spy tools and apples hardware
even like I said even modify an apple
software update that allowed the
government to analyze every keystroke
okay so they had shown in the past that
they weren't just asking Apple for
requests they were doing things on their
own to be able to gain access to our
digital devices in any way they could so
when you think of that and then you
think about okay let's move forward here
Apple help us create a way to get into
our phone but look at what they've done
historically can you know the
government's role is to keep us safe as
well as to use what other methods they
can to protect us by pulling this
information but there's also a right to
privacy it's that it's that battle so
I'm all behind what Tim Cook said Google
sundar Pichai chimed in also was in
alignment with Tim Cook us jack dorsey
of twitter and others also are in
alignment with Tim Cook and this is a
big this is a big issue technology has
changed how we live our lives it's it's
not the same you can't it's the way that
they track people everyone uses their
devices now is instead of like they are
there still credit cards there's still
emails but our digital devices hold so
much personal information that's what
you have to really use to be able to
kind of sometimes get this data but I
still don't think we should build a
backdoor know like Tim Cook sees the
iphone almost as an extension of you you
know it's like it's your identity in
there a lot of personal information
financial banking information
everything so I I totally agree with
what he's saying it's tough it's tough
to say that you don't want the FBI to
help catch terrorists but you know yet
it goes deeper than that right yeah it's
so complex it's like really hard to say
that but I mean they who knows what
could happen they can crack in the phone
and find nothing but you know i'm all
about privacy and keeping our phones
safe you know from everybody from all
kinds of hackers when I even look at
this overall story of the two terrorists
in San Bernardino they had kind of an
accomplice on the outside who they who
they have you know arrested they have in
custody but will those eat we know a lot
about their movements what they were
doing now how they prepared for this
attack but do we do those 18 minutes
will they change anything right yeah you
know they will they really change
anything and so by building this key to
get into your phone just to get a sneak
peek of 18 minutes that at least the FBI
claims that are blind to but they have
all really all these other pieces just
to get a better understanding I don't
even at that I don't see that it's a
valid argument yeah this this is
probably gonna go all the way up to the
highest court you know this might be
more for sure Supreme Court so we'll see
we'll keep stay tuned to see that will
be on top of this course yeah the
deadline for Apple to respond to this
court order is now februari 26th it was
originally going to be five days from
the request which would have placed that
Tuesday I'm up next week I believe five
business five business days at least so
um Apple has that I just wanted to kind
of quickly just for listeners who you
know because it helped me kind of to
really understand how does Apple protect
the phone versus what the FBI is really
requesting so there's just like a few
points of really how Apple initially
protects the phone first of all right a
user can enable an iphone to completely
wipe its data after 10 incorrect
passcode attempts you've done that where
you've totally forgot your password just
keep on hitting a kid in and hit it and
then finally once you do it over and
over and over there is an option to
erase the data you don't have to but
that's one of the ways Apple protects
your iPhone also
your pass code that you you enter in the
second thing is this pass code is works
in tandem with a unique ID that's
actually fused into the phone right like
a think of it as like a alphanumeric
seal number that knows that this
passcode is with this specific phone
that Apple and its suppliers do not know
so the pass code that we enter is then
coat it into our phone but no one knows
it except us the person who put in the
passcode right that's the protection
that the FBI wants to break the other
aspect of this is that iOS adds an 80
millisecond delay between passcode
attempts so let tech this out if you it
would take you five and a half years to
try every lowercase letter and number
combination on a new iphone 6s in order
to break that so you're not going to 5.5
years versus 80 millisecond delay
between passcode attempt this it's
literally impossible okay so those are
the three ways that's it through a I
mean maybe you could be you could
totally screw up and just you know get
locked out of your phone forever and
then you're screwed look like the
easiest thing you could probably break
and a half of everyone's phones with the
pass code 1234 0000 so I shouldn't be
worried about that now this is what the
FBI actually wants from Apple themselves
they want to disable the auto erase
function so that it would permit
unlimited passcode attempts why would
they want this they also what the FBI
also wants to be able to submit pass
codes to the iphone via a fit you know
through its like lightning port and then
use something like a Bluetooth or Wi-Fi
or other device to basically enter in
the number so for example right now you
can only physically press them with your
finger right yeah they want to be able
to use like a machine to plug into the
iphone to enter in all these codes as
many as possible right a computer just
totally trying to hack you know just
trying to find the right number
combinations forever exactly and then
they also want to remove the automated
delays between a passcode attempt so
they don't want to put this 80
millisecond delay in between it so that
you basically could
brute force entry what we mean by brute
force is right just hit every
combination possible until you hit it to
get access to the iphone I've seen it
impossible enough times to know this is
a bad idea where they put in like a code
like a little card and do think again
finds the numbers you know I know this
this is a bad idea so John Connor had
that back in Terminator 2 I saw what
happened in that movie all right I don't
want that yeah I do not want that
Armageddon people so um and then just to
kind of wrap this story up I did throw
up a poll on my Twitter account at
bryant on not trying to plug it if you
guys have comments or thoughts that you
want to bring up during the show just
tweet me at brian Tong I look at it
while the show is going on but here's
kind of a look at the poll on the result
we had 922 people respond and you know
because it's not the easiest thing just
that you you think about it but it is
gray fifteen percent believe that Apple
should build a backdoor for iPhones
while eighty-five percent of our
respondents said no so you know Steven
and I are when we are on the side note
again I see your argument for why we
should give the FBI access I just think
it goes beyond this case it's more of a
long-term what will the government do
with that power right yeah just a side
note 2 is that someone mentioned it in
the livestream comments actually in the
livestream chat if you're watching on
live stream that government is the
Congress is meeting today and they're
talking about ways to change this law
about encryption so that they will be
able to get into phones in the future
they won't have to get FBI they won't
have to get you know letters from the
FBI to get into to get people to unlock
phone so let's look for that we got to
keep an eye on that too because that's
that's going down right now like they're
talking about it today in Congress yeah
there's the thing is that laws are going
to change based on app you know how we
live our lives but some of you know the
constitutional rights that we have look
I'm sure they're able to get access to
the emails of these terrorists that's
not locked by the phone right if they
wanted to know every single location
these people were based on their phone
in that 18 minute window may
that helped them but you know they still
have access to credit card statements
phone activity emails and then general
surveillance cameras you can still piece
together a puzzle from that alone you
still use cell towers to pinpoint where
they were while they're using their cell
phones is that still worked where they
use like three different towers
triangulation yes i'm pretty sure i
think that that's still a thing right
I've seen 24 they still definitely do
that yeah this is just where ever your
phone pings a tower then they can find
those three towers and I see ya so uh
you know we'll keep we'll keep an eye on
this store I mean this is something
that's gonna have future implications
it's a big story and it just so happens
that you know Tim Cook and Apple is at
the center of this it's almost kind of
like the tech world versus you know the
government right now yeah because all
right it's Twitter it's like that one
burner with so many tech companies right
now SpaceX uber everyone everyone's
fighting the government so so just a lot
of implications I mean it's a really
intriguing story to me it's why we can
talk about so much we'd love to hear
what you guys and gals think about this
to me I'm not about saying there is a
right answer or a wrong answer I just
want to hear what your your thoughts are
so you can call us at one eight hundred
61 62 63 and see how I to scroll up and
look at the phone up I was like I saw
wine for it on the screen eight hun tray
everyone can see that I didn't even I
can't remember this stuff all the time
so just give us a call we we can't wait
cuz we're gonna I'm sure when I hear
from a lot of you about this issue but
let's just keep on rolling on last week
we talked about error 53 this was the
issue where people that might get their
iPhones serviced by a third party
company I did talk about like if you're
screening room at screen was broken but
really it up and it was incorrect right
it really applies to the home button in
addition you know getting damaged
there's a cable connector to that home
but to that home button but again it's
also the touch ID button that stores all
of your touch ID data and recently we
had heard right applebrick to all phones
that were that were not able to validate
that this was an authentic
well Apple is apologizing and has
released an update to the latest iOS and
this is not a new version of iOS it's
it's still like nine point two point one
but it's an updated version to restore
any iphones that have been just been
disabled by error 53 wow that's pretty
awesome that's that's a good Apple man I
have to be honest though I think they're
doing this as well to get ahead of the
fact that there's been a lawsuit filed
like a class-action lawsuit filed
against them and this is kind of a
pre-emptive way to say hey we actually
realize we made a mistake we're gonna
make sure the consumers are okay we're
gonna let them know about this but this
is what we'll do for now you know like
if there was no lawsuit I don't know if
we'd actually see them fix this I don't
know totally it's definitely a
write-once and how long ago did this all
come to light maybe like six months ago
well well actually the air 53 I mean
only became a really big issue about a
couple weeks ago because the latest
software update iOS a nine point two
point one when it was released people
are like why our phones breaking now all
of a sudden like what is this air it's
just a little patch then that's cool
exactly exactly so they're not changing
the number to like iOS point nine point
two point one non brick edition it's
like just iOS 921 non brick addition the
good one the good one so if you if for
any of you listening or know people that
are having this issue you can go get
that restored with the latest and
updated iOS all right this is another
story just a lot of stuff happening in
the courts with government entities
federal entities like the FCC which this
has been kind of I like what about for a
while I love this story right what the
FCC just took really the biggest first
step towards changing the cable box
business so in a two to three vote sorry
a 3-2 tuvo very close from the FCC very
close the FCC has decided to move ahead
with a proposal that would have
far-reaching consequences for how Cable
customer
like you and I watch TV allowing us
potentially to go through third parties
for their set-top systems yes rather
than being tied to the cable box that
comes with the cable service that we all
know we are at the moment required to
use yes right which would be awesome
because I pay like a ten-dollar HD fee
for my stupid cable box you do like
where she did what is that an HD fee
come on on top of a rental fee for the
box yeah exactly okay I mean you instead
of just paying a flat like let's say
really those boxes are probably like
they're just interpreting the signal
it's like those boxes are prob like
seventy nine hundred dollars like
flattered so cheap like they they're
likely even cheaper than that actually
yeah they're like they're sitting on the
piles at the comcast cable set or
whatever you know but and then also
it'll take in your signal in a little
some in some cases make your signal
crappier you know yeah like if it's
straight out of the wall you get a
really nice signal to your TV but if
it's going through the box and it looks
a little like the refresh rate is
screwed up and it just doesn't look as
clean so so what does this mean for us
right we have been begging this is
actually an opportunity if this goes
through for companies like Samsung for
companies like Google for obviously
apple with their whole apple TV push to
basically ideally in the future for us
build their own cable set-top box that
then just takes the signal from the wall
and then we use whatever cool kick-butt
software they have to allow us to watch
those cable streams and we wanna team
stuff to our phone I'm sure that's gonna
be all yeah it's a great stuff it would
be at based as well you know yet the
cable companies have argued that the
future like by allowing this to happen
they're saying oh it could leave us
entirely behind and I'm like dude cable
box companies let's be real other than
other than I mean I finally got to use
the x1 interface I'm like wow I feel
like I'm in the future ish for comcast
but cable boxes have been in our homes
for what 20 30 years yeah at least 20
plus years 30 years yeah and really have
we really seen n
innovation not really with cable boxes
not really until like literally 2015 yes
nicely I'm not even King right we had
all dingy menus it was they were slow
they still finally were you may next one
looks is it yeah I haven't been likes 1x
one is actually looks nicer but it's
slower it has voice speech where you can
be like uh sorry since we are CBS own
company CBS and then it all I go to the
go to the network I'm like okay even
though I could just punch in the numbers
but see there the cable companies like
should be worried about this they've had
the opportunity of a lifetime there a
box that's in every living room they
could have done so much more with them
right so even some I could imagine I
really envision something like the Xbox
one that has the ability to put in cable
but it's kind of restricted because you
have the way that it talks to those the
cable operator that you're with forget
that in the future you just pop in your
cable signal and then it's like this
really cool elegant interface that feels
cohesive with the entire set top box
that you're using yeah that would be
awesome man like you know I'm dealing
with a crappy-looking cable the one
thing that that would you would have to
lose is like on demand sort of things
you know like Comcast on demand stuff so
I mean that would that be some things
you'd have to be able to live without
but um Xbox is already cut has already
been doing this too right they have you
can use your Xbox as a cable set-top box
well the main thing is like you're right
about the whole on demand feature but my
my take is that look because most of
these set-top boxes will have a hard
drive of some sort then as long as you
basically program your set-top third
party set-top box to record whatever you
know that's kind of like you're on
demand cuz you you kind of know the
shows i don't know i don't know how many
times I've actually gone into onto man
and said I'm gonna go find a brand new
show to watch you might you know it
helps you but more often than not I go
to on demand to find shows that i
actually already watched i just want to
watch them later that's because i
haven't because i haven't recorded them
right yeah that's how that's how i use
it to i never go looking
for any new content on demand that's for
sure I mean sometimes a friend says oh
take the show out but ice and then I'll
like dvr'd or something but you know
it's it does serve a purpose i'm not
saying on on demand is great with kids
though because they just go into that
disney thing and they just watch like
shows right that's like fun two mature
babysitter but really as you move toward
more app based stuff you get access to
like disney's the content through their
app and all these other you know comcast
has an appt themselves they're not going
to limit you from using that either if
you already pay for the cable service
right i can look at comcast stuff
through my digital device already so um
right now what what this where this is
at is this proposed rule change is going
into what they call a comment period
where basically businesses and customers
are going to be able to weigh in on the
issue this will be a head other of
revisions before they come to a final
vote so we're still months away to me
this is exciting as a consumer it's a
no-brainer for a consumer it's still a
close three-to-two vote you know but
it's it's been it's being moved along
and this is better than anything we've
seen in i don't know how many years
right yeah that's very cool i think also
do another issue that might come up is
that you know you have this idea of like
oh yeah everyone will be able to be able
to build like their own third-party
cable set-top box let's be real its
gonna be like Google Apple and Samsung
or something yeah although it opens it
up its gonna be like three companies i
basically become the you know the cream
of the crop right yeah totally but it's
also gonna have to pay a subscription
fee for cable box i'm okay with that i'm
super happy about that plea no gonna
happen and i don't know I feel like
apples always complain about because the
cable industry is very like tricky and
you know for example comcast has a more
dom / dominance in certain areas of the
same city where then like time warner
they have like kind of like agreements
row yeah you take this area you take
that area you take this area and you're
forced to use you know a cable service
based on where you live not because I
I want comcast at my fiancé's apartment
guess what there is no comcast here only
time order that's right that sucks very
regional yeah right so you you then
eliminate that aspect as well which
which is awesome it's all good more
innovation let's do it it's all good in
the hood um another cool story as we
continue on just a little update about
the iphone 5s ii and the ipad air three
a bloomberg feature recently profiled
Johnny scroogie he's the apple chief
chip designer basically responsible for
designing the a9 processor the a
processor and they kind of did this
profile about what they went through and
how basically there was a point in time
where they were behind the schedule in
making a processor for the ipad pro and
they were worried that oh man we're
gonna we might have to put it a less
powerful a8 chip in the ipad pro while
the iphone 6 coming out has an 89 so
they like basically truncated their
schedule were able to crank out an a 9 x
processor for the ipad pro in half the
time it was kind of like talking about
that the challenges and how Apple
decided to start making their own
silicone so um this is this is just a
story about that but in the story it
revealed that and pretty much confirmed
that the ipad air 3 which is expected to
come out in March and the iPad iPhone
5se which is expected to also be
announced sometime in March Oh we'll be
using an a 9 processor for the phone and
an a 9 X processor for the ipad so there
you go that's awesome so we got a lot of
phone calls asking about the new iPads
and processors so there you go there's
your information I like this uh this
article looks really cool actually yeah
it's a really cool profile some nice
photography in there the server room
there in it's crazy it's like a bigger
that's like a modeling shot man okay
okay just a few more quick stories just
before we get to your calls global
SmartWatch shipments have finally
overtaken swish swish swish swish can
you say Swiss watch really fast I bet
you
swoosh swoosh swish watch it becomes one
word let's let's do it another contest
guys you call us I let's see who can say
swish Swiss watch shipments yes whistle
Swiss watch shipments five times fast
it's impossible swoosh washing miss you
can't do it I can't if someone
successfully calls us 1 800 61 62 63 and
leaves us a very clean Swiss watch
shipments five times fast we're gonna
give you a price we're gonna give you
something I'm gonna hook you up ok so I
get back sax whilst ready yeah I got
this so um for the first time
smartwatches have surpassed Swiss watch
sales um apple the Apple watch itself
captured sixty-three percent of that
global market which is an estimated 5.1
million sales in the third quarter
samsung trailed with about sixteen
percent with an estimated 1.3 million
sales basically Apple and Samsung
together accounted for eight of intent
of all smartwatches shipped but yeah
yeah it's it's a big deal Smart Watch so
let me see this real quickly um if I oh
man I can't I can't pull it up right now
but a percentage percentage wise er I at
least basically in total sales global
smart watches rose from a net from to an
estimated 8.1 million units whereas
Swiss watch sales total 7.9 it's the
first time they've been down compared to
8.3 million the quarter before and so
now we're kind of finally seen that that
point where their one's going down one's
going up my hands aren't even moving the
right direction that's crazy I wonder if
that's gonna like if Swiss watches you
know the value of them is going to
increase like you know they're like
antique cars or something that night air
I totally see that happening that's
eventually that's kind of cool all of a
sudden all of a sudden because you said
that next quarter they're like Swiss
watch sales have surpassed ails ya t
tonight yeah it's totally like good
extra crunchy podcast it started right
here it started right here so that's
kind of another another cool tidbit uh
and then just a couple other small kind
of things going on with Apple Apple is
offering a new payment plan they have
basically like three different kind of
training payment plans but this one is a
new one where basically you can trade up
your old iPhone or even android phone or
Windows Phone apply that value of the
device to a new iphone and then pay off
your new gadget in installments over 24
months it's only applied to the US
stores right now in apple soars physical
apple stores in the US so it's a new
plan it's not like this has nothing to
do with their um the the whole plan
where you just like trade in your phone
straight up to four amount of dollars
based on how much it's been damaged this
is a trade up and then spread the
remaining costs over 20 months 24 months
to you so you know just giving us
options this is the plan that I dodged
by one day when I was in Detroit when I
did the upgrading it was like the last
day you can upgrade and I dodged it I'm
so happy dang that that's very good
that's super good and then finally just
for macbook users uh I don't know if I
actually know a lot of you have been
probably affected by something like this
but apples extended their macbook pro
repair extension program this dates back
to 15 inch macbook pros and 17-inch
macbook pros sold between two thousand
eleven and two thousand thirteen okay
that had problems with this like
flickering lyonie distorted video the
remember that basically the repair
program was set to expire as a februari
27th I believe this month but they've
extended it one more year so you know
pretty much four years to get this issue
fix or if it pops up there taking care
of you it's a good thing that they
extended here I actually typically three
years after four years after I mean
people are looking for the laptop around
four years or five years yeah i mean i
know some of y'all are looking for a
laptop like every six months but this
doesn't apply to you
yeah that was quite rich people don't
listen to this don't list this is that
they're like this is a useless story cuz
I'm rich okay um Julie yo check out the
phone calls at all everyone's been
calling us with ya thank you guys for
calling in we have a few here and the
first one is from mike from canada hey
this is mike from canada my question is
where do you see the ipod in regards to
light the ipod nano and the ipod shuffle
from a year from now thank you love the
podcast and see ya oh sorry go ahead
come on Beachum now it's kitty oh canada
baby um where do we see the ipod it's
it's still I mean still kicking huh it's
still there fill out and kicking it's
still there ish but what about like the
old like traditional ipod is that like
i'm not talking about the one with the
screen but you know like a traditional
just music ipod does that still exist
it's kind of really more like the ipod
touch now okay i mean you can still
there's you can still get i mean
basically if i recall right i swear i'm
pretty sure they stopped they
discontinued the ipod classic which is
like the last remnant of that is that
was and it was because of the parts yeah
they did they that was a our last Apple
Keynote thing that we did right yeah it
was like I think they did it yeah I feel
like they did it again that somewhere
like the end of 2014 ish maybe early
2015 but they're like it's been about a
year right there like or maybe a little
more than that but I'm i know they
discontinued the ipod classic so I mean
if he's asking what's gonna happen more
to the ipod touch in the shuffle I think
they're going to still exist they're
just going to maybe get a processor
boosts every two years I mean they're
not going to keep on iterating those
anymore at least the ipod touch they
haven't really they'll add new colors
but I there's going to always be at
least a spot
the ipod touch because there are still
kids that a parent is not going to buy
them a phone yet and so that's like an
entertainment device they can still
message people but they just aren't
gonna set him up with like a cell phone
plan yet yeah that's like my brother I'm
gonna do yeah my brother-in-law his my
niece has an ipod touch and then she has
one of those um like Wi-Fi hotspots
that's connected to a carrier but it's
limited data and she knows that and so
she can use it once in a while but it's
not like it's a true phone all the time
and you don't have to pay you know like
70 80 bucks a month for that so yeah I
think that you know man I I mean Beecham
you're gonna you're gonna you're gonna
feel that that's gonna hit your wallet
oh yeah you get there man yet I'm still
working out with my ipad 3g
third-generation wait wait you're you
said ipad yeah i still have my that's
all my kids like that's what my gave my
kids become oh I say the regeneration I
thought you said you work out like no
it's still were like yeah i thought i
meant i thought you meant like you work
out at the gym with the night no no no
no never never will do that that would
look ridiculous alright next phone call
is about a video brian just made
recently actually hey grind hey
everybody um I just I saw your you're in
your video on netflix how is thinking
it's like secure beloved very romantic
very touching video anyway I've been
thinking about what what if you're with
your boo and you want to share a song
with them you know you might be walking
by the University and she might be in
her other place wherever and you want to
share a song together I was thinking
about that is there an iOS app for that
kind of see maybe maybe Brian you could
do another video about music he's really
he's really feeling yelling that way
into it um there-there is actually I
didn't really feature it because I I
kind of like the idea of just like
one big full screen experience when
watching Netflix but there's basically a
nap and people are like oh why don't you
show off rabbit it's if you go to the
website are a BB dot IT it's called
rabbit it's an iOS app i believe it's
also an available on Android as well but
it's an app that'll let you watch things
like Netflix let you watch things like
youtube and send music and you can sync
it and there's also like a video chat
component involved in it it works on
mobile devices it does also work on your
desktop I just like the the other
feature for people that don't know what
he's talking about i did a video about
how to sync netflix with your
long-distance lover and so the website
that i go to it only works in the chrome
browser but it's called show-goers dot
TV it's spelled like it sounds and
basically you add an extension from
showgoers TV and then whenever you watch
Netflix you can send a link to someone
that is also in the Chrome browser that
also has this extension and they
instantly jump into your Netflix with
you and you guys can watch it together
and chattering it's super cool and I
like the fact that you can throw your
image from your laptop to a TV screen
and then just hang back and sit and
watch it so um rabbit is another one RAB
bi t that's not the one that works on
multiple devices by it's like a big
screen experience when I'm watching my
netflix so um yeah there's the answer
that's cool go do it with your boo or
your BAE alright a couple more calls
here we go hey Brian you didn't get ya
next Ivan and you wave oof yes why will
the next iPhone be waterproof it'll be
water-resistant well existent you can
splash water on it our current iphones
water-resistant right now they are they
are to a certain degree i mean there
have been test where people they see
like you although they don't recommend
it and they never will outright say it's
waterproof where you can put it in water
and it'll still work for a while I think
like there's a video where a guy put his
iphone underwater for like 20 or 30
minutes and it still worked perfectly
fine
afterwards something that I'm not going
to do but um yeah you know their water
resistant but they'll never i don't
think i don't making an iphone
completely waterproof would probably
increase the size of it by point one
millimeters and I don't think that's
something apples willing to yeah no
it'll be heavier too so it's just one of
those it's just one of those things okay
here's our last call of the day for bj
and I need to buy my Jesus just gonna
have all this success features are six
features but in the 5s form and probably
going to have a rose gold edition by so
