vehicle today a couple things to
understand we're talking about a Pamella
fuel cell proton exchange membrane
that's what goes on inside this box
shape thing about yeah it's not very
large secondly it's hydrogen fuel in
other words you're putting hydrogen in
on one side to create the chemical
reaction this generates the electricity
hydrogen from a tank in the car is
exposed to a plate coated in platinum on
one side of a sort of sandwich the
Platinum plate causes the hydrogen to
break up into positive protons and
negative electrons a membrane in the
middle of this sandwich only allows the
positive ones to get through so those
negative electrons have to go around
that circuit creates the positive and
negative poles the potential that makes
the electric current when the electrons
and protons do meet on the other side
they combine with oxygen from the air to
form h2o and a huge PR win for hydrogen
backers so what's a like driving a fuel
cell car just like driving an electric
car because remember a fuel cell is a
source of electricity powered by a very
clean very abundant fuel but it is not
the powertrain source that moves the car
that's a difference so really when it
comes down to is electric cars that fork
two ways one toward hydrogen fuel-cell
one toward battery electric the big
difference here is when you go to refill
it's a whole another world so the
benefits number one clean hydrogen fuel
cell electric cars emit nothing but
water vapor and not much of it this is
like a week's worth of driving and yes
it is clean enough to drink
number two renewable hydrogen is the
most abundant thing
earth I'm told 75% of the mass of the
planet is hydrogen found in things all
around us
it's found in water it's found in plant
material and it's bounded everything
that's a hydrocarbon convenient
refilling a hydrogen fuel cell car takes
a few minutes at the pump
compared to hours plugged in for most
electric charges it's quick clean and
easy and not you're on your way in less
than five minutes
now some challenges first distribution
hydrogen to be useful as a fuel in a
fuel cell car needs to be highly
compressed but naturally it wants to be
14 times lighter than air it wants to be
very gaseous and low density so it's got
to be managed
it's got to be created has to be
compressed has to be kept in that state
from the point where it's stored to the
point where it's put into the vehicle
that makes it trickier than gasoline
which is very happy to be this oily
liquid it's lives underneath your
service station durability current
hydrogen fuel cells are good for maybe a
hundred thousand miles before they're
spent that's rather below what consumers
expect from a gas or diesel number three
pollution now just told you that
hydrogen fuel cell cars are incredibly
clean but creating the hydrogen may not
be depending where you live and what
kind of a source you're a local filling
station has for the hydrogen there is
upstream pollution created much as there
is with battery electric cars it'll vary
widely by how and where you refill the
Holy Grail is to run solar powered
plants that crack water into hydrogen
making no upstream pollution and using a
virtually unlimited resource this
station in Emeryville makes its hydrogen
from solar power and water in a process
called electrolysis other stations make
their fuel on site for instance from
waste water or even landfill gas cost
fuel cells catalytic converters and
wedding rings
none of them are cheap because they all
use a bunch of platinum
devine automakers who are members of the
fuel cell partnership are starting to
introduce their commercial vehicles some
of them are for lease now and limited
areas where there are stations but we're
hearing them talk about starting to sell
them in just about 18 months and 2015
that sort of OEM loss leadership will be
key but perhaps more than any other
alternative vehicle hydrogen fuel cell
cars will need leadership from
government to foster a new network of
fueling points and supporting
infrastructure
