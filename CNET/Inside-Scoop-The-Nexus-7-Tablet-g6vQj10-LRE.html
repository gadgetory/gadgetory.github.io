editor at cnet eric franklin Eric thanks
for joining us no problem so last week
at Google i/o a lot of people were able
to get their hands on the so called
Google tablet the Nexus 7 and you've
been reviewing it since then first of
all did you get it on wednesday I did I
did did you wait in line no I didn't
have to wait on line they had a special
that's a seven waiting for I see the VIP
line yeah exactly that's why okay i
called it I saw the 45-minute line i
said i'll pick mine up on me i'm glad i
have to wait in that so tell me what you
think of it I like it I don't know if
you see my review but I gave it four
stars and I like it a lot I think it's
fast i think is really comfortable i
think is really well designed i love
android 4.1 not i'm not even a fan of
the android OS but i really really love
what they've done with the latest
jasmine less yeah yeah the one thing I I
have noticed that the battery kind of
dreams kind of fast but i noticed that
yeah yeah i've been using my not mention
it's already down to a quarter of its
battery my eyes it's kind of weird and
right now and then lads we're conducting
some official test so we'll see what
happens with that but right now it's it
does seem to drain pretty fast anything
else you don't like besides the battery
life um well I don't really like how the
home screen doesn't rotate that's a
little weird and I kind of I can kind of
understand why Google did that it's kind
of a safety net for people who aren't
used to the android OS and that can be
kind of intimidating but you know you
have this long as you press the home
button don't worry you'll go back to the
home page and it'll look exactly how you
know you're expected to look it won't be
in landscape mode won't be and it'll be
in portrait mode and it look exactly how
you left it so it's kind of a don't get
intimidated by this presses button
you'll be fine okay now a lot of people
are saying oh Google's going after Apple
with this it's an iPad competitor but to
me given the size and the price 199
dollars it seems to really be going
after the kindle correct yeah i think so
too i think that two hundred dollar
price I think Google's kind of focus on
on media you know at Google i/o they
announced that they're going to be
I know having they were they were going
to allow purchase purchasable movies on
google play participant EV shows before
they were just rentals they now have
magazines on google play so i think that
that is sending a clear message that yes
we're going after the Kindles market and
finally how does this change the tablet
market if you're if you're out to buy a
tablet what would your recommendation be
who should buy this who should buy this
I think people that don't like carrying
around 10 inch tablets in your purse or
in their backpack I think that people
who don't like the restrictiveness of
the ipad and iOS android 4.1 is just as
flexible as it was in four point oh it's
just a little bit more user friendly
than it was before and people who don't
want to spend a lot of money on the
tablet yeah this is a great tablet to
get what I do like about it as a size as
you mentioned I mean I can see myself
carrying this around much more than I
would my iPad but I'm not crazy about
the fact that it's Wi-Fi only yeah you
know I'm not too crazy about that I mean
for me I don't carry around tablets in
my bag I'm you know I use my for your
nursing well my purse we can go into
that later but but nope so I don't
really have a need for a 4G or 3g tablet
but I can understand people who just
want to have everything at all times and
access everything that could be kind of
a bummer for them yeah those greedy
people who want it all yes yes that's me
I guess you're one of them Eric thank
you so much for joining us and for your
insight no problem for seen it I'm Sumi
das thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
