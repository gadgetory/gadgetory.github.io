and this is a battle between two windows
eight Ultrabook laptops with
touchscreens that are unlike any other
and you know what i'm just gonna call
them touch tops it's a prize five punch
out between the Lenovo yoga 13 and the
Zeus Taichi 21 our judges for this fight
are senior editor Dan the man Ackerman
senior associate editor Scott the bottom
line Stein and Brian can't go wrong Tom
that will take all three judges blind
scores and average the mounts the
nearest tenth each round the final prize
fight score will be an average of all
rounds using the same system let's get
this party started round 1 is design the
yoga 13 looks pretty much like most
lenovo laptops with its really clean
lines and a soft textured body it brings
a nice 13.3 inch display that's heavier
in weight at three point four pounds but
it really Wow's you with its flip around
tablet design that goes all the way
around this is truly one of the most
unique designs you'll ever see now the
asou statue 21 brings a tight compact
design with a real classy black glossy
lid and an angular body with beveled
edges it weighs in at a lighter 2.8
pounds but there's a surprise the lid is
also a screen that's right this guy has
two 11.6 inch screens business in the
front party in the back the two screen
concept is great in theory but the
outside of a laptop takes the most
damage and it's a smudgy fingerprint
magnet mess it's one of the rare times
I'm taking function
looks the yoga 13 takes this round with
the floor and the Taichi 21 gets a 3.7
next round his features the yoga 13
brings a 1.7 gigahertz core i5 processor
with 8 gigs of RAM a full size HDMI port
2 USBS and an SD card slot but let's be
real its biggest feature is that the
yoga 13 has more poses than Panda
Express has menu options put it on your
lap stand it on a table use it like a
laptop read it like a book or wear it
like a hat it's not called the yoga for
nothing and this thing is flexible
now the Taichi 21 in this price fight
has been configured with a 1.9 gigahertz
core i7 processor and 4 gigs of RAM
you'll get micro HDMI a mini VGA port
and 2 USB ports but the biggest feature
here is its two screens in one design
and almost no other laptop has had that
feature but the inner screen doesn't
have touch and it's a killer omission
now sure it doesn't sound like a big
deal until you use this guy and you get
frustrated with the disconnected
experience Windows 8 was made to be
touched and on top of that using both
screens is controlled by a clunky
utility in the desktop that includes a
mirror mode and dual screen mode that
might be useful in only a handful of
situations
now seuss really swung for the fences
here but decided not to round all the
bases the Lenovo yoga 13 gets another 4
and the asou statue 21 gets a 3.3 so
after averaging 2 rounds the yoga 13 has
the lead the next round is performance
the tight 21 is a more expensive
configuration that brings a faster CPU
and no surprise here it's faster in most
of our benchmarks it's shined in the
multimedia multitasking test and
slightly edged out the yoga 13 in the
Apple iTunes encoding test but it wasn't
too significant of a performance leap in
fact the yoga 13 actually took the
Photoshop cs5 processing test showing
that it's a solid performer our judges
give the tie to 21 this round with a 4
and the yoga 13 gets a 3.7 round 4 is
the all-important battery right in our
video playback battery drain test the
yoga 13 was the clear winner with 5 and
a half hours of video playback which is
solid for an ultrabook but not bad or
great now the Taichi 21 ran for about an
hour less at just under four and a half
hours of playback and if you want to try
using both screens at the same time it
goes down one more hour to 3 and a half
hours and that's if you even use both
screens at the same time now the judges
all agree here lenovo takes another
round with a 4 and the asou sets a 3 so
after averaging 4 rounds the yoga 13
still has the lead the final round that
decides it all is value you'll be paying
over 1 grand for either of these touch
tops but with the yoga 13 that starts at
$1,099 you'll be getting one of the best
values in a Windows 8 laptop right now
with its super versatility and solid
performance the isuzu 21 still comes in
at a price that's not outrageous
starting at $12.99 for two screens but
this product falls short because of the
disconnect in the user experience and
its execution with its dual screens
there will be people who love its unique
design but the yoga 13 is a better value
right now in the final round lenovo
takes this one with the 4
three and the suit I cheat gets a two
point seven so let's average out all
five rounds and in a prize fight where
Lenovo jumped on top early a sous was
still able to take around but it wasn't
nearly enough and the Lenovo yoga 13
takes this battle for to three point
three and is your prize fight winner
both of these touch tops are bold new
designs and it will really be
interesting to see how this product
category of all's now sous brought a
real clever proof-of-concept and we'll
see if the next-gen for them perfects
that idea but right now it's the yoga 13
that takes the title of king of the Ring
i'm brian tom thanks for watching we'll
catch you guys next time for another
prizefight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
