appliances here at the neato bought back
85 now the first thing you might notice
about this robot vacuum is that it looks
a lot like the XV line models we've
tested before but it's not this one is
599 dollars and it's the highest end of
the new Bott vac line one clear thing
that will distinguish bot bags from XV
line is that all of the bot packs are
white with a brightly colored accent on
the top here but the most exciting
changes are really things that you can't
see at first glance one cool thing is
that Neto made its bin capacity bigger
and it's filters bigger that means that
you won't have to empty out the dustbin
quite as often and that the filter will
be collecting more because it's bigger
neo also made its main brushes bigger
you still have the same pet hair brush
in the same standard blade brush but
they're much longer about an inch longer
and that means that they go closer to
the wall and they can clean those edges
more efficiently but the thing I love
the most is that they added a side brush
to this design it's on the right side of
the vacuum sort of like the Roomba and
it's great for cleaning those edges it
gets even closer than the larger brush
already does usability is pretty much
the same the buttons are a little bit
different instead of a start button over
here you have the home button that just
wakes up the bot and press it again to
initiate just a regular old cleaning
cycle pretty simple performance was
interesting too with all these updates
and the new side brush you'd expect it
to do better and it did as far as
performance goes the existing nito's are
really really good this one's even
better it still did great with the pet
hair it did about the same on the sand
test but one thing that really stood out
was the rice test we did on all the
flooring surfaces it collected more rice
than any neato ever has and that was
actually an area where nito's had
struggled in the past so if you're
already thinking about getting a neato
and can spend 599 dollars this is a
great option but if you're thinking
about getting a Roomba I think this is a
more interesting comparison because the
Roomba 880 cost $6.99 this one's $5.99
and it has really similar features and
it did just as well so this really could
be the best neato yet thanks for
watching I'm Megan will
