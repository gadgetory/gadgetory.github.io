interesting with its portable Bluetooth
speakers instead of completely redoing
its line its upgrading certain models
with a water resistant design and simply
adding a plus to their product names in
this case we're taking a look at the
charge 2 plus which except for the color
of its logo looks identical to last
year's charge 2 which also cost - $150
but has since come down in price like
its predecessors you can lay this
speaker down horizontally or stand it up
vertically it charges via microUSB and
has a built-in 6,000 milliamp battery
for 12 hours of playback and a USB port
for charging your smart phone or music
player there's a built-in speakerphone
it works well so long as you stay within
about five to ten feet of the microphone
and a social sharing mode that allows
multiple users to connect to the speaker
with their devices and alternate playing
tracks the speaker is powered by two 7.5
watt drivers which gives you a total of
15 watts of power that's pretty decent
for speaker this size and the charge -
plus plays surprisingly loud and unlike
the original charge - I reviewed it's
tuned better and delivers a cleaner
sound with tighter bass my only gripe is
that it's ports aren't sealed off which
means that if you drop it in a pool or
really get it soaked it will be a
problem and I don't think I fully trust
using it in the shower perhaps we'll get
full waterproofing in the charge three
but for now this isn't much of an
upgrade over the charge - but at least
this speaker doesn't have the distortion
issues that kept me from giving the
charge to a more positive review when it
first launched I'm David Carr noise
that's the JBL charge 2 plus thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
