year's CES was the Intel compute stick
tiny device about the science but chunky
USB key did you can plug into any
monitor or a television and turn it into
a fairly basic desktop computer so of
course this year we're back with the
second generation of the Intel compute
stick and I've got it right here still
very slim very tiny it's basically got
an HDMI output on one end right here and
you plug it into the HDMI port on your
television on your monitor the big
improvements this time are that it has
two USB ports instead of just one so if
you want to connect a dongle for let's
say a keyboard and a mouse and they're
separate or a keyboard mouse combo and
something else you have an extra port
they're very handy faster Wi-Fi because
it's got Anto 2011 AC instead of the
older end and of course it's got an
updated version of intel's anna
processor so it should be a little bit
faster
still not going to be your all-day
everyday computer now if you think this
looks very slim and sleek and just plug
it in and go but you do need a couple of
accessories with it if you need some
extra clearance to get the hdmi cable in
it comes with an HDMI extender that's
pretty handy and of course it needs
power so you do have to have a little
power brick and cable also so you gotta
chain all this stuff kind of together
but still hide it behind your TV still a
fairly easy way to get streaming video
or any other online stuff you want on
your TV or on your monitor this guys
going to be available now suggested
retail price 159 dollars at CES 2016
that is the second generation Intel
compute stick</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
