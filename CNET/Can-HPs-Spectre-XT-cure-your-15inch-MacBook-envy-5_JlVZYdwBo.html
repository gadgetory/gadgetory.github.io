a look at the HP Spectre XT 15 all those
words together what do they mean well it
indicates that this is part of HP's a
higher-end line it used to be the NV was
the highest and then they added the
Spectre and the XT is some sort of
additional modifier on top of that and
you get various combinations of env
inspector and XT this is the specter XT
I think the XT stands for extra thin or
something like that because this is a
very slim laptop especially when you
consider it's a 15-inch laptop with a
core i7 processor and a full 1920 by
1080 display now this is a pretty
high-end system it's $12.99 you can go a
little bit more a little bit less
depending on how you configure it even
though for that expensive price you
don't get some of the high-end extra I'd
like to see like maybe a slot loading
optical drive I've certainly seen
crammed into systems just about as thin
as this or discreet graphics or even a
full SSD hard drive this has got a
regular 500 gig hard drive with a 32 gig
SSD cache which is becoming increasingly
common that's a good way to get a lot of
storage space in the laptop but still
haven't qualify as an Intel ultrabook
which requires a certain amount of SSD
storage the keyboard is very similar to
what we've seen on other recent HP
systems it's got kind of a rounded
corners on the on the keys at the four
extreme corners here it's backlit which
is nice the touchpad is also the recent
HP style really stands out from other
laptop brands than that it's a flat
touchpad but it's in sort of this big
indented moat in a way I kind of like
the design it makes it a little bit
difficult to deal with if you're doing
off the edge moves to control Windows 8
but you shouldn't have to worry about
that too much because this is a
touchscreen just like pretty much any
new Windows 8 laptop should be one
interesting note about this laptop it's
one of the few non-apple laptops we've
seen with a Thunderbolt port now if you
want to get a bigger 15-inch screen in
Windows 8 with a touchscreen you could
certainly go way down to six or seven or
$800 to get something that's perfectly
nice probably not as thin or with the
same high resolution but if you want to
go super high-end like this there are
very few candidates this is maybe a good
alternative a less expensive alternative
to the 15-inch
retina MacBook Pro although that system
of course has a much higher resolution
and discrete graphics that's what you're
giving up here I'm Dan Ackerman and that
is the HP Spectre XT touch smart 15</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
