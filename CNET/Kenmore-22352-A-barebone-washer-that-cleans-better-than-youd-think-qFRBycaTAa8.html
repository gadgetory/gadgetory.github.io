kenmore washing machine behind me
doesn't really do a whole lot it looks
seriously basic one of the most basic
looking models we've reviewed to date so
judging on aesthetics alone you wouldn't
expect this thing to perform
particularly well but that's the
surprise it actually does pretty darn
well it's not amazing but it gets the
job done it'll remove stains little
freshen up your clothes and it's
actually one of the gentlest machines in
terms of wear and tear so if you have
concern about delicate items but you
wash them on the normal setting you
should be perfectly fine and like I said
it costs only seven hundred and twenty
bucks and Sears is currently running a
discount so it's on sale for just five
hundred the one potential downside is
that this model does have an agitator
which takes up significant space inside
the tub so instead of a five cubic foot
capacity like many top load models have
this one is down to four point two that
means you won't be able to fit family
size loads but you should still be able
to handle a regular-sized load so if
you're looking for a seriously no-frills
model that doesn't have all the fancy
extras this $720 Kenmore top load
washing machine might just do the trick</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
