Trade Commission to ban apple from
importing the iPhone into the US the
company said Apple has infringed six of
its patents that it says quote enable
high performance in a smartphone while
extending battery life
it's the latest development in a heated
legal battle between the two companies
in April Apple stopped paying royalties
to manufacturers like Foxconn for mobile
patents owned by Qualcomm these patterns
include intellectual property that
connects phones to a wireless network
Apple said in a previous statement that
it tried to reach a licensing agreement
with Qualcomm for over five years they
weren't able to negotiate what Apple
called quote fair terms because of
Apple's refusal to pay royalties
Qualcomm expects to make less money
Apple continues to use our technology
and not pay for it they've really left
us no choice but to say you've got to
stop this that's Qualcomm's General
Counsel speaking to CNET Qualcomm
expects the ITC to start the
investigation into the complaint in
August any potential ban wouldn't go
into effect for at least 18 months but
could a ban actually happen in a ruling
handed down in January 2016 in the Apple
V Samsung case a judge ordered Samsung
to stop selling smartphones in the u.s.
that infringed on Apple's patents but
the ban applied mostly to all the
devices that weren't on sale any more at
the time of recording Apple hadn't yet
released a statement but you can keep up
to date on the ongoing legal battle at
