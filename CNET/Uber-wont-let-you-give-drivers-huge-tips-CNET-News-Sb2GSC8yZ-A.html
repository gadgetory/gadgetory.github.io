YouTube Drive is like as of June last
year yeah they did but did you know
there's a limit on how much you can tip
no way yeah it's crazy it was a lot of
the drivers don't even know all right
well let's take a ride I want to find
out more about okay that's good so
what's the deal you can only tip over
drivers a certain amount
yeah within the app you can only tip to
a certain amount either 200% of the cost
of the ride or $100 Wow so 100 is the
absolute maximum right here right so
what if you want to give a driver say
cash for example you can definitely give
cash that's fine but a lot of people
don't carry cash anymore so what does
ovah said the reason is behind this
limit so uber says they want to avoid
typos mistakes or fat fingers so you
know when you type in $10 but my mistake
maybe you put a hundred then the
passenger won't have to go through the
hassle of getting that money back and so
competitors like lyft do they also have
this limit on tips yes lyft also has a
limit and this is actually a little
lower it's 200% like uber but then $50
limit and what a drive is saying about
this so it seems a lot of drivers don't
know about the limit from all the
drivers that I've talked to have told me
that they have never heard of a limit
and so if they come against the limit
they're really surprised
so Jacob have you heard about this uber
tipping limit before what do you think
about it $100 tips is since we're before
I Drive already of course I want to get
more what is the biggest tip that you've
ever had pap√≠ about 20 dollars yeah I
never go 200
before so I wrote a big story about this
all about the tipping limit and how the
app works so you should read it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
