and I'm here with the a e2w boses first
bluetooth headphone what's interesting
about this headphone is that it's very
similar to the bose wired ae2 headphone
which is one of the company's most
popular non noise cancelling
over-the-ear headphones the difference
here is that bose has made some tweaks
to the sound of the headphone and added
what amounts to a bluetooth dongle which
connects to the headphone port you know
the jack where you normally attach the
headphone cable to that dongle doesn't
look like it's removal but in fact it is
which will leave some owners of the
wired AE to s wondering why Bose doesn't
just sell this accessory separately it
may someday but right now it doesn't so
if you want a wireless bose headphone
the AE 2w is currently it what I will
say is that this headphone sounds
surprisingly good and is arguably the
most comfortable over the year bluetooth
headphone on the market that's not
surprising since the standard AE 2 is
lightweight and very comfortable and
also managed to passively seal out a
good amount of external noise aside from
being really comfortable the headphone
sounds very good as well especially for
a bluetooth headphone there's good
clarity and the sound is well balanced
dynamic and pretty natural sounding
which means bose isn't pushing the bass
too hard and all I thought they were
very pleasant sounding headphones that I
could wear for long periods the like all
over the year models your ears will get
steamy in warmer environments Bose says
the ae2 W has improved performance over
the ae2 because it uses something called
Bose active EQ so there is a slight
difference in sound quality but
otherwise the two models have the same
design like with most stereo bluetooth
headphones this model also has an
integrated microphone for cell phone
calls and the answer end button and
volume controls are well placed on the
dongle and easy to operate by feel the
answer n button also serves as a button
for skipping tracks forward and back as
for battery life you get about seven
hours before having to recharge the
dongle that's decent though not great
however if the battery does run out you
can switch to a wired connection and
still use the headphones the rubbin all
this is the price these guys are
expensive at $250 and I thought Bose
could have
included a better carrying case at this
price instead of the cloth pouch you get
but if you can live with that high price
you are getting a very comfortable
wireless headphone that also happens to
sound very good particularly for a
Bluetooth model I'm David Carr noise and
that's the bose a e2w wireless headphone
