selling your old phone to pick up a few
bucks but you're not exactly sure how to
get started not a problem
I'm Jessica dual-core with C net with
some tips on how to sell your old phone
for some additional pocket change the
first step is to round up what you've
got it may be just one phone that you're
planning to replace with a newer model
or a whole horde of ancient devices
gathering dust in the back of your
closets and drawers new phones are of
course the most valuable getting you up
to $350 for the latest hotness if you've
got a pile of old phones and newer
devices then you may wind up selling
them in different ways
laso of those chargers and boxes to
because you can get rid of them as well
first let's talk about trade ins almost
every carrier offers a trade in or
resale program of some sort and that's
because there's a valuable secondary
market for refurbished phones and parts
so do research selling your phone even
if it is damaged
sometimes your carrier will offer a
trade and deal tied to the promotion of
a new phone most of the time you'll go
to loan through providers dedicated
website the good news is you can resell
devices from any carrier searching for
the name of the phone and answering
questions about the condition of the
phone to determine the handsets trade-in
value however there is one limitation of
a carrier site and that is the fact that
you'll receive a carrier gift card as
compensation instead of cold hard cash
another option is to sell your stuff
online there are a ton of websites that
specialize in selling old electronics
and they work just about the same way
that the carrier websites work except
that you'll get a cash card instead of
carrier credit be careful though because
not every website accepts every phone
especially older models it also helps to
know the products full name if it's a
smart phone knowing the storage capacity
will help accurately price your
particular model if the phone sells with
more than one storage option for example
16 gigabytes and 32 gigabytes more
intrepid sellers should consider
Craigslist or Ebay you can often sell
phones at higher prices and negotiate
directly with buyers but unlike some of
the websites a phone you sell yourself
absolutely needs to be in good working
condition clean the phone nestled in its
original
packaging if you can throw in the
charger in a case and make sure it is
fully charged before you box it up if
you don't want to deal with shipping and
if you're planning to be in a shopping
mall anytime soon anyway you could take
your phone to one of the many eco ATMs
across America Eco ATMs are small kiosks
that automate the entire phone sale
transaction and they pay you in cash
you'll need your thumbprint and ID for
security purposes but the kiosk will
spit out at least a dollar for your dead
and broken phone often much more for a
newer device retail shops like Best Buy
will also buy back some devices in
person you should check in at the
customer service desk to get started if
you don't have any ecoATM near you and
you can't tell your decrepit phone or
other electronic device donate it to a
recycling program electronic devices
contain toxic chemicals that you do not
want leaking into groundwater so you
never ever ever want to throw them away
luckily most online resale outfits will
offer to take your phone off your hands
even if they don't give you a dime in
return Best Buy stores also have recycle
bins as you walk in specific cell phone
charities like hope phones or other
options as our local area outlets like
Green citizen here in San Francisco
however if you look hard enough you
should be able to sell that phone for at
least a buck definitely spend 30 minutes
comparing buyback prices across the
different websites you may find an up to
$50 swing on certain phones if you're
smart make ecoATM your last stop so you
can compare the prices it offers to your
other quoted choices then sit back and
let the bucks roll in for even more
