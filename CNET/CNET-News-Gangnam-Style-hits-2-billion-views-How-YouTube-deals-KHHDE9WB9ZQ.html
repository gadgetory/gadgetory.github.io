fun Cottenham star or you love to hate
it but no matter how you feel Gangnam
style is making history as it crosses
the 2 billion views mark a song and an
incredible video there's never been a
video that's been quite like that it's a
pretty visually stunning short attention
span winner right from the start it's
pretty engaging and there's a lot of
let's say incongruous or surprising
visuals didn't really know what you were
gonna get into made you want to watch
again and again and again Justin
Bieber's baby is the only other member
of the billionaire's Club but it's a
distant second to Korean pop star sized
viral chartbuster die says there's more
to come asked about the two billion
milestone the singer said quote they are
very honorable and very burdensome
numbers with the appreciation that will
come back soon with more joyful contents
the video has helped boost k-pops
popularity kpop viewership on YouTube
jumped by nearly three billion in 2012
Gangnam style was uploaded in July of
that year it's also inspired parodies it
spurred an invisible horse writing dance
craze
NASA Johnson style there's something
about the fundamental democracy of the
platform that lets our users access
whatever they want whenever they want
that that really makes for these sort of
independent success stories and again
it's in a pre YouTube era this type of
success for an independent Korean artist
it's with 1 billion monthly users and
100 hours of video uploaded every minute
YouTube is venting Gangnam style is a
one-hit wonder for the video sharing
site we're already planning for a world
where there's hundreds or thousands of
videos that reach billions of views and
one of the big things that one of the
big challenges we have how do we support
all that usage how do we transmit all of
that data over the Internet another
challenge viewers are watching on mobile
devices 40% of the time to future-proof
their player for users on the go
undiscovered dance fads and the next cat
sensation YouTube re-engineered the way
it streams video we do it out in much
smaller pieces
and we as we do out those pieces were
actually checking to see whether or not
it got through if it gets through very
easily then we say oh okay maybe we can
actually send a little bit more water
send you higher quality if we see that
there's problems we see that the you
know pipes are a little bit stopped up
then we send less water when the data
doesn't get through the player switches
to sending lower quality video so size
shades may not be sharp but the video is
less likely to freeze and hopefully
you'll never miss a single Gallup lasso
