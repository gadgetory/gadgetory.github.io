we're taking a first look at the Nike
FuelBand Fuel band which is $150
represents the next evolution of the
nike+ line it's a fairly simple looking
wristband that uses an accelerator
measure your steps calories burned and a
new way of measuring activity called
Nike Fuel points now it's Nike Fuel part
that's going to be a real hang-up for
some people it's a system developed by
Nike you need to have a fuel band or
some other nike+ product to really make
any use of it that means the score is
pretty meaningless to your friends who
work out with someone fitness tracker
their smartphone still how important the
score is depends on how much value you
place on it after a week with FuelBand I
have to admit it's a pretty effective
motivational tool you set a daily goal
for fuel points and get rewarded with
the little animation or banner when you
exceed that mark you get different
Awards based on hitting certain
thresholds like getting a 10,000 points
in total or doubling your goal for the
day so think the gamification of fitness
gamers who have been on the couch
hunting for that last achievement a call
of duty will take to this pretty quickly
personally it definitely got me aware of
how active and inactive Oh was on any
given day well it's a bit bulky the
wristband actually does a good job of
fading in the background during my
workouts it was simple design with the
single button to cycle through the
different categories and a line of color
leds that progressively light up as you
get close to your goal the wrist band
snaps open and when it actually plugs in
the computer's USB port for charging the
transfer of data for a quicker data
transfer you can sync the data via
bluetooth to an apple on your iOS device
sorry folks an Android app isn't yet
available so the FuelBand certainly
isn't for everyone if you're a fitness
fanatic or already have a regular
exercise routine you probably don't have
much use for this device if you're
hardcore enough to want to be able to
track your progress there are more
feature pack devices like the Moto
active for Motorola that's because
there's no way to get data on a specific
activity runners for instance have no
way of tracking how quickly they have
run since there's no stopwatch they
can't even measure the distance they've
run on a course it's the film and only
gives you the data for the entire day
there's no way to break it up except on
an hour-by-hour basis which is a little
clunky the scoring is a little wonky too
I estimated that I scored 2,500 points
running around central park one day but
later that night I racked up nearly 400
points drinking beer at a bar
generally it did a good job let's show
you the difference between an active day
and once spent huddled in front of a
computer but the details are always a
little muddled four hundred fifty
dollars you have to be pretty serious
about getting in shape it's fairly
pricey given what it can and can't do
there are cheaper alternatives including
a $99 Fitbit ultra still it's fairly
easy to use and the use of awards color
leds and bright and simple graphs to
show you a progress and prod you to keep
going could be worth a price if you need
to get in shape I'm Roger Cheng and this
