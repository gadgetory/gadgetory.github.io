CES 2013 and attached to my finger here
is a product by massimo it's called the
ispo to it's a pulse oximeter and what
it does is that it measures how much
oxygen I'm getting in my blood and also
my circulation and my pulse all by a red
light that's going through my finger
right now it's measuring how much light
is going through and it blocks out any
surrounding light with all these
different side panels so it's doing a
pretty good job of making sure that all
the music and the noise here isn't
interfering but after I see there for a
few minutes I'm able to measure how I'm
doing it's good for athletes it's good
for people who hike maybe they want to
see how their oxygen intake is whether
in high altitudes calots perhaps also
want to be interested in something like
this this company makes devices for
hospitals so you know that they know
what they're talking about when it comes
to being able to do this technology
right on the screen I can also email
these results to myself or others I can
track my trends it's see how I'm doing
over time you can get this right now on
amazon for 249 dollars you're seen it
I'm Bridget Carey here at CES 2013 with
a first look as is p 0 2 kilometer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
