lot about the if this and that app but
it's usually in reference to fund or
more novel applications actually there
are a lot of practical uses for it too
I'm Megan willerton with the weather
related how to this sling behind me is
red we'll get to that in a second but
here's how you start so this recipe
involves the RSS feed as the ifft and
your philips hue lights as that what
you'll do is go to the National Weather
Service and search for the RSS feed that
gives alerts in your area you can find
alerts that are nationwide you can
search by state and you can even search
by county to get really really specific
updates so just go to your scrolling
list and select RSS feed as your if and
then click on new feed item and add the
URL for the RSS feed you want I selected
New York because there are some flash
flood warnings in the area and I knew
that there would be some alerts so I
added that URL then you hit next and
then you select your Philips hue bulbs
as you're that and then you can really
do whatever you want you can have your
lights flash you can have them change
color you can't set it to blink and
change color which I wish I could do but
it's still a good warning in case
there's something going on so this lamp
has a fillip to bulb inside and I
programmed it to work with this recipe
and if you have multiple bulbs you can
select all of them you can select some
of them or just one whatever you prefer
and that's really it you've selected
your RSS feed for your area you've
selected your philips hue lights and
told them what you want them to do in
the event of an alert just hit finish
and you've created your recipe so now I
breathe time there's an alert in Niagara
New York my light will turn red so while
there are a lot of novel ways to use if
this is one practical way I'm Megan
willerton for Cena
