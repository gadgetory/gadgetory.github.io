CNET news and I'm here in San Francisco
with my colleagues Richard Nava who is
the Google editor here on our team and
Ian sure who is an executive editor for
News Silicon Valley has had a lot to
talk about this week about a topic that
has been in the news for most of the
past few years but has really taken off
in the last few months that topic is
diversity and inclusion there's been
some high-profile stories about what's
going on inside tech companies and this
week Google has taken the lead in this
discussion rich give us the sort of
state of what's been going on sure
so the the center of it is this memo
that this this guy his name is James
d'amour he's a he was a senior engineer
at Google and he talked about diversity
in the company and what he called an
ideological echo chamber and in the memo
he he talked about the the biological
differences between men and women and
that's kind of where we get into the
controversy you know he cites some
studies and people are kind of
disagreeing with with with what he said
what he hasn't said but basically it
sparked a big conversation around gender
and diversity in the company let's talk
about though what has been sort of
Silicon Valley's take on what he said
about diversity no one argues that there
are biological differences between men
and women that's not at issue it's the
way that he's used the arguments and
studies to frame a discussion so just
give us a bead on how Silicon Valley
sees what he said the people who are
upset about what he said and what his
supporters think is that sure so the
people who are really upset with this
memo are arguing that this is basically
gender discrimination that he's saying
because of biological traits that there
are things in in women that make them
more neurotic and that's one of the
reasons
y-you see less women in in you know
higher up leadership positions his
supporters Ian have been saying that he
has a right to his opinion and that this
is all about the First Amendment and
just having an open conversation what do
you think well the First Amendment kind
of stops at the government you the
government is not allowed to control
your speech but companies can choose to
do pretty much anything they want with
your speech
there are rules around like what are
your policies are you treating everyone
fairly within those policies but you
know there is no First Amendment
protections for me to be able to say
whatever I want and not get fired for it
and Google seems to have taken the
stance and again what we know from
Google are from some memos written by
the diversity officer there and their
CEO sundar Pichai he came out with a
note saying that Google believes that
these kinds of views about limiting
someone's potential based on their
biology goes against their code of
conduct what do you what do you think
you know it's interesting because I
definitely the code of conduct is an
important thing right then having again
policies and kind of HR stuff that is
consistent is important for any large
company I think a lot is gonna be really
interesting about how far they can take
this right I a lot of the stuff hasn't
been tested in court before about
whether or not you know you can have a
code of conduct that says you know you
can't say X Y or Z but one of the things
I've heard a lot throughout this
conversation that resonated with me is
that he created a hostile work
environment that you know this guy is in
charge of people he decides raises and
stuff like that and so he may these
views may actually be adversely
affecting his employees it's no longer a
conversation it's actually affecting
people's lives and that's there's a
whole nother kind of ball of wax at that
point rich and that is true right google
has a peer-review system tell us a
little bit about them yeah that's that's
where these kind of get pretty hairy so
Google has a system where you can ask
your you have to ask your fellow your
peers to review you
and from from what I understand it's
about like you got around five it
happens twice a year and these things
kind of dictate whether or not you'll
you'll get a raise whether or not you'll
get a bonus what kind of projects you're
gonna get to work on right your level of
responsibility and and on the on the
other side of that it's you know whether
or not you you might get fired or put on
some kind of you know performance plan
so you know these things matter and if
if somebody has this kind of this
predisposed bias it is it is something
that you know they might want to
consider why it's being one of the big
conversations around diversity
unconscious bias I don't know if this is
unconscious or not given that we have a
ten page three thousand word memo it's
how you interpret what he said and that
is certainly uh a big point of
controversy this week people are saying
his his views have been messroom
misrepresented and that google was a
little quick to fire him we don't know
if he's done a lot of peer reviews right
what is google telling us no they're
telling us nothing we don't know it so
so that's one thing to you know to be
sure to point out that we don't know
what the peer review situation is so he
might have done none but it's it's a
good question and it's something that
Google should probably be forthright
about and and if he has done peer
reviews I think we have to ask the
question of you know has this affected
women's careers in Google right I mean
that's that's a huge question and there
may be people who have been getting less
pay or may have even been pushed out of
the company because of these views he
holds so yesterday we were gonna hear
from Google sundar pichai this thing of
Google had set up an All Hands meeting
and we thought we'd get some of those
answers but then it was cancelled at the
last minute rich tell us why yeah I know
firsthand that it was canceled I
actually went to Google to see what was
going on and was was told that it was it
was not happening he said that he
canceled it because of fears of online
harassment from from employees
apparently
or toward employees right toward
employees yes yeah yeah apparently some
of some people's online information had
leaked and people have been you know
daxing workers which is like pretty much
how would you how would you describe
daxing it's basically putting out the
personal information of an employee so
it could be everything from their email
addresses and their phone numbers to
their social security numbers to their
family's information and it's something
we see a lot with targeted harassment
campaigns on the web this is something
that happened a lot during this period
in the web called gamergate right it's
happened a lot during the election it's
something that especially trolls on the
web and an extremists like to use to
rattle unsettle scare people that they
disagree with I want to just step back
for a second and talk about diversity in
the tech industry as I said it's been a
topic of conversation for the past few
years a Pinterest engineer Tracy Chow
led a campaign a few years ago for all
of tech companies to disclose the makeup
of their employee base and we started to
see a diversity reports come out now
their annual from more than a dozen tech
companies and every time one of those
diversity reports comes out the first
thing we hear from a company is that
that they should do should be doing
better that they're predominantly male
white employee base has not really
shifted that much over the past few
years now let's just remind people why
that's even a subject of of interest why
do people think that diversity is a
business goal that they should be
pursuing it wants to take that one well
I mean I think the interesting thing is
that the data out there and we've
written about this on scene that is that
diverse leadership often times leads to
more profitability it adds it leads to
more sales it leads to products being
better it there's there's a lot of
information out there that shows that
this is not only a social reason to do
it but there's actually a business
reason
you know the really interesting
conversation I've heard in Silicon
Valley a lot is that almost everyone
seems to in leadership position seems to
understand that that is the case and yet
they are consistently hiring you know
far fewer than the percentage of black
Latino whatever people who are graduated
of computer science programs in the
country they're hiring far fewer than
that percentage into Silicon Valley so
you have this really interesting kind of
mix up here where they say one thing
they're predominantly doing the other
and it's not changing despite supposedly
Silicon Valley being so nimble and being
so you know kind of being able to come
up with great ideas they can't solve
this one very fundamental one well in in
Google's case the advocates for
diversity there are like you're building
products for the whole world they've got
they've got seven they've got seven
products that have more than a billion
users and so the argument there is you
want everybody to be able to use these
things and so why not get everybody you
know people from all walks of life to
make them so they understand how
different people are gonna be using them
and there's an important point about why
as well you remember Google Buzz right
back in 2008-2009 they're compete
competitor at Twitter it's okay if
you've forgotten but you know one of the
things that came up was that you know
what it did is that you sent out status
messages to your entire email contact
list right and that was how they were
gonna beat Twitter at their own game and
the first thing that happened was that
someone who had a restraining order
against her husband I think it was ended
up at connecting with him on Google Buzz
against her will and it became this huge
problem and a huge privacy snafu and
actually helped to sync the product and
so it's a great example of if you don't
have a diversity of voices in the room
you're not going to think about these
things right because I don't have the
same life experiences as someone who has
a restraining order against her husband
I just don't and so understanding it's
not like you have to seek everyone out
but having a diversity of voices will
lessen the likelihood of that stuff
happening
okay so Google had an incident where
one of their senior engineers posted a
memo that has raised a lot of
controversy about diversity and
inclusion in Silicon Valley he was fired
after the CEO of Google said that it
didn't doesn't reflect the values that
they believe in I was a company he went
to hold an All Hands meeting but
cancelled it because some of his
employees were getting doxed or feared
harassment for just raising questions
about this debate so what's next rich
what happens next well the the official
word from Google is that they're going
to be holding these forums over the next
few days instead of this big All Hands
town-hall meeting and then really it's
who knows damar has filed a complaint
against google right he said that he
feels he's been unfairly fired so we're
gonna have to see that play out as well
right I don't know if he's filed his
lawsuit yet but he's definitely
threatened in the press to do something
and so that that will likely at least to
start this conversation that's really
interesting as well about how far can
your company policies go in terms of
these things it's gonna be really
interesting to watch in that regard so
diversity inclusion we're far from the
end of discussion about this intent
we're still at the beginning I feel
right I mean they it started with these
diversity reports and these product
snafus that just continue to happen and
now you know we have Silicon Valley at
the reckoning stage right where it's no
longer just about talk it's about rubber
hitting the road and we're I think we're
very far from whatever the conclusion
might look like right well so d'amore
said that with his memo he wanted to
start this conversation so in that
regard he got it yeah all right well
thank you for joining me today and I'm
sure we'll be talking about this more
often in the future Thanks
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
