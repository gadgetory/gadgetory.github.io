seenin appliances and this is the
Breville slow cooker with easy sear the
first thing I noticed about this slow
cooker was its design I really love it
it's minimal it's sleek it looks a lot
nicer and more high-end than pretty much
any other slow cooker I've ever seen so
I kind of had high expectations for it
but ultimately it really lacks a lot of
the features that I think make a slow
cooker great it doesn't have a warm mode
it doesn't have a timer basically you're
left to your own devices which is
defeating the purpose of a slow cooker
so let's take a look at the display it
has off low high and dual basically duel
starts on high mode and it moves to low
mode after two hours I'm not exactly
sure why you need that so it kind of
seems superfluous especially when you
could use that space for a warm mode or
a timer see and that's the thing there's
not even a timer on this so there's no
way to say I want to cook this on low
for 6 hours you just have to come and
switch it off yourself and that's the
other thing if you have a recipe that
does say cook this on low for 6 hours
this Breville is going to overcook your
food it tends to cook faster than other
slow cookers and to me that's kind of a
problem because you want them to be
reliable you want them to be predictable
you want to be able to say the recipe
says cook on high for this long or on
low for this long but this one really
doesn't you're gonna end up with
something that's overcooked you're gonna
have to do a lot of tweaking with this
Breville this frivolous law cooker is
one $29.99 which is double the price of
the hamilton beach one i reviewed but
half the performance I think Breville
probably tried to be a little too cool
with a slow cooker and forgot a lot of
the basics that make slow cookers great
to begin with thanks for watching I'm
Meghan Willerton for siient appliances
this has been a review of the Breville
slow cooker with easy seer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
