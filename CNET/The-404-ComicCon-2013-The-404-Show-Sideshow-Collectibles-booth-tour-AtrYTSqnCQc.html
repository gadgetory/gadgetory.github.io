Vader and Boba Fett over here me too oh

behind us we have iron man and we also
have the war machine okay so we're here
with bruce says hi can you tell us about
this is an unbelievable life-size bust
of Batman obviously what goes into the
making of the sort of stuff because I
don't know how close you can get in but
the the detail in the attention to
detail is mind-blowing when you really
get up in its really a thing as an dress
even hand-packed what does something
like this usually go for words I got
bust for four busts of this size and
this nature it ranges anywhere anywhere
between 350 and 500 dollars okay see
that to me is like I can do that I can
we can make that happen oh my gosh
what's happening over here with miss ivy
this statute may or may not get you in
trouble but this is our poison ivy
statute from the Batman line yeah and my
gosh obviously one of our most popular
is it really no characters that it is
popular she's got a great personality
she's really has a perky personality you
tell what's familiar I can't quite put
my finger on it I'm not sure yeah is
this is this poison ivy thing something
you would buy what she's all skanky yeah
she would show she's letting oh hey yeah
so here's Harley Quinn and this is the
closest I've ever been up to it this is
sort of new right this one's a totally
new yes and I'm blown away not just by
like the I you know the her eyes are
pretty shocking but you can tell like
she's gotta cheering like skinny tight
where's that latex or like some sort of
in spandex yes it is spandex right we
have fabricators in the house yeah their
specialties is costume design
okay so we're here at a totally sort of
different line of products they're a
little bigger they're not exactly one to
one but they're to some scale this is
our legendary scale figure legend
Thursday it's technically half scale
right I'll there's some characters are a
little bit larger with Galactus right
basically 30 storeys tall sure can't
really do a half's no not anymore we
threw in our Little Silver Surfer right
you see that so that's how much larger
Galactus is then silver surfer he's just
this little guy he's like a fly to him
he just buzzes around and what's really
cool about these is they there's like
light up elements to them as well when
when the costume and the character calls
for it that we will add electronics and
other detailed features very cool in her
Galactus in particular he's got the
light up eyes the chest piece and he
also comes with a beautiful display base
that shoots the purple lighting up onto
him so we're here with sarin from Lord
of the Rings and this one's blowing me
away because number one it's the most
bad has one here in terms of just
terrifying and just so freaking cool
that mask is unbelievable but what I'm
noticing is all the different types of
materials that are being used with this
and if you get in real close you can see
the unbelievable detail to like the
branding on the weapons so how does the
team what are they used as like source
material to to replicate this in such
amazing
we use whatever we have access to write
x if the film is in progress yeah
actually get access to the prop weapons
to be able to see the etching Oh have
onset photography we'll we'll have
actors costume test shots right you go
from so from start to finish like the
second okay we're gonna make a sour on
to the time that it's done how long does
that take sometimes it could take two
years sometimes it can take in here
alright so we're here in the hot toys
section of the sideshow collectibles
group their stuffs out of control for
sure beautiful likenesses yeah they go
crazy on the accessories everything's
super detailed and they have sometimes
six sets of hands we have so many
accessories you need different hand
gestures favorable and you can see that
with the with the Batman and Robin here

Joe retaliation these are more hot toys
