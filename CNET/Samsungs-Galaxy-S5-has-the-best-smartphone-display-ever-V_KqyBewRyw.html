to google issues for everything google
that we can pack inside of a show each
week and this week we're expecting big
news after amazon sent out their
official invitations for an april second
event where we're expecting to see the
unveiling of their own set-top box now
we always look for clues with these
invitations so it's either amazon's
rumored video streaming box or a popcorn
vacuum cleaner and i'm leaning towards
the vacuum now amazon trademark filings
in September of last year revealed the
name fire tube which sounds horrible
even if it aligns with its fire branding
we're expecting the box to feature the
streaming of amazon prime content
running in android OS it will run
third-party media streaming apps and
possibly feature some gaming content as
well we also showed you that leaked
amazon game controller a few weeks ago
so the pieces are finally starting to
come together and we'll find out the
official details soon enough now in
google news we're all big fans of the
Google now feature on Android and
according to a new report from Android
Police not the actual police it's a
website they say the service will be
getting a new feature very soon that
will help you remember to pay your bills
including the amount to pay and an easy
link to pay off the bills that look
similar to this in the Google now layout
also we've talked about Google opening
up their chromecast sdk and you'll now
find support for movie services like
crackle and the music service are do
that are now compatible and accessible
from your mobile device to play on the
chromecast now we've been really
impressed with the HTC One m8 one of the
top android phones right now even you
know if it's camera isn't on the same
level and looks less sharper than the
competition but its main competitor the
samsung galaxy s5 comes out in a week or
so and display mate technologies is
calling it the best smartphone display
ever tested showing that oled technology
has finally improved enough to challenge
or outperform the best LCD screens it's
high praise that is well deserved after
the s5 achieved the highest scores of
any smartphone display in six separate
categories now
all they have to do is a clean up that
TouchWiz UI and one feature Samsung
isn't really talking about since it
comes with everyone possible is the
galaxy s5 can be a baby monitor now
check this out in the settings there's a
baby cry detector and when your phone is
paired with that galaxy gear you can
leave your phone next year baby and when
baby cries it will alert you by sending
a notification to the gear see that's
all you need an S 5 a galaxy gear and a
baby nobody is going to use this come on
son and just a side note Samsung and
Apple are back at it again in court this
time they are fighting over different
patents and a newer generation of
devices you won't hear about hardware
design patents this time it's about
software utility patents like slide to
unlock that were granted to Apple that
Samsung allegedly ripped off and use
them in their own tablets and phones
sounds like fun right well this will be
going on for the next couple of months
that's how much fun all right now you
know April Fool's is just around the
corner and it will probably be here by
the time you watch this Sir Richard
Branson the founder of the Virgin Group
and Tony Fadell the CEO from Google's
recent acquisition of nest put out a fun
video for what they call total
temperature control on virgin flights it
allows you to use nest technology to
simulate anything from a balmy Cancun
afternoon or the cool of Chicago's polar
vortex in your own seat all right it's
worth a little chuckle but google has
really outdone themselves introducing an
amazing new feature in google maps to be
a pokeymon hunter now this is no joke to
me just open up google maps on android
or iOS click on the search bar and then
you'll see press Start this creates a
game where you can collect 150
pok√©mon's found throughout the map when
you see one just click on them and it
will save to your pokedex look I just
found luxray and they could really be
anywhere on the map so go and find them
and I'd like to know how many you find
seriously I'm not joking all right guys
you can email us at Google issues at
cnet
come or tweet me up brian Tong and i'll
show you my pokedex if you show me yours
alright that's going to do it for this
week's show thanks so much for watching
and we'll see you guys next time for
some more of that Google licious
delicious</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
