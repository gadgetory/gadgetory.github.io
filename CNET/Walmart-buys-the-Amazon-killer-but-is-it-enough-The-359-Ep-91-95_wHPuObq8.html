there in YouTube thank you for joining
us on another episode of the 359 podcast
with Roger Cheng and Ben Fox Rubin good
morning guys what are we talking about
today morning happy monday everyone whoo
we're gonna be talking about two topics
the big merger monday deal walmart
buying gedcom for 3 billion dollars yeah
Cillian yes with Abby I don't know if
people heard of gedcom but don't they
well now well now for sure well we're
gonna we're gonna get in that we're
going to talk a little bit about Delta
and how a power outage of all things
knocked out pretty much their entire
system canceled three hundred flights so
sorry if you got your on a delta flight
today cuz is not gonna be good day for
you yeah you guys can crash at my house
as always if you have any questions
about these topics or anything else we
will try our best answer a producer
Brian will pick out the best questions
after the actual podcast taping and we
will will try to answer them so why
don't we get started all right platform
set audio is rolling and let's record in
three two welcome to the 359 when we
talk about the top tech news of the day
all the other crap we want to throw in
I'm Roger Cheng I'm Ben Fox riffin its
merger Monday again Walmart is hoping to
supercharge its online ambitions with a
3 billion dollar purchase of gedcom in
its early days gedcom was hyped as a
potential amazon killer early days early
they thing is like a year old so what do
you think it means that that definitely
that was that hype was not warranted
right um that's that's hard to say
because they're keeping the senior team
in walmart and so jet started with about
like 500 or 600 million dollars which is
really good for a start-up but still how
are you going to take on Amazon with
that kind of writing it's really not
enough so now jet is going to have
Walmart's coffers and it could create
much more significant competition for
Amazon but probably not in the short
term right you know we might see
something a couple years from now I
don't know well if you and you look this
piece last year yeah around a seller
around yell about gedcom Chiefs of
algorithms to kind of figure out the
best deals for you
does that mean walmart gets more nimble
and I should get you better deals online
so that's a good question in their press
release today walmart mentions that jet
and walmart are going to have separate
brands so walmart com is going to do its
thing jet calm is going to continues to
exist as its own brand so is walmart
gonna change walmart.com and start
adding some of those fancy real-time
discounts yeah I don't know I'd like to
see that because it have you ever
shopped on jet like never used it nope
very quick like everyone like everyone
else I know right exactly so I'm in
e-commerce reporter so I have shopped on
Jed hey I do actually kind of like that
you know if you waive free returns you
save like seven cents on you know a
bunch of you know like the soap that you
purchase it a detergent or whatever so
those might be some nice little add-ons
and they do add them to walmart I I
don't know that they will though well
we'll see I mean it's a I don't know
that I think the biggest problem is no
one knows what jet calm is hopefully
Walmart is the answer for that yeah I'll
see I think an even bigger problem is is
that Amazon is just stuff such as
suffocating like Jagger nod when it
comes to e-commerce and you would think
like in the online world so much else in
online is competitive actually now that
I'm saying it that that's not true
Facebook dominates social right google
dominates search and amazon.com irse but
i would like to see more competition
like the thing of it is is Walmart's
looking at this from the narrow lens of
retail Amazon's already sort of expanded
beyond that right total shows our own
zone they've got all cut their their
everything basic there they are
literally the everything store whereas
walmart still trying to work on the
whole yeah commerce thing ya know what's
good luck to them good luck next up my
sympathies if you're on a delta flight
today a power outage in its headquarters
in Atlanta knocked out its system and
the company had to cancel about three
hundred flights today ouch yeah it's it
just surprised me that it took something
as simple as a power outage to just
knock out an entire nations worth of
flights I was saying this i was saying
this earlier that the airline is now
using twitter as a backup to inform
people twitter has its own like
fail whale and its own problem so I
think you're really kind of screwed if
you're using Twitter as a way to inform
people about things but well we have we
had someone on the ground although I
think he's literally in the air now but
Terry Collins was out in DC trying to
catch flight back home and he he was he
was on a Delta flight and had to deal
with the delays fortunately he was one
of the few flights that actually made it
through but it is yeah not a great day
of your Delta flyer it doesn't make a
lot of sense to me but this I guess
proves that I don't know a lot about
airplanes and such because like how did
this even happen didn't they have
backups I I don't know you're gonna see
ya I don't wanna know more about these
stories check us out and seen it I'm
Roger Cheng I'm Ben Fox ribbon thanks
for listening and that's a cut on the
audio recording and I um we do want
people to feed their question and
questions in and work out a few coming
in right now but I'm kind of curious as
a ecommerce participant that's an enzyme
analogy sure why not well jet also say
chopper identity or will it just be
absorbed into like a grander Walmart
shopping experience so just kind of by
the back end that is definitely a good
question i think Jett has about three
warehouses it currently owns and
operates walmart has its own I don't
know off the top of my head exactly how
many it would probably make sense from a
position of scale to combine those two
so that it is in the back end you are
buying the same stuff because a lot of
times when you're on walmart.com or
you're on jet calm what are you getting
you're getting like diapers or like a
frozen shirt patio furniture yeah patio
furniture a lot of it is like like
commoditized consumables anyway so I
don't think that like people are really
going to notice or care about the
difference as to whether their items are
being fulfilled by a wal-mart warehouse
or a jet warehouse it does sound to me
though that jet is going to be able to
continue to maintain some sort of
independent status because I know a lot
of tech companies these days even after
an acquisition continue to get to be you
know their own thing kind of like how
Instagram is under facebook although i
would say i would i would be
disappointed if Walmart does it take
some of the technology the Eau de lis
right like it just seems like a waste
like having to sub-brand it to me that's
like that's not worth a deal I just
really wonder what walmart has been
doing with walmart.com this whole time
Walmart icons existed for about 15 years
right and they make god i don't remember
they make about 500 billion dollars in
revenue a year Walmart UN's Walmart does
yes 13 billion of it is from their
online channels like that's embarrassing
they're like billion 13 billion out of
the 500 billion is online is their
ecommerce sales like this well it's not
good think about a threat as would the
way Walmart's exist massive super stores
at every corner kind of thing granted
there are holes in pockets across
international presence right there in
Canada now aren't they ya know they're
overseas yeah they're in China why would
you go to calm when you could literally
go out your front door it's hard I mean
I'll find a walmart and their their
shelf stock is a lot greater in
comparison to other stores have online
presence where it's an online only type
purchase you can't find this necessarily
in your neighborhood you probably will
because Walmart's are gigantic daunting
like dinosaurs right and they and
walmart.com has kind of been um you know
second fiddle to walmart I think Robert
Horry hasn't been as good either part of
the problem is that yes right now you
know people are still preferring to go
out to be spoken more stores the world
slowly shifting that next generation is
not really they're not big fans going
out the real world and buying stuff they
just they want to click on their phone
and order something fair but I think
there's something to be said that and
like this is not me like endorsing
walmart in any way shape or form that
the it's kind of impressive that they've
maintained that they're one of the last
ones that really get people in the door
I mean I think that's partly because
it's like you said scale right look very
few other companies gonna look look at
Circuit City or Barnes note wind up our
noble that eventually yeah borders
eventually barnes a noble look at these
other retailers they didn't have a scale
to compete with everything and so that's
why they got gobbled up and the
demographic for walmart tends to skew a
little older yes my god okay as tech
savvy there is shane yeah there is sort
of a shelf life on them like they see
the future
dead is on the wall eventually they did
they did yeah it took him a while it
took them 20 years but that's okay well
hopefully there would be more
competition that's that's what I'm
hoping to see from this Randall surmises
it well he says obviously walmart is a
profits titan and i think walmart bought
it's because they see the horizon with
that profit yeah okay so that's saying
yeah right on the nose randall bossom
says that he thinks with walmart support
gedcom will see greater success be more
competitive I've seen gedcom commercial
it's not like that weren't completely
they were completely invisible but I
just never really liked gave them the
time of day look a lot of a really long
time to build trust in the marketplace
generally develop a brand presence and
they've been doing that but they've only
really existed for about a year and so
they were doing this basically from
scratch right that's really really hard
to do so at least you know that jet is
in some ways going to continue to exist
under the Walmart brand it definitely
has the early definitely has an air of
legitimacy under walmart for sure right
exactly because i think a lot of folks
were like okay you just raised a ton of
money as a start-up but you guys are
going to be spending like crazy trying
to get the word out yeah now people that
are jet customers at least know jet is
going to consume you exist so what i
want to run a few numbers by you by the
way just you know they disclosed today
that they add about four hundred
thousand new shoppers every month
process an average of twenty-five
thousand orders each day is that good or
bad i mean the first startup is
definitely good they also have this one
number not to get too wonky here but
they mentioned in the press release that
they are on a run rate for gross
merchandise volume of a billion dollars
that so okay a billion dollar sounds
like a lot but gross merchandise volume
means this is what gedcom cells and also
all the third parties that are on Jack
are not like jet calm is actually making
that right that's not a revenue number
that's like all the stuff that sells on
our website and a run rate it basically
means that we're gonna take the best
month out of our 12-man we're on pace
and then we're going to multiply we're
gonna say we're on pace we're going to
multiply that by twelve and say well we
did ridiculously well in March and if we
have more marches for the rest of the
area theoretically we
have this number yeah so look like those
numbers sound pretty good to me for as
young a company is at but it's still
like um not very big compared to Amazon
I mean you have to compare them all to
Amazon sure no because like those that's
the vicuna david says that the website
walmart's website as is is terrible and
reinforces my point that he'd rather
just go to the store to get what he
needs which I probably fine I think I
honestly think that walmart has been
ignoring its website for a long time or
at least not putting another and to as I
told you last saw it is i use
walmart.com too but i did too video game
i I got a dust buster buster on
walmart.com so it's not like cyber
monday or black friday spec was yeah i
was one of those it was something like
that and it was just slightly cheaper
than amazon doc i would say the
experience of it was it was fine it just
wasn't as slick as amazon like it what
definitely wasn't in total Easy's amazon
also it is cheap because L checker says
hopefully they can lower the prices
because apparently there's not a whole
lot of monetary incentive to use walmart
com prices are high you're not actually
getting a better deal to go online they
want you at the store well and I think
that they also they have a fifty dollar
minimum for free shipping which is right
you know free shipping these days like
people kind of take it for granted
especially if you're a prime member not
so if you're not putting what is not so
with 35 with Amazon what's the 35 and
it's also by the way 35 I believe for
jet calm so I ok maybe walmart will
lower the price I'm not sure well see
okay speaking of been you said you've
used Jack calm yeah give us a little
more background information on the user
experience in their history because
people are curiously recurring comments
what's jet calm right heard of this yes
exactly um so jet calm was started by
Mark lawyer who is kind of like an
e-commerce wunderkind he's like 45 years
old but he started quit Z which you
don't know that name but he quit Z was a
parent company for soap calm diapers.com
and wag calm that company was sold in
2011 to Amazon for 545 million dollars
he proceeded to work for amazon for a
couple years kind of chafed at that and
then
he was going to do his own thing and so
he started jet jet officially launched
only like last summer and look I think
their mobile is actually pretty good
they have their own app and I'm I'm
pretty happy with the app sometimes I
can't find what I want like the search
isn't that good sometimes but I think
they have been improving that and online
like they're also pretty alright but the
differentiator that they have is that
they have this real time algorithm they
say it's kind of like a trading platform
where basically if you purchase bulk
orders or you purchase a lot of items
from the same warehouse they can cut the
price down for you the more stuff that
you buy right so um it's surprise like a
loyalty card almost yeah it like the
prices are fluid though depending on the
right if equation yeah so if i buy like
one bar of the one thing of deodorant
it's this price but if I by five they'll
cut the price for every single one of
them um so it's this pretty clever way
of gamifying shopping and I always end
up buying a little bit more than I might
normally because I'm like oh you know
now I get all these other discounts if I
just buy one more thing isn't that right
in line with like the walmart business
model though walmart sam's club it's
like oh yeah i could buy like other
bloke like a six pack of ramen noodles
but they have 44 eight dollars so i'll
get forward that's yeah it's like the
costco model right yeah exactly the same
so I I agree with you that walmart
continues to try to get people in the
store because invariably if you do go in
the store you are going to make some
impulse buys yeah and then end up like I
was planning on spending twelve dollars
on I end up spending 50 instead the
thing is is that like we're in 2016 like
their online presence isn't big enough
and they know that and you know the
world's biggest retailer so well by
revenue by total revenue so I think this
jet thing is an admission that they're
like we have to get much more serious
about web and we have to get much more
serious like right now like yesterday so
yeah hopefully that was some helpful
info finally i'm bored with the 21st
century yeah yeah yeahs took him to come
along 20 years yeah become 20 years
that's fun do we have any flights coming
out of this office anytime soon it's a
that's a bummer what the delta thing the
delta thing is killing me but like you
say you know
it's embarrassing that one power outage
but remember a couple years ago one
power outage took down our scenic
coastal servers that's true one power
outage took down basically the northeast
corner for the Northeast I was a couple
years oh yeah a couple years ago but
yeah were you in the city when that
happened I was in New Jersey City it was
there in doubt it was out of their
buddies uh I remember I was living in
hoboken home of jet calm and I for
whatever reason are our apartment had a
generator downstairs we were like the
only building like within like the
square mile whatever that that had power
people were looking up at our apartment
cuz we had our lights blasting AC
running we're just like hey guys
chickens check us out anybody watching
been affected by the Delta outage or
know somebody that's been affected by
the Delta outage would be curious to
hear like we we said a couple of our
reporters have been kind of uh vac
seated in the process it's yeah it's
going to show it was it wouldn't send
Terry out there specific cover this he
just happened to be like waiting for his
flight when he got hit with the delay
like everybody else and he's sitting
there like aa gold yes like that to be
like hey we covered slick yes yes we're
on top of it so outage took out spirit
in February in southwest in June thank
you for that LJ yeah that's a good point
i forgot about those yeah shire that's a
very killer for us at this just proving
that you know the tech world is not
invulnerable no yeah well especially
companies like Airlines the airline guys
they're not exactly known for high-tech
right like I remember the Delta CEO was
speaking at this conference like two
years back wearing when he can all these
questions about it was a tech conference
and he just sort of scoff at the whole
notion of tech in general just likewise
I don't understand the stuff like it
just seemed like he clearly didn't
really care about tech like airplane
caretech a place art you should care
about airline tech maybe I necessarily
know he cared about because he still
today you have to turn your phone off to
get on a plane right but he just he
didn't care about some of the the more
you know like cloud services mobile apps
that stuff like they do that but he
didn't seem like he really that wasn't
really his folk right because they don't
have a job to be that focus cuz they put
you on the airplane and then you're
completely disconnected from the ground
so what do they care about any of that
stuff that's true huh yeah any last
questions no I think it's about time to
wrap up that's a good show all right
hopefully we don't have any traveling in
our near future yeah um I'm traveling
like two weeks now then three fine by
the actually be driving quite a bit mmm
knock on wood there we go alright let's
wrap things up here if you like anything
