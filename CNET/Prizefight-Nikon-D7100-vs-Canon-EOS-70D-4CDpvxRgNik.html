I'm Brian Tommy we have a face-off
between two of our favorite mid-range
digital SLR cameras it's a picture
perfect punch out between the Nikon d70
100 and the Canon EOS 70d our judges for
this fight are Cena reviews senior
editor Laurie boom boom brunnen and
senior editor Josh the Gold man Goldman
will take both judges scores and average
them out to the nearest tenth of a point
the final prize fight score will be an
average of all rounds using the same
decimal system let's do this first round
is design and interface both of these
camera bodies are comfortable to use
they aren't overly complex with easy to
navigate menus for DSLR users and can be
found for around $1,100 each now a lot
of times this comes down to personal
preference
Josh likes nikons layout better while
Lori prefers canons the convenience of
nikon's power switch right next to the
shutter release makes more sense to us
and while we're fans of canons flip out
LCD that design choice forces some of
the direct controls to be on top
pressing a button directly in the middle
of the mode dial to unlock it can be
awkward and even though its menus are
easy to navigate its directional pad
control dial combination can make it a
pain that comes d70 100 gets things
started with the 4 and Canon 70d gets a
3.5 next round is features both of these
cameras bring features you'd expect from
a mid-range DSLR Nikon brings dual SD
card slots and clean HDMI output for
video but it lacks the ability to change
aperture during video shooting you have
a fixed LCD screen that limits its
usefulness and if you want Wi-Fi you'll
have to purchase a dongle add-on now
Canon 70d articulated touch screen LCD
built-in Wi-Fi and its ability to
control aperture while shooting video
sets it apart from the d70 100 it really
has the advantage if you're looking to
shoot video but the lack of a headphone
jack and clean HDMI out is a bummer it's
still won't matter this round goes to
Canada with the 4 and nikon gets a 3
it's after a between 2
cannon has the slight lead next I the
shooting performance fast don't lie and
the numbers don't lie
we're tenths of a second matter now the
d70 100 is generally faster for still
photography with a tenth of a second
advantage in time - first shot both
cameras are dead even with raw shot two
shot time as well as JPEG shot two shot
time now in dim light situations the d70
100 has the advantage by three tenths of
a point where the 70d has a two-tenths
of a point advantage for typical shutter
lag now for typical continuous shooting
speed Canon 70d also edges out Nikon
with 7.1 frames per second versus Nikon
6.3 frames per second for the d70 100
also Canon 70d shines during live view
shooting with autofocus performance that
outclasses other DSLRs these results are
all tenths of a second apart but in real
world use the d70 100 feels faster with
the ability to power on and shoot with
one hand and it gets the edge this round
with the 4.5 and the Canon 70d gets a
for the final round that decides it all
is image quality the d70 100 brings
better detailed resolution and naturally
sharper images because it doesn't have
an optical low-pass filter it also
brings better colour reproduction
without fiddling with the settings
valori says it doesn't preserve as much
highlight detail as she'd like now the
Canon 70d is no chump but the judges
aren't too hot on his default color
settings and images just aren't as sharp
with its optical low-pass filter now
josh says it's the high iso results that
tilt this in favor of Nikon d70 100
Nikon takes the final round at the 4 and
Canon gets a 3 let's average out all
four rounds and in a prizefight wear
Nikon trailed early the d70 100 closed
the gap on Canon 70d and takes this
battle
three point six and is your prize fight
winner
I'm Brian Tong thanks for watching we'll
catch you guys next time for another
prize fight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
