Starcraft for example take forever to
load that it's unacceptable now if you
go I will tell you go ahead and buy a
new computer this time however I have
something else SSD hello my name is
delgo and today and show you how to
migrate your computer's hard drive to a
solid-state drive okay to do this there
are a few thing you need first an SSD
just go out there and get the one that
is a the most affordable for the amount
you need the most important thing
however you need to get an SSD that have
capacity that is more than the amount of
existing data you have on the computer
but for the demo though and use one that
is 240 gig why settle for less quanta
can have more right the second thing you
need is a piece of software to clone the
hard drive
I use the akunis true image the reason
because this is a very public software
and it can do more than just cloning but
you can use any version that was
released on or after 2007 for example
here I use hakuna 2m is 11 which was
released in 2011 regardless of what
version you use they all share the same
cloning function which can be accessed
from the Tools menu
now the third things you need is a
adapter USB to SATA if you have a
Seagate go flag hard drive you actually
can use the adapter part of the DRI for
the job and the last thing you need is a
screwdriver now let's start with the
project first you hope the SSD to the
adapter and then you plug it into the
USB port of the computer now on the
computer you run the aqua needs to image
as you see the software loaded and you
should click on tools and clone disk and
then click Next now you're going to
software to do the job automatically so
you pick this option
and then this is important step make
sure you choose the source hard disk is
the main hard drive of the computer and
then click Next and now of course you
pick the destination hard disk as the
one which is plug in through the USB
port and if the new drive has some
partition or data on it the software
will ask you to delete partition and you
want to do that make sure though you do
not delete your import information and
then you click Next now we see the
window we show the result when the
cooling process is finished you click
Next
make sure you see that a two drug would
be exactly the same you click Next and
then click proceed now the software will
ask you to restart the machine for the
cloning process to start you go ahead
with a reboot and then after that the
computer will ask to restart now this
will take some time up to an hour
depending on how much data you have on
the computer so I suggest you go ahead
and do something like running another
blog do push up I'll call your mom maybe
not because take you more than an hour
and now it is done just press any button
and the computer will shut down it is
now time for us to replace the hard
drive with the SSD physically now the
hard drive the most laptop can be
replaced very easily with this down for
example it takes only 2 screw for the
hard drive to come out and there you go
now here is the hard drive of my Dell it
is now no more in service now I take the
SSD now of the adapter and I would put
it back in here and now I'm going to put
the SSD Isis clone earlier into the
computer and now the moment of truth I'm
on turn the computer on it is now
running an SSD and you will notice how
much faster it boots up
and there you go and now let's see how
much faster start wrapped loads all
right
there you go must faster and now if
you're still losing I can help you
for more information check out the
write-up version of the how-to that you
can also find linked to software and
other option up sort of state and so on

Facebook page or Twitter you can ask me
question there if you run through a
problem once the game my name is Don low

to on how to migrate your computer from
hard drive to solid-state drive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
