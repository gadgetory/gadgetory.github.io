example the reboot of Robocop which was
kind of much maligned and it wasn't
perfect by any means but I think the
most interesting well it wasn't perfect
it wasn't go on it was no no we can
agree it wasn't perfect it was okay it
was terrible because it was terrible
very long waiting the TV and movie
industry is filled with reboots at the
moment but our reboots grates or are
they tearing apart everything we love
I'm requests away and with me is rich
Trenholm foreseen it doesn't like
reboots rich what's the problem with
them well let's call a spade a spade
right let's be upfront about this a
reboot is just a fancy name for a remake
right it's a complete dearth of
creativity and that's the problem with
Hollywood I I strongly disagree but well
done being so concise okay what I would
say is this yeah I like reboots because
they are in a way the oldest and purest
form of storytelling like the bards of
old we passed down familiar tales from
generation to generation don't you think
it's there's something quite nice about
the fact that like kids today are really
into like transformers and it's the same
stuff that we were into like we passed
on these familiar stories and characters
I think there's something quite nice
about it yeah to a point but then you
know if you want to talk about the oral
tradition that's because that was that
was the only way you could tell stories
now we live in a world where if you want
your kids to enjoy transformers you can
show them that the Transformers movies
you that you enjoyed as a kid you can
show them the same movie you actually
enjoyed as a kid you know I mean I kind
of see where you're coming from if you
look at like the Doctor Who reboot for
example right that was that went away
for years and years and years I remember
watching when I was a little kid and it
went away and I thought that was the end
of it I thought you know no other kids
would ever get to enjoy it the same way
that we would and then it came back and
and my nephew really liked it and so I
was quite you know I was quite happy
that that I was watching this show again
it was back on television when nephew
got to enjoy it but that was a sight
that was a slight difference because
that was a continuation what I kind of
have an objection to is the idea of
instead of coming up with a new way of
taking a particular story forward
whether it's coming up with new stories
for Doctor Who I kind of objected the
idea of
mantling the whole thing and going right
back to the start and trying to retell
the same story again like for example
the Star Trek reboot which is literally
telling the same stories again well but
most reboots do try and take a different
tack so like look for example at the
upcoming Terminator movie they you know
that they're going in a very sort of
different direction I mean I don't think
it looks very good but but I want to do
okay well well there you go then at
least they are sort of taking they are
trying to like take the same sort of
themes and characters and ideas but sort
of muddled them up a bit kind of put
them in a blender and produce something
a bit new I think it's the sort of a
hard reboot for me is the thing where
they just start like start from scratch
and go back from scratch and I think
bond is more of an evolution a same with
Doctor Who and the same with plenty of
other series of that the thing about
bond is that it kind of it updates for
contemporary concerns and I think when
there's a reason to do that so bond will
kind of echo action movie trends and and
you'll see that it kind of leads the way
sometimes in effects sometimes it's
trailing behind other types of movies
for a while there it was very born like
I hopefully it's gonna be a bit more fun
from here on out but um you know you can
see why it updates for contemporary
concerns we kind of a bonds always been
about gadgets for example and in the
early films that meant he would have a
phone concealed in a briefcase and that
was revolutionary and now he's got all
kinds whether you know a lot of tiny
devices and technology plays into that
and if you look at something like for
example the reboot of Robocop which was
kind of much maligned and it wasn't
perfect by any means but I think the
most interesting well it wasn't perfect
it wasn't go on it was no we can agree
it wasn't perfect it was okay it was
terrible because it was terrible very
long waiting but the most interesting
thing about that was the fact that it
did actually apply the kind of the
themes of that film to modern concerns
it was about drones it was about
government surveillance that kind of
thing and I think that's kind of
interesting when there's a reason to do
that but who needs a new Godzilla movie
who needs a new version of Stephen
King's it who needs a new poltergeist
who needs new versions of all these
different films we know that reboots are
favored by Hollywood because essentially
they're safe because you know what
you're getting the audience knows what
what they're getting and they sort of
already know that they like it so when
bring out a new spider-man with Garfield
in it because the answer you know they
are looking like web slinging lasagna
yes but yeah he doesn't do any
crime-fighting on Monday yeah so they're
a safe bet for Hollywood and I think
actually if you look at some of the most
exciting directors who were making
movies that kind of appeal to geek
culture actually reboots are a fantastic
opportunity for them because Christopher
Nolan you know inception I believe was
something that he wanted to do for a
long time but he it was such a
big-budget idea
it wasn't until he'd successfully
rebooted Batman that he was sort of
trusted with the with the cash to do
that or if you look at JJ Abrams who
rebooted Star Trek and then he made like
super 8 which is a sweet film that I
don't rate JJ Abrams personally but
there you go but I mean that's that's a
debate for another day or like I mean I
know that Avengers isn't isn't strictly
a reboot but kind of along that theme
you get like a you get like a safe
Hollywood option and now Joss Whedon
he's leaving them he's going to go do
his own thing
so why Whedon hasn't done anything for
years and years and years because he's
tied up in a franchise
it's like Peter Jackson hasn't barely
done anything for 20 years now because
he's been doing Hobbit movies I think he
really likes it I mean no one no one
like that someone does I think the
perfect example for me of the difference
between an original film and original IP
as they call it and intellectual
property racial property and a reboot is
the the kind of the closeness of
Godzilla and Pacific Rim I'm sure
someone would have said to guillermo del
toro would you go and make a Godzilla
movie and he said well he went and made
a movie that was like Godzilla but just
way more crazy and out there and the
Godzilla not good and it's so much
better than Godzilla the Godzilla movie
is just a Godzilla movie it's like you
know exactly what's gonna happen in that
movie but the effects are a bit more
advanced I'm sure you're right about
this Godzilla theorem thing they're not
even better the effect and then you've
got sailor movie than the old ones
they're just more CGI II they don't look
better they don't feel scary I find much
more I find the effects of the original
movies much more compelling
then I do the kind of the gloss
ccgi sheen they fight for a bit and then
the camera cuts away to Aaron
taylor-johnson they fight for exactly
the right amount of time I decide for
any longer it with all the fighting
would cease to be impactful and amazing
which it was we again stop like if if if
you have if you are a director and you
want to sort of like it take on take on
a project like that and if you want to
try and breathe new life into something
or like experiment with your own ideas
because all of these reboots like they
do have like a little bit of like
although some of them are rubbish they
all they all are different you know they
usually have like a little creative
stamp or like they go in a different
direction to the sort of original and
sometimes like with transformers that
turns out to be just horrible yes but
you know like it is a creative direction
and I think what's wrong with getting
more eyeballs on the thing that you're
trying to make by tying it to something
that people you know love and fondly
remember because I think it's I think
it's I think it's lazy it's a it's
conservative and it's it's it's kind of
it's just sort of it's it's not giving
the benefit of the doubt to the audience
I think all right well we want to know
what you guys think about reboots are
you ok with them or do you think that
they are doing harm let us know I'm
request away seen its rich Trenholm
