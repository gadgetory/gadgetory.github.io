taking a first look at the Nokia Lumia
625 this is the largest Lumia yet
measuring roughly 5 inches tall 3 inches
wide and less than half an inch thick
it's rounded edges make the phone feel
high-end the cover is made of a smooth
matte curved polycarbonate which feels
smooth and is easy to grip behind that
back cover you will find the battery
microSD and micro sim card slots while
you can easily swap out the sim and SD
cards you can't remove the battery on
the top edge of the 625 is the headphone
jack on the bottom is the micro USB
charging port along the right side of
the phone you'll find a slim camera and
power button and an equally slim volume
rocker the volume rockers short size and
position on the 625 make it hard to use
when you're talking on the phone as I
struggled to reach the controls while
the phone was up to my ear the front of
the phone sports a 4.7 inch LCD screen
despite the large screen size the
resolution is lower than most Lumia is
it just 840 by 400 pixels that makes
icons look fuzzy in places but the text
is still easy to read the Lumia 625 is
running Windows Phone 8 and comes with
many of the same features you'd find on
other Lumia devices however the phone is
missing NFC which means you can't tap to
share files like many higher-end Lumia
devices the 625 does support LTE which
means websites and web enabled apps will
load quickly inside the 625 has a
Qualcomm Snapdragon s4 dual-core 1.2
gigahertz processor which gives the
phone just enough power to load apps and
move through menus without feeling
sluggish the phone has 8 gigabytes of
internal memory but you can add up to 64
gigabytes with a microSD card on the
back of the 625 there's a 5-megapixel
camera and single LED flash photos and
videos came out looking just okay though
outdoor shots in the shade looked overly
dark with its high-end design and 220
euro price tag the Nokia Lumia 625 is an
impressive device that's worth
considering for your next phone that is
if you live in regions where the phone
will sell such as in the UK Europe and
parts of Asia you can read my full
review of the phone on cnet com I'm
Sarah mature off and this has been a
first look at the Nokia Lumia 625</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
