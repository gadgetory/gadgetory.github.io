not investing in audio these flat panel
TVs look great but the problem is they
don't leave much room for booming sound
so today I'll show you three ways to add
audio to your home theater system the
easiest and fastest way to do it is with
a sound bar they're cheap easy to
install and look undeniably good
underneath the flat panel TV with sound
bars you can go low-end
or invest your money in a higher end
sound bar in this case Vizio is
affordable and still sounds good
especially for movies the drawback with
sound bars though is that they're
well-known not to perform as well with
music however lots of them come packed
with features like bluetooth and they
usually come with a sub like most high
achievers the choir is a little bit
different from all the other kids in the
playroom for the richest home theater
experience a 5.1 surround sound system
is your answer in this case sound hits
you at every angle with two front
speakers a center speaker two rear
speakers and a subwoofer now there are
some drawbacks to consider for starters
the speakers alone can easily cost you
$2,000 and then of course you want to
factor in the cost of a receiver too on
top of it all 5.1 systems requires some
planning because you'll want to consider
placement concealing the wires and in
some cases you might even want to
install the rear speakers in the ceiling
if you don't want to go all out with a
5.1 system the best solution is two
stereo speakers and maybe a sub it's one
of the most underrated options but you
get great sound for music movies and
it's really easy to set up you'll still
have to spend a few hundred bucks but
the good news is that these speakers can
last you up to 10 years and they'll
still sound just as good as when you
bought them setting up stereo speakers
is really easy in this case I have a
compact amp that gets plugged into the
TV with a digital audio cord
then these two bookshelf speakers plug
right into the back with regular speaker
wire it's really that simple
so whether you go for low-end speakers
or invest in something more high-end
there's always a way to add audio to
your home theater for that amped up
