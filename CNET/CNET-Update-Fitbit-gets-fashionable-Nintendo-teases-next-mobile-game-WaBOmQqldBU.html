Bridget Carey
this is you're seen that update
today we welcome a new Fitbit into the
world there are so many of these fitness
tracking wristbands to choose from and
the latest from Fitbit hopes to lure you
in its style it's called the Alta the
main screen module in the center does
all the computing and you can swap out
the bands in multiple colors and there's
even leather and metal options for when
you're feeling fancy the band's cost
extra but the Maine also cost 130
dollars and for that price you don't
just get an activity tracker you also
get alerts when you're too lazy and
you're not moving yes judgement about
your life is now a feature in these
things because sitting is the devil this
model does not have a heartrate tracker
but in exchange it promises to
automatically recognize what type of
activity you are doing so it knows when
you're on an elliptical machine or if
you're biking outdoors or doing aerobics
all based on motion and that gets
factored into calorie burning
calculations on the app the screen also
shows incoming smart phone messages it
hits us stores in March in other
countries soon after you can get about
five days out of the ulta before it
needs a recharge battery life can be a
make or break feature for many people
Microsoft just updated its band 2
software to improve battery life when
you have GPS on for outdoor workouts the
GPS power saver mode gets you four more
hours of tracking because it'll check
your location list frequently Microsoft
also updated its health app so you can
enter in your weight and track changes
but isn't that a basic thing that should
have been there from the start microsoft
also has been busy with other apps it
just acquired the popular keyboard apps
Swift key which is installed on more
than 300 million mobile devices they
learned your typing style and offers
suggestions while you type the Financial
Times reports that Microsoft paid around
two hundred and fifty million dollars
for the technology but how about we
balance all this health and productivity
talk with some new games then tend to
announce that its first mobile game will
be launching in March for both iOS and
Android
it's called miitomo and all we really
know so far is well it's not really a
game game it's more like a social
network where you talk to other friends
Me's and share photos to get you hooked
there are incentives the new my Nintendo
Rewards program is tied into this but
details on points are unclear Nintendo
is releasing five mobile apps over the
next year and it teased out that the
next one is gonna have a well known
Nintendo character does that mean Mario
or Donkey Kong is coming to your phone I
don't know I'll probably just get
something with the dog from duck hunt
that's it for this tech news update and
there's more at cnet.com from our
studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey
