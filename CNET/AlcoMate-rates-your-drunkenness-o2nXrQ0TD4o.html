blood-alcohol level means you're too
drunk to drive I'm Wayne Cunningham and
I'm Caitlin for chocolates and we are
here looking at the aqua mate prestige
this is the breathalyzer if they can
tell you how drunk you actually are so
this little handheld device has a little
nozzle on the end you can take that out
for hygienic reasons so different people
can test it nice it's got two double-a
batteries that go in the bottom here
it's also got a replaceable sensor that
goes in the top and that can actually
last for about 200 uses they say or a
year now it's got this power button on
the side here you turn it on you push it
down you hold it down and it starts to
warm it up and it takes a little while
to warm up as we found yeah definitely
takes longer than I think a drunk person
would be willing to wait and once it is
all warmed up then you blow into it
it'll beep and blow into it it gets a
long beep then it's a couple of beeps
and it tells you it's done and then that
couch lights your BAC your blood of all
content I've had about Q beers so it
shouldn't be too terrible
can you drive survey says
no it's gonna say 1.33 that result does
not sound right that sounds a little too
much and it's telling me about a 1.6 1.6
1.6 wood beam that I probably up to have
my stomach pop no you would be dead yeah
that's not even possible they say that
0.5 is when most people are dead yeah so
I am not too thrilled with the result
Wow prestige and I've gotta say we've
had this out today we've tested it with
coworkers in a bar and we've tried
different drinks and make sure we place
the sensor on this - to make sure we had
a clean result clean starting point but
results have been very inconsistent and
something like way all over the place
yeah you know sometimes it seems okay
but most of the time it's kind of been
off the charts and and I wouldn't really
want to rely on my whether I'm safe to
drive to something that has these kind
of definitely not as far as price goes
this run's $130 list price although I
saw it on Amazon for about $80 so you
can get it for cheaper and the
replaceable sensors will cost you a
little bit more you can also buy extra
nozzles for it but I'm just not loving
the fact that it's very especially for
that price yeah once I mean is gonna
work consistently every time I'm Wayne
coming in and I'm Caitlin Patroclus and
we've been looking at the up m8 prestige
cheers Cheers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
