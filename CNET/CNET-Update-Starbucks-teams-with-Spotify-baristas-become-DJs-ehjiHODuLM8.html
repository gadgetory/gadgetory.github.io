music playlist to go with that coffee
I'm Bridget Carey this is your cnet
update Starbucks is partnering with
Spotify and bringing the streaming music
service into its stores in a new way by
putting the store's music in the hands
of Spotify users as part of the
multi-year deal Starbucks employees are
getting free spotify premium accounts
that normally costs ten dollars a month
and the employees can create playlists
for the store's customers with Spotify
can give feedback if they do or don't
like a song and they can also request
songs to play in the store the Starbucks
app will also tie in with the Spotify
app so Spotify users can earn points for
free coffee starbucks is known for its
influence on music and technology back
in 2007 it partnered with apple and
currently offers iPhone app users a free
song every week from iTunes perhaps that
relationship will be a little strained
going forward because Apple is working
on a music service to compete with
Spotify we'll see how all this works out
when it launches in the fall Spotify
also has been creative in marketing and
partnerships Spotify can be tied into
your uber app so you can control what
music plays on your driver's stereo and
reports suggests that Spotify is going
to be adding video streaming to its app
Spotify is keeping quiet but more
details will likely be revealed at a
news event on wednesday blending music
and videos is the name of the game
lately music streaming service title
charges a monthly fee like Spotify but
it also offers music videos and music
videos are showing up on all sorts of
apps snapchat has become a popular place
to debut music videos back in February
Madonna premiered her living for love
video and this week the electronic
musician known as gold room is releasing
for music videos on snapchat you can
find it in the discover section the app
is becoming a media platform for short
shows and news reports all of which
disappear within 24 hours in other news
Apple has made some updates to its Mac
computers it added the new force touch
trackpad to the 15-inch macbook pro
laptop instead of the traditional
clickable trackpad
this one has new haptic feedback it
creates sort of a tap vibration feeling
on your finger to make it feel like a
click without actually having a hinge
that moves up and down it also has
faster flash storage and longer battery
life in addition Apple is selling a
two-thousand-dollar version of the
top-of-the-line imac with retina 5k
display that's cheaper than the original
model which came out in October and that
also got a price cut it's now costing
2300 dollars and if you're wondering
what is retina 5k well it's a
ridiculously high def screen or you
can't see the pixels no matter how close
