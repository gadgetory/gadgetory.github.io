XPS one 27 so this is Dells brand new
27-inch almond it's actually a new
version of a model that came out earlier
this year the big difference with this
one is it comes with Windows 8 it has a
touchscreen and it has a new adjustable
stand on the back this is an outstanding
on one for a couple reasons but
primarily its said its resolution is
higher than any other 27-inch Windows
based on one on the market at 2560 by
1440 it's higher than all the other 1910
by 1080 on ones out there now you'd
expect that a high resolution monitor
and a big screen like this would not be
cheap but Dell is actually highly
competitive on price also the starting
price for this unit is $13.99 without a
touchscreen once you go up to the
baseline touch unit it's $15.99 and the
pricing scale is all the way up to about
2500 bucks this model is the $19.99
midpoint model comes with a core i7 CPU
a higher in graphics card and more
memory and a larger hard drive although
this one is actually going to be $21.99
thanks to a blu-ray drive although that
option won't be available until December
it has edge-to-edge glass of the bezel
won't get in the way of your input and
in general it's just a smooth touch
experience it seems like there's a
coating on the screen that gives it sort
of a smart phone quality to it and it's
a lot smoother and more responsive than
we've seen from other all-in-ones now
does of course come with a wireless
mouse and keyboard the keyboard in
particular feels nice and sturdy so from
this angle you can see the stand here
it's got a couple hinge points so you
can angle it up like this goes back to
about 60 degrees as well as move it up
and down this makes it easier to use the
touch input if you're standing in front
of it or you just want to quickly
interact with the PC it's not quite the
full 90 degree recline that we've seen
some other all-in-ones which actually
can be kind of useful but overall this
is not a bad sacrifice especially given
how easy it is to adjust the stand
let's while we're on the side of the
system we can show off the blu-ray drive
here it's a nice slot loader and then on
this side you can see there's a couple
ports so you've got 2 USB 3 s analog as
well as an SD card input now for ports
on the back it's a little bit clunky
because the stand does kind of get in
the way here it's only really kind of
awkward with the power cable and you can
adjust the screen enough so that's not
that big a deal over here though you've
got a couple more USB 3 ports there's
four there's an Ethernet input
also an HDMI input and output which lets
you use the Dell with other home video
devices over here there's a digital
audio output which is great and you will
see a coax TV tuner jack but that's
actually not gonna be available here in
the States it's only here because this
is a pre-production model that Dell
agreed to send us ahead of time so
depending on what price point you pick
up for this system you'll find different
CPUs and other different components
inside this particular model was a fast
performer one of the fastest windows 8
on ones we've seen so far it can play
games and it handles Photoshop pretty
much any consumer-level task you can
throw at it it's not going to be a
problem regardless of its internal
hardware at the start of the system
really is its high resolution display
for that reason alone this is the best
Windows 8 all-in-one around and that's
why it's an Editors Choice winner
so I'm rich brown this is the Dell XPS
one 27</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
