temperature of your beer or find your
cat when it gets lost in the walls of
your house that's because it has a
thermal imaging camera built in it's
called the cat s60 let's take a look so
let's start by talking about that camera
because it's definitely the headline
feature so this has been put in cats
phone by FLIR which is a company that
specializes in this kind of thermal
technology what's quite interesting is
that you can see on the back here there
is both the thermal camera and a regular
camera and when you're looking through
the thermal view it really makes use of
both of those sensors so you can see
around the heat imaging you get a little
bit of crispness a little bit of detail
and that's coming from the regular
camera if you take a photo with the heat
sensing tech what's quite cool is it you
can check the temperature of different
parts of that image afterwards I'm told
that it'll detect heat up to a hundred
feet away and it'll start to get a bit
more accurate when something is fifty
feet from you so apart from that heat
technology stuff what you can see is
that this is a very very rugged phone
indeed it's got a 4.7 inch display it's
waterproof down to 5 meters for up to an
hour and it's extremely rugged as well
I've been asked not to drop this one but
I'm told that it's pretty tough
so obviously the ruggedness of this
phone means that it's not going to be
for everyone but I have to say it is
pretty cool I really like it it's a lot
of fun playing with the thermal imaging
tech and I'd like to see that in other
phones as well and I can see that it
could actually pretty useful if you have
to do things like check where heats may
be escaping from your house or if you
just want to see which of your friends
has the hottest head so this is cat's
new flagship phone it's going to be out
in June and expect to pay five hundred
and ninety nine dollars or six hundred
and forty nine euros</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
