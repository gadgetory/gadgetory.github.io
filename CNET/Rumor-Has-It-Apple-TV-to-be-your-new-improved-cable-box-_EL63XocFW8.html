Dreyfuss and welcome to rumor has it the
show where we round up the week's
biggest tech rumours vote on which one
sounds legit and which ones seem like
there's someone's pipe dream and
remember that you can vote on all of the
rumors too so keep your eye out for the
pole in the interactive player if you're
watching on Cena it'll be right there by
my head first up in rumor land Motorola
is having a mystery event September
fifth seven days before the iPhone 5 is
expected to be announced the invite
tries to tantalize us by saying Motorola
on display for giving the incorrect
usage of periods in that statement it
seems the emphasis is on visual display
so could this be where we'll see the
droid razr HD probably we noticed over
the weekend that a handful of tutorial
videos for the phone posted on YouTube
only to be taken down when the rumor
mill started asking questions the videos
taught us that the droid razr HD is
going to be a whole lot like the atrix
HD big crisp and ice cream sandwich II
our next rumor comes from engadget which
picked up a leaked RadioShack document I
am isn't it just the shack no they
changed it back because they realized
that was the worst anyway the document
indicates that radioshack will launch a
no-contract wireless service on
September 5th the service will be
powered by cricket and will offer an
exclusive 8 gigabyte SD memory card with
all move music phones so Wow Radio Shack
will have everything except for
relevance yeah this deal was suggested
after someone was like hey one of my
opponent radio shack where all the guys
are really creepily trying to sell you
stuff because they're on commission
cricket next up according to a Wall
Street Journal report Apple wants its
streaming set-top box to double as a
cable box say people familiar with the
matter drink anonymous sources now
according to these anonymous sources no
deals have yet been made but Apple's CEO
Tim Cook has at least talked with cable
provider Time Warner and incidentally
that conversation took place in my home
town in Idaho at one of six restaurants
that I grew up going to as a kid
according to my local spies Emily nobody
really cares about Iowa Idaho whatever
the internet blew up
everybody freaked out people were
speculating that this is what Apple has
up its leaves not an HDTV but an updated
Apple TV that's your one stop shop for
cable streaming movies buying movies etc
and I agree I was all into the HGTV
rumor but I actually think that this
makes more sense at least in the short
term the apple TV is due for a major
refresh and this seems like the perfect
way to do that I agree but I just don't
think that it precludes an actual Retina
display apple television from happening
in the future also I think this is a
really good way for Apple to sort of dip
its toe in the muddy waters of cable
television try out an interface with
minimum risk and then take what it
learns here and apply that to the big
million-dollar television that it hopes
you and I go into debt for next year we
ask people this question at our rumor
has it launch party at cnet headquarters
which was so much fun let's go see with
the scene headers and our fans had to
say at the party well someone who
currently does not have cable in New
York that would be awesome i'm actually
on Roku's so i probably won't go for
Apple yeah I'm not really sure about
that one sure why not they're clearly
trying to attack the the tivo market you
know the monthly fee is kind of a bit of
a bit old-hat now at this point and so
if they can really simplify it and put a
hard drive in that thing or whatever
sort on the cloud or something I could
see you know I could see it being really
useful I think it probably will be a
cable box the cnet Council is composed
of five editors who cast their votes
anonymously their opinions are not an
endorsement by Cena or CBS interactive
obviously because these are rumors folks
and the cnet verdict is yes four out of
five editors think the Apple TV could
double as a cable box soon our comment
of the week comes from Apple rod who
writes about the surface tablet if it
goes for less than three hundred fifty
dollars I'll eat my hat we ask our
guests at the rumor has a launch party
to come up with what they think the next
iPhone will look like here's the winner
it's a cat unfortunately this person did
not leave their name so this is the real
winner this is a iphone that Scrolls
into
a pocket so there's that old tiny needs
new age that's our show everybody send
us your drawings of what you think the
next iPhone will look like to rumor has
it at cnet com and tweet to us and tune
in next week for more tech rumors thanks
to this week's sponsor eBay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
