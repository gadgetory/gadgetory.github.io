cnet.com these are the Sennheiser HD 700
headphones the first thing you'll notice
about them is their price tag
yeah these headphones are $1000 which
basically limits their appeal to audio
files that are shopping for a lifelong
investment with the most natural sound
possible Sennheiser brags about their
wide open soundstage that keeps treble
mid range and low end frequencies nice
and balanced with no exaggerated
frequencies steve guttenberg from CNET
sat down with these headphones and as an
audiophile himself he's convinced that
these are accurate and great buy for
shoppers that want to hear their music
the way it was originally recorded so
the bottom line is these are not only
the best headphones we've tested but
they're also remarkably comfortable to
wear for hours at a time speaking of
comfort don't be surprised if you forget
that these headphones are on your head
they only weigh 272 grams and these
plush microfiber covered pads let air
circulate around your ears so they're
less likely to get hot after hours of
use inside the earpieces themselves
you'll find 40 millimeter drivers that
are unique to this headphone that is
Sennheiser does not use them in any of
their other headphones on the market the
700s open frame supports the drive
inside three ultrafine stainless steel
mesh grilles that control air movement
inside for better sound and better
comfort the earpieces also move back and
forth as well as up and down on small
pivoting points for a near universal fit
and the open back design lets
environmental noises in so they're
probably not going to be the best
purchase if you're looking to drown out
noise on your morning commute but that's
not to say that they aren't travel
friendly the headphones come with a
sturdy padded storage case that fits the
headset the nine point eight foot long
cable with a stereo connector on the end
as well as a 6.3 millimeter connector
that you can plug into an AV receiver or
headphone amplifier in terms of sound
performance Steve found the hd7 hundreds
equally adept at playing movies as they
are at playing music the resolution is
obviously at the top tier of the market
and their neutrality is especially
noticeable in dialogue and lyrics where
voices sound naturally balanced and
clear one way you can tell great
headphones from lesser ones is the
headphones like these let you sense the
texture of sound
what cheaper headphones sort of implodes
the sound between your ears making you
more aware of its artificiality for
demanding audio files there's supersonic
accurate tonal balance and precision
will certainly make these a hit no
matter what the cost you can check out
Steve's full review on CNET but that's
going to do it for me I'm Justin you you
just took a first look at that
Sennheiser HD 700 headphones thanks for
