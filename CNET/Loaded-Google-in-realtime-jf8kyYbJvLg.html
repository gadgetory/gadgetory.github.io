made to help customers with any number
of problems like sinking an iPod with a
computer or connecting to Wi-Fi target

recycling program where customers can
receive gift cards in exchange for old
electronics and video games and Best Buy

program where you can exchange old games
for a gift card and similar to target
you won't get very much on that gift
card but there you have it and google
launched real-time search this is
different from live search and that this
lets you see up-to-the-minute news
comments and postings from Twitter and
Facebook on any given subject if you
google the name using real-time search

about that person and so forth to try it
out go to google.com / landing /
real-time youtube has a new movie
section for viewers in the UK there's
around 400 full-length films that you
can watch on demand for free this is
courtesy of a few deals that Google made

Jackie Chan flicks to Bollywood to
cartoons the same offering came out last
year to users here in the states and

way we won't see it here in the US but
it's being released in China it's
currently being dubbed the ebox and it
may be out in China by the end of the
