there's no question that who have done a
awful lot of good in the world as well
and you know today I think it's worth
thinking about Travis who I don't
actually know personally but who's then
you know lost his mother lost his job
you know he's you know he's created
something really special he must be you
know he's obviously made some mistakes
but my good you know he's you know when
you're when you're creating a company so
quickly and that it's just exploding all
over the world mistakes will be made so
yeah so lets us give a give a second
thought for for an extraordinary
individual who's human like the rest of
us and hope that the next thing he does
you know he can get back on his feet
again it has had to have saved tens of
thousands hundreds of thousands I don't
know the number millions of lives are
here today
maybe us maybe me because Eber exists
because someone didn't run the light
because they were drunk Richard I think
he'd be a good CEO of uber actually Oh
plantain he at all he has time for that
IIIi have actually put forward somebody
who I think would be a great CEO for
uber will see where they see whether he
gets the job but now I think I mean look
the point you made you know like I never
even thought about it but no question
and that amount of people who've been
saved who could afford you know they
people can afford to actually get get in
the vehicle a lot of people couldn't
have afforded it before it's made it's
made a big difference and they're
definitely yeah good point</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
