major refresh of the seventh generation
charger which shares a platform with the
300 this is the new charger if you will
with a new look that dodge says they
derive by going back and lifting
liberally from the 69 charger I say that
indicates that marijuana must be legal
in Michigan now because I don't really
see it maybe in this new strip of a
taillight back here they did carry over
that big body indentation on the side
from sort of a 69 look although that had
to this had one but this one with it's
all new revisions that touch almost all
the sheet metal no longer rings rental
car when you first see one on the road
now when you get into charge or any
charger but especially our r/t you're
greeted by what I would call a
curvaceously macho cabin
I'll give them a big kudos for the
matching look and feel of that
instrument panel in front of the driver
and this head unit over here between
driver and passenger doesn't hurt that
they've got a red black and grey theme
going on that in this particular car is
echoed by the seat under your but the
two-tone thing I can always live without
but that's just me in between those two
conventional analog gauges and the -
you've got a whole plethora of
automotive instrumentation now back in
the Haig unit this guy's generally very
good 8.4 inch UConnect it's very square
in its aspect ratio as you can see kind
of a dead opposite of what BMW does the
big wide ribbon using it is extremely
easy especially for nab because it's
Garmin power
you should have almost no ambiguity
about what you're supposed to do next
when you want to enter a destination
you've got just about every media choice
in here including SD card and Hawks and
USB HD radio comes optionally with
navigation by the way and behind all of
this we have the optional Beats Audio
which is 10 speakers around the car
including one very obvious sub back in
the trunk at about 550 watts backing it
all up under apps you've got a pretty
good array on these Chrysler's now a lot
of the usual suspects like AHA I Heart
Radio Pandora and slacker you do have a
hotspot technology you can get in this
vehicle
I'm not real
big on the concept but it's here if you
want it now drive controls your shifter
is this very cool-looking kind of offset
t-handle for the one choice only 8-speed
automatic paddles are these very small
but metal upright little horns behind
the wheel here two buttons here are key
as the driver goes sport mode puts you
in a sport mode which will dial in in a
minute but the one to the right is
interesting the super track pack hit
that and you load up a whole different
set of screens first of all you've got
the launch control screen because this
vehicle has that you can activate launch
control mode but most importantly down
here is where you set your rpm lock
point for that you can say what sport
mode means on your car including three
levels of steering tightness and weight
that's an electric power steering by the
way traction control can be normal or
barely there you can turn your paddles
off and on for shifting i've ever seen
that in the car before and if you want
to dial in the engine and transmission
personality those are coupled so how the
shift points are handled and how power
comes on under the throttle is all one
basket that's unusual to normally those
routines doubt separately the other
thing you've got up here are the
performance pages and then two separate
panels of discrete gauges that you can
bring up similar to what you can show on
the instrument panel but you can get
them all up at once the expected g-force
indication as well and then you've got
this sort of master engine gauge you can
bring up that I thought was fascinating
you have horsepower on a ring around the
outside you can get a lot of stuff going
on for eye candy for the driver okay
here's the part you wanted me to get to
in the first place the 5.7 liter Hemi we
had 70 horsepower they do it the
old-fashioned way
no turbos no superchargers no direct
injection no overhead cam this is a
pushrod v8 this is as old school as you
can get the year 2015 but boy does it
work 395 pound-feet of torque goes out
rear wheel drive base we're all-wheel
drive hello snowy climes with an
interesting system that completely
decouples the front drive apparatus when
you don't need it to supposedly get you
down to zero drag but definitely more
weight oh and speaking of weight this
car brings a lot of it over 4,200
on the whole that's heavy by today's
standards and trend toward light
weighting you feel it in the MGP 16:25
is your EPA rating that's just about
right we saw it dead on 19 average over
the last few days okay first thing I'm
getting the Chargers I notice there's a
little bit of a lack of headroom now I'm
six-two I've got the seat all the way
bottom now people always ask me how's
the Headroom in some of these cars that
have this kind of low greenhouse and
this one I'm just touching I do have the
optional sunroof bear that in mind let's
get on the road now in standard drive
mode this car is too much in love with
its own eighth gear but put it into
sport mode with that button I showed you
and now it's appropriately lively it
comes up and stays out of those top
gears at least much of the time so the
power that nice exhaust note are not
going to surprise you what surprised me
however was my first day with this car I
took it out on a nice country Drive with
a bunch of European import folks I
thought I'd be driving the big lunk
right and they'd all have the sharp
easily possible Italian rides well you
know what I did just fine a nice
testimony to this car is underpinnings
that are well done now of course an RT
does have a much better tuned sports
suspension but it's still dead steel
this is not an adaptive rig underneath
in any way shape or form okay a Charger
r/t done up bar way is going to throw
about 34,000 bass that includes the 5-7
Hemi then we're gonna add a few things
to get it seen that style of course
including Beats Audio for about a gram
the tech group brings you all of the
driver assist and the nav group brings
you navigation and HD radio all in we
end up a little under 39,000 so in all I
came away more impressed by the charger
than I thought I was going to be now we
do have a high trim high powered RT here
but that engines brawny american-ness
with a very finessed handling I wasn't
expecting we're a beautiful balance I
had to get used to being a little tight
inside however and having to coax the
power out of a car of this type I found
to be odd I wish it was more responsive
on every snap of the throttle in every
all in all it's a big sedan that does a
lot of things well and does them in a
uniquely American idiom</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
