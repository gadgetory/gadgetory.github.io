is being scrutinized for any clues now
software companies have ways to identify
specific individuals and pick them out
of the crowd that's what we're looking
for is the different ways that your
mouth has shaped the different ways that
your nose is shaped a different way you
know that the ridge is shaped and how
your eyes are shaped so all of those
kind of compute into metadata and then
that's how we run that search against
your face the engineers at 3v are in San
Francisco say their facial surveillance
technology works like a Google search
but four faces show me all men show me
all women show me all people over 30 so
I'm a repeat everybody under 20 or we
show me people who look like this
specific person those are all things we
can search on this technology can also
be used to identify objects in a
specific area like a child's backpack or
car if there was a report that a red
vehicle fled east on the street we could
run around a little against that video
and show you every single time a red
vehicle went east while facial
recognition technology can cut an
investigation from days or weeks to
minutes or seconds it also brings up
questions and concerns over privacy and
possible overuse of the technology the
surveillance technology is very good
uses I mean it can solve crimes it can
deter crimes but it also can all across
sort of cross the Creeky line and not
everyone might like being subjected to
this kind of potential cradle-to-grave
privacy intrusion while a hat or
sunglasses can stump some cameras
engineers are already working to
counteract these disguises in San
Francisco I'm Kara Tsuboi cnet.com for
