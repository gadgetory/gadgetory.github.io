budget-friendly hi I'm Sara metropolis
Cena and today we're taking a first look
at the very cool spark very cool has
made a name for itself with low-cost
phones that can be used all over the
world like other very cool models the
spark is a dual sim phone meaning it has
two sim card slots that you can use it
on to wireless networks at once the
phone is thin and sleek with an all
plastic body that looks a lot like the
samsung galaxy s4 there's a bright 5
inch 1280 x 720 resolution screen which
is crisp and readable on the back
there's a smooth cover with a textured
look remove it to get to the battery
microSD and 2 sim card slots one
standard sim and one micro sim inside
the spark is packing a 1.3 gigahertz
MediaTek processor one gigabyte of RAM
and two gigabytes of internal storage
the processor will serve you well for
playing games and launching apps but
just don't expect the phone to feel fast
the phone supports 3G and get hspa+ 4g
speeds but there's no LTE the spark is
running Android for da to jelly bean and
comes with most of the stock google apps
like Gmail and Google search very cool
also included a few of its own apps
including a file manager and a to-do
list there's a 12 megapixel camera on
the back and a 2-megapixel front-facing
camera and neither is all that
impressive even though I try to focus
the camera while shooting many of my
photos came out fuzzy and had lighting
problems at two hundred dollars off
contract the unlocked dual SIM very cool
spark offers a lot of value just don't
expect any high-end features with this
budget minded device you can read my
