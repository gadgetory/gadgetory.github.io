market leader but that doesn't mean it
couldn't use some help to stave off
competition and that's where this comes
in I'm Josh Goldman Lucy net and this is
the new hero4 session it marks a change
not only in shape going from that
familiar rectangular box to a cube but
also in overall use it's the smallest
and lightest GoPro to date and is also
the first to be waterproof without a
housing good down to 33 for 10 meters
with the square shape and no need for a
housing GoPro includes these cages for
mounting so you can rotate the session
into position the lower profile means
instead of having to mount it like this
you're doing this and if you can't get
the angle just right a new ball joint
buckle is included too taking a cue from
the action cams that start up with the
slide of a switch the session turns on
and starts recording with a single
button press a quick press starts at
recording video a longer one kicks it
into 8-megapixel time lapse photo
capture another press shuts it off
several recording resolutions are
available including 1080p 60 frames per
second and 720p and 100 frames per
second but with just this little screen
and two buttons you'll need to use the
cameras built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth to
change settings by connecting to a
mobile device or a wireless remote which
isn't included also to keep it this
small the battery isn't removable the
continuous recording time is about two
hours but the idea is that because you
can quickly power it on and off you'll
be able to shoot just the stuff you need
plus with the press of this button here
you can quickly tag the best moments for
easier editing another nice addition is
its dual mic system that dynamically
switches from front to back to curb wind
noise and has specially designed
membranes to clear water as fast as
possible with very good video and photo
quality at least in the daylight the
biggest rub for most people will likely
be price it's four hundred dollars in
the u.s. 330 pounds in the UK and 580
in Australia you can read the full
review on cnet com but if you can live
with its price and what it lacks to get
the size and weight down this is a
welcomed addition to go pros lineup</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
