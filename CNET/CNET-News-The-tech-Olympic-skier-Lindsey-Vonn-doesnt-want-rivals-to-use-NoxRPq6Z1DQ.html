alpine skier I use a lot of technology
and pretty much everything that I do
there's so much technology now that
helped me track my training track my
seat I think social media is a really
good platform to be able to communicate
with fans and especially since my last
two surgeries a lot of people have
written me asking how they can recover
better or rehab better from their
injuries I just like to write them back
and give them a little bit of motivation
and inspiration and try to get them back
on their feet of smiling again I think
training virtually would be a really
amazing tool you know one thing that I
feel like I'm really good at is
visualizing the course in my mind if
everyone was given that opportunity to
virtually train all the courses then it
wouldn't be an advantage for me ok guys
this it's done if I could have one piece
of technology it would probably be
something that was able to track my
skiing better hopefully in the future
they can come up with something that
will help me improve my training and be
able to figure out what I can do better
I hope people will recognize me as a
great skier but also as a good person
and someone that tries to give back as
much as possible I started my own
foundation know Lindsey Vonn foundation
in February and my goal is to empower
young women even one
