after after show I'm Patrick I'm Lynne
and I'm Caitlin and we're all seen that
editors who are big fans of the show
Westworld today we're going to talk
about season 2 episode 9 yeah and if you
don't like spoilers you should leave now
close the tab and walk away early
bookmark a gun bag oh yeah so this
episode was called vanishing point and
as the penultimate episode of the season
we got a crap ton of info crap ton of
info it's a subhead on this episode you
know the music director no I mean we had
you know some pretty clear timelines as
opposed or compared to other episodes
right so we it wasn't too difficult to
follow but we did have a lot of
flashbacks with William it was a lot of
information I found it kind of difficult
to follow except the men in black man in
black storyline but everything else is
like I'm so confused so so hopefully the
next episode will yeah I mean so we
start with William and like a ritzy
party with his wife and his daughter and
later we see Ford make an appearance and
we kind of get a glimpse on his home
life where his wife Juliette played by
Sela Ward loved her is we learn a drunk
she's been a drunk for all of it their
daughter Emily's life and we kind of get
bits and pieces of their home life and
we see you know maybe it wasn't that
great Emily alludes to her mother often
forgetting or not being involved in her
life with the gift of the music box
which we were kind of talking about and
it just seems like William and those if
that party scene it's just resigned to
this is my life
this is what I do on a day to day life
is hard being rich so Darren from what
we see of him in Westworld yeah and you
could see that you know when he was
talking to with Juliet with their friend
that they knew that they have this
facade that they're like this happy
couple but you know just like everything
else it's not really how it is they play
off each other very well but like I like
her escapism is alcohol and his escapism
is Westworld
so in that sense like they're definitely
making that comparison and also there's
a little like scene in the bar with Ford
and he slips them the card of all his
personally all the stuff they have
captured about him
I like that scene Ellen for the card but
if a lot like that scene in The Shining
when he walks into the bar and bets all
ghosts you know I don't know there's
that parallelism of the same like angles
and shots and some of that I mean for it
is essentially a ghost to us in present
timeline so it definitely felt like it
works
he gets his little profile card which
seems like it's like the weight of like
a black American Express like it sounds
like a metallic like a Chase Sapphire
good card this is your profile oh yeah
your your life limit is $250,000 no but
that was neat in him sliding it on the
bar but then he caught caught wind that
literally it's a handoff between Emily
and men and black who takes care of mom
yes yeah and we kind of see that despite
the facade or perhaps because of it they
have really spent their life together
fighting and angry and constantly
pushing down all of these you know
desires and presenting this United Front
to the world he is the leader of a huge
corporation we learned that he donated
massive amounts of money
he's supremely philanthropic from the
outside looking in but then you go home
and he's just like I'll take care of you
she's like screw you Juliet's like screw
you don't talk to me tell me something
true yeah I felt really sad for one was
that she's like he might have a history
of just gas lining her I was telling her
that she's crazy that he's not doing
anything and you know that the kind of
stuff that he does in West world and she
knows it too she has like a feeling that
he's just kind of this terrible person
yeah and he won't tell her why and we
know that goes through these pilgrimages
and that he probably doesn't invite her
she doesn't go with him and yeah it's
just like an awful terrible
there was references earlier that maybe
they were used to go as a family that's
how
as a kid and stuff but now it's kind of
like it's his thing it's his way of
supposedly coping with his anger or that
darkness that he has that they keep
alluding to I've seen the big thing
we've seen like hints of her suicide
throughout and I didn't I guess I wasn't
there was like a huge flip it was
interesting reveal that she was dealing
with alcoholism really bad and that is
that the alcoholism that's kind of
Williams fault is it the fact probably
it's heard that it spurred the something
spurred the suicide that was his fault
or is it a little bit messy because like
her father is Dilys and William is
William and it's like wow could you pick
more crappy people to be in between she
was I mean alcohol is about to get
disease too but she thought she was
picking the good guy she even said it
she's like here's someone who wasn't a
phony it was just himself the problem
was that was Williams facade like that
was never who he truly was and she
called him a virus well she basically
infected the family she was responsible
for like Logan unraveling he yes
definitely he was like responsible for
Delos and doing like becoming obsessed
with immortality yeah and like basically
try to take hit over the company and he
was like this company is gonna be mine
watch me and then now we know you know
in the end he shot his daughter so he
basically kind of like infected the
whole family and and she was probably
like you know I'm probably the way she
was driven to suicide and alcoholism
because of all the crap he did well I
think him telling her all about his you
know she he finally gives her a piece of
truth and it's that moment where she
goes oh my god I was right like he was
gas lighting her he never told her about
his darkness or how terrible he was
inside the park and he's like yeah you
were right you saw it you're the only
one who saw it nobody understands he's
like sorry I don't belong in this world
I have a long list for I'm like I was
like you want to be in this game what
about taking care of a family what about
being here and now and being in the
present and having relationships with
real people right and he's like I don't
it's the escapism too of that I think
that is what whether it's you're
escaping through for yourself or they're
escaping through for money or
immortality alcoholism all these things
are pulling you out of your reality and
obviously it's commenting a lot on where
we're at with uh society that where you
we use our phones we use the Internet we
using our connectivity just contantly
constantly escape those awkward moments
this boring room it's just tough moments
you know where does this line up in the
sense of the Della's timeline because we
know like we had saw earlier the season
of them trying to make him a host so I
think in terms of the timeline we
actually can go back to Episode four
with you know William and Alice's
interactions and exactly figure out
where all this happens the what third
time he's goes to see James Dallas is
when he tells him yeah Julie it's dead
and Emily is gone she blames me for the
death when Juliet picks Williams profile
out of slaughterhouse-five which let's
come back to that one so she puts it on
her tablet and looks at it and it says
subject 2 and it goes through all of the
things about his personality and what
he's like and who he is he's a supremely
rare personality type he's persecutory
his delusions and he's a paranoid
subtype and so all of that she's like oh
my god I was right this was exactly who
he's always been if anything can tell me
who this person I'm married to is it's
Westworld so she knows that they've been
mapping them she knows that they've been
performing these like experiments and
Emily even tells William later you know
uncle Logan which is really funny to
hear called tells me used to tell me all
these things but I just always thought
he was wasted and he used to tell me all
these stories and I always just thought
he was crazy and Juliet probably isn't
telling her daughter this because she
doesn't want her to see her father like
that but I mean she wouldn't know the
same things Logan does at the
at least Logan would be spouting off
wasted to her probably alright so I
think she definitely knows what's going
on I think she definitely it's the
realization that he's been gaslighting
her all this time that leads her to
suicide and I think our timeline places
it actually maybe just a couple years
before the final Delos visit with
William which places us maybe a couple
years before all this crap goes down at
West world I wonder - then how much do
you think that has we see it flashbacks
that her suicide has haunted him forever
and part of it is to blame that he feels
to blame for that but then it's also
really apparent that Emily does she has
a whole speech about the gift box of the
ballerina yeah so my question with the
whole gift box thing was that she said
she went through the whole trouble of
telling this story about how she forgot
she missed remembered that she was a
dancer she threw away the jewelry box
which is kind of a bratty thing to do
but it's okay this rich family's like I
want a jewelry box man um throws it away
and then it gets cleaned up but then we
see the mom put his profile card in the
jewelry box and that's and Emily gets
that profile card from her mom she said
that she left it as a clue about who you
were and it be and I thought it was
really strange that she left out that
the mom in the end did salvage that
jewelry box and I wonder I mean I wonder
if it leads to anything if that if it
becomes important later on or if it's
just you know a kind of a little Easter
egg it's like you know the mom was kind
of nice in the end but this actually
doesn't mean anything but I just thought
it was such a odd detail I wonder too if
her including my detail would have saved
her life
yeah or if it's you up or the opposite
way where it's maybe that is the detail
that it wasn't just William that push
mom to have commit suicide but also
Emily and the way she acted to some of
those things too I think and obviously
feel guilty but I think it's well
daughter was a bitch to her mom she was
gonna have her committed yes yeah but
then also like you have the her dad
telling you know pushing yet to do that
it's just like you know you and being
committed is like you know she wanted
treatment it's not like that that the
daughter wanted to find treatment for
her mom and she probably didn't act in
the best but I'm like mana black is like
super I feel like the weight of it well
in the way what do you think that means
that she brings up because it happens
and then we kind of get into a lot of
other stuff really quickly but she
brings up the fact that her purpose was
to bring mom back to life so to speak
kind of like they were trying to do with
papadelis
I mean what have happened there she does
kind of insinuate that that's what she
wants
maybe but she also in the last episode
told okay you know what I want is for
him to hurt and my way will be much much
worse than whatever you have planned and
so do you think she planned him shooting
her so a couple like did she did she you
know take into account she's seen his
profile does she know that he's super
paranoid was she you know constructing
all of this to really drive him over the
edge or was she going to duplicate their
mother and have her kind of RIP into
William or did it all just go entirely
off the rails yeah I think she
definitely didn't want to get shot I
felt like there was so she's like no I'm
not a robot I'm just not that which is a
really good language yeah I'm just
trying to I'm the daughter trying to
give a about you
it's Westworld it could go either way
but sometimes of simplices the answer is
the best words he it just shows you how
far gone he has that the one family
member he has he kills and you know
there are moments of like ambiguity is
we never get to see the scan if she was
yeah switching to I was like dude
Emily's real mikono Emily may be a robot
I'm like no Emily is real I don't know
man Madame black is a robot now no he's
probably real
yeah just like oh it now I'm now I
decided that both our real humans so in
both our wait you think both are yes
thank you really it's just like this
story would mean a lot more if he really
did in the end shoot his daughter and
that like him being obsessed with
Westworld had actual real-world
repercussions that he killed his like
only living family member and like so
why do you think he stops himself from
shooting himself another another suicide
attempt in this episode he holds the gun
to his head
I wanted him to shoot are they all weed
we all did yeah we we all I mean well
let me say this I did and I think that
I'm glad he didn't because there's just
still something more to reveal about him
yes and not I'm not talking about the
host thing I think that's like a look I
think that's a mystery that it's a
mystery
I think that's part of his paranoid
delusions I think he's you know
seriously devolving we see him
hallucinate Deloris at that rich party
we've seen him kind of you know be uber
skeptical of everyone and because so
everyone is a whole o forward you tricky
yeah like no dude we're like real people
it's like it's like Trump with the fake
media it's like you're a hosted your
host like if he doesn't get his way but
I had to say the jump though from the
last time we saw him on-screen two
episodes ago to now it does seem like
Edie Harris's performance all of a
sudden like we're starting to see more
of like oh like we see the where's
before it was a little more hidden and I
kind of like that subtlety but maybe
we're also at the end of the season we
have to have a little more like yeah
he's gone but also he got shot four
times like how he's dying
how was a 68 year old getting shot four
times and being able to walk at all well
I mean she Emily did help him a little
bit well it holds out of this but I
thought I was like she put it like a
little bandaid on his I'm I'm like well
there was four so well weren't you
getting blood from is it there's plasma
available I have so many questions
she's such a good medic if she could
like really like heal him so none of his
shots were like in his heart if we
assume none of them hit any major
arteries they all grazed him all the
bullets just like yeah yeah man I mean
she could have healed him yes yeah so
I'm glad he didn't shoot himself I think
that's you know he has a lot more to do
with tearing down some of the
experiments that he began and he started
and I'm interested to see where he goes
one more thing do we think this is the
last we're seeing Emily it's like we're
like oh I had a bulletproof vest
underneath my blouse the entire time
kind of thing or there might be another
reveal that oh she was a host the whole
time do we think this is the last of
Emily I was
scared that when he was gonna shoot
himself that the real Emily was gonna
ride along the horse and like dad what
are you doing the whole time I'm like
always ready I'm gonna be like very
hyper aware that any of all this could
happen I was reading her interview with
Vanity Fair yeah actress Katja Herbers
who plays Emily said she is a human and
is dead but this is HBO guys come on
john snow the exact same thing happened
with Kit Harington as Jon Snow he's like
no no I'm dead I'm dead like I'm not
filming anymore next for next season I'm
out have fun so who knows
so you're saying Emily will return in
the next infinity or sang is stay tuned
on Westworld season 3 Jon Snow I would
rather they finally merged okay so that
was definitely a big part of the episode
and then we have two of our other
favorite characters Dolores and Teddy
and Teddy commits suicide
awake Teddy commits suicide that was a
great storyline I'm glad that I will at
first I was like oh he's gotta shoot
himself he's gonna shoot her but it was
really good appoint himself it was
really good pointing at himself because
he was just leading up to the fact that
he doesn't want to kill anymore
and that he changed her and he's
resentful she changed him and he's
resentful of that and he's like I can't
protect you anymore cuz maybe like he
just doesn't want to do all this stuff
and finally when he's free Teddy the
person that he kills as himself
the only person free Teddy kills yeah
yeah I mean I'm sad Teddy killed himself
yeah obviously however maybe this will
kind of spurred Dolores to take a look
at what she's really striving for what
she's really looking for
she was flabbergasted it seemed like
when Teddy was like yeah you used to say
that the natural splendor line as he
looks at the horizon and she's like oh
my gosh she he remembers he's awake and
she's sitting there thinking I did this
I did this like I made him a survivor
and I woke him up and then he just turns
and he and who's to say that nice Teddy
could have survived anyways
yeah he's like that's kind of
unnecessary that kind of fine you know
just because I wasn't shooting every
executing everyone you wanted to execute
and this is nice teddy yeah like he she
bumped his aggression so far up but she
forgot about his loyalty in his brains
and he said feeling he was worried for
her when she when he first laid eyes on
her that she was cold yeah and she's
like did I wake him up was he always
destined to be awake
I wanted this in bold answer though cuz
I want if it's like that's fact she's
lost a lot because she lost teddy
she's lost her father Peter Abernathy
but she still has a little CPU the
little light bulb thing you didn't see
in this episode so hopefully that will
connect to hopefully the next episode
there's one left
yeah I wonder what their path is she's
lost Clementine in her army but that
might be a good segue into Maeve
Clementine and Ford and all that's going
on with that storyline so last episode
we saw Maeve her neck is basically be
peeled up and we see her musculature her
veins and arteries and all that stuff
and she looks like she is holding on for
dear life literally but good ol Bernard
tries to come visit her carrying his
good old ghost friend and conscience
Ford and Ford's like hang on I have a
message and he delivered to me he'll get
it from you though just you don't need
to go in there get into the room and I
had to say that was actually one of my
favorite moments next to maybe the Teddy
moment of the episode was Ford just
having this kind of father-daughter talk
the little kiss the forehead all that
stuff is just so heartbreaking that hey
look I had intended you to do a lot of
stuff but I didn't know that this would
be the path you chose now we know that
there are some hosts that are acting
against Ford's programming but it's good
because now sometimes when I have like
an inkling of doubt like Bernard cutting
himself out to give extracting Ford out
there was always like oh is he really
doing that as Ford making him do that
well we could still see you know
actually doesn't answer anything still
control people but I just
to know that it's there is a possibility
that the host can go against Ford's
programming yeah it's like a chance that
they couldn't do that and I think he he
he relishes that a bit for good and bad
because that's part of that game that he
seems always liked to play and how nice
is it for Bernard to like yep I'm gonna
just cuff myself the steering wheel
therefore I cannot shoot you
yeah yes after after Bernard delivers
the mave message we see him going off
with Elsie and I thought that was
actually really sad as well they're out
in the dune buggy and Elsie goes to
scavenge for these weapons and he has
this breakdown of oh god I need to get
Ford out of me so he does he handcuffs
himself and like Jackson and she's like
no secrets no lies in his face is like
so like torment she's like are you okay
which is like why do you have to go if
you're not gonna hurt her why are you
leaving her if you're already doing this
so that you don't hurt her yeah she's
like screw you Bernard you asshole
you have major abandonment issues for
the rest of her life giving her and
stuff but he's like doing it to save her
from right so weird I think he's going
to the valley beyond the forge yet a new
day a new vocabulary word that we have
to learn the forge the hottest club in
town in club in town in west throat the
Ford full of like crazy clementines yeah
Bernard who might be Arnold who might be
Bernards and somewhere fort ghosts yeah
and then that's the other craziness we
see Ford when he kisses Maeve's forehead
we notice her tablet of her personality
says core permissions unlocked and maybe
ghosts I mean apparition as it goes kind
of but it's he's more of an apparition
thing I mean he's just code he's just a
package delivery yeah that little email
message that he gave he's like please
he's cookie he's the new clip Iain I see
you're trying to control Westworld
would you like network it seems like
he's being nice to me yeah yeah I was
like I'm right here I know I know
no I mean I think he does identify
her the most she has this irreplaceable
desire to constantly help and find her
child and help the host and like Ford
also feels that way for as crazy as he
seems sometimes man all he wanted the
moment he realized they were awake the
moment he had that interaction with Aki
in Episode eight he went oh oh you are
waking up I did this i I need to
Shepherd you into the next stage of
evolution I need to get you there then
but didn't it take Arnold like dying and
killing himself to have them realize
that because it was you it took Arnold
way less time to realize yeah the hosts
are waking up and a large part of that I
think was his interactions with Dolores
and how often they would talk to each
other and it was through his suicide
because he was like I you know there
needs to be new Stacy I can't just like
if the hosts kill themselves for Gary
yeah and I feel like it took that
suicide then Ford was like okay I kind
of start believing it I don't think that
changed for it at all I think Ford never
really we never see him marry anyone we
never see him with anyone excelled in
Arnold we never really get the sense
that he had any human connections other
than Arnold and I think Arnold's death
was just Ford being like well that sucks
guess that's the end of Arnold's
experiment of you know true intelligence
I think that Ford likes me because
they're both British okay so another
thing that happens that gets us to the
end here is Clementine he's back loved
Clementine but she's weaponized
Clementine what do we think of that
zombie Clem with the mesh network
they put although the hosts in the
classroom and they put her there and he
gives them a little bit of a high-five
literally well maybe a y5y five and then
that's totally what happens and then
thank you the office and then yeah they
just destroy each other yeah in burn art
well Bernard actually watches it happen
and Ford is sitting in Bernard
saying like see what they want to do to
you see what they're gonna make happen
they don't give a crap about you how
come he didn't get looped in in them
Lynn I was gonna ask the same thing
I
think because they didn't expand her
network reach yeah she could NFC close
enough exactly she was on NFC bandwidth
not mesh net but and that's why they
restricted her I think it's interesting
cuz we saw last episode Maeve's
bandwidth has increased quite a bit and
it's curious to see what's gonna happen
in the next episode so what are our
thoughts on there is the trailer we
acknowledge here's an amazing trailer
with lots of interesting little cookies
we'll put it over us talking right now
but what do you guys think of that
trailer and hope for the finale well I
noticed that I think they're going to
pick Clementine against me because now
Clementine has the same mesh network
powers and she was the one kind of
chasing them and and maybe was telling
them to run away so I think now she has
a formidable adversary that has the same
powers that she has because you know
maybe was just like extremely powerful
so now and it makes it's poetic that
they made it Clementine yeah I was
thinking that too that's kind of like
hurt her so I got to you like Maeve is
now neo and now we have an agent Smith
in the form of Clementine yeah yeah
that's cool and there's always her
prodigy so we'll see what happens there
and you saw a bunch of Easter eggs oh my
gosh they're so many so man I tried not
to I well I didn't want to like get to
like there's so many so many I loved it
I went through I pause certain it's the
one that I am so concerned about what
looks like Charlotte Hale talking to
herself
it's Charlotte Hale not a mirror but in
light another in what looks like cold
storage kind of the same silhouette as
her is it her is it maybe like a
short-haired different host is she just
being approached by this naked host
randomly and storage or is it hurt are
we having another situation where she
kind of has this realization when she
found Bernard like oh my god anybody can
be a host now she might find herself I
think I have a deep cut conspiracy
theory that I think that it just links
up into Truman The Truman Show because
and the Ed Harris man in black is the
producer so it just all brings us
together and Jim Carrey will come out
and that'll be the end it's big in the
end thanks for sticking with us today as
