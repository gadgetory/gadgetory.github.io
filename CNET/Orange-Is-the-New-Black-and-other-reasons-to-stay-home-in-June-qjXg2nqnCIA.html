the whole kick-ass women on TV thing and
there are two shows that I am really
excited for first up orange is the new
black which has been around four seasons
now it's great
yeah but season five is where it's going
to step up a notch absolutely at the
start of season five we come straight
off the back of season four and at the
end of season four we entered in
full-blown prison riot mode this is if
this is a real man teasing this is a
step forward or backwards rape on this
season we're right back in the thick of
it and it starts hard and fast
especially because the whole season
takes place over just three days so
toothbrush tubes are plenty how many can
you squeeze into 72 hours I think you
can squeeze in plenty the second ever
episode was called tit punch now if that
doesn't tell you what the show is about
I don't know what will but this isn't
even the Netflix show that I'm most
excited about for this year I want to
talk about glow they're looking for
unconventional women whatever them hello
ladies
I'm Sam Sylvia and this is below sorry
what's glow gorgeous ladies of wrestling
so this one's also from Jenji Kohan Liz
flabby so orange is the new black and
homeland but it's a fictional show about
an actual wrestling promotion from the
80s in Las Vegas and the thing I love
about it is the really awesome 80s vibe
so from the old TVs to the brick cell
phones everything down to the pitch
perfect costumes and the soundtrack
I mean what I love and fair cop bitter
personal bias here is that it's a
wrestling show that takes wrestling
seriously so it deals with the business
of wrestling the behind the scenes and
the work that goes into making it look
so good
totally but for a show that's all about
wrestling it's not just body slams we go
into the world behind the wrestling but
the life of these women outside the
rings it hits the same notes as orange
is the new black but it's a much lighter
half-hour comedy instead of the
hour-long drama so you'll be able to
watch orange is the new black from June
9th and glow is out on June 23rd better
cancel your plans for that month</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
