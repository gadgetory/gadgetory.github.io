here and the sad fact is your gaming
laptop is probably not up to speed in
fact really only desktops with desktop
graphics cards are officially supported
by that oculus rift headset that should
be coming out a little bit later in 2016
except if you buy one of a very small
handful of laptops one of them is the
origin PCE on 17s LX which I have right
here the secret here is inside not only
do you get a desktop CPU which we've
seen in a handful of really big laptops
before it but you get a desktop graphics
card and that's because Nvidia figured
out a way to get that 980 desktop card
shrunk down to a former you can actually
stick it into a laptop so this is the
first mobile PC we've tried that passes
the oculus test basically you've got a
laptop body with desktop DNA inside of
course it's superfast blew away pretty
much every other gaming laptop that
we've tried also super expensive if you
want to configure it like this guy about
3500 dollars that said this thing is a
back breaker good luck fitting it inside
your your backpack or your briefcase and
lugging it around and the screen it's
only a 1080p screen you can obviously
push a lot more pixels with the desktop
graphics card it's kind of fun to hook
this up to a big-screen TV a 4k TV and
play games in 4k using this as the
driver and just watching him on your
gigantic screen it's more gaming laptop
than you probably need but if you're one
of those people who wants to be ready
and make sure that the new generation of
VR hardware is gonna work on your laptop
something like this is the only way to
go that's the origin PC
Eon 17s LX</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
