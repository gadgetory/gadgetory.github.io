and i am super stoked to introduce to
you you know the face direct or produce
or a rapper entertainment ambassador
also won a quite honestly one of my
favorite movies of all time drumline
thank you sir one band One sound that's
right on the stage Nick Cannon live here
make some noise everybody BTW what up
baby what's up how's your CS going CES
has been amazing you know i have the
title i am the entertainment matters
ambassador sounds very important i'm in
the bachelor of i get to do peace
treaties in macedon yet all that good
stuff now it's been a lot of fun and
I've been seeing some amazing things and
obviously my job as the ambassador is to
kind of bring the world of entertainment
and tech together which you guys are
doing as well so I don't know why they
need me here cuz you're here well you're
kind of entertainment part you know what
I mean what I'm saying is it's just that
cool idea that everybody understands
that you can't have one without the
other I mean obviously in the world of
entertainment with that's how we consume
entertainment is through Tekken with
tech you know we got to make the content
that is focused directly on the new tech
devices and stuff and at that enhances
that experience so it's pretty cool you
know I think also and this is this is
not any brown-nosing we've seen
entertainment matters ambassadors in the
past oh that did not have any street
cred like they they might be
entertainers maybe but I mean you have
been at CES before people knew you were
coming to see us before this title years
and you've seen a lot of tech tell me
about like you know what drew you here
to see us years ago uh honestly is a few
things one money no that's why they're
all here to you know honestly I mean
that the business of tech is we all know
that's why we're all here is tremendous
and early on i always say it was
probably doing it was the big headphone
boom uh five to seven years ago and i
was kind of on the ground level a lot of
that and
had some extremely successful business
with with monster and that business
continued to grow into the world of
tablets and you know flash drives and
things like that my company incredible
has kind of flourished in this in this
area and it's been such an amazing
learning experience for me and like you
said I didn't come out here to kind of
be flashy and all that stuff you you
look at how I did let's be really what
you want to see flashy we always like to
show off the bling here on the stage
tech paid for that that's technically
incredible whoa incredible watch right
there no but honestly when I first came
out here I came to learn a few years ago
I had never been out here before and I
was one of those people's like hey I
have some products I want to figure this
out and you know a few years later you
know it kind of all made sense in and
luckily I can be one of those success
stories to say hey I went to see us and
I made quite a few business deals here I
mean we launched a 7-inch tablet last
year at CES that we exclusively had a
QVC and now this year you know we're
launching our 10 inch tablet and we're
growing and we're doing also so it's
it's really exciting to where each year
I actually uh my business kind of goes
to the next level in the space attack so
I feel privileged yet now you talk about
people being here for money but also
people are here for passion and I think
sometimes forget like you know as an
artisan traitor that these are actually
things that you want to do like to you
sometimes I know you hear flak on the
internet about like this and that like
oh he's not really in the tech game but
how do you like responder address that
type of stuff you know it depends where
you where you want to start I always go
back to tell everybody man I was a radio
shack kid you know any like really i
would go to radioshack every week that
was my favorite place that's the place i
got my first DJ equipment keyboards
that's where I would go by RCA cables
and figure out how to hook the telephone
up to the television well you know like
I was that kid uh and then growing every
I'm a gamer you know me what are you
game in right now what's the lit you
know I know you're busy guy what's their
last game that you were actually feeling
I mean it it's interesting because I'm
definitely a sports do because of you
know everything from the two cage
Madden's and all of that I love those uh
but the multiplayer games I've always
been a huge fan of that so no the halos
of the world and stuff like I get down
with that a little bit um but then I
like to be I hate to say but grand theft
is always been my favorite why you hate
to say that because I decision that's
that's my game you know it has been my
game says but you know the sense the
PlayStation days um but honestly it's
just being a gamer I'm definitely been
in this space being somebody being a DJ
I mean I have to be in this space I mean
everything from I've been you know
buying equipment music equipment since
you know I was an adolescent and so it's
like I'm i guess i qualify as a techie
on so many different levels um so this
is my I live this life but I think we
instead of trying to kind of wave that
flag like I'm attacking we're all
techies at the end of the day you know
everybody wants to have the newest phone
everybody wants to have the experience
of whatever tech is to make your life
better and more enhanced so I feel like
that's what I've learned at CES 2015 is
that you know the the previous years
would be like hi how do we make your
life easier how do we bring everyone
together I feel like this year's about
enhancing the experience the own
personal experience how do you make your
experience better and that's what I'm
seeing everything from the wearables to
of every wireless to virtual reality to
driverless cars it's like yo we know
that there's stuff that's already out
there but these are things that can make
your life better so kind of really just
hit all the key bullet points a CEO you
did your tutor title right there that's
paying off ok we um as an entertainment
matters ambassador I found this pic that
was kind of used to associate you with
this and I liked it you know as an
entertainer we like to get into like
what is your mind thinking when you do
some of these poses so I don't know if
the people in the back uh have an
ability to pull that picture of yeah
there we go what is Nick Cannon thinking
at that moment what's your motivation
right there was the next business i can
buy uh no you know i was actually that
was that was I was trying to be the
inner
/ businessman entrepreneur I call it a
otra parte nur uh that's you know
because if you notice like it's very
colorful out of you my socks are like
like The Wizard of Oz which socks if you
see they're like all striped you can see
them right there but like the cut it was
but at the same time I was still trying
to be a businessman so that's that's the
Entrepreneurship retainer poles you also
got a little bit of thinker action ok
yeah i was outside of you know yeah I
say that yeah exactly now also um this
is this is a fun one I don't know if any
of you guys or many of you know this now
a little while ago you broke or you hold
the record you know what I'm going at I
do I hold the record for the most
selfies taking at one time with uh other
people not just off myself Oh many how
many did you hit in like that it was it
an hour how long was supposed to be
right i think it might have been an hour
i think we did something it was like
somewhere around 400 selfies are you in
an hour we have any of you even come
close to that I thought it was that I
had to go up and down the line and then
there was it was a lot we were actually
trying to break a few World Records that
day it was about how many selfies you
can do with individuals then we did the
longest chain selfie so we took one
phone and everybody had to take the
selfie and pass it along with the next
person so we we broke a few World
Records that day in the world of selfies
clapping for that he's happy about that
that is there yes an accomplishment that
will go down in history of Nick Cannon
eventually absolutely now uh do you know
have you heard this though that the Year
2015 has by some experts been claimed to
be the year of the Belle fille I don't
know if you know what the the yo yeah
what is that the belfie is a booty
selfie uh yeah I don't want to partake
in there okay you don't you don't want
to say i want to start it today i I'm
because I don't really like my booty
like that's the ladies asked the lady
said they want to see your podium I
don't want to cut know that why that
fellas you want to see Nick Cannon's
booty that's it that we're really no gay
so I saw a guy over there young hey wish
to each his own up
I'm just insecure about my backside
everybody else go like it not it sounds
fun though it seems like if someone is
really cool so I mean is that is there
is that a belfie stick yes yes let's go
back to that so that's how someone gave
me a belfie stick on my partake right
