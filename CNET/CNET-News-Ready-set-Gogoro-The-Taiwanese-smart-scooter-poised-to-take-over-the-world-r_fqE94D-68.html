scooter for three years revealing the
gogoro smartscooter at CES at the start
of 2015 the smart scooter was designed
from scratch by gogoro
and along with its stylish looks and its
battery system it's a powerful little
scooter - it accelerates from zero to
thirty miles an hour in 4.2 seconds and
has a top speed of 60 miles per hour it
has a range of 62 miles and features 80
smart sensors to monitor the scooters
health and performance co-founder Horace
lute explains why the company chose
Taipei as its pilot city Taiwan happens
to have about 23 million people and
onshore has 15 million scooters if you
look at the overall population of Taiwan
is pretty much much 1 scooter per person
and its highest density of concentration
per capita in the entire world for
two-wheeled vehicle so we pick taipei of
course the capital of Taiwan as the
pilot city and the pilot program that
we're going to run this summer to
validate into to showcase what Google
can do in a mega city like Taipei the
smart scooter sells for just over $4,000
and a subscription to battery swaps will
cost around $30 per month
a swap takes just six seconds to
complete and by the end of 2015
go-girl expects to have a 150 battery
swap stations strategically installed
around its launch city of Taipei to make
battery swaps as convenient as possible
industry experts expect the electric
scooter market to expand rapidly in Asia
25 percent every year for the next
decade that puts kaguro and its smart
scooter front and center as the Tesla of
this exciting electric scooter industry
of course
kogoro's ambitions for its smart scooter
and its battery technology reach far
beyond Taiwanese shores five years from
now I'm hoping that we would make a lot
more traction with you know different
different cities around the world
bringing this fun way of transporting
yourself from point A to point B to the
global scale on top of that we also
you know we're also looking at different
ways to manage energy and contribute
back to cities you know really
contributing to the smart grid you know
the everybody's been talking about smart
cities and smart grid
we're hoping to make a lot of leeway in
toward that direction coming up soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
