stops to get you interested in the new
iPhone 10s and pixel three let's break
down the specs and work out which one is
right for you and remember most of the
specs are the same between the bigger
10s max and pixel 3 Excel with the
exception of screen size and resolution
the 10s starts at 999 dollars for the 64
gigabyte model while the pixel three is
seven hundred and ninety nine dollars
for the same capacity in the US both
looks similar to the Apple and Google
designs of previous phones the pixel
three has a 5.5 inch OLED screen and
Corning Gorilla Glass 5 the pixel three
excel on the other hand is 6.3 inches
the 10s has a larger edge to edge oled
5.8 inch screen while the 10s max is 6.5
inches we don't know officially if the
iPhone has the newer Gorilla Glass 6 or
not but Apple calls it the most durable
glass ever in a smart phone Apple's
phone comes in space grey silver or a
gold finish while Google's is white
black or color called not pink inside
the iPhone uses Apple's latest a 12
ionic chip and the pixel has the
qualcomm snapdragon 845 both phones are
water-resistant Google's phone can be
submerged in over 1 meter of water while
Apple claims two meters for 30 minutes
while as charging is standard on both
the iPhone uses face ID or a pin to
authenticate and unlock your phone while
the pixel has a fingerprint sensor
pattern or pin if you want jewel SIM
functionality for two numbers on the one
phone that's only found on the iPhone
time for the camera specs hardware wise
the iPhone has two 12 megapixel rear
cameras one with a wide-angle lens at f1
point 8 and the telephoto 4 2 X optical
zoom at F 2.4 both cameras have optical
image stabilization the pixel on the
other hand has just one 12 megapixel
rear camera with optical and electronic
image stabilization
around the front the iPhone has a true
depth camera with an aperture of f-22
and a 7 megapixel sensor but the pixel
has two front cameras at 8 megapixels
each one is a wide-angle for group
selfies at F 2.2 and the other has a
regular field of view at F 1.8 the rear
cameras on both phones can film 4k video
but the iPhone is the only one that can
shoot 60 frames a second at this
resolution but the hardware is only one
part of the equation both rely on
software and computational photography
to process images the pixel has an HDR
plus mode and portrait mode that lets
you adjust the blur on photos it also
makes up for not having an optical zoom
with a feature called super resume to
enhance photos the iPhone 10s has
Apple's smart HDR onboard and you can
adjust the blur on portrait photos after
the shots been taken both the iPhone and
the pixel are top of the line phones
that look impressive on paper but this
is just a spec comparison so check out
the see net reviews for more about how
the pixel 3 and iPhone 10s compare in
the real world
