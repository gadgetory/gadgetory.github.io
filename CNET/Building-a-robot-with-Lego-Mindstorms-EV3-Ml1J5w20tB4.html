robotics expert but maybe I'd like to be
maybe you'd like to be maybe you've
heard of Lego Mindstorms which is a
programmable robotics kit the Lego makes
well Lego Mindstorms ev3 is coming out
September 1st and is going to be
compatible with iOS and Android you'll
actually be able to use apps to control
these robots that you build that's a new
development for Mindstorms now the kit
that we've got here early look at Lego
Mindstorms ev3 doesn't have that
capability yet but I did try to put
together the very first robot in the kit
for myself the tracker and it took me a
little bit of time but I did get there
what you get in the kit for $349 is a
whole bunch of pieces you get enough to
build not just one robot but multiple
robots and more depending on whatever
instructions you can find on the
included software that's available for
mac and pc and the future app that's
going to be available on Android and iOS
it tells you step by step instructions
it also gives you the opportunity to
program this robot yourself and what I
mean by program is it's got an A 9
processor in this main brick it's got a
variety of in-and-out ports it's got a
color sensor it's got a touch sensor
it's got IR control all that stuff you
can control via sort of like an
object-oriented programming where you
can take each element that you want to
program for each motor and drag and drop
into this interface and then download it
right here into the Mindstorms now
that's pretty complicated and I admit I
didn't get that far with it but I'll be
playing around with it a little bit more
setting up the very first unit the
tracker robot is what you get the
instruction manual for in the box and if
you only want to go through the
programming you can still use this as a
little remote control cool device here
and do some fun stuff with it there are
four different channels you can program
buttons here to do various things
this included robot that's pretty basic
but there are other robots that include
a big mech version and a lot of things
that shoot little pellets and have
pincer claws
and legs and all sorts of other stuff
this is really just this is kind of like
weak sauce for the robot building set
but I was proud to build this one this
little main unit here which runs on
double-a batteries also has a USB port
and an SD card slot the SD card slot to
hold extra files that you might download
into it like programs you want to run
and the USB could actually connect
optionally to Wi-Fi put this little
sucker connected to the Internet
wirelessly I'm not even sure why you'd
want to do that but I'm sure people will
come up with uses for it it's really
much more versatile than you realize and
I'm gonna have to spend some time
getting more in depth with it but it's a
lot of fun and it's not that hard to
build with Lego Mindstorms ev3 will be
out this fall I'm Scott Stein and that's
a quick look at lego mindstorms ev3</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
