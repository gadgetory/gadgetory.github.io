alternatives when Apple unveiled its
newest laptops the pro part was
seemingly de-emphasized let's see what
else is out there at number five the
Lenovo ThinkPad T 460 32 gigabytes of
RAM
that's something no new MacBook Pro can
do this 14 inch think pad has that
option and it comes with a touchscreen
plus a fingerprint sensor Lenovo claims
up to 18 hours of battery life which is
pretty dang sizable at number four is
the razor blade Pro razors laptops are
positioned to be gaming laptops so you
know they pack a punch the razor blade
Pro is a 17 inch beast with a 4k
touchscreen and up to 2 terabytes of
storage this laptop is also pretty thin
under an inch thick all of that is going
to cost you the razor blade Pro starts
at around thirty seven hundred dollars
at number three the Microsoft Surface
book Microsoft upped the ante with its
newest surface book with an Intel i7
processor and a new GPU that is twice as
fast as the previous version of the
surface book unlike the map of throw the
surface book has plenty of ports and it
can operate as a tablet at number two
the Alienware 13 r3 this SE 13 inch
laptop that is powerful enough to handle
VR for the oculus rift and the HTC vive
you can also get the Alienware 13 with
an OLED touchscreen but that puts a
starting price at around $2,100
one of the downsides to this laptop is
it has just two regular USB ports that's
two more than on the macbook pro it also
weighs a hefty five pounds but you want
power right and the number one is a Dell
XPS 4k touch we're spotlighting the XPS
15 version here it starts at $9.99 but
that model gets you no touchscreen and
that resolution is only HD adding in a
4k touchscreen and Intel i7 processor
and an NVIDIA GeForce 960 in graphics
card brings the price up to around
$2,100 the 15-inch version of the
MacBook Pro starts at two thousand two
hundred and fifty-five dollars so the
XPS could be a better deal there's a
good chance that you aren't watching
this part but if you are I want you to
know that you're my favorite I always
liked you I'm I as actor and I'll see
you online
