we're going to take a look at the wink
relay smart home control panel so here's
a panel right here there's a 300 dollar
smart home accessory it is that you
hardwire it into your wall
where you have a light switch and then
anything on that circuit becomes a smart
device so we've got some hard buttons
here they control the lights that are
out of my back porch there so anything
that is on the wink smart home network
that I may be controlled through an app
on my phone I can now control from this
one place here built into my wall to
install the relay you need to take over
a light switch in your wall and it has
to have a neutral wire that might be a
problem for older homes too it's
relatively straightforward you kind of
have to mess with the wiring setup
particular if you have a double light
switch box like this one is here but the
idea is you shut up the power undo the
light switch tie those wires in to the
relay it shouldn't be too hard to handle
though if you're basically competent
with home maintenance so there are a
wide range of devices that work with the
wink Network all kinds of lights and
lock some different sensors and all
kinds of things it's actually pretty
broad so for that wink is useful so
scroll around on the screen and you can
see some of the other devices connected
to this relay hub so I've got a drop cam
here I've got some lights I've got a
nest thermostat program down here and
clicking through to those will give me
access to any of those who are home
components thermostat integration is
pretty good and I've got direct control
here of the thermostat settings I can go
home away I can set it to heating mode
cooling mode it's not quite as in-depth
as what you get on the nest itself but
for basic interactions of thermostat
it's pretty useful in its resting mode
you see the time weather display it also
has some shortcut buttons that you
programmed through your phone that show
up on here and you can kind of program
all different smart home behaviors into
shortcuts here
so overall link relay works pretty well
we had a few connection issues but
nothing that we couldn't circumvent
there seems to be a lot of potential in
the product because if you have a whole
lot of different Smart Homes things that
you're looking to kind of wrangle into
one easy control spot the benefit of
anything else in the circuit becoming
smart is useful there
these two switches here but that said
you can get other in wall units that
bring other things online for much less
than this but if you're just getting
started with the smart home and you only
have a handful of devices this probably
won't give you that much value
particularly since most of the controls
you'll find in the wink app for free so
thanks for watching I'm rich Brown this
is the wink relay smart home control
