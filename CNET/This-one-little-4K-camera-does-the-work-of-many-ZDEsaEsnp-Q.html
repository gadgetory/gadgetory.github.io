better image quality but they also give
you extra resolution for editing and
that's the idea behind the four hundred
dollar livestream Evo a small 4k camera
that combined with its iOS app and
wireless capabilities could give your
live or recorded videos the look and
feel of a multicam shoot but without
doing it in post
connect the me go to a wireless network
or any iOS device and you'll get a view
straight from the camera you can
manually zoom in to a subject to create
a tight shot or pull back a bit for a
two-shot or go wide and get the whole
scene in you can then digitally pan by
dragging from one subject to another
with the speed of movement controlled by
how fast you move your fingers you can
create a set of cuts too so you can
quickly tap between shots or you can set
it to autopilot and it will handle the
cuts on its own and you can even have a
track faces as well as movement to
automate the process even more it's
built in stereo mics do a decent job but
you can also add or mix in audio via the
iPhones mic Jack what's more all this
can be done while streaming to Facebook
live or livestream site over Wi-Fi or
your phone's data or recording straight
to a microSD card the big downside here
outside of no Android support is that
since this is all done digitally the
image quality takes a hit plus it's not
particularly great Lola if your audience
is watching on a mobile device which
let's face it most people are these days
the results look good battery life isn't
great either at only an hour so you'll
want
get in or pony up for the add-on 10 hour
battery still with just the Mevo and
your phone
it's a cost-effective dead simple way to
add a pro touch to your band videos
sporting events or podcasts</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
