hi I'm Matt Fitzgerald and welcome to
the final day I've seen a 3d printer
build week so Matt we pretty much pulled
this off
we got everything to work we actually
printed some stuff and it seems like
overall it was a success
so we had this octopus here does our
final big print took about an hour and
15 to actually print this thing although
we spent a lot of time troubleshooting
you can sort of see the setup here we've
got the printer there's the build plate
that travels up and down and we're going
to get a print we've got our spool of
filament hooked up here it's kind of a
jerry-rigged but gets the job done
got a couple power supplies here going
into the 3d printer got a circuit board
for the USB cable coming off of it and
that goes into the PC that controls the
system that you want to talk about the
system side ultimately and over here we
have the computer that we use to control
this this is the prompter face software
that we use to send the files to the
machine and to process the files and
over here on the next window we have
skying forge or screen forge however you
want to pronounce that and this is the
part of the software that we use to
control the detailed settings the speeds
the depths it's also something where
there is a numerous amounts of settings
that can be set controlled and adjusted
way beyond the scope of what we delve
into here overall I'd say this was about
as hard as building your own PC would
you agree with that yeah no harder than
that definitely a success
definitely success maybe a few sticking
points here and there we had to kind of
Google around especially on the software
side yeah the actual construction of it
was pretty straightforward for us but
the software definitely requires you to
sit down and think a little bit about
the parts so overall this is a lot of
fun I feel like we learned a lot there's
definitely a lot we still have to learn
though I mean like you said we didn't
get into the settings at all there's so
many other things that we could have
gotten into about controlling the
details or the print right you get into
different materials and different print
speeds different heat settings like
there's a whole sort of it seems like a
little whole world of physics beyond
this so that's it thanks for watching
and hopefully we'll have an actual
review of a consumer 3d printer shortly
