curved s7 edge are here at last but how
do the phone stack up and what do they
mean for samsung in the broader
smartphone market we're catching up with
some cnet experts to get their first
impressions so Jessica the s7 and the
curved s7 edge you've seen them you've
played with them what are your
impressions of the phones are they any
good yeah they're beautiful they're both
made of metal and glass just like last
year's from the outside they look very
similar and almost the same to last
year's phones except the edge is a
little bit bigger but importantly
they're waterproof again this year and
they have a micro SD card slot the
batteries are larger of course to the
camera promises to take better photos
all in all everything is going to be
just a little bit better than last
year's little bit better sounds good do
you think it's enough bearing in mind
tower how close the competition is out
there you know these are very high-end
premium phones and I think that they're
going to be very attractive for people
who have an older phone but for people
who have last year's models I don't
think they're going to be as interested
in moving on to the cirrus versions and
in fact i would recommend that they
don't Chara samsung's had a bit of an
old time in the last few years it hasn't
been as on top as it has been in the
past do you think the s7 and s7 edge
you're likely to change that was the
company going to continue to struggle
these definitely aren't radical changes
so it's not going to completely turn
their fortunes around they're not going
to be able to get all these iphone
buyers to come to samsung what it's
going to do those kind of attract people
who maybe were interested in samsung but
wanted expandable storage or waterproof
or I guess water-resistant those are
very attractive features for them it's
not going to completely change things
and does it do you think it'll help
Samsung fend off competition from those
smaller manufacturers like Xiaomi or
well way who are you know making cheap
very cheap Android phones the problem
really for them is pricing so these
Chinese guys they have really high end
phones but their pricing them incredibly
cheaply for samsung we don't know
exactly how they're going to price this
yet but there's no way that they're
going to be able to reach the pricing of
the Chinese vendors so you know all
these features are great but it's not
necessarily really going to change
things for them on the low end</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
