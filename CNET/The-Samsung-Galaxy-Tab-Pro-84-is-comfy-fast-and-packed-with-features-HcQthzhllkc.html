the 8 inch range so obviously they have
a larger screen than say 7-inch tablets
but are a bit more portable than say v
10 inches out there the samsung galaxy
tab pro 8.4 inch is the latest tablet to
hit that tablet size sweet spot it has a
2560 by 1600 resolution screen a microSD
expansion slot and IR blaster so you can
use it as a remote control micro USB for
charging and file transfers as well
there's also the faux stitching from
some recent Samsung products and at 0.7
pounds it's still pretty light it's all
so thin and feels really comfortable in
the hands and I for one like the kind of
pleather e back side though it does
attract a lot of grease there's an 8
megapixel camera with LED flash on the
back and a 2 megapixel camera on the
front like many Samsung cameras they're
decent but neither takes especially
impressive pics there's a two point
three gigahertz Snapdragon 800 processor
inside so gaming performance is as
smooth as it gets on a tablet currently
the screen is incredibly dense with
pixels colors are vibrant and the
viewing angles wide HD movies run
smoothly and look great Samsung's
TouchWiz interface has changed a lot
over the last few years and has only
gotten better with each iteration and
this is the best version yet all the
shortcuts and customization options are
here the amount of settings available is
staggering the Samsung keeps them all
well organized the new magazine UX
interface is best described as having a
widget based front with Flipboard
underneath in that it actually uses
Flipboard for its interface in case
you're not a fan of Flipboard you can
customize the magazine UX to your liking
and minimizes footprint if the
traditional Android interface is
preferable there's also a ton of
productivity software from WebEx meeting
to a built-in file manager to e meeting
hand come office and remote PC the tap
pro starts at four hundred dollars for
16 gigabytes and there's a
five-hundred-dollar version with
32 gigabytes of storage check out my
full review at cnet com for more
information and a final recommendation
i'm eric franklin and this has been a
first look at the samsung galaxy tab pro
