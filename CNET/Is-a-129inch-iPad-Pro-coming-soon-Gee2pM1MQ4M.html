next week's event I'm Jeff Bakalar
filling in for Bridget Carey this is
your cnet update so at this point it's
like why is Apple even having an event
next week we pretty much know every
single detail there is to know at this
point especially today as we're finding
out Apple may debut an ipad pro and the
ipad mini for next week according to 925
max citing trusted sources a 12 point
nine inch ipad is almost ready for
primetime full specs on the new iPads
are a little light at this point but if
Apple does unveil them next week look
for them to be available this november
so while we don't have specific specs
about the new ipads the picture is much
clearer on the new apple TV 9to5 mac is
also reporting that the new apple TV
will rock an a8 chip that's the same
chip in the iPhone 6 and it will come in
8 and 16 gigabyte offerings starting at
one hundred fifty dollars the new Apple
TV will also run in iOS 9 core and
feature a newly designed remote that
supports touch and motion controls look
for the new Apple TV to focus on gaming
as much as streaming content but don't
expect it to support 4k all right enough
with the apple news for now let's switch
gears to Google according to cnet
reporters Roger Cheng and Shara timken
Google will hold a nexus event on
September 29th in San Francisco Google
is expected to announce a smaller
version of LG's Nexus phone while the
second larger flagship device will be
made by Huawei now say it with me huawei
we don't know much about the specs of
the new devices but there's sure to be
running the latest version of Android
6.0 marshmallow and finally Tesla has
announced the pricing scheme for its
electric SUV the first run of Model X
are going to cost you one hundred thirty
two thousand dollars just just for the
base model well that puts me I want to
say like a hundred grand over budget but
I guess
the future isn't going to be cheap I
mean this thing comes with a feature
called autopilot that's just what it's
called autopilot so I guess I'm not too
surprised what is a bit surprising
though is that the car is only going to
get 240 miles on a single charge which
isn't as good as other Tesla models so
where is that magical 35 thousand dollar
Tesla that everyone's always talking
about the model 3 well Elon Musk said in
a bunch of tweets that pre-orders will
begin March of next year that will do it
for this tech news update you can always
