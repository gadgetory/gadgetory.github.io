short-circuit had a lovechild maybe this
is what it would look like meets chipper
on a projector robot obviously it has a
projector inside at 720p resolution can
expires tomorrow NAND slide by that you
can control its movement around your
house now in terms of the projector
component you can show you things from
your smartphone such as your Facebook
newsfeed your Twitter timeline and there
is also an HDMI port as well in the
robot so you can connect something like
the fire stick or a chromecast you can
also change the orientation of the
projector from portrait to landscape so
imagine instead of pulling over in the
morning to your smartphone and picking
it up from the console all you need to
do this is call up the robot and
projects your Twitter timeline or your
email onto the ceiling and you can read
it straight from the comfort of your own
bed you can also leave via a camera
exactly what the robot is me in real
time and
programs certain places around your
house within the app and then the robot
knows that this is a designated area
such as its charging station so when it
needs to recharge it just goes there
automatically now the tip run is going
to be available in spring or summer of
2016
around 1000 to 2000 dollars but hey here
at CES 2016 where it's hard to make new
friends
I think I'm banning you on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
