last year LG switched gears with the g6
it's a lot like most typical flagships
you see but by playing it safe LG made
the smarter move the g6 has a polished
design and its 5.7 inch display has an
uncommon 18 by 9 aspect ratio because of
this taller proportion your eyes will
get an extra helping of content to view
not all apps are compatible with this
ratio though so you'll need to adjust it
in setting the phone is also dust and
water resistant it can be submerged in
about three feet of water for up to 30
minute it kept on ticking after I dunked
it in a fishbowl and splashed it in a
shower for 30 minutes each water
resistance unfortunately usually comes
with non-removable batteries and the
same applies for the g6 the longtime LG
fans this might come as a disappointment
but there are some upsides LG increase
the battery capacity just a notch to 3.3
ampere hours during our lab tests for
continuous video playback on airplane
mode the handset lasted an average of 13
hours and 21 minutes which is better
than a g5 s 12.5 hours for us customers
it can wirelessly charge now - even when
it's wet the handset has a dual camera
setup with 230 megapixel cameras on the
back there's a standard englands and a
120 degree wide angle lens so you can
capture more content in each frame the
five megapixel front facing shooter has
a wide angle as well if you do take
wide-angle shots know that angles will
be distorted and elongated from the side
especially when it comes to selfies with
a front facing camera the camera also
took underwhelming muddy shots in low
light but other than that you'll be
satisfied with the cameras which
generally takes sharp and vibrant
pictures LG added a separate camera app
- called square camera it offers a
number of different tools to take neat
square photos some parts of the app can
be confusing to figure out first but
once you get the hang of it the results
can look pretty cool aside from the
Google pixels the g6 is the only other
phone so far to have Google assistant
natively you can chat with assistant to
look up random facts the news and nearby
places it's deeply integrated with
Google services - so it can remind you
of events in your calendar or call up
your emails the g6 is less exciting this
year
she is covering the basics and doing it
right the s8 may still be the superior
phone it looks better and has a more
recent Snapdragon 835 chipset for
example but Samsung is still suffering
through some note 7 fallout the g6 is
capitalizing on that especially since
it's about 30 to 100 dollars less than
the s8 depending on where you get it it
may not have anything novel or buzz
whether you go for the first time in a
long time
it's LG's most marketable and wide
appealing flagship yet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
