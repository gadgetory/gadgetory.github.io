photo shoot interview I'm a Gemini I'm
in my you know my mom I'm in my late
early whatever I don't eat meat except
on a cheeseburger I like ponies did I
already say that I am very passionate I
don't work to make friends I don't work
to be liked I worked to bring character
to life but I hated my own and when I
met on the other side by a filmmaker
that sees that I feel very like I matter
and for an artist and also for a woman
that that sometimes can be everything
avatar was a film where I created this
character with James Cameron you know
when he allowed me to add textures to
hurt his tail is gonna dictate the way
that she walks the way that she moves
her neck and he was like yes absolutely
let's do it let's research it
and space is different it allows you to
experiment with other roles besides
someone's girlfriend someones mother
someone's wife someone's victim you feel
much more relevant in space you know
you're helping the whole crew save the
day you're translating alien languages
as opposed to being at home and being
the one that you know encourages you to
win the day you know and then when they
killed my roll off you don't even shed a
single tear my first reaction is I'm
happy I'm proud I'm humbled oh my god
that is in my face why do they do the
hair like that oh those arms are just a
little do like basil and then you
realize can you just stop and appreciate
the fact that you're you're an action
figure you know
I like the connection that you can have
with your fans it's been very flattering
and very humbling when the person on the
other side receives it and responds
saying thank you because then it lets
you know oh my god we do need each other
wait guys sorry I have something for you
right here and it's um it's this it's
this right here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
