tab this is the show where we have a few
drinks and we chat with you the live
viewing audience on facebook on youtube
wherever you're coming from thanks for
joining us my name is Jeff Bakalar on
the couch or two very special guests the
first one you will know him if you
listen to my podcast the 404 show he is
the audio feely act man himself mr.
Steve Guttenberg my rope off Max's
gardenburger left-back the spear spear
his nickname is fear everybody do do
yourself a favor and admire the man's
shirt for a second that's corn on the
cob horizontally corn on the cob respect
that drink it in for a second yeah to
his left is senior editor hi pendlebury
how are you sir I am very well sir
thanks for being here thank you you guys
have your own podcast right yeah yeah in
you to show butyral yeah greatness on
out I thanks for the cocoa during open
tab we are taking your questions and
comments live so do yourself a favor and
get mentioned on the show type it on
that keyboard that you're sitting at or
on your phone and while writing this
typing's with your thumbs now you were
what is both kinds of typing I'll show
you what a phone looks like it'll be
great all right never smart so do all
that and we'll respond to that whatever
you guys want to talk about we will talk
about but you guys are experts in the
field of audio and fidelity I want to
ask you guys some questions about the
way we listen to music these days and
you guys will hopefully be able to help
out some of our viewing audience so how
do you guys people who take audio to
such a level that most people don't who
care about that that phonic sort of feel
the phonic fear the phonic feel I just
need your podcast so simply put how do
you guys listen to music like what what
is your sort of ritual with that I think
we both differ
I'm most thing almost completely digital
right with a bit of vinyl going in there
you consider him like a savage yeah he's
a savage Iverson I am from a colonial
Country sure you know so when we're sick
backwards a little bit yeah so when you
say digital-only explain that most of
the stuff i will probably buy a couple
of second-hand cds but most of the stuff
i buy is flac file straight from the net
right and flac files reveal don't know
that's flac that is the the best
encoding or raw it's the raw sword right
so it's compressed like a zip file so
everything that goes in there comes out
again whereas something like an mp3 you
pull you pull bits out willy-nilly
almost just to get the size down right
people don't realize how much audio
information is being deleted when you
listen to an mp3 Steve's read me the
riot act most most streaming is mp3
rightmost streaming is mp3 as well so
okay so we have your the digital guy for
this conversation and Steve well I can
guess what side of the fence yes i'm in
the pure and perfect side but no
seriously when when you ask that
question for me it's like where do I
listen Brian listening at home is very
different and better in almost every way
than listening somewhere else so you're
saying you're staying quiet everything
people don't take the time to just sit
down from the right whatever it is the
people will take that side of the iphone
in your stereo their gramophone whatever
you want to call it right they're not at
one with their music the music is they
do another thing multitasking whatever
so you see you don't think there's
enough of just like sitting down and and
and appreciating what you're listening
to I'm not saying that's the only way
right I'm just saying if you love a band
sometimes just listen to a tune close
your eyes and don't do anything else
closing of the eyes I've actually stops
you from multitask yeah I've done that
I've closed my eyes and I fell asleep so
what band was it ah lady was more like a
jazzy cameras man no announcement they
they would put me to bed maybe one
like a child 10 talking about recently
okay i can't speak for their current
stuff well anyway so yeah some people
doesn't make any difference do some ppl
they'll hear things they'll feel
differently about the song sure how you
feel about music is really the whole
whole bowl and you just want people to
get something from you so so connected
to the music I mean the artists they
have work weeks months or possibly years
right to craft an L of them and if you
just have it on as you're doing other
stuff you're missing a lot of the one is
respectful say it yeah it's just these
kids these kids what do they know well
they know a lot about streaming music
because that's basically how the planet
consumes music these days it makes me
sad so what what can people do I know
you're another in a bit of the minority
there but what can people do to get the
best sound quality out of streaming
services I mean a lot of people use
Spotify as far as the best you can click
the extreme quality button right that's
such a good is a higher bitrate right
then what you get from the free version
but is there anything people can
actually do to improve the quality get
get a good pair of headphones yes I was
gonna I was going to let everybody in on
a secret what's that whether it's a
lossy mp3s or flac files the way to make
things sound better is to have better
headphones or speakers okay that's way
more important so you think whatever
think that's the number one tool
absolutely door speakers better
headphones and something that I exit
victim is the latest generation of
phones you're Samsung's or your your
iphones actually have a pretty good
headphone abdomen not really audiophile
quality but they'll drive a good set of
header you can spend 600 bucks on a pair
of headphones and they'll sync sound
great food one of those feels right yeah
because I have a decent set of earbuds
that I use on my Nexus 6p listen in a
flac files and I I'm super happy with
that relation if you listen to an mp3
file it's not gonna burn holes in your
yeah you're gonna die because you know
you won't die you might die a little
inside but you're not gonna actually
drop your phone in your the follicles
right the nerve endings they'll die
they'll die the risk Oh it'll be like oh
I'm not I'm unimpressed yeah um what
about where
you listen we talked about this briefly
with you minute ago but like where you
listen to music has a great deal of an
impact of like the actual content that
you're consuming right like for me I
know if I want to check out the newest
you know album from one of my favorite
bands I'm probably not going to listen
to it while I'm walking through the
street just because like you said like I
do maybe wanna have a little bit of a
quieter thing I'm not gonna sit in the
corner of the room with close my eyes
and do it but I'm gonna like like in a
lotus position exactly it's like
meditate I'm not gonna do that
necessarily but I'm gonna find the time
to do it where I'm not multitask I think
better of you know oh my stock has risen
a little bit all right fair enough but I
think for me like on the subway is
basically the only time I can funnily
enough get at some alone time sure
having a good set of headphones in a
decent music player even even if you
trade up from a normal phone I've had
some pretty you know fun experiences on
a train listening to musics right if you
get some decent sort of noise blocking
ones and you know then you'll be okay
yeah well yeah aside from your freaky
deaky like listening ritual where else
can people listen and get like an okay
experience you mean other than home
other than home it probably be turnip
Ark bench right pose your eyes just got
birds tweeting around too huh no life is
just a big like fantasy for you big
fantasy what do you already thought what
are you sound like you're closing your
eyes in public places you don't I'm not
alway York City close my eyes all it's
fair enough does make a big difference
oh I so close that's true that's a whole
other story that will get to the next
time on the show don't forget we're
taking your questions and comments
anything audio related you got two of
the most prolific audio reviewers in the
biz right here so knowledgeable too
knowledgeable too i think that was
implied with largest cell if it meant a
lot it did not quality nobody hears
stuff the way these guys hear stuff so
make sure you get those in right now
guys what would you say are your
favorite speakers and or headphones wait
because less because if you go to get
headphones yeah you do headphones Steve
what you know the headphone guy what's a
good headphone for someone with like 100
our but I am I'm glad you're sitting
down because I'm going to say something
that you're not going to expect you
might think this is april first or
something oh my god you're gonna throw
this is curveball Guttenberg yeah hold
on look at your chicken scratch that
just falls off the tongue so it's the
bose soundtrue ultra in-ear headphones
they're not sound buds that rests on
your auditors they actually get jammed
into airs right but the 129 bucks
they're super super comfortable and it's
the first bows in your head phone or
your bud that I like now I don't like it
I love it Wow games for that kind of
money it's hard to beat traditionally
you despise everything well I you know
impartial journalists of course I treat
everybody fairly right I used to should
you just they just haven't had a great
track record with you yeah everything
sucks everything's oh no no we found it
alright this is you know what they say a
stopped clock is Right twice a day so
every now and then they can squeeze out
something good you never go back to me
your crappy ones alright alright so tell
us how you really feel um yeah this is
coming in from YouTube commenters as
well like what's what about speakers
what's a favorite speaker of yours well
speakers is a weird one because you can
get passive speakers for about a hundred
and thirty dollars a pair massively I'm
up to an amplifier receiver was right
bs22 yes spb as 22lr right so a lot the
i guess the future of those selected 720
oh the future those speakers is kind of
weird because pioneer sold most of its
musical assets to onkyo who now
continuing the brand and I guess the
Americas the only market the carries
Andrew Jones all a lot of Andruw Jones
products okay so you know some of these
speakers go on sale all the time some of
the speakers disappeared like they had a
sound base which is completely gone now
so if you want to get Andruw Jones
speakers now that he's moved on as well
to elac and produce it some really great
stuff if you want to get Andruw Jones
pioneer stuff I'd say don't graduate I
mean seriously it's there's nothing
comparable for 129
I love seeing audio dudes get excited
about I'm excited to get excited about
something that real people can bods yeah
it's practical and his neck at all i
like to get if i can't afford it it's
another 20 min dollars where ya Mac
McGill I mean there are other cheaper
speakers say from dayton audio but i
don't think that had the same hole not
even close we are you talking about
onkyo onkyo i remember when back in the
day I used to check out some onkyo
systems and whatnot those they make like
the whole all 10 toes companies like a
key oh it's like vintages of wine
they're good years they're nuts okay so
you like times they're good so the 2012
was a nice yeah that there's too much
rain in 23rd yeah yeah you can take all
the crew could hear you say it was
wetter yeah I all I can say in bed onkyo
is that my one of my favorite
experiences and one of the things that
clued me in to the high five hobby was
listening to dark side of the moon on an
onkyo turn I know you talk 70s onkyo
turntable electronics beautiful it's
good analog yeah I don't know I feel it
say so that didn't happen on a flat file
no it did you can still experience that
lately you know you can still get good
stuff out of flack like yeah I listen to
black I feel like I'm getting something
you get more are but you're the thing is
you literally do not know what you're
missing with mp3's right it's like if
you only had wood rosin orange juice and
you never had an actual fresh-squeezed
arms your time fussing I just spine it's
great yeah cuz you don't know when an
actual orange tastes like okay how about
this what is the what is the lowest it's
not it's a little unfair all right
exaggerated that's like not not the ebon
Collins I never called you a snob Steve
but you're a bit of a snob no I it's
because I care it's because you care and
you listen see look I'm cover I could
just sit in my house and Sarah I don't
care about you guys oh yeah I got what I
need say scream I do this because I'm
trying to help people spreading the love
I am through seven I'm spreading
everything oh ok height is possible fair
enough oh how do I pivot out of that i'm
not sure what about sound bars you go
back to my shirt soundbars soundbars get
a lot of they catch a lot
of heat because some people say they're
crap some people swear by them would
what's a crazy to swear at them yeah I
think there's a number every now and
then that I I admire like they've come a
really long way you're happy I am
especially for movies I'm generally less
happy with their sound for music okay
for movies is there one you recommend
for under a hundred dollars no no okay
that's good to know you want a sound bar
you got to spend a little more money and
spend at least two hundred bucks okay
what a name a brand real quick that
you've got some really good stuff at the
moment pioneer if you can still get
pioneer stuff is good yamaha stuff is
good that's pretty much i'm learning a
lot i actually have to take some notes
because people are asking me about sound
bars I believe we have questions from
the live audience let's check in with
Mike hi guys so we have a few comments
from our about sound from people Melissa
says I do think a bit is lost via phones
for sure mostly her own hearing Jackson
says she just wishes Apple music and the
music app were separated pizzas that he
misses the attention given to album
packaging some people are still trying
he lists to ol Beyonce etc as examples
and Paul is the question he says he has
so no speakers he's deezer flag high in
service he used wondering if you guys
think more music services are coming on
the horizon probably not I mean the big
one or the big rumor this week was that
Apple is supposedly in talks to buy a
title so i think that that what's going
to happen is you're going to see
consolidation of your music services
because there's a lot particularly in
Europe there's people like deezer and
wimp became time title and it was its
own brand for a while so it's going to
get smaller rather than bigger I can see
people being really boutique II and
collating in and being like that but
they're not gonna make much money idle
began me you missed your big opportunity
what's up just wait right past it what
the whole room thing Oh rune other guy
loved one works room room is a very
TWiki hifi system which integrates
meteor on your hard drive with title and
make
him into one library oh ah ah great
service amazing interface plus five
hundred dollars but oh so this is this
well that's for the lifetime okay I mean
yani Bugsy that's actually not good for
seven years all right i love the service
yeah i'm still trying to convince steve
of it okay I like bose headphones and
right get anything's possible yeah oh do
you guys ever think some like a spotify
would switch would turn the flack switch
on sure yeah yeah cuz that i feel like i
would pay more money you i want oh I
makes more I'd pay five dollars usually
double I pay five right now what Spotify
10 bucks okay look I pay with your page
one i paid fifteen i don't think i'd pay
20 i paid 24 title and i love it yeah
Tyler got rid of Spotify this is a
regular the stigma associated with title
is understandable for sure stench what's
that the stench yeah the stench
emanating right but at the same time
like the service is great the service is
really good it's just because the oil
rig little molecules around right yeah
um yeah I feel like I would definitely
pay 15 a month for Spotify titles 20
yeah yeah see that's like me that's kind
of like the threshold for me right um I
just think like I think streaming flak
is like such a bad idea right i was
super psychic went idle came along say
they were doing that but then all that
other stuff happened there i canna left
but on your Spotify do you put stuff on
your phone do you download to your phone
I don't why not should I I do I mean
I've never really found myself in a
situation where I mean I also do have
the flag stuff that I bought loaded onto
my watch so that's kind of work I i
balance it they used to buy and download
itunes not often but I do yeah I kind of
guilt out of guilt and yeah I you know
good self-pity good that kind of thing I
prefer the kilt all right Colonel
anything gets you to support living
bands right make them say hey guys you
know it's okay make more record name or
somebody well yeah well actually fine
it's true and you know to that point
someone in the chatroom brought up the
idea of like the lost art of you know
packaging and and that kind of
experience of opening the record opening
the Sienna
you know I struggle with that because I
used to love that growing up by buying
the new you know no effects ed like flip
it through the thing by whatever like
seeing Oh what are they saying in that
song what is this Oh what are these
awful photos they decided to include in
the booklet that's interesting oh that's
a weird stamp they have on the CD that's
weird um yeah I missed that but just
like a book cover I've kind of just
learned to let it go you're right now if
you love it set it free that's what I
say but something is lost it is lost I
think you know what I think's lost I
think a band or a group or whoever an
artist has a tougher time communicating
their personality right I think like
that's kind of lost in the whole thing
music videos I guess are still a thing
on YouTube they're nowhere near as
prevalent as they were in the 80s and
90s I feel like that communication is
kind of lost well oh well uh thank you
so much for being here Steve you have to
say goodbye to you we're going to take a
break when we come back someone
different is going to be sitting where
you were at all right we're gonna fill
my shoes definitely not because you have

now sitting on the couch like he owns

tab mr. Joseph Kaminsky it's good to be
the king it is good to meet you look
well you look well-rested I am thank you
yeah back from the Caribbean wasn't it
the Bombers tell us what you do there
did you gamble Leah did I didn't I don't
gamble not with money not on gamble I
don't gamble just with life I'm a sure
thing all right ah we got Joe back here
ties going to stick around it's time to
parlay this conversation into what we're
kind of experiencing in the iOS 10 beta
the public beta is out if you have an
Apple device you can get it on your
tablet on your phone whatever the hell
else they make what uh have you played
around with it at all briefly um Jacob
hood actually on his iPhone I refuse to
put it on mine why is that because we
talked about this today on 44 on betas
or BS well it's a number of things I'd
done the beta on my 6 plus last year and
the the the releases for it aren't
there's there's no rhyme or reason for
the releases and then wait what does
that the the update for the beta there's
no rhyme or reason because there's
certain things that may not work or may
work like deauxma players that's a
developer thing but and um and then when
the full one comes out there sometimes a
problem just pushing that through
sometimes you just wind up having to
write to download enforces like you know
what I'll just wait last thing I do is
try to make a phone call and have that
be the one feature not work yeah I'm
pretty sure that's the safe bet that
that'll always work it's funny even even
like my my my mom who's very
disconnected from like the you know
keeping track of iOS updates she's
always like yeah I'll wait till the
point one comes out just because I know
I gotta let that dust settle a little
bit and she's not wrong but really it
really has to have to shake the cobwebs
out of that thing before you can get a
reliable there's so much pressure to
keep putting something out to stay
innovative is just to keep ahead that a
lot of times we
become the beta testers even even
totally like don't don't don't be
mistaken they are collecting data on on
how the beta goes and you know taking
that under consideration so you are you
familiar with any of the new features or
is there anything about ten are sort of
psyched about um the text features
probably fun back and forth with you
know my son so forth the lift when you
lift it up in the notification seems
pretty cool to sway notification sounds
like they're spending a lot more time on
the lock screen to read that the lock
Trina some cool notifications um what I
would love and hopefully they'll do it
is maybe under the settings with 3d
touch yeah if they'd enable where you
can customize it because you don't think
I really want to go to another 3d touch
really quickly from the settings would
be to turn my hot spot on and off or I
think that would be really cool i mean
i'm not sure if they did anything with
that um what else did they do with that
thing well well tie your you're an
Android guy right like myself you've
seen an iphone have you touched one i
had i think the last iOS i had a virus
55 okay i had a this mixing oh he's
touching it i had these the 4s or the
fall right so and then i went to android
what so you've been there for a while um
me personally I am indifferent like I am
an Android guy because I happen to like
that OS better right um I don't I think
if something came along attractive
enough from an iphone I would switch
I've just never been presented with an
opportunity to be like oh this is the
time to switch over is there something
that would would convince you to
consider making the switch I don't know
if the design was good enough yeah I
think that that particularly the iphone
is sort of being in a kind of holding
pattern design wise right i think the
four was probably the nicest and there
was a throwback was it the 6s had the
glass back again no the davening well
before before us that was the last of
the glass okay last I like that designer
for is that phone yeah i think you know
you get a lot more variety obviously
with android you got hundreds of
different models you can choose from
that's a mixed blessing right that's all
right that you deal with fragmentation
and issues like that right and the fact
that each manufacturer has to modify the
OS to fit my phone why get it by six
months or that's why you go nexus
and that's that's a nexus have had some
really nice phones definitely uh Mike in
the control room tells me there is a
question from the chat room yeah guys so
Nicholas says if there's one thing he
doesn't like about iOS 10 it's clicking
the home button to unlock the phone so
because there was a big change with the
notification screen and the unlock
screen right and on YouTube we had
someone who asks i'm not sure if we know
that's definitively yet though did Apple
fix the battery problems with iOS 10 on
the iphone 6s I don't know about that
but the battery stuff it might be too
early to tell yeah I mean when you're in
bed you can never rely on battery yeah i
mean i would assume it burns your
battery quicker yeah um I think one
thing that's also overlooked when it
comes to the whole iOS Android thing is
money invested um I had the first iphone
and didn't get another iphone again
until the 4s but i did get an ipod touch
in between that and i purchased a number
of songs speaking of which everybody was
strolling about purchases and at that
time Apple had you locked because they
were you know the music was encrypted
yeah so you know between music purchased
movie purchases apps purchase sometimes
you're kind of just locked there because
you spent more money on your library
than you actually did on the device and
I do and I have like from the first
generation ipod touch have been
purchasing stuff through it so I mean
I'm well invested in that maybe if there
was an incentive program where let's say
you wanted to buy an android device and
developer said hey you want Angry Birds
for such-and-such if you're switching
from iOS will give you a discount or
something like that they may they may
inspire a jump between but that's
probably another reason why a lot of
people's probably stay with where they
are they just defend it to Lynn because
the one wants to be on the sinking ship
so to speak all right you have your
marching orders mr. cook get to it let's
move along amazon prime day is july 12
if you recall amazon prime day it is the
one day of the year that amazon sort of
came up with a self-declared holiday or
you will offering thousands and
thousands of sales on their site
exclusive to Prime members prime day
take two is happening July twelfth we
know
little bit about it we know that they
are focusing on TVs and toys toys is
super vague I don't know what the hell
that means some deals are rolling out
ahead of the sale itself they're calling
them like countdown prime deals what do
you guys think about prime day are you
psyched are you tempted what's the deal
hacia was kind of disappointed it was
really bad they had this big build-up
it's gonna be bigger than Black Friday
yeah and it kind of fell over in heat no
that was I don't know I didn't take
advantage of any of the sale I get a nod
to find bottom i bought a dust buster
and then i thought i saved like 78 cents
right and i was like what the hell i
didn't really need to do that i guess
because with black friday you have
people like us who can count down the
deals and the clay ting it'll sure and
all the news outlets are primed a is
kind of its own thing and it's harder to
catalog and point to where good stuff is
yeah it's it's uh for me it's just like
I get it I know y prime day exists and
like you know for what it's worth it did
real well last year they amazon killed
it on prime day even though there was
like this inexplicable sort of
understanding of what was on sale and
what wasn't right um it makes sense that
they would do this again I don't know
did you buy anything less your job buddy
there yeah if I don't know it has to be
really good to force we deferred to
something like when I'm not planning on
purchasing it right but I'm I didn't see
anything there was nothing that really
impressed me I mean the last thing I
think I bought like pre-ordered was the
echo okay so what do you think about
like on the fire TV stick when I was 21
foot I'm you got imagine like all their
first party stuff is gonna be on sale I
wouldn't Kindles go on sale everything
goes on sale for me it's just like the
navigation was kind of twisted up I felt
like I had a really tough time
understanding what was the what was the
deal they were having these flash sales
I'm just like this I need to like
research I have to like draw the right I
don't want you to do yeah because they
got the monopoly on debt are inside so
they can control what is you know
highlight it oh for sure it seemed a
little counterintuitive but hey i'm
going to amazon
all right to check that but they're
gonna be good you know hopefully I mean
all right the nice thing for like people
now is that they have to pay for the
full year they can do the monthly
subscription if they kind of want to
slip in and just check out the sale and
be out you're not you're not committed
for you really so yeah I mean well
that's that's cool because if you come
in on in that month of disappointing
you're not stuck paying that all hungry
for the whole year don't forget it's
only good for Prime members that's July
twelfth and well I guess we'll have like
under Prime members is the monthly in
the annual yeah we'll have a post-mortem
on prime day next week okay what do you
guys know about pokemon go I know you
know way more than your right eye and
I'm old air I I'm not a Pokemon fans oh
you're dragging about that I'm a dragon
ball guy yes I couldn't you tell
everybody that's right just by looking
at him like mike cronin oh so poster do
you know anything about pokemon girl all
I know is there was a story earlier this
week it was actually the first thing I
heard about Pokemon go was that the
Darwin police department in Darwin
Australia Northern Territory where have
been too because everyone has tried has
been everyone Australian but they said
no but they said that they issued a
warning to people saying you weren't
allowed to go into the Darwin Police
Department or the police station to to
get your Pokemon go characters so if
they appeared that you weren't allowed
in surely they'd say you know don't go
into strangers houses or you know don't
go off cliffs is no don't go into the
police station yeah okay Australia
doesn't really have a lot of problems I
guess that's something that you know sir
surface to the top so here's what
pokemon go is it's a mobile game that
uses a are so amazing augmented reality
which means you're holding up your
phone's camera in the world around you
and they're sort of like putting their
placing pokemon around areas in the real
world and you have to like flick out the
ball the Pokemon balls am I saying that
wrestle
I don't know anything about okay I know
my son would go crazy if they had a
yokai yeah up whatever that is a joke I
ok you need a yokai watch this yoga
right i forgot to get 10 so that's so
that's a thing a lot of people are
complaining that it doesn't work though
everyone's calling it pokey bad stop oh
really yeah because like the servers are
having issues connecting we were talking
about today my buddy russ was only able
to hook into it like twice not unlike
set up a username and that was it not
enough money to keep the server's going
I don't know if that's what it is but
set a Pikachu broke you know this is not
a great launch for that brand and I feel
like it's been a rough rough couple of
years not just well pokemons been
arrived but like the nintendo sort of
brand is taking a bit of him the way you
was supposed to sell a hundred million
well that's just what when I was 12 and
it sold 12 million oh you know just 12
millions a lot oh that's a lot it's the
fur that I guess uh anyway let us know
what you buy on from Iowa you froze on
sale or the amazon prime two hundred
bucks i buy four nice so that would be
the gourmet fur you're at that amazon we
