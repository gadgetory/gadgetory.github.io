phones from several years ago
well pom is back but this isn't a phone
at all instead this little itty-bitty
device is a companion for your regular
phone the new pom pairs to your existing
phone to become a second screen that you
can really easily slide into your pocket
or into accessories like a clutch a
bifold wallet or a fitness sleeve so you
can take it on the go you just use your
main phone again when you come back the
pom runs on Android 8.1 and works with
Google Play which means that you can
download any app you want but it will
work best for basics like Google Maps
responding to messages and uploading
photos not really for playing games pom
is taking its name literally because
this thing is actually palm-sized it
looks like the smallest iPhone you've
ever seen down to its shape and the
camera array on the back there's a 3.3
inch pin chirp screen which is important
because the on-screen keyboard is
miniscule and so is a lot of the text
that you're going to be reading texting
is a challenge even for my smaller hands
but there are three ways to use Google
assistant and that should help the palms
only button is a power weight key on the
side that you can DoubleTap to launch
voice assistant or the camera otherwise
you use gesture controls to navigate
around and you unlock the device with
your face face unlock is only to get
into the phone you can't use it for
mobile payments there's a single 12
megapixel rear camera and flash and an 8
megapixel selfie camera on the front the
palm uses Gorilla Glass 3 on both sides
of an aluminum frame and did I mention
that it's also water-resistant for a
rating of ip68 there's a tiny 800
milliamp battery that you charge through
USB C port but there's no standalone
headphone jack
well the palm will technically sync with
your iPhone apps like iMessage and
FaceTime won't work it integrates best
with the Android to help cut down on
your phone addiction the palm has a
feature called life mode turn it on and
you block out most notifications and
apps except for the ones that you ok in
the set
now this next part is very important
although the pond has its own nano SIM
card for an LTE data connection you
can't buy it to replace your primary
phone if you want to make calls or text
you have to use a built-in app that
pairs your phone number with the palm
but you can still message with the apps
that use Wi-Fi and yes you'll have to
pay a $10 monthly data fee to use the
palm the palm goes on sale in November
exclusively with Verizon and will cost
about $350 and the carrier and pom are
both baking on this being a completely
new category of smartphone accessory</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
