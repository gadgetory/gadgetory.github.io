cnet.com and what I have here is DJI
phantom 2 Vision+ now this is a smart
unmanned aircraft and it's the first of
its kind of come with an integrated
camera system that shoots 1080p video as
well as RAW images now what makes this
unique also is this gimbal this is a
three axis system that allows for image
stabilization so I can either go left or
right while I'm rolling or I can pitch
forward and back and also while I'm
rotating this is called yaw it is stable
all the way through another thing about
the DJI phantom 2 Vision+ is that it's
GPS enabled and we really what that
means for you is as a pilot if you're
not gonna be going too crazy it centers
on your GPS point it allows it to what
they call it has this GPS hold feature
so you're able to hover it you don't
need to continuously be calibrating or
really correcting where you're flying
this guy will do it for you and it makes
it really easy for hobbyists to pick up
and play
another unique feature is that the
battery packs are included with this
have 25 minutes per battery that's more
than anything else you'll find out on
the market right now so it also gives
you a lot of time to play and fly and
kind of figure out how this thing works
and come up with some really beautiful
shots now with the remote control this
also has an app for your smartphone it
works on Android or iOS and what it does
is it creates a wireless system and you
can actually see the visuals that the
camera is seen on the phantom 2 Vision+
on your iPhone or your Android phone and
it allows you to in some cases even
control the angle that the camera is
tilting on your iOS device but really it
lets you see what the phantom 2 Vision+
sees another feature of the phantom will
be bringing is what's called the airport
safety feature and this is coming with a
firmware update this will create a
no-fly air zone so if you're near an
airport you won't be able to take the
phantom off and also if the phantom 2
Vision+ is flying and it hits this zone
it'll send you back now it's coming out
in spring for $1,300 so it's affordable
enough for the hobbyist but you could
see I mean we had a blast with this
thing at the park you could take some
amazing shots amazing video and really
who wouldn't want to play with the drone
for cnet.com i'm brian tong with the
phantom 2 Vision+</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
