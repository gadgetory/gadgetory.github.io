its nickname is land of a Thousand Hills
you can't talk about anything about
Rwanda without talking about the
genocide and kind of Rwanda is recovery
from the genocide the government there
has really tried to put a stake in the
ground in becoming this kind of
technological hub of Africa they're
really kind of leaning into the idea of
innovation and and this kind of startup
you culture Rwanda is a complicated
country its president Paul Kagame has
been accused of being a dictator
silencing the opposition and violating
human rights on the other hand he's also
seen as a visionary and areas like
rebuilding the economy and the health
care system in 1994 the genocide
devastated the country a million people
killed also the infrastructure the
electricity running water buildings
everything was gone we were interested
in how this country was able to build
itself up and become one of the leaders
of health care in Africa their
approaches to put a hospital in each
province and make it accessible the
president is really open to working with
nonprofits like Partners in Health to
fill the state of our hospitals what we
are trying to do is to really prove that
it's possible to provide the
high-quality medical care even in a
velocity
once they decide okay we're gonna put
this hospital here the government is
also kind of like supporting that with
other pieces of infrastructure such as
though they'll pave the road that goes
there and one of the provinces we are in
they're laying like a fiber network and
just like running through field just
propped up on sticks kind of and it's
totally active it's just I haven't
buried it yet because the road isn't
being paid now people are trying to find
innovative ways to service these rural
hospitals the Rwandan government
partnered with this Silicon Valley
company called zipline and what they're
doing is they're using drones to fly
blood to hospitals in the countryside we
have a fleet of twelve autonomous drones
we deliver critical blood supplies to
hospitals
the hospital will say we need this this
blood the platelets whatever the
hospital needs at that moment from
getting an order to launching me for
about 10 to 15 minutes
loads a night of this drone loads up an
SD card with a predetermined course to
the hospital and the drone is launched
and so the drone flies circles over the
hospital and kind of descends in a
spiral shape and drops this package onto
a target and the drug does not land
there it continues then spirals back up
and flies back
one of the big problems with providing
healthcare to rural populations is
electricity so one of the places to be
visited was this big solar electricity
farm when it was built it was the
largest solar farm in East Africa there
are 28,000 solar panels spread across
this vast flat plain which is unusual
for Rwanda because it's such a
mountainous hilly country a lot of other
countries in Africa are looking to
Rwanda as a leader for help because it's
been so successful and lowering its
rates of malaria TB maternal mortality
those kinds of things it's a new way of
thinking about where good hospitals and
well-educated doctors can be located
Rwanda is so fast-growing that a lot of
people told us come back to Kigali in
five years you won't recognize it the
rest of Africa is watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
