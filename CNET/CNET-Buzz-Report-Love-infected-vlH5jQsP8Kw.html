buzz report and now for the gadget of
the week the gadget of the week is the
posse Oh Greta now we've seen do it all
phones before but the Greta which
debuted the three gsm mobile show in
barcelona is also a copier a printer a
fax machine a scanner and a clock it's
about the size of a small suitcase and
it comes in a surprisingly sexy red you
want to know why because it's the
closest thing the 21st century man is
going to get to a hot little secretary I
said it and now for the news this week
was Valentine's Day but it wasn't all
commercialism flowers and chocolates oh

uncovered some pretty nasty viruses

experiment with video filtering software
that can spot copyrighted material
before it's uploaded to the website
reached for comment the public said
super now what about the pedophiles y2k
is coming back daylight savings time is
coming early this year in the United
States thanks to a law passed in 2005
that moves up the date for the
time-shifting change to march 11th so
any software written before 2005 could
potentially malfunction because it's not
scheduled to update the time until the
first weekend in april now non network
devices will be the hardest hit but
authorities are warning that automatic
stock trades might go wrong airline
flight schedules could be disrupted
global conferences could be thrown off
murder and mayhem could erupt looting
will be rampant I kind of Miss y2k don't
you i think i'm going to go stock my
bunker with rifles and SpaghettiOs just
for old times think the rfid chip maker

people have chosen to have
radiofrequency chips implanted in their
