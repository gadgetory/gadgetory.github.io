this is the silver iPhone 6s plus in
Apple's traditional aluminum enclosure
the high-gloss finish is new to Apple's
lineup and it looks really nice but
apparently it may not stay nice for very
long
even though Apple says it's just as hard
as the aluminum model the admit the
scratches are more noticeable the fine
print on the site even states it may
show fine micro operations and that if
you're worried you should put it in a
case first up we have the denim test for
those who keep their phone in their
pocket this minute-long test had no
effect on either phone the dust test or
basically any time you happen to slide
your phone across a tabletop surface
after a quick wipe down the scratches on
the aluminum nearly disappeared while
the jet black could not be helped
the wear and tear from being inside of
your purse is probably what's going to
cause the most damage and again the
Knicks disappeared on the silver model
but stuck around on the jet black finish
so this sandpaper test is a bit extreme
but a bad fall on a sidewalk could be
just as damaging the scratches on the
silver are obvious but only from certain
angles on the jet black there's
absolutely no hiding it and for the
grand finale the key big scratch on both
phones again the silver one wiped away
and the jet black retained the nasty
scar after everything we put them
through both phones have visible damage
but the matte finish on the aluminum is
definitely more forgiving so unless
you're planning to treat your phone like
fine jewelry you may be better off going
with the matte black but if you're dead
set on the glossy finish include a clear
case with your purchase you may lose
that shine but you'll still have your
bragging rights</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
