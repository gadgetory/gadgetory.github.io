Google finds a new reason to monitor
your messages I'm Bridget Carey and this
is your scene that update Instagram is
now larger than Twitter the
facebook-owned app reported it has 300
million active users to compare twitter
has about 280 4 million the majority of
instagrams users more than 200 million
are outside of the US facebook also owns
the messenger service whatsapp which has
about 600 million users that's twice the
size of Instagram another messaging app
just got an update to better compete
with Facebook Google Hangouts added
stickers you know those cutesy cartoon
cutouts that express feelings Google
Hangouts also added filters to video
calls so you can talk in black and white
but Google is also reading the text you
send to give what it calls smart
suggestions if you're meeting up with a
friend and you type where are you
hangouts will take notice and prompt you
to share your location with one tap
it'll also tell your friends the time
you were last on the app so it'll be
harder to hide and ignore chess the
updates are out now for Android and
coming to iOS soon now since we're on
the topic of updates snapchat also has
been updated with new caption features
so you can change colors of text pinch
to resize and drag text around the
screen it also lets you use layers of
filters and photos are in full
resolution for new iPhone 6 models if
only they would make more improvements
to encryption and security protections
because that would be swell now if
you're among the few with an
android-powered SmartWatch you can get
some new watch based designs there's a
whole section in the app store for watch
designs there are also a few interface
improvements for navigating blocking
notifications or checking the apps
battery and storage status moving to the
topic of streaming video amazon updated
its instant video app to stream in 4k
Ultra HD for Prime and non-prime users
the catch is that it's only available on
select 2014 4k Ultra HD televisions but
it doesn't cost anything extra to get
the better resolution Netflix also added
4k as an option earlier
this year with the series house of cards
and a couple of nature documentaries
Amazon's also making changes to its
shopping side you can haggle the price
of some items it's called make an offer
but you'll only find it on fine art and
one-of-a-kind collectibles that cost
more than one hundred dollars about
150,000 items now have the make an offer
button that's your tech news update
there's always more at cnet com and you
can stay updated by following me on
twitter from our studios in New York I'm
