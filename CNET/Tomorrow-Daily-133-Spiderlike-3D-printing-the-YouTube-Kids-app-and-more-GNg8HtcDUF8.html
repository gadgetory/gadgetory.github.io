can make 3d printing like spider silk a
new youtube app that isn't for everyone
and an artistic installation that turns
the artist into the canvas hey it's me
it's also tmrw daily
greetings citizens of the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best geek
talk show in the known universe I'm your
host Ashley skele joining me I mean
technically you've been here most of the
time joy I'm joining you once again kill
anonymous we thought you were dead oh
yeah I feel like I always dies no Logan
and I we already mourned you I know I
saw the eulogy on last week's show
really yeah it was real short cuz we're
sorry we're short on time but well
welcome back I'm glad I'm glad that
everything's going fine now right pretty
gap since was for a reason yes pretty
good the dogs are fine ring still in
cones they're still in the cones of
shame but they I think they get out this
Friday they get their stitches out but
all is well surgery went very well for
both of them some some minor
complications post-surgery for both of
them of course because what would a
surgery be if there weren't
complications but generally speaking
there and they're in good spirits and
are being plied with treats probably as
I speak so doing very well so Bailey and
Jenkins send their thank yous um you
ready to talk about some technology I've
been waiting for all weekend yeah
excellent let's let's hit the headlines
so one of the big puzzles of 3d printing
becoming mainstream one of the questions
that you have to answer is how do you
make things that are not reliant one on
gravity which is like you build things
layer by layer and then it relies on
gravity to sort of settle in yeah um so
that's that's the biggest question and
then also how do you make things in a
fully realized space like a full 3d kind
of structure without again relying on
gravity so I thought this was really
interesting this is from Shanghai these
are developers from a group called jishi
and they were part of this digital
future workshop check that are now it's
like a spider it is it looks just like a
spider they this is a robotic arm hey
that's a spider that was an actual
spider on the video they made this 3d
printing arm that replicates a spider
weaving a web so what they did was and
they're calling this biomimetic
fabricating process so a biomimetic
fabricating process the actual arm is
called the robotic sixaxis 3d printer
and their goal they say is to eliminate
the line between designing and
fabricating so what they want to do with
this arm and what they apparently have
done based on the video is to mimic the
way a spider the microstructure of how
spiders sort of build silk threads and
how they do that is if you're looking at
the end of this one it kind of looks
like the gun from honey i shrunk the
kids a little bit but like there are
three okay so there's four different
servos running four different 3d printer
heads at the tip of this robot arm one
of them is right in the center and it's
stationary and then there's three that
surround it in sort of a triangle like
triangulating around it and the three
around it actually move so they AUSA
late and as they oscillate you can see
in this time-lapse video it builds a 3d
structure in midair without the need for
additional support so a lot of times
when you have to build stuff like this
you need to have some sort of support
structure holding it up otherwise it
won't stay up but this is really
remarkable because it doesn't need that
and you can see all of these different
chains that they were able to build
without any additional support structure
required to keep them standing so it's
pretty cool that they were able to sort
of make this happen my god there they
are right there that you can see the
three of them are moving in and out and
then making that sort of interesting
pattern and then there's the one in the
middle that goes straight that is so
it's so crazy when we use Tet with like
we end up having to go back to nature to
figure stuff out yeah you're like the
honeycomb is like the like the most
naturally like it can create the most
dense structures it's so brief figured
that assistant writers are now making
self-reliant right and so it's great
they mentioned that too like when they
were saying why they decided to kind of
go with the spider is just so this is a
really strong structure obviously and
the second thing is is that in nature
spiders are able to create webs that are
self-sustaining they don't need
additional structural support they just
started one and they go to the next so I
thought this was really cool and that it
took apparently took three weeks to
create this robot just probably oh you
don't worry up design it and put it all
together intrigues because they've read
this read a bowl yeah there at that
workshop it took them three weeks to put
that together so there you go and
absolutely go oh cool so cool I want
them to make that a candy now just like
me Kelly sorry little ropes like a
little licorice like all the way around
okay tell me about talk about YouTube
all right so for this next for this next
story I have to introduce a brand new
segment two tomorrow daily this segment
is called if you're ready
but heck I'm just happy kids have access
to such a cool form of media like this
YouTube kids app segment that's really
wordy but I like it yeah it's going
great like that graphic so check this
out today youtube announced they're
going to be releasing a new app this is
the called the YouTube kids app and it's
out for iOS and Android this app pairs
down content specifically for kids into
a simple navigated into simple out
navigated channels that means you won't
end up what your kids won't end up
watching question on loteria
questionable material the watch of which
there is much on YouTube yeah so
questionable material including bad
language violence or content with me in
it there's categories for shows music
and learning so to keep your kids busy
even though the menu has annoying music
and sound effects okay look it did look
pretty simplified which is nice because
I know that sometimes the YouTube app
itself like on iphone and ipad gets a
little bogged down yeah you look at it
and it's very it's very user-friendly
for kids you can tell that the app is
for kids when you use it some of the
shows that I I was able to look through
because I downloaded it checked it out
the sesame street's on the show's Thomas
the Tank of friends DreamWorks a Babar
Barney my little pony and a bunch of
other stuff I didn't know because I'm
not five and I don't have kids I liked
the I like that they had like some
science programs like actual like the
real life people not cartoons or puppets
or whatever doing like science projects
and things like that like they showed in
the video you were able to like type in
you know what is the Sun made of and or
whatever and then it would show you some
videos that were kind of related to that
but appropriate age appropriate yeah so
it's rach are there like so many kids
TED talks to which was which is very
interesting to me child said yes their
goal is this app will ensure that your
kids can watch videos posted online
without stumbling on clips that you
wouldn't want them to see and then
parents can lock off you know certain
like they can lock it to specific
content so they're okay um but anyway so
yeah that's that's all we have on this
brand new segment called way to the
graph wait for it man i wish i had this
as a kid but heck I'm just happy kids
have access to such
former media like this you keep kids out
I really like that ukulele yeah it's
copyrighted by the way you cannot use
that name for any other side now this i
saw i saw the copyright right at the m
there so everybody thinking about using
it do not the segments are really gonna
take off i'm looking forward to bringing
more if you use it you're gonna hear
from kales lawyers of their of which
there are many so i assume your next
segment is actually it brings you the
hashtag of the day so hashtag of the day
is TD kids thanks for your Logan and
it's not it's not man I wish I have this
as a kid it's not it's not that no it's
man i wish i had this a kid back i'm
just happy kids have access to such a
cool cool form of media like this
YouTube kids out I won't make you guys
thank you bring it back um so there are
snug days TD kids and the question is
okay so say you had to make a children
show for this for this channel okay for
these for this app what would your
children show be a man there's bugs
everywhere and then I go around and I
find bugs in different places of the
city and you eat them no I would find
them and then run away oh okay I like
that you yeah okay it would be like me
showing kids where there's bugs like
worms I approaches I recently just I
really like this I like this idea that
like we're going with this it seems like
it could be a really big hit man there's
what is it called again man there's bugs
everywhere bugs everywhere there's bugs
everywhere stupid hey continue I think
okay I this gonna sound really dumb but
I really got into making mug cakes this
weekend have you ever heard of this no
ok so like an old woman thing no there's
only two of us in our house so to make a
full size cake like that's a lot of cake
and we're not gonna eat it Oh in a mug
so you make a little tiny bit of batter
and you pour it in a muggy you put in
your microwave you microwave it for like
a minute and it's a cake it's like the
greatest thing ever I've just discovered
this that sounds like dangerous to like
health super dangerous like before bed
have a mug each have a mug of cake um we
we had some chocolate mud cake last
night during the oscars and it was
delicious but i like i like that idea of
like here's how to like cook a little
bit but for kids like small kids so it's
like things that are not gonna be super
dangerous poisons yeah yeah suna and and
small portion so it's like you make
yourself a snack by the way at home if
you forgot your friend's birthday make
mud cake yeah and also a bad friend but
still and also that we would have the
inevitable crossover episode of their
bugs everywhere in my mug cakes and then
it would be that's for each week just we
would have wheat of six foods and they
can make cricket mud cake and then feed
it to kale why does he why are you
you're ruining my show I'm sorry I'm
really good at that guy is that already
been canceled so TD what what is any
kids ok TV kids um all right this very
last story I thought was so cool i love
these art installations if people are so
creative about this stuff this comes
from nyu's interactive
telecommunications program it's called
skin deep oh so we're going to see how
this works so ok you have this
projection of their 3d models of the two
artists hmm and the artist name are
Rosalie you and a lawn chitta yacht and
they scanned themselves into this 3d
modeling program and then they let you
the visitor sit down and you can see
this person is like sketching out or
drawing coloring in a space whatever
okay so what she's writing on right
there is a piece of paper that has
cutouts of the artist body so portions
of the actual 3d model that are 2d ok ok
so they're designing little pieces and
then you can see right there it there's
a webcam pointed down at the paper and
then in real time it translates your art
onto their 3d rotating projector oh
that's interesting it's so cool like i
love this i think this is a really
awesome idea and it turns i really love
this concept of turning the artist into
the canvas so that's sort of the goal
for them here and they're using
technology like webcams and they created
their own software i was one of them
that have been an animal or something
we'll see but that's the cool thing is
that they could do that if they wanted
to so you could really find all kinds of
ways to sort of integrate this into art
so here's all the different ways people
have designed it and as they flip
through there you go it changes you can
see in real time exactly how people have
designed them technically that's
fantastic little really cool that'd be
good for like design companies I want to
see that it's music that yeah like I'm
going on with the kids theme like that
would be a really fun thing an
interactive fun thing at a kids museum
or like you said like I really like this
idea of like brands doing this and being
like help us design our new
or whatever you know and then they do
these like cool contests and everything
where people can go in and like do
real-time art on something that is then
projected in 3d that's a cool find it's
really good I just thought that was
really cool so um so yeah you can I
think I don't know if they have the I
don't know if they have like an actual
exhibit going on right now but they
showed this off and then maybe it's
other ongoing or maybe it just ended but
I just thought that was amazing so great
job NYU students again they're being
creative their names are Rosalie you and
a lon chitta yacht they should yeah we
should take that on the road that yeah
they should totally take that over but
it's called skin deep and you can check
it out they have a website whole website
about like how they did it and probably
put a like there's a glow skin deep yeah
it sounds like it's gonna be gross it
was like beauty's only skin deep and
then it's like you've been drawn their
skin mmm salt to a bad start gettin can
go it out okay yeah let's skin fashion
skin skin fasho nope next segment where
we going okay we're gonna go and take a
quick break for a second and then we're
gonna come back with back under Hackett
we're very interesting products for back
at our hack and I'm really curious to
see what you think about that and then
of course we have your user feedback
about the drone circus and our phone
time for the day so don't look away it's
tomorrow daily
welcome back to the show we've returned
we've returned it's monday we're in a
glass case of emotion it's very exciting
milk was a bad choice no cuz a terrible
choice um but you know like I said it is
Monday which means it's time for her
back at her Hackett I thought this was
really interesting and I don't know if
you're gonna really like this or maybe
you'll hate it but it's called the
memento pearl okay okay like it so far
okay so what this is is it's a little
bit of jewelry so there's the Pearl
right there looks like a normal standard
necklace I hate it but it's got NFC on
the inside so notice they're tapping it
against the backs of their phones whoa
what she just realized ok so what she's
realizing is there's a voice that was
playing on her phone once she taps on
the back so how this works is this is
kind of crazy and I like I saw this and
I thought this is really cool so the
Pearl has NFC capabilities inside it and
it allows the user to store information
on the Pearl to access later so you
would ok so let's say you buy it for
your girlfriend you buy the Pearl you
record you get the app you record a
message and you tap the Pearl to the
device to your phone and then uses NFC
to transfer that data to the pearl ok so
then you would give it to her as a gift
and then she could then go get the app
tap it's the back of her phone and then
hear the message that you recorded or
she would be able to see the picture you
took or the video that you took like you
could attach a lot of different things
ok a lot of different things or just
like a couple of things I would say like
a handful of thing ok like what like
they do voiceovers like one thing the
pictures like this is lady showing how
it works he's ok yeah he comes on
necklaces in your necklace is wearing
rings um I but I thought this was a
really interesting way to use technology
and in a way that was not so obvious um
and I like I found it really fascinating
that they were that they're really into
using like high-end jewelry is like a
way to sort of get people to use
technology or maybe normally wouldn't
use it or like as a clever interesting
gift ok no now you you keep saying gifts
so now I need to know how much it's
gonna cost ok ready to get that's that's
it's cool but now I need to know
I'm the person who is just like I'm just
gonna buy it for myself my husband hates
I don't have like a million dollars I
know it's not gonna cost you a million
dollars so if you would be if you want
to be an early backer an early bird
backer it's gonna cost you $95 for a
white pearl or 125 for black which isn't
terrible for the necklace is it an
actual pearl mm-hmm it's an actual pearl
with an NFC chip inside okay going and
then after the early bird is gone so
once that's cleared out oh yeah look
there there plucking the pearls okay so
this is really interesting too i'll
explain that in a second so notice i'll
explain what's going on in that so 130
150 for the the white or yellow okay so
or the white or black pearls so the
thing that they were doing in that video
that we just saw where they were kind of
like carving out they actually uh first
this is like the expensive one I think
it starts at seven hundred and fifty
dollars but it's a gemstone that they
put into an actual oyster and then put
it back in the ocean for like 18 months
and then the oyster rebuilds a pearl
around it and so then they carve out a
shape into the this new pearl to where
you can see the color on the inside Wow
yeah so these people already have money
then yeah like they've got a whole thing
this company very clearly knows what
they're doing and they've been around
for a while but they're doing
Kickstarter they want to start doing
this and but here's the thing because of
that the estimated delivery for this
they want 50 grand to start production
on these and to do it if it if it gets
funded deliveries April it's like a
month and a half six six weeks from now
they should have done it before
Valentine's Day I know I feel like they
really I was a missed opportunity but
this is really cool and I thought I
thought for a few reasons one like they
mentioned in the video there's a lot of
like you know obviously tugging at your
heart strings type of thing where it was
like they had a girl who had like a
message from her soldier boyfriend or
husband then they had another lady who
like you know got this beautiful gift
and it had this very nice sentiment
attached to it with like voice but they
also mentioned things like taking
pictures of your kids you can keep sort
of these things as mementos without
carrying them on you so it's if you like
subtle jewelry but also something that
is a reminder they talked about it being
sort of a digital locket and I really
the idea of that so I like this concept
a lot and I think for 95 bucks like I
feel like I would go in on it I feel
like I would back it just out of pure
interest and also it's just a nice piece
of jewelry even if it stops working or
becomes incompatible still a nice piece
of jewelry hmm that's what I think but
it gets more expensive like as you go up
I think to add the earrings it's like
250 like it's another cheaper because
that's two pearls and those are also NFC
like you can use them so it's like
around 120 bucks per pearl I'm all over
the map on this one as far as what I was
so curious to see what you think about
this because I was like kale is either
gonna love this tour hate this and I
can't decide which one are you decide
either line dear i love like technology
you know a jewelry like it's like a 3d
printed whatever or it has some sort of
digital remember they had the the
necklace or whatever that would change
based on right yeah and sound and stuff
like that and those are really cool but
this is a company that already exists
and probably could do this themselves
but they just want help well let me ask
you this this is also your testing the
market as well is it this is also
probably a jewelry company who hasn't
really gotten into technology and are
testing the waters through Kickstarter
to see what I have started to be though
okay so this is a this is a new
discussion yes I want Kickstarter to be
people that have no ability to do it
themselves getting an opportunity
because they came up with such a great
idea that's fair I like this it's not
cool enough to like for me to like wanna
back a company that already has their
stuff too good do it yeah but what if
they don't have a lot of capital what
they're just an established jewelry
company they gotta make they got to take
a risk just like everybody else okay
alright so I like it we're not back in
it oh ok I wait until they come out and
then they get man you'll see a fancy for
me I say I'd like a jerk I don't know
not at all i think that's a really good
argument I just for me like I think I'm
interested enough to say like okay I
would pay a hundred bucks to this like I
would pay a hundred dollars for a Fitbit
why wouldn't I pay a hundred I tell you
what the fact that they can shipman
April already means that they're made so
that's a that's what I'm telling you is
that or that they already has them oh
that they can really ramp production up
very quickly there
the fact that they have the ability to
kick him out in April shares it there
you have enough you know capital and
backing I don't disagree with you
alright so I gotta get back at Hackett I
think so and so far the idea though they
want fifty thousand dollars so far they
have last I checked they had about seven
thousand it's probably will probably
little more than that it only think of
7200 last time I looked so we'll see see
how see how it goes all right guys it's
time to talk about your thoughts because
it's all about you right now this is
user feedback would you make that the
theme song you say it's all about you
just get rid of the little boob then you
can watch it on YouTube kids yeah could
you watch this show on YouTube kids hey
you say Fanny a few times well I would
say no just because of some of the
stories probably not appropriate yeah
skin deep sounded like it was gonna be
well there was like color-changing bras
like that probably wouldn't work or
another site yeah you missed that when I
was a that was an early one okay guys
last week Kim and kale asked you guys to
use the hashtag TT circus to tell us
what you want to see it the drone circus
yeah uh and you guys came through with
some good stuff what is Houston what do
you want to see what do I want to see I
was so sad I didn't get to talk about
this well where's my drone freak show
where's all like the weird like NASA
drones that are like janky kind of weird
like that but also really cool and it's
like people would pay extra go see those
like I like that like the weird
experimental drones I like how my answer
was just like the servants they like
bringing popcorn and cut I like that you
suggested a drone bear I like oh yeah
the drone bear this I thought that was
cool what did they say I wanted to see
the drones like fly into the mouths of
tigers then fly out like I be good all
right anyway Kylie wrote and said I want
to see a strong man drone in my TD
circus able to balance and lift all the
other drones that's cool I said
versatile very versatile I'm mark wrote
and said two words hashtag flesh fair
which I gave I don't know what that
means but I was slightly disturbed and
intrigued all the same time so mark
thank you Carl wrote in and said how
about aerial battle drones you know
battlebots reboot but oh but like in the
air yeah is that what they're gonna do
with the battle
reboot I don't think small I don't know
I don't see a good idea but although it
would be one hit and they're down I
don't know well you put our moradabad
stuff i'd be really i cold and
then Walter wrote in and said I want to
see tightrope walkers and crazy clowns
clowns drones took a kick like rubber
runs up but it's got like a little
flower and it squirts water yeah wise
away I like the Contra lot of drugs how
many comedy clown drones could you fit
in a car and they all fly out the open
the door they all fly out would be
amazing oh god I love you guys um all
right it's time for our very last piece
to use your feedback which as always is
our phones agra for the day we got two
pictures tonight from David okay he was
aggressive David wrote in and he sent us
two pictures and he said hello there I
