through the cloud I'm Bridget Carey and
this is your CNET update the Apple TV
set-top box looks like it'll get a
software upgrade at the same time iOS 7
launches on September 18th the vlog all
things digital is reporting that Apple
TV will have a new feature that lets you
stream content purchased from the iTunes
Store to any persons TV not just the one
you own the airplay streaming is done
through the cloud and it could mean that
a digital movie you purchase can be
easily shared to a friend or family
member even in another state but details
are still vague and TiVo is working on
something similar it has a new personal
video recorder that saves a recorded
program to a server online and that
recorded show can then be shared with
other TiVo users more details on that
are coming later in the week we are
expecting Amazon to release new Kindle
Fire HD tablets in time for the holidays
but the blog boy genius report is
publishing leaked images of what it says
is the next version but these are not
clear images parts of the tablet have
been blacked out so that the device
owner cannot be identified if these
images are real the new Fire HD will
look noticeably different on the outside
with an angled edge and new buttons
it'll have a better display resolution
and a quad-core processor along with 2
gigs of RAM and 64 gigs of internal
storage these images are of a 7 inch
model but it's reported that the larger
8.9 inch model will be designed the same
Intel is coming out with new Atom
processors for tablets that run Windows
8.1 and Android until atom ships are
known for being kind of slow when
they're used to run Windows 8 tablets
but this is supposed to improve the
performance so we'll have to put it to
the test to find out as for Android
Intel says there will be new Android
tablets with this chip that costs as low
as $100 which is a pretty great price
for a tablet let's see how long it takes
for that to happen
Apple is no longer supporting the cards
app on iOS devices the app was
introduced into
and 11 as an easy way to send a printed
greeting card to someone from your phone
using the photos that are saved on your
phone they came in different themes and
Apple handled the mailing and postage
for $3 but Mac users can still use
iPhoto to order letterpress cards and
other printed items and the a pink by
sincerely is still around it's another
way to design and mail postcards from a
phone it's good for quick messages or
