it's not a dodge anymore it's just the
RAM the 2013 ram 3500 Laramie super cab
4x4 even the name of this thing is huge
this is a gigantic truck I'm cheating a
little bit because I'm on a hill right
now but if I were to stand level with
this vehicle the hood it comes up to my
chin I mean it's just like a massive
thing it's built to be strong not really
fast everything about it is all about
being beefy and able to take a lot of
punishment and as you can imagine that
sort of very strong construction
actually makes this vehicle pretty
well-suited for you know things like
navigating construction sites although
as you'll learn in a second it's maybe
not the best for off-roading sort of 4x4
type thing
now you can get the ram 3500 with a 6.7
liter Cummins turbo diesel that's
actually an inline 6 but with more
displacement though it's actually got
some pretty big pots in there it's
turbocharged and so you get a little bit
more power and grunt on top of that
already sort of like torque eNOS of
diesel the upshot of that is that while
your power goes down to about 370
horsepower torque jumps all the way up
to 800 pound feet so that's just a lot
of just you know not really speed but
grunt that's gonna help you haul heavy
things maybe not go so very fast now you
would think that a vehicle with an
engine this big with this much weight
around it would get pretty bad fuel
economy and if you look at the spec
sheet the fuel economy is actually
listed as not applicable because this
isn't really even counted by the EPA as
a consumer car it's listed as a
commercial vehicle fortunately I was
able to get about sixteen point six
miles to the gallon out of this diesel
engine but that was admittedly with a
lot of very easy highway cruising so it
probably represents what I consider to
be maybe a best-case scenario for this
year inside we're seeing a lot of the
Chrysler DNA sort of starting to seep
through its particularly in the design
and layout of the dashboard and the
steering wheel seems like a Chrysler bad
should go right there in the center but
then once you get from about the front
of the seats on back the laramie
longhorn in particular starts well you
know doing some very truck ish cowboy
things for example the long run
additional all of this sort of brown
leather that has embroidery on it that's
supposed to look a lot like the designs
that you'll see on the side of a cowboy
boot this is the newest generation of
the UConnect system the touchscreen
interface the navigation system on this
8.4 inch screen is still actually a
Garmin based but unlike the previous
generation which kind of looked like a
Garmin Nuvi just popped up on your
dashboard when you hit the nav button
this one has actually been restyled to
look a lot more like the rest of the
UConnect interface the benefit there is
you don't really get that sort of
jarring switch between two interfaces
but then you also get one of the best
navigation
systems in my opinion on the market
right now what are the other interesting
things about this generation of UConnect
is that it comes with the ability to
download you connect apps and these are
actually apps that are installed in the
dashboard that get downloaded over the
3G connection that's built into this now
this generation of you connect actually
comes with you connect apps and that's
sort of an in-dash app interface now
right now the only apps that I've seen
available for download are you know your
travel link app that's going to give you
actually access to some information that
comes over your Sirius XM satellite
connection and then Yelp is the second
app that's actually installed on the air
and that gives you user based reviews of
destinations in the area one of the
other interesting things you can do with
the 3G connection that this vehicle has
is turn on Wi-Fi hotspot' now chrysler
and their UConnect system is going to
charge you a monthly fee for that but
once you've got it turned on you'll be
able to share that 3G connection with
other devices in the vehicle and a
little bit further down here you'll see
you've got like a bank of buttons right
here with a bunch of different controls
for towing things like it's right here
to control the trailer and then you've
also got a couple of interesting button
right here this is actually the button
that is added with the optional diesel
exhaust braking system so you can turn
that on when you're going down a very
long descent and it'll actually use a
little bit more of the back pressure
from the exhaust system to help slow the
vehicle and you'll kind of hear that
little extra a little bit about when you
do that you've got a big tech ometer
over here on the left a big speedometer
over on the right and then another gauge
over here that's added by our optional
urea injection system so this is the
gauge for your diesel exhaust fluid and
it basically gets sprayed on the exhaust
fumes as they come out of the vehicle
and helps catalyze some of the
contaminants that are in that does help
kind of clean up the emissions of the
vehicle a little bit if you care about
that but it is one more thing to worry
about when it comes time to maintain
this vehicle
so now we're doing a little bit of a run
the sort of dirt tracker technically
rookie baton now down here we've got
controls for the 4x4 system we've got
settings for the 2wd which is actually a
rear drive bias switching the the knob
over here to four wheel drive lock
allows you to lock the 4x4 system into a
50/50 split and that give you better
traction for things like climbing hills
and whatnot the trade-off though as i've
noticed is the turn radius which is
already that great suffers a little bit
in that 4x4 a lot and the final setec
which I'd actually have to stop and go
to neutral form is gonna be 4x4 low
that's gonna allow you to shift into
that low range on the transfer case and
even further multiply that a hundred
pounds the of torque alright so we're
gonna try to make a climb here but it's
a pretty steep one when you first get on
the gas there's not a lot of power but
then that turbo
the layer of sand over so we get a
little bit of wheelspin but we're in the
4wd lock mode there is none of that it
just goes right on up with that surge of
power on the road ram 3,200 actually
behaves well enough pretty smooth car on
the highway although just like we saw on
the unpaved trail the way this vehicle
sort of doesn't really soak up so much
as crashes over them leads to a lot of
bouncing around the cabin and then also
the engine sort of had three different
temperaments there if the loads ever
meant when you're just sort of moving
around town you get that good low-end
and diesel torque to give it a little
bit more than the second stays it
happens where the vehicles bring a
little bit more life to get a bit more
acceleration but you have that sort of
third mode that you can take advantage
of by you know really flirt
putting the pedal to the metal in that
cause of that turbo to spin up
to fill up but it never really feels
scary or dangerous I just always feel a
little on edge like I've got to be
paying a little bit more attention as it
should a lot of people on the road now
this Ram 3500 laramie longhorn crew cab
wit T Cummins turbo diesel is gonna
start to hit about 50 to 70 90
26:54 the lower rear axle ratio on the
transmission and seven thousand seven
hundred ninety five bucks for the urea
diesel emissions fluid that's going to
get you a little bit cleaner emissions
if you want a lot more juice for your
electrical accessories there 395 for
dual 220 amp alternators and the full
UConnect system is standard on this
laramie longhorn edition as tested this
example is gonna ring in at fifty seven
thousand eight hundred and thirty-five
bucks now that's a lot of money for a
pickup truck but this is a big pickup
truck that does a lot for your money so
the only thing left to decide at this
point is if it's too much truck for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
