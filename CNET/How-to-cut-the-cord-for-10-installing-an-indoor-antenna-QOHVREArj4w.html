spend time and money installing an
outdoor antenna but if you live in a
good reception area you could probably
get away with something like the channel
master flattener for only 10 bucks and
there's no more cable feed here's what
you need an indoor antenna a tuner which
will either be a TV or digital video
recorder and finally good adhesive tape
antennas like these are designed to be
installed high on a window and some like
the antennas direct clear stream are
even reversible so it won't look
obtrusive in your living space setup is
easy
while some antennas do include their own
adhesive the flat Tanner doesn't instead
grab some masking tape and fix the
antenna onto your window try not to use
duct tape as it can mark the glass also
keep the antenna away from magnetic
metals such as security bars if possible
as they can interfere with your signal
experiment with placement though as you
may find that using a wall instead gives
you better reception while the flattener
is perfectly good and you can pull in a
lot of channels it comes with a pretty
short cable if your window is a long way
from the TV you might want an antenna
with a replaceable cable like the $40.00
Mowgli next next the other end of the
coaxial cable to the back of your TV or
DVR screw it in nice and tight and
finally you can now set your tuner to
scan for available channels
be aware that you're receiving digital
signals instead of analog and you won't
get snow if you have no reception you'll
get nothing at all you'll get a jumpy or
pixelated picture with poor reception or
simply a good picture
you should find you're able to get at
least the major network channels and
their affiliates plus your local PBS
depending on where your house is you may
have some issues and doing a web search
on a problem channel will tell you if
it's a common one in the end it may turn
out you need a roof top model after all
but at least it will only cost you 10
bucks or so to find that out check out
our indoor antenna roundup on CNET for
an in-depth look at the differences
between the most popular models</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
