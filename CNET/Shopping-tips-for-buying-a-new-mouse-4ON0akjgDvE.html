when you really think about it it's an
important decision to make and one that
you'll live with every time you sit down
on your computer so be sure to choose
the one that will make your on-screen
life easier how do you do that well the
first thing to look at is shape and
design and start with whether you need a
full-size desktop mouse or a mobile
model the difference there is obviously
size and portability if you plan to
travel with it and the mobile ones tend
to use alkaline batteries instead of a
rechargeable microUSB port for juice you
should always look for a mouse that fits
the ergonomics of your hand there's
different models for left and
right-handed users in addition to
contoured shapes to prevent the onset of
repetitive strain injuries like carpal
tunnel also it's worth noting that a
small mobile Mouse might be a good fit
for users with smaller hands the
majority of mice out there connect to a
computer either through a Bluetooth
wireless connection or using a USB
accessory you should probably stay away
from the ladder if you're prone to
losing small parts but just know that
you'll be missing out on special
features like logitech unifying reciever
that lets you connect up to six devices
to a PC or mobile device using a tiny
USB dongle alright so let's talk about
buttons you're probably used to seeing
mice with two or three buttons tops but
now you can actually get one with five
six even eight buttons that can be
mapped to any function you want whether
that's opening a particular program
controlling your media or switching
between windows those shortcuts can
really help you out with your
productivity too and once you grow
accustomed to using them throughout the
day
you'll probably be hooked forever so
here's my theory about mice everyone
falls into one of two categories
you either prefer an infinitely smooth
scroll wheel for jumping down pages with
a single flick of the wrist or you got
to have that ratcheting style wheel with
notches that stop at each turn every
brand has their own style but I like
Blodgett X mice that can switch between
the two
remember the dust ball that would
inevitably build up inside those old
mechanical mice while those days are
gone and laser tracking technology has
come a long way enhancing precision
movements and allowing for smooth
bouncing across different surfaces like
wood glass and even your own skin if
you're in a bind finally your options
can expand even further if you want
extra stuff like touch sensitive
gestures flashing lights or enhancements
for you
now the price for the fancier models can
reach upwards of a hundred bucks but you
don't have to spend a lot to get a great
mouse that works for you start by
checking off the features you need first
then decide which ones are worth paying
extra
