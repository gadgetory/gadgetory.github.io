lamented the day BMW stopped making
really good sport wagons or at least
importing them to the United States but
after spending some time with the bmw x3
I'm convinced that maybe they pulled a
fast one on us because this SUV has a
lot more in common with the wagon than
you might think I'm Antoine Goodwin
let's take a look at this 2013 BMW x3
xdrive28i now our example is equipped
with two different performance packages
the first being the in performance
package which amongst other things that
these cool little in badges all over the
vehicle but mostly it gives us 19-inch
wheels and adaptive suspension and BMWs
version of a torque vectoring system you
also get really nice sport seats on the
inside they're going to grip you in the
corners the second part is the dynamic
handling package which adds adaptive
sport steering so when you go between
your different driving modes the
steering feel actually changes also
now you'll actually control all of those
sort of adaptive performance bit with
this rocker switch right here give you
the access to four different drive modes
the first in default drive mode is
Comfort that's the the one that you'll
get when you get in the car and crank it
up
you can also rock it forward for sport
which is going to give you a little bit
more responsiveness on the pedal it's
going to liven up the adaptive steering
just a little bit and also firm up the
adaptive suspension for better
responsiveness all over you can rock
forward one more time to liven things up
just a little bit more and to loosen up
the traction control just a hair
there's also a traction control button
here if you want to turn it completely
off but I'm not sure why you'd ever
actually want to do that in an all-wheel
drive vehicle
plenty of grip then you can also rock
back to the Eco Pro Mode this in my
opinion is probably one of the most
interesting modes in this vehicle
because it's not really a performance
cards kind of a get from point A to
point B vehicle so Eco Pro will let you
do that in the most fuel-efficient way
possible in addition to resetting the
steering and suspension to they're most
comfortable settings it also does that
Eco mode trick that we've seen in a lot
of vehicles where it sort of dulls your
pedal inputs and kind of tempers your
lead foot so it takes a little bit more
pedal to get the vehicle going but the
upside of that is that you use less fuel
in the Eco Pro menu you also get a
couple of options that will allow you to
further increase the fuel economy the
first thing is you can turn on what's
called eco pro climate controls which
sets the air conditioning and heating
system to their most efficient settings
so that you save more fuel you can also
set a speed limit warning so that when
you exceed a certain speed you get a
warning we all know that the faster you
drive the more fuel you use so you can
sit like a gentle reminder for yourself
to keep it under a certain limit there's
also an interesting Eco Pro potential
meter right here that will let you know
how much fuel that you're going to be
saving by for example if you reduce the
Eco Pro speed limit to 60 you'll see
that number jump up and if you turn
climate controls off of the Eco you'll
see it drop down
own dashboard technology is pretty much
what we've seen in about maybe four or
five different BMW vehicles of this
generation before if you want to get a
really deep in-depth look and here with
Brian Cooley has to say about that you
can check out maybe the BMW x1 review
it's probably the most similarly
equipped vehicle to this one
in short the standard packaging is going
to include a full array of digital audio
sources including HD radio and Bluetooth
you've got a technology package equipped
here which is going to add navigation
and rear view and around view cameras
technology and then we've also got a
premium audio package that's going to
add satellite radio and a really nice
sounding stereo now when you lift the
hood you'll notice first that there's
actually a lot of empty space here in
the engine bay I don't want to get my
hand caught in any moving parts there
but that's because the x3 makes space
for BMWs of v6 engine but this 328
example is actually powered by a
twin-turbo two-liter four-cylinder
engine so it's a much shorter engine
pushed back towards the rear of the
vehicle
now when I say twin turbo what I
actually mean is twin-scroll there's one
turbo charger there with two Scrolls it
spins up a little bit faster than a one
large turbo would so you get less lag at
the end of the day what you're left with
is 240 horsepower and 260 pound feet of
torque which is a pretty good amount of
power for a vehicle of this size that's
going to go through all four wheels by
the xDrive all-wheel drive system and an
8-speed automatic transmission fuel
economy is about 24 miles per gallon
combined which breaks down to 21 in the
city and 28 on the highway
maybe it's me but it seems like the x3
has gotten smaller the ride heights not
much higher than your average large
sedan I go down the road I look over
them I almost I leveled with Prius
drivers and the handling is just it's
very natural it's not very truck ish but
then what do you expect things built on
a slightly elevated car platform now in
the the sport mode the the engines
actually very responsive the
turbocharged engine is not very much lag
and I've got pretty good grunt it's not
really what I would consider a
performance car though don't let all
those embed just fool you now the
interesting thing is the Eco Pro Mode as
I said earlier it does kind of adult the
acceleration a bit but I get the feeling
that people who are interested in the x3
particularly the 28i
are not going to be interested in
all-out acceleration the car still has
pretty good pickup the acceleration is
acceptable it handles about like you
would expect a large sedan I've been
driving smoothly and efficiently and as
a result I've squeezed at this point
four point four more miles out of a tank
then I would have without the Eco Pro
climate controls and speed warnings and
the benefits of that softer accelerator
pedal a part of me is still kind of
leaning towards the ex ones because I
you know personally I like smaller
vehicles small hatchbacks that's just my
personal taste in my heart of course
will always belong to the BMW 3-series
touring which we can't get here in the
United States anymore
now one of the most common comments that
I read on our BMW x1 review was why
would you buy a small car when for a
couple thousand more you can get this
big BMW x3 now not exactly an
apples-to-apples comparison because the
38 5 that'll get you out of the door on
this x3 it's actually the starting point
it doesn't include about eight hundred
and ninety five dollars in destination
fees three thousand dollars for the M
Sport package thirteen hundred dollars
for the adaptive steering and we haven't
even started on the tech all in to get
it as equipped as we have it see next
out add a fifty four thousand ninety
five dollars now that's a pretty penny
but it's actually not bad for a vehicle
that's as well-equipped as this one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
