about the top tech news of the day and
all the other crap you want to throw in
I'm Roger J I'm Ben Fox ribbon it's
finally here Apple officially unveiled
the iphone 7 and iphone 7 plus tomorrow
we'll break down the Apple watch series
2 but today it's all about the iphone
Ben would you think I I don't know was
it any good was it fate did you like I
was glad it was over we'd been talking
about it for like months now I'd only
got to see what it was so and there were
no surprises there were no surprises the
rumor mill had actually done its job
quite well I thought that way a little
too well because there were some
disappointments but we can get that
later yeah well okay fine let's start
with the camera then yeah what was it so
the camera I thought they did a pretty
interesting job with they presented what
was it like the dual lens camera yeah
the dual lens camera plus the six or the
seven plus sorry no it's got a normal
wide angle plus a telescopic lens allows
you to zoom in like a 10x zoom okay I
got any degradation it's pretty
impressive yeah but the flip side there
is that was downside is you have to buy
the plus which I'm not in the market for
us all right there's a lot of people
like you who don't like those jumbo
phones who I should prefer a smaller
phone so why the iPhone se exists who's
gonna be turned off but won't be able to
get the latest and greatest from Apple
right so the good news is is that they
also upgraded the iphone 7 where did
that have like what is that the image
stabilization stabilization which had
only been a feature on the + phone for
the last two years finally gets it on
the seven it's a little bit of catch-up
because most most phones out there have
0 is as a standard feature what does
that do by the way so it removes the
kind of shaky cam when you're like
moving around with video particular it
actually keeps the video a bit more
stable so it doesn't get all it's not
too jumpy yeah so it's actual pretty
good especially if you're taking you're
taking photos and you're moving your
hand around a little bit it
automatically kind of stabilizes so the
photo isn't blurry do you see this is
something that like people are gonna
like run out and like when I get the
phone for this you know what for the the
dual lens camera it's pretty slick
feature like it LG has had it HTC's had
it I kind of wished like the iPhone
before so yeah everybody has HTC and LG
phones so i guess they just answered our
question well look whenever they roll
out of feature no one cares when apple
rolls out the same feature totally
people care yeah alright so moving on
headphone jack that was a really big fan
the big controversy right yeah already
so basically they got rid of it we're
switching over to the Lightning port yep
they reminded us to that the Lightning
port was always intended for audio as
well so I don't know I know they spent a
good amount of time kind of justifying
it Nicki you could tell that they were
being a little defensive the audience
was pretty quiet there weren't a lot of
that's true what a lot of plazas for the
the switch oh yeah we got rid of it we
got rid of this thing that you might
really like yeah way to go to vested all
those all your money to headphones those
are all junk yeah I look they have the
adapter which is pretty lame and I'm
sure they have the wireless earbuds okay
which internet and Twitter of just
savage there's not a popular thing
people will just find it really ugly
well why wouldn't they don't people that
like have the like the Bluetooth like
the in-ear headset like people have been
making fun of those guys for years like
why would people look at this any
differently I you're right yeah okay and
then another thing with the little time
we have left it's going to be this new
phone water and dust-resistant yeah
they've been continually upgrading this
feature and this is this is significant
improvement from you this is ip67 which
is same rating that Samsung has on its
galaxy note 7 its galaxy seven phones
really and again this is Apple kind of
playing catch-up because most of the
industry or lobby players have
waterproof phones and apples finally
saying yep we have 12 ok good for them
well the iphone 7 is here and i can't
wait for next year's there you go the
more about Apple check us out on seen it
i'm roger cane I'm Ben Fox Rubin thanks
