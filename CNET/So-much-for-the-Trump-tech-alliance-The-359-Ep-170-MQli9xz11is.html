and we are back after an unforeseen
hiatus welcome to episode 170 of the 359
podcast with Ben Fox Rubin and Alfred A
and good morning guys Hey morning nice
good back morning yeah we have a lot to
talk about today so we're going to try
to cram in a lot in four minutes we're
going to start with the tech industries
response to the new Trump immigration
ban also the delete goober hashtag which
is of course related and then we'll talk
about something that's a little more
solidly in the tech world which is
apples earnings which are going to get
reported tomorrow night as always send
in your questions and comments Brian's
going to get to all of them or as many
as you can at the end of the show and
without further ado let's get this thing
going okie dokie hang out for a second
will be back and check in with you in
the chat after we do the recording will
see you in three minutes and 59 seconds
from 32 welcome to the 359 I'm Ben Fox
Rubin I'm Alfred Aang it looks like the
good vibes between the tech industry and
president Trump didn't last long after a
bunch of tech leaders including Tim Cook
Jeff Bezos and Sheryl Sandberg met with
Trump last month to find ways to work
together many tech execs many tech execs
slammed Trump's new immigration band
first off despite the meeting last month
I mean what what do you think these
folks do you think these folks like
really had much of a friendly
relationship to begin with I don't think
so i think that was kind of more of a
formality than anything Tim Cook himself
said when he attended that when he
explained to Apple employees why he
attended that meeting saying you can't
you know foster a lot of change sitting
on the sidelines you have to play ball
if you want right so that's why I like
they wanted to have that means yeah so I
don't think it was kind of like hey
we're gonna be buddy buddies but you
know I'm gonna see what I can do like
like I'm gonna play this game because I
have to so with all these tech
executives calling out the immigration
band also do you think that this is
really going to fundamentally change the
relationship I mean like we're kind of
discussing that already is
that they didn't really trust this guy
or they didn't they didn't support him
during the campaign it doesn't seem like
this is this is going to materially
change much as far as that relationship
I mean I think that meeting was more
about business though and I think this
one is more about you know standing in
solidarity with all their staffers you
know Google's already mentioned that a
lot of their employees will be affected
by this travel ban and that was one of
the points of that brought up to you
know would fit with the visas for a lot
of their staffers being able to come to
the United States that that was a point
that they had brought up during the
their tech summit with him and now it's
just you know even if you have a visa a
lot of people are being affected by this
yeah yeah another flash point over the
weekend was the delete goober hashtag in
solidarity with protests over the new
ban at JFK the taxi unions stop service
for an hour at the airport uber
meanwhile suspended surge pricing there
which was seen as a way of exploiting
the taxi strike now folks are deleting
their uber accounts do you think that
that's a justified response I think so I
think the best way to get any action or
kind of response from a company is a
boycott I mean we've seen it work you
know with plenty of companies during the
civil rights movement and I think this
was a this was a response to hoovers
actions here I mean ubers been defending
itself they've been saying you know we
you know didn't do this you know we did
this we didn't do this to break the
strike we did this outside of that hour
long you know protest yeah and they put
up some money to to try to support their
drivers do you think that like some of
these efforts to quality outrages like
working or it's helping at all I'm not
sure if it's working I I do know that
even before this immigration ban and
this you know surge pricing issue uber
has been catching a lot of flack for
this because of its CEO serving as one
of trunks Trump's economic advisors yeah
yeah I figured that might be related as
well also last stop Apple is reporting
earnings tomorrow but don't expect too
many fireworks that's because the iphone
7 and 7 plus probably didn't deliver
massive sales growth the same way the
iphone 6 and 6 plus did two years ago we
talked about this a lot on the show
do you think that smartphones are still
interesting as far as innovation is
concerned or we like kind of at a
standstill I think it's plateaued but I
I still think it's interesting I don't
think you know I think I don't think
we've taken any steps back yeah well
that's true but like my biggest concern
with the iphone 7 is that it looks just
like the iphone sex I do you agree with
that we know it doesn't it doesn't have
a headphone jack oh my god a very big
difference that is a huge huge
difference justifying a lot more money
so I try to make the push towards more
bluetooth earbuds yes and it's a big
difference all right well if you want to
read more about these stories check us
out on cnet I'm Ben Fox Rubin I'm Alfred
hang thanks for listening okay so as
someone who is a little bit disconnected
from the news last week myself lucky you
yeah fair enough at some point we're all
just going to go off the grid and go
live in caves which is probably coming
sooner than we thought according to the
Doomsday Clock just send me a Facebook
invite to that oh there there won't be
there won't be one pair of you um so
just help me clarify i want to start
with the the what's going with uber
right right cuz i've completely missed
the bus on this again due to i had to
deal with some family stuff last we have
o to stay up on the news help me do you
want it this thing all right well you
know it's i think a lot of people have
already expressed concern about uber and
their business practices to begin with
so as we mentioned on the show getting
rid of surge pricing especially while a
taxi strike was going on a lot of people
probably saw that is just like a craven
effort to you know exploit the situation
get more get more customers yeah even
even if it wasn't during that hour it's
certainly like a lot of people were
already outraged and inflamed about what
was going on here uh it's it's not
surprising that lift a major competitor
jumped in and said that they were gonna
put up what it was in a million dollar
about three million dollars yeah so lift
was also trying to at least take
advantage by saying hey we're not the
bad guys here but
I think I think the the sorry was
already layin dollar it was Amelia from
thanks for tracking yeah um three
million was from from uber actually to
support their drivers but i think that
the ground was already rattled rather
fertile for people to go and do the
hashtag delete uber thing because their
CEO has been working with Trump I was
like it in an advisory capacity during
during the inauguration they were
protesting outside of Hoover's office
also in San Francisco where they weren't
letting uber staffers into the building
um now is he actually sympathetic to try
to to the trump administration is that
where the question lies because it
nothing wrong with someone trying to
work with I don't stretch I don't know
is encouraged that we should be working
together more which is part of a lot of
the discrepancy I feel right now there I
don't think it he's at fault for wanting
to get in by mean even louvers CTO like
put out a scathing letter you know
against Donald Trump so it was one of
those things where it was basically you
know it's not even though his CEO is it
knocking out economic adviser for Donald
Trump it's not exactly you know uber as
an entire company sure yeah but and we
were talking about this before the show
to that Elon Musk is also working in an
advisory pacity with Trump and hasn't
gotten nearly as much flak and I think
Alfred you you correctly identified that
like you can much much more easily
protest against uber because people use
uber pretty regularly as opposed to
Tesla which what am I going up is it's
definitely easier to boycott something
that you can actually use you know bear
yeah i just gotta wonder though is there
also an element of is the uber camp
sympathetic to administration which has
become undoubtedly more polarizing and
then tesla is more of an obligatory
position is there an element to that no
uber as a company doesn't really put out
a whole like we support Trump kind of
okay do I think it's usually the CEO you
know that draws the backlash by I mean
you've seen it happen like LL Bean sure
the captain of the ship is the one
representing the company a large right
yeah it's it's
I at the very least I think that uber
realized over the weekend that they need
to present themselves a little bit more
clearly as far as what the position is
and they've they've presented themselves
in support of drivers yeah who obviously
a lot of them have immigrant backgrounds
a lot of them perhaps even come from
some of the areas that had been banned
so they want to they want to show that
they do support those for ya up until
friday and saturday the the conflict was
you know him sitting on as want one of
trumps advisors but now the the surge
pricing thing is what kind of tipped it
over for that where you know why would
you were already protesting despite not
having any taxi drivers go to or from
JFK and you know that would bring up
surge pricing because the demand so high
and that's the point of a protest this
is disrupted to kind of make things
harder on your rightful dear i realize
your problems and then why in the hell
would you just hey we're gonna get rid
of surge pricing for now and make it
easier going back going back to my
original point uber was already
controversial to begin with for a number
of reasons including their business
practices for the past couple years
suggesting lift did something like this
I don't know that it would have caused
as much of a backlash maybe it would
have because people were already
outraged they were already protesting
and they were really upset but I think
uber has continued to be a bit of a
lightning rod as a company yeah so yeah
like the ground was fertile main do we
want to do do we think that's just uber
trying to keep the wheels turning and
letting people who really have a message
to make their message known kind of
thing or do you really feel like uber is
kind of at fault here should they have
like just kept the nose out of that I
think they definitely stepped in it a
little bit this time and ya know that so
they've been doing a lot lot really
wrong yeah they've been doing a lot of
damage control since then because they
realized that they kind of screwed up at
the very least from a perception
standpoint let's say that like they
tried to do everything right and this
wasn't intentional or whatever from a
perception perspective like they pissed
off a lot of customers and and III
wouldn't I would disagree with that
notion you know like that wasn't that
wasn't such a great way to present
themselves okay thank you
help me clear that up I was really kind
of at loss i'm trying to play catch-up
here in the last couple of days and and
figure out where we're going with this
let's move back on to the phone before
we call today yeah he got a good comment
here from polar jf x official he says
smartphones are interesting in my
opinion but if companies make phones
kind of look like the previous
generation and remove that useful thing
that people have gun used to that makes
a huge difference so what he's saying is
like it's all part of the puzzle you
know and one tiny little you know broken
cog in the machine changes the whole
game i wonder what that useful thing
from the previous generation was if
we're talking about the iphone 7 here I
don't right I can't imagine if they take
a small piece out of the general worry I
think they still sold the the analysts
expect apple to have sold 78 million
iPhones over the past three months
though and granted they don't break down
exactly how many of those are iphone 7s
and seven pluses but it tends to be more
of the newer phones because that's what
you're upgrading to so without a doubt
they're still selling boatloads of these
phones but they're not growing nearly as
much as they used to the iphone 6 like
the first time that hit the market it
was like crazy gangbusters i think they
had the best quarterly profit of any
company ever in history and we're just
not seeing that type of situation
anymore so it's also an expectations
game that they were all the way up here
before and now they're just kind of
treading water a little bit so we'll see
what happens come September when the
iphone 8 comes out I mean yeah it's a
date on that September we don't know yet
within this Julie yeah it's usually in
September they haven't announced
anything they're getting even announced
that that phone is coming but it's it's
going to be coming at some point so yeah
it's just like design wise and and I've
heard from other people like people have
commented that like it's a new processor
it's a new camera you know it's
waterproof like there are a number of
changes that they've done however is
that really gonna you know excite a lot
of people to upgrade to the newest model
especially when it's like the base price
is 600
fifty dollars so I've continually argued
that like probably not but now it's
allowing a lot of the loyalists are
always going to be there statistically
the numbers will remain but for a long
time now that's been the running joke
with Apple is just like oh look they
polish the turd a little more right um
problem is i mean what's gonna replace
them they know like thoughts have been
underwhelming yeah but like okay from
what I've got the little bar now so you
know yeah I mean there's a lot to
complain about but as far as innovation
from Apple these days the issue is is
like if you're not going to use an
iphone what are you going to buy instead
if you do have to upgrade and like the
Google pixel is just getting started so
it's Samsung's got its own problems yeah
so what is going to steal the mantle
from Apple nothing yet nothing that I
consume so now I'm interested to see
what comes of this like Renaissance of
like cord cutting to the next degree
kind of situation as someone who
absolutely hates cables which is
ironically why I got into the media
production field as a career I don't get
me wrong I make jokes about the
headphone thing but there's a little
piece of me that's like finally to get
rid of more cords yeah more ya know core
I want no cords in my life eventually
but I think they may have pulled the
ripcord a little soon that's my two
cents my two cents on that and I can see
where think a lot of people would agree
with their wireless charging I love the
idea of I like my headphones and right
now there aren't enough wireless heads
out there to satisfy their it's not the
right ecosystem to go wireless right now
is the thing yeah it's coming like a
freight train yes but right now no you
know I like there's so many like
situations where i think i need my
headphone jacks for this thing like all
these road trips and i'm on with like in
my friends cars that like don't have
bluetooth or anything like that yeah
it's just not ready yet yeah just like
yeah I mean it's why i think it was so
courageous of elavil to make this change
when they do gotta go sit in the corner
take about my gosh shut it down shut it
down Reuben all right i believe all did
yeah let's call it was grown right
