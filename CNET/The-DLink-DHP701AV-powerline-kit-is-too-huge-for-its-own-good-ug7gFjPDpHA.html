AV 2 mm gigabit starter kit from dealing
now take a look at the box here and the
photo here is quite misleading because
this is the actual adapter look is huge
now normally I have nothing against huge
but with this type of products the
bigger it is the harder it is for you to
use I decide to plug directly into one
socket like this the largest I mean it
it gonna be hard for you to find a place
to plug it in and when you do we're
gonna block the adjacent outlet and
remember powerline adapters are supposed
to be plugged into the wall directly and
not via a power strip or shirt protector
now that's how to use it it's quite
simple the kid here come with two
identical adapter here you plug the
first one into the existing network such
as your router and the second one into a
device such as a computer or game
console or printer then both of
them into their world outlet and you're
done they've been turned the electrical
wiring between them into network cables
and deliver quite fast speed and speed
is the second thing is quite misleading
about this d-link it because dealing
claimed that they can deliver up to
2,000 megabits per second and there's no
way they can do that because each
adapter here come with a gigabit network
port so at best they top at 1000 megabit
per second and even that wasn't true in
my testing now the sewer here has to
sustain real-world copy speed of some
400 megabit per second now to be fair
that's quite fast I'm five times the
speed of a regular Ethernet connection
and currently the fastest in the world
of powerline adapters but seriously to a
thousand megabit per second who are you
kidding so the question is is this a
good power like it to have for the
answer is not really because it's very
expensive at some $160 now I review this
Netgear
1200 kit here it costs half the price
come with smaller adapter
was just tiny bit slower so the bottom
line is this one here is still a fast
and convenient way to extend your white
network without having to run network
cables but it's not a good deal because
of its high price and the large physical
size of the adapters and four more this
one here check out my full review as
cnet.com basically you'd be very happy
if you got this kid for free which I did
I'm still not happy though I'm having a
bad hair day and that's because I'm
dongho and this has been the first look
at the powerline AV 2 mm gigabit starter
kit for dealing crazy hair</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
