media and Twitter and if you really be a
powerful tool so we wanted to show you
some cnet secrets that will possibly get
you as many followers is justin bieber
and I'm serious about that so let's
start off with what I call the big three
and kev you need to pay attention number
one be useful you want to post some
interesting links that your followers
will also be interested in so for
example I have people that follow me for
tech video games and geek pop culture
but I'm not going to tell them about my
cross stitching project now number two
is be opinionated share your thoughts on
a topic or idea and really generate a
conversation around it without being
overly negative in this case I started a
conversation about a really important
topic creamy or crunchy peanut butter
and better yet it's also useful and
number three be funny everyone loves to
be entertained and Twitter's are really
quick and easy way to throw out a jab or
a joke so have fun with it now there's
also some other tools that you can use
to enhance your Twitter experience you
want to check out bit ly and this allows
you to shorten your links that leaves
you more characters for your tweets also
a really cool trick if you add a plus
sign at the end of your bitly link put
it in your browser you'll be able to see
how many people clicked on it where
they're from and when they did it also
for your desktop users another cool tool
is a free app called tweetdeck and let
you see all your interactions on Twitter
and even cooler you can schedule
specific tweets for a specific time to
go out and if you guys haven't jumped on
the Instagram bandwagon pretty much it's
time to do that it's really a great way
to share the snapshots of your life from
your perspective I like to take pictures
of cities I've been in or some of the
great amazing food I've had to eat but
there's other people that like to take
self-portraits of themselves Gavin so
you guys there you have it some really
cool tip for social media and kev i
expect now be useful be opinionated and
be funny man</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
