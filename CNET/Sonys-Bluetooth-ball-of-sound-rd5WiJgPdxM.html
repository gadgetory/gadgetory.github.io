cnet.com and I'm here with the sony srs
bt v5 this is a small bluetooth speaker
it's a very cute bluetooth speaker it's
in the shape of a ball there's a lot of
them out there however this one's claim
to fame is that it also has a
speakerphone built in as well as NFC
pairing capabilities NFC is available on
a lot of new phones but not the iPhone
just yet this does come in a few
different colors I have the black and
white models here I will say that it
feels like a nicely built speaker some
of these ball speakers are very light
this one has a little bit of heft to it
however it only sounds okay the sound is
pretty thin there's a Philips small
speaker like this that does sound better
has a little bit more bass this doesn't
sound great the one of their big issue I
have with the speaker was that while it
is NFC compatible I just couldn't get it
to pair using NFC even using a Sony
phone
you're supposed to download a special
app called NFC easyshare you read the
instructions carefully and then I tried
to pair twice with both a samsung phone
as well as a Sony Xperia phone and I
could not get the device to pair so
there still are some kinks to be worked
out with the NFC in the end I really
thought the strength of this little
speaker was its design it is well
designed however it is a little bit
pricey at 70 dollars and you can't get
other mini Bluetooth speakers in this
size that have the speakerphone
capability for less so I would say this
isn't a great deal I would like to see
that amp C pairing work I assume Sony
will get it working but for now I wasn't
able to get it working it's also worth
mentioning that Sony is supposed to give
another more catchy name the speaker but
for now I will have to finish by saying
this is the sony srs bt v v bluetooth
speaker thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
