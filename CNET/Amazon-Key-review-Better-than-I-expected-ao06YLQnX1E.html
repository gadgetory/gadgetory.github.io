delivery services Amazon P has a lot of
privacy concerns to overcome but the 290
dollar Amazon key home kit the smart
lock and security camera you have to buy
to use the service make it much less
creepy because you can keep an eye on
whoever's dropping off your packages
plus it works really well install the
kit yourself or have a professional do
it for you then log into the Amazon key
app using your existing Amazon account
info select setup and follow the steps
to get everything up and running keep in
mind that you have to be a prime member
to use Amazon key after that all of your
prime orders default to in-home delivery
you get alerts letting you know the day
and the timeframe to expect the package
and you can block access leading up to
the actual delivery if something comes
up and you change your mind the camera
records video clips of the entire
delivery so you can not only see that it
was delivered but how it was delivered
and ensure that your delivery provider
followed protocol that includes opening
your door just enough to place the
package inside closing it and locking it
again
I never once ran into an issue with the
delivery the alerts were reliable and
the deliveries worked seamlessly however
one time I inadvertently locked our
storm door which meant that the delivery
person couldn't actually get inside to
deliver the package so they left it on
the porch instead but in the app had a
nice note explaining what happened and
why if you're a Prime customer who
already orders from Amazon a lot and
you're concerned about packages being
stolen Amazon key is a good option that
keeps your front porch free of packages
assuming you don't lock the storm door
