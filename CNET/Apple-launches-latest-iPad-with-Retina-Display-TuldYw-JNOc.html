out with a product that's more amazing
than the iPad 2 with its big beautiful
nine point seven inch screen superfast
a5 chip all-day battery life and elegant
then in life design everybody's been
wondering this will stop wondering we
are
the retina display might have heard that
an iPad could have a Retina display but
until you see it you can't understand
how amazing this is we introduced the
retina display technology first on the
iPhone 4 and it's incredible and to this
day no one has yet matched that display
technology in any mobile device and
we're going to bring it to the nine
point seven inch screen of the iPad when
you turn on that new iPad you are going
to see graphics text icons sharper than
you can imagine
they're just beautiful when you go to
read a book you're going to see text
that rivals anything you've seen in
print and newspapers or magazine
everything you do is just going to look
stunning surfing the web reading your
emails and photos are just going to look
amazing at high resolution on that
gorgeous big display the new iPad
display is 2048 by 1536 pixels and if
you do the math really quick you'll
figure out that's over 3.1 million
pixels on this display the most ever in
a mobile device
put another way many of you all have an
HDTV at home these televisions 50 inches
60 inches have a resolution of 1920 by
1080 here's an iPad skilled
appropriately next to it it has more
pixels let's overlay the photos the same
photo as they could be displayed on each
of these devices you see the iPad shows
over a million more pixels than your own
HD TV does at home that's incredible
and of course to display that many
pixels we pack them really tightly
there are 264 pixels per inch in this
display and that is enough to call it a
Retina display so the new iPad has a
Retina display with more pixels than any
mobile device has ever had it is 2048 by
1536 resolution over three million
pixels there's greater color saturation
as the a5x quad-core graphics this is
the best mobile display that has ever
shipped the second feature in iSight
camera well you know on the front of our
devices we have a FaceTime camera it's
most often used for FaceTime video calls
that our customers love making and on
the back we have a camera and when that
camera gets of such quality and
capability that you're proud to use it
as your everyday camera for photographs
we call it an iSight camera and the new
iPad has a great eyesight camera it's a
5 megapixel backside illuminated sensor
we brought the optic system from the
iPhone 4s 5 element lens hybrid infrared
filter on it and we have an isp built
into our a 5x chip to do some great
software algorithms and capabilities on
this for photographs but of course the
ultimate measure of a camera are the
pictures you take with it so let me show
you some pictures taken with this new
iPad the iPad has auto exposure so cats
great exposure great color it has auto
focus it's incredible that the detailer
picks up and you see that lens can throw
over a great edge to edge sharpness and
detail it has auto face detection so you
take individual or group shots it knows
just what to do
there's auto exposure lock and auto
focus lock so you can compose exactly
the photograph you want it is just a
blast to use ads derby world's largest
dog
so it has a five megapixel iSight camera
advanced optics with an IR filter auto
focus auto white balance face detection
everything to deliver a great photo
