else to watch on netflix coming up we
already let you know the best stuff
leaving Netflix in November you can
check that out at cnet com / netflix
today let's talk about the biggest stuff
being added in November the first three
are Netflix originals so you're not
going to see them elsewhere for a while
first up marvel's jessica jones season 1
will be available on november 20th this
is part of marbles and larger avengers
universe and you might see familiar
faces pop up in the series netflix
released a trailer and this show looks
really dark and gritty don't expect too
many quips between deaths on jessica
jones on november sixth season one of
ozzy's Ansari's new show master of none
arrives on netflix Ansari stars as a 30
something year old actor trying to
figure out what to do with his life
marriage kids you know that kind of
thing I'd imagine there'll be a lot more
jokes in this show compared to Jessica
Jones then there's a new Netflix
original comedy special John Mulaney the
comeback kid streaming on November 13th
you might have seen Mulaney on the
hideously unfunny Fox sitcom Mulaney
however after watching a bunch of John
Mulaney stand-up comedy I'm betting this
special will blow away his TV show
because Mulaney is funny I don't know
what happened on that TV show but don't
judge a stand up on that what about non
originals we went through every title
and checked its metacritic score known
as a metascore Metacritic comes up with
a score out of 100 based on a whole
bunch of critical reviews here are the
top five highest rated movies hitting
Netflix in November number five here and
I with a metal score of 70 it's a
documentary about the fashion business
number four blue Caprice based on a true
story a man trains a teenager to become
a sniper number three another
documentary best of enemies it focuses
on the 1968 debates between gore badal
and William F Buckley Jr number two with
a metascore of 81 twin stirs two women
believe that they are twin sisters
separated at birth it's also a
documentary and the highest rated movie
being added to netflix in november with
a metascore of 86 is the last days in
Vietnam this documentary covers the you
evacuation of Saigon for a full list of
everything coming and going online check
out cnet com / net fix I'm is stop
watching this and start watching that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
