mode flex this is actually a bicycle not
a car and it follows on a couple of
bicycles that Ford announced earlier
this year the mode pro and the mode me
now what Ford is looking at here is it
different ways we'll get around in the
future in an urban environment including
buses and trains and cars as well the
mode flex has a lot of cool features
that make it a very technological bike
make it sort of the future of cycling we
have a rear light here we see that as on
a lot of bikes today but this one
actually gives you a brake light when
you pull the brake lever we also have
turn signals up on the ends of the
handlebars here if I just push this
little toggle switch on the handlebar
that actually lights up that turn signal
lets people know that I'm turnings I
don't do hand signals any more up front
here we also have a headlight that's a
nice bright light and that actually uses
lighting technology out of the Ford
f-150 up on the handlebars I have a
mount for a smartphone and they actually
have a special a smartphone app for this
that controls a lot of the lights and a
lot of the aspects of the bicycle but
this also ties into the electric assist
system this bicycle has a mid drive
electric motor mounted near the
crankshaft here and it's got a look
theum ion battery in the middle so that
powers that it gives you electric assist
for getting up hills or if you're
getting a little tired on the ride but
the Ford mode bikes including the Flex
have one really important feature that
makes them part of the whole Ford
transportation ecosystem you can break
them down and stow them into any Ford
vehicle this one is designed for the
front piece to come off the center
section the rear piece can even come off
of here and the idea is you can break it
apart put it in the back of your Fiesta
or in the back of your f-150 and that
feature also makes it modular so you can
put different pieces on the central core
you can actually have a mountain bike
front end or a road bike front end and
sort of change the type of bicycle you
have based on the center core and the
components you add to it now the mode
flex is strictly a concept at this point
but it's one way Ford's looking at the
way we can get around in the future in
our urban areas I'm Wayne cutting m4
