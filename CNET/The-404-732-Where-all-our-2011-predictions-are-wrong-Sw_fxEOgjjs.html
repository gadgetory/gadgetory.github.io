Jeff Bakalar I'm Olson tang and I'm
Justin you and this is the show where
all our 2011 predictions will be wrong
yes everything that already we have a
very terrible track record at predicting
things we thought avatar would be the
worst movie ever it turns out is it a
bet is the best film ever conceived
right I don't know about the best film
probably one of the highest grossing
shooters we also said that 3d would
never take off and every movie released
in 3d well I don't know I kind of think
that that's true though because I was
about to say I saw a couple of 3d movies
over the holiday break like Tron
doctrine uh terrible weird was it
chronicles of narnia some of the movies
at three it was so so why did you see
these well it was he it was I was in
Hong Kong it was the only one that was
in the English that could actually watch
ok there was actually a natalie 3d movie
which I was told was very inappropriate
yeah you don't really want to know what
it's about but ok ok well 3d like it
really hasn't added to any of the
experience I saw Iran saw you know all
these other movies it's man you know
like there's there's a moment where you
cross over into the 3d world and just
wasn't doing it why I remember last year
at CES that was the whole thing 3d
remember we were like all were the first
podcast in 3d no sensei so ever and now
I feel like we're just gonna eat it
because everybody literally every
product you can buy this year will not
only have a way for you to do it in 3d
but like you know maybe without glasses
3d printing to come out in 2011 dreaming
3d printing mayor uh maybe people will
actually start to get really interested
in the whole like printing counter that
will never happen will happen though so
last year we were here we did three live
shows from the scene that stage it was
amazing that's all they talk about now
they're like all remembers for 4 last
year I was the greatest thing ever
happened right so
what we're going to do this year cnet
picks their top best of CES products so
we were wrong on all of them because
like we said we're terrible with
predicting stuff but what I want to do
is I want to go back and sort of do a
little where are they now right thing
right so let's look at some of the top
products that we voted best of CES last
year fast forward a whole year see where
they stand now Wilson you want to start
things off but the first big one was the
panasonic 3d TC pvt 2500 case you have a
photo this or something up yeah it's a
it's a catchy catchy name for a 3d
plasma TV but apparently it got one of
our our best of CES award yeah so now
okay so why did it why it just seems
like just a regular television well I
apparently it looks fantastic it's it's
relatively low power but it's 3d it was
one of the first 3d sets and I don't
know if you guys remember rural area
this year watching 3d content kind of
hurled watching like a 3d TV moly
sidenote forgot about exactly laughter
watching a three it was only five
minutes of a 3d movie exactly what was
what kind of content was it was it was a
african documentary tiger it was it was
about like being in the Sahara and
whatnot yeah and the the content just
messed me up yeah like I watched five
minutes of it and i hurled an hour later
where I just had the worst headache I
couldn't take anymore anyways I gotta be
honest it's the reason why I don't even
care about 3d TV sex anyway because they
make me throw is that because there's
two separate images that are going into
both eyes or what way to go he's got the
stomach for looking we watch an hour and
a half of tron in 3d and ya know he goes
and go snowboarding yeah you're so like
I've mentioned this before and it said
like hot you know that I would have
loved to have been there yes just watch
explain yourself anything or do you
think perhaps you would not have vomited
word other content you know it was it
was because people don't know how to
make 3d right it was some brand-new is
very
brand new people grabbing whatever 3d
cameras are out there like I know last
year there was a couple from was it Sony
and Panasonic and they're just making 3d
you know documentaries with no regard to
how the I changes perspective we're
focused when is your clothes versus far
away okay and there was just a lot of
messy things like there was I have
mentioned this before but a globe yeah
you know like to the earth right and the
sides of the earth felt like they were
10 feet away yeah the front of the earth
was right in front of my face I want to
throw up just thinking yeah so that
missed me up and I'll be honest that's
completely screwed up the 3d TV category
for all right well you know it doesn't
make me want to throw up the 404 well
you know choose your words wisely last
year we voted of the alienware m11x as
the best in gaming and in no coincidence
alienware is very nice to uh to give us
some some some goods to do our show with
every day here at CES that's right so
let's look at that alienware m11x so
that was and that's this bad guy you
actually have it right in front of
pretty sweet I can't get over it's
actually a lot smaller than I thought
which is pretty cool you know he's left
I want any of the hackers laptop
remember that when they customize their
own cuz you can change the color of the
keys imagine how you want to like spray
paint yeah yeah that'd be good with
Annette can we make it happen a camo
alienware Haiti he's like don't hear
blown up right now fair enough so that's
what we're excited to see what will a
lien where come out with this year I
mean I guess when you ask where they are
now well people still sell them I know
people are still buy these things maybe
they should have waited for new ones
coming out right but uh but yeah so I'm
definitely curious where the teeny tiny
portable gaming laptop where's that
going well what else is on the list well
we have smart books okay so you know
everybody knows about the netbooks the
sure mark book category was supposed to
take off last year and that was anything
that didn't run windows in a netbook
form essentially so and we all know what
happened right ipad came out nobody
really cared this is no longer a
catalyst
haha took it off the list it's been
right the lips we've eliminated from CES
that's fine and that's where it is now
exactly exactly that uh you know
speaking of Android one of the other
products was the motorola backflip yeah
this is a one of the first android
phones just before the tidal wave that
came to see sure it was you know a lot
of people really interested in because
it had the keyboard built in and you
know we mentioned this the other day i
don't think anybody really gives a crap
whether a phone has a keyboard oh that's
it i'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna go
ahead most agree out of all the new
phones coming out well up just
percentage-wise how many of them have
keyboards I don't know but one that was
like a iphone question is eager killer
yeah you wouldn't get an iphone because
they didn't have a keyboard right that
was one of the reasons i didn't want to
have an EVO i have an EVO now and now
they're making an evil with a keyboard
shift so they're just playing with my
left and right they really want me to
lose my head but uh no I don't you know
I think the EVO shift 4g I think that's
proof that keyboards in you know phones
are not going anywhere necessarily I
don't know I I just don't I i typed so
much faster oh that's you I myself and
kind of a you know tool box when it
comes to that don't have that six-month
learning curve where they're mistyping
pairs and wanna they were just wanna
have a hard work and then it learns like
all the wrong things to learn and I'm
texting my mom like awful things and
that's a big deal I feel much safer the
safety net of a keyboard you understand
what I'm saying I I understand that
let's move on another thing that we
really admired last year was the i-5 pro
x2 this is an SD card that you can put
into a camera that allows you to
wirelessly upload photos to the Internet
I sets genius I still have difficulty
grasping that technology I just don't
understand why more cameras don't have
that built-in Wi-Fi technology i know
that it would there are some companies i
do that right well i know that you know
if-- the iphone is really popular but
it's like the convergence of because
what ends up happening right you
out to a party or an event I take a
picture and the only thing you're
thinking the whole time is man I got to
get home to upload this right right so
like it just takes out the the middleman
and yeltsin things when he's at a party
everyone else has no upload photos of
tank and a party Wilson's already done
it right and he's already offended
everyone within a 10-foot radius never
go to a party with Wilson because he
will be live-blogging the entire thing
oh yeah ya know everybody wedding that's
right that was uncool phone hey check
out a lot of traffic that ended up being
a integration I'm great your google
adsense on my wedding I deserve a cut
his eye fi pro x2 would be is right up
your alley well yeah cuz like you know
the iphone the camera is not not the
greatest it's better than it was before
but it's still no you know it's close to
a point shoot but not quite there
especially when it's dark but you know a
lot of people especially with the pro
cameras want to take a picture upload it
straight to their Flickr or their
Facebook and this is the one product
that actually think sort of did take off
but more in the e like if you knew about
it right okay I gave if a lot of you
know if against the mainstream sure had
heard about it sure who about it you
don't see ads for this right I think a
lot of people would have embraced it but
let's move on let's actually talk about
what's coming up for 2011 oh and it
seems like everybody and their
grandmother is making a tablet an
android tablet yeah yeah and remember
last year Microsoft came out they sort
of introduced the the form factor for
the mainstream they said hey we're gonna
have any windows slate tablet coming out
and what is it worked out keep on
October's yeah maybe 500 units oh and
Wilson just loves to just crap on
anything that's not apples it's amazing
well how many of you are planning to get
an ipad I'm getting the next iPad yes i
will also i like the next one it took
all my strength not to get one for
christmas pretty sure that was another
thing we predicted for not take off the
ipad it behind n like no way will that
work out there's no one
gonna want some that's against hahahaha
or James Cameron it's fun yeah yeah we
also thought this the social network
would be a terrible movie i also have
all my money on the 49ers we're making
good bets all around but I great
everybody you know now that Apple sort
of I guess pull the rug under microsoft
released a much better product everybody
is clamoring to get their own tablet out
right and I'm hearing tablets from
people on never expected like Hetal like
vizio then it's out two years ago this
was this this was the manufacturer you
go to Walmart to buy like a you know
relatively inexpensive plasma or whatnot
and two years later they've won our cnet
best of us you know that editor's choice
award and now they're releasing phones
and tablets right so I don't know I feel
like everybody's got a tablet they're
becoming like America's Choice like the
Kirtland the same choice everybody the
kirkland brand of electronics yeah
here's another here's more a big list of
manufacturers that are slated to release
a honeycomb powered tablet at one of
them tell me sir archos asus creative
dell entourage I've never even her on LG
motorola next others that's a nice
roster I think the most interesting
thing and you can you could talk about
this as a category sure just the ipad is
that when the ipad came out the number
one question besides why did they decide
the name of the ipad right was what are
you going to use it for right and now I
think we've counted there's something
like 50 different different tablets
coming out right and everybody I've
talked to who's got an iPad or tablet I
think the only one that's really useful
is the samsung galaxy tab oh god loves
it absolutely loves it so I'm really
digging it I'm definitely getting one in
March right are any of you guys really
considering getting to android tablet at
all no probably the way for the ipad 2
yeah i'm gonna get the other to talk
about it ipad 2 I mean look I you know I
will play with an android tablet uh-huh
but for me a lot of the games I like
what I'm seeing on the iPad and I really
you know want to read comic books
the marble eyes that's no joke I don't
know he laughs it is laughing I just
they are you I'm laughing because like
like last year you guys were crapping
all over the whole idea of owning a
attack don't know what you're talking
grab a lot of my dear but you know what
more so than the ipad I like all the
ipad accessories yes come out and goofy
as they maybe they're all kind of goofy
like check out this I prop right here
this is a bendable neck and bald socket
connector as you attach to your iPad
that i'll let you bend an arm up to your
viewing area if you're so lazy as soon
as i'm living right the idea of having
an ipad is that you can hold it in your
hand right browse just not have it
waving around on the stay on a visit we
usually I mean that's a big complaint a
lot of people are like I'm gonna get a
kindle or nook cuz the ipad is too heavy
I see a woman in this picture by the way
in the advertiser description looks
delighted to be using this is she does I
hope she's okay though that's you know
that's not I hope she doesn't have to do
that how someone needs to photoshop
Wilson's face onto this bow because
that's what you will be doing anything
that's your life let's Wilson just put
like an old Asian man and a Pringles can
come on Pringles and it's so I wanted to
mention this mention is that like I
found my old ibook yes Christmas yeah
and the thing is heavy yes it weighs
like 67 pounds and beauties are heavy
they used to be as well I used to carry
that thing all over the place and look
how Jack you are in one hour okay my
laptop arm yeah we got our a few more
minutes before we hit this break I think
yeah I want to talk about Nintendo for a
second Nintendo is sorta gonna be at CES
for the first time and I don't know 15
16 years and obviously everyone's
excited about the 3ds yes which you'll
see more for me later doesn't care no
most notably my little brother who just
received a dsi XL right Chris man now
you're going to want to buy them this
thing some news is leaked out apparently
on the Japanese Nintendo website there's
this big disclaimer saying that kids 6
in under should really use the 3ds
sparingly or not at all
are basically never because it's the 3d
technology is actually hazardous to
their health well the the 3ds is claim
to fame is that you won't need to put on
glasses right that's that you'll be LLC
to 3d yes I'm sure there's some sort of
magic or we do different images that are
projected into both eyes ladies and
shows two layers can drastically affect
the development of children's I i don't
know i think if that whole you know
country survive pokemon like I think
they can take what work indeed an
epileptic seizures because wherever you
think they learned their lesson to make
an omelet you gotta break some eggs you
know what I'm saying buy eggs you mean
children's on okay that's fine you said
it not me but that's your kids six and
under really be using a nintendo dsi
absolutely okay I mean first of the gun
on whether or not you tell them that you
can't rude I mean that'll have their
friends gonna get it this is if you're
the evil parent that doesn't buy and
breaking up but you know like with any
gaming system yeah you got to take a
walk every now and then you got to relax
especially handheld ones when your face
is six inches in all of it it's gonna be
hilarious to see kids walking around in
Japan or just like cross-eyed playing
series of people waiting in a bowl Wow
like that doesn't already happen right
now right I don't know maybe it does but
it's a very interesting disclaimer and
obviously the media goes nuts whenever
they see this like oh my god they need
Nintendo saying don't buy it for your
kid when they would like anything but I
just think look at Jeff he's been
playing video games since he was four
look how you turn in and I'm clearly
fine I'm really fine yeah it worked out
well we're coming up on our break rate
we are we're actually going to be having
cars a boy from a very exciting on on
the show with a 30 about what's going on
on the floor we'll also you know find
out what the kind of weird stuff all the
kind of wacky products that were that
are coming out here at CES we'll see you
guys after the break right well so what
we'll do is we'll have her and then also
we're going to have an alienware contest
Thursday and Friday that we just want to
tease real quick and we have a phone
number to call 1866 404 seen it somehow
we'll make that work yeah
all this after the break see you guys on
their side
you
alright welcome back to the big show
this is only isn't weird the day before
the doors open it's kind of quiet here
at CES nobody talking we got a whole oh
my god the millions of people watch one
good turn the camera literally dozens ah
standing uh you know standing room only
second half of today's 404 we are lucky
enough to be greeted by Kara Tsuboi
thank you so much for being here well
thank you for inviting me my very first
appearance on the 404 yeah this is very
my inaugural visit right very long time
in the making very long but I'm glad
you're here thank you I'm glad to kick
off your first show its yeah absolutely
you're doing CBS coverage exactly right
here you got to walk the floor now just
fold esquema we're owned by CBS yeah so
this is a should be no surprise like
breaking news from Wilson whoa oh hey
already jeez um what about you you've
had the chance to walk the floor yes uh
have you seen some really interesting
things in what's the hottest thing
you've seen no from the show floor so
like the thing that I'm most excited to
purchase myself well definitely not 3d
TV yeah I wouldn't say that but I've
seen a lot of cold tablets that's always
fun and I'd like some of the quirkier
smaller more innovative stuff right I
mean like I'm really not looking to buy
like a 50-inch plasma okay that's not in
my budget not my future sure not in my
like apartment space right you know but
the smaller stuff you know like the
camera is the goggles the headphone agha
right you were telling me yesterday
about a cool pair of snowboarding oh my
goodness you guys oh my goodness ok this
was fantastic right pair of goggles that
you can either wear them underwater like
scuba diving goggles or or on the snow
oh you guys skiers are skiing somewhere
yeah me too that it listen sorry Wilson
falls down a hill gracefully we can
document okay I'll put on the boots and
just fall that's easy no with a camera
though we can document all of his
wipeouts yes and put them on you there
wouldn't be enough tape
more shots of me pulling myself that guy
running over a six year old one tree is
very vividly visual that visualizer so
so how do they work out so they pretty
much look like regular girls there may
be a little thicker up top but you're
not much heavier which is a really cool
part that's a big deal and then right
between the eyes they have this little
camera all right like you'd see on your
smartphone sure basically a James Bond
kind of a little bit yeah I think yeah
so then on the side you're I think you
use your right hand there's two buttons
you like 14 start work for stop and it
takes still photos and then if you click
hit it twice it'll take video oh wow and
when you're wearing the goggles you see
a little blue light flash a couple of
times indicating i took a picture or
we're now rolling you're on and this
thing can hold I think up to 12 hours of
video oh my god oh my god no how is it
powered you have to charge it up you
just charge it up but they say it runs
for a long time and then on the other
side of the goggles you have a little
output where you can take the video off
input it post it whatever you're gonna
do with it well I want to know like yeah
that almost seems like so 2008 like well
would reassume forging like built into
the first off me at the top of high
watchin TV built into the things I could
watch you know yeah no you guys it's
absolutely sure to have a sink with your
phone or something all right but the
fact that you're getting 12 hours yeah
that's and none I do not work for this
company liquid something or other but i
will say that it's pretty reasonable too
well it's about 350 oh that's cuz how
much is a professional set of you know
ebooks you saying even a hundred bucks
for like a really sweet marathon will be
cool if they somehow made it into a
helmet hi a goggle hybrid first-timer
like this guy's mouth plus his medical
information
surance part 1 of this pile of bones at
the hell needs to be sane gonna get
arrested for running over that's really
cool so stuff like that that's we come
to enjoy I mean I think so I mean you
when you come to CES you know you're
gonna be seeing you know the flat
screens you know you're gonna be seeing
you know new smartphone sure but it's
that it's not kind of fun smaller
geekier stuff that I look forward to
catching especially in our community I
feel like I know this is true myself
already have the big flat screen
absolutely I can't put anything bigger
you know without straining my head very
missable you know let me turn right you
live in New York all right like the TV's
like this far away from you sir okay go
on but and ever you know all of us have
smartphones so I'm trying to find that
you know next thing that I could waste
150 luck Wilson I might have have I
might have your solution right here to
sleep I arm forearm mount if we can
switch to a picture of this this is
actually a joke but I think it's a funny
one it's a forearm out that you put on
so that you can literally just raise
your arm up and use your iPad it's like
you're a quarterback you know that's
exactly what's one of these innovative
apps that lets you use your arm right
and yoli all has one arm the double
piety in the restroom or on the go this
might be the one that changes around our
prediction law this is the game changer
I think that's that we're gonna see that
like an industry do you see like a
waiter coming up you know oh you like
the soup there you go you know that be
good application I was in Hong Kong /
December uh-huh and what was interesting
I had never seen so many iPads and
tablets just out yeah and it was really
interesting we say you're out what do
you mean people you know people want you
to have a street actually using an iPad
okay device have you so you so you're
saying in New York you don't see people
using I because you want to get mugged
yeah industry with cool yeah I've never
seen a my knees worshipping him was that
they actually have jackets now mm-hmm
where the ipad fits inside one of the
like one of the sides they whip it out
like this and they use it like that oh
well I think he doesn't have a charger
on the bottom you like a stocky stated
charges there so
exactly just withdraws money from your
account yeah Steve Jobs bank account
will you take a photo that next time
please definitely but you know I promise
you I kept on seeing people do this yeah
oh really working all night like little
Minority Report so what else did you see
on the floor you know that that wasn't
so hot yeah you're just like really yeah
you got someone to give you a hundred
thousand dollars to make this thing yeah
I guess you approach yeah we completely
ripped 3d TV enough yes oh hey we hate
3d TV arguably more than anyone even the
glasses-free 3d TV well I had her toys
yeah Ivan yeah right up know it sounds
better oh it's there have you got to use
it no I really didn't but when we were
out in the floor this morning I mean it
was still like you were dodging forklift
right they are in full on setup mode up
there so we saw them from afar and they
were even plugged in yet but you know
advertising it well so you haven't seen
it in Act I have not am I worried with
that is it's probably gonna be this one
degree sweet spot yeah Charlie you know
method you might lose it yeah gosh you
may want to watch TV with a friends
don't figure and you just have to go
head by head just watch it it's one of
the features it's a bonding thing sure
like it's a little over Josie sigh music
spirit that's never gonna have me about
that I've got a 3d TV but it only works
yeah what I don't understand is how
they're gonna go ahead and justify last
year selling you every single pair of
nine hundred dollar 3d glasses that
you'll need and then they show up
photographs of all this family smiling
at home the dog has no fair everyone has
their own pair and then they're just
like you know what nevermind you don't
need anything you know it was a big fail
before the show even started though was
Google TV I remember how big that was
just two or three months ago and then I
don't have a saw the article yeah right
you saw the article your time says you
know Google
just dropped the ball and said hey don't
all that stuff you're planning for CES
as far as Google TV internet connect
reason it's not ready yet don't even
think about releasing it but a lot of
people we've talked to have said that
those smart TVs are a major trend keep
an eye on and we saw someone using it
out there we saw their TV and for
whatever reason he googled in CSI Miami
yeah little CBS plug and if it's kind of
cool like up on his TV you know hopped
all these YouTube videos of Caruso and
what noddin well I think the biggest
detriment to the platform is it the
there's still a lot of you I bugs right
like you it's essentially having a
computer hooked up to the TV it's not
really that sort of home entertainment
seamless that's sink a bad kind of
experience it sure I don't know I i I'm
a little disappointed with it because
the whole idea of Google TV is supposed
to be fantastic I really dig it but all
the first products not up there I
wouldn't use any of them not even I
think there was the logitech revue this
couple sony tvs are about five hundred
dollars spent there's no real brand
sorted that people can ultimately I or
instantly identify with that says oh
that's Google TV that's the one I needed
and I know Intel and all these other
people saying Smart TVs but where are
they do you think we're a year too early
I think they was a year too early Google
may be spreading itself a little thinner
yeah come on let's stay to survie
careful because they know your social
security how many times and a whole lot
more thank you that's what we bringing
that out during the census ah right why
doesn't the census the Census Bureau or
ever were just knock on Google's door
and get hey give us all your you don't
need to walk around with people who are
no birds and now and some just level
knows I mean Google absolutely knows
everything you're doing there exactly
how many people where you lay know where
I am literally right now absolutely how
much gonna check in I know I'm like
looking behind me um alright so Verizon
is here as well nah and everyone's
talking verizon iphone
like it's the biggest secret in the
world is you know I kind of think like
if that does happen officially wouldn't
that be the last possible piece of news
that anyone would care about you know I
was surprised that it sort of all the
rumors right now or that Apple was
supposed to say something about verizon
iphone around CES but everybody is now
saying oh it's going to be pushed either
to the end of the month or just before
Valentine's Day right but I think it's
going to be really big I think I
personally am very seriously considering
dropping ATT and paying the four hundred
dollar fee she not here to get out of my
contract that's so really that bad we
hate life that much right now really
think for rise it's gonna be that much
better though I every time I've had
verizon i have sprint now but every time
i've had verizon I've loved the actual
service I didn't love the customer
service or bones themselves that much
right but quality and coverage while I
mean it really couldn't be but I think
the best thing that's going to happen
though is that there's probably be some
competition and those like hundred and
fifty dollar phone bills that we're all
getting the iphone or might you know
drop down ten dollars of you know
there's people who pay that much for
yourself i pay at the very minimum 105
we're on the same plan that's what I pay
should i do too mmm suckers I knew what
I just had to buy with a microcell at
eighteen t microcell for my San
Francisco apartment to buy it you got to
buy your own antenna yeah yeah service
service is so bad happy dad we're gonna
force you buy another hundred and fifty
dollars to buy this micro cell to sit on
our floor right near the door the window
and it would it doesn't even work that
well that is it one go AT&amp;amp;T toso thing
is it doesn't work it's little spotty oh
really is like it's it's sitting right
at City right there yeah and like I'll
be in the middle of a call and then four
minutes later I'll job yeah so this is
why I have a home phone I'm probably
like the only person under 40 who hasn't
known about well I have one too it's
weird i looked at I'm like Hello
very sure when it rings you're like I'm
like right get out of here like a big
deeper speaking of AT&amp;amp;T the company has
revealed 4g handsets and their LTE
launch plans probably be able to get an
LTE antenna for your apartment as well
another 150 bucks another it's just
bounce right on top ATT contractor right
yeah start working for the company said
selling service right so among the
announced 4g phones is the motorola
atrix 4g the htc inspire 4G and the
Samsung Infuse 4G I please hope this is
the last time with all the you know
ending every phone in a 4g i think i'll
be sort of get it you know like even
when they oh this is this HD I get it in
that better not to get too nerdy oh free
we've way beyond a wave upon wrong we
threw ourselves over the water uh well
who do you guys think about the whole
debate though about whether t-mobile
really counts as 4g ATT is this really
for gene I wasn't even aware of the
debate go down anyway no faster but
beyond that like are any of you
clamoring for 4g phone LTE verizon I
mean no ish my iphone 4 g's good enough
for me I mean I'm okay I won't lie uh
when I was on my honeymoon who I getting
4g on sprint that was awesome so what
were you doing with it though oh I was
just able to like I was paying attention
my wife yeah yeah that's the official
one area but I was uh and also the
amount of you know cuz you're always out
and about and you need axelle where's
this restaurant where's this Beach
whatever that was really good in Vegas
here for gene Sprint's turned on and
that's been awesome so yes I do like
having for it okay again like this is
sort of parsing things but I I think the
bigger issue is not so much the
bandwidth right cuz I'm not bit
torrenting on my you know iphone oh haha
you'll figure it out tonight it's the
latency it's like if you hit something
you got to wait like a second or two for
the network to respond and then it no
it's sort of dumped someone to your I
mean I think it depends as you go
yeah and where you are right i mean New
York is one of the worst places i feel i
mean san Francisco's master than New
York but it's still slower than Kansas
City right now we have Kansas City
people calling so look at these done
yeah I love you at the city but yeah
yeah that place anybody who has like a
tea service here at CES I feel like this
like an annual thing I had to switch it
over to edge in order to even like make
a phone call huh like it sounds when I'm
gradually work as a workaround you get
better service I get better than I get
you far better service and to be honest
I don't expect to be able to make any
phone calls yeah when I'm in that cuz
this is to be this is nerd central
there's more you know smart phones here
than right you know per capita like
square you know mileage than any place
on the planet right everybody's gonna
stand what percentage are iphones would
you guess that's a good question ah you
know or even close to 50 I know I'm so
he goes I say 35 35 yeah something like
that blackberries being the next
category I think now Android phone yes I
don't know I usually your android and
blackberry the students are using the
blackberry yeah there's a lot of that
here oh yeah we're getting close we are
you want to sort of go around the table
here in sort of say okay what are you
expecting like what you know you got
your your hands on show floor stuff a
little prematurely perhaps mm-hmm but
you've gotten a grasp of what's out
there yes is there something right now
on Wednesday you could say CES 2011 is
well how about I tell you what I'm
looking forward to catching either later
today or did absolutely and you can
catch all this on CBS that's what i'm
doing is i'm reporting for CBS you can
see our stuff in the morning show and
affiliates around the country and we're
really looking to catch some fitness in
tech in the the marriage ok I mean we
fit is obviously old old news but
there's so many more gadgets right and
implementations of technology out there
I'm sorry to see a lot yeah exactly i'm
starting to see a lot more that like one
of the more innovative things i saw was
they finally they have a product now
that can measure your blood pressure and
heart rate right on your iphone it gets
up with your facebook that's what we
need we need a weight
hahaha we need a weight loss RPGs people
will want to level up and be like oh I
gotta get more HD I'm telling you that
would work you promise you people left
and right you we'd all be 140 pounds say
one of my favorite moments of working at
seeing it was watching the first look
video work Jeff stands on the wii fit
for the first time when you get all the
wii fit like it's this very you know
generic looking character and then he
sit stands on it and just yeah that's
what happened with the systems like oh
my god how did you even get into the
store the perfect these units thanks for
that insight it's cool you're getting
laid and you would you look presentable
yeah you're going to hawaii an amazing
exactly um okay i guess i'll go to what
about my yeah you know I do all the game
stuff I think there's going to be a lot
of cool new gaming accessories in the
vein of sort of what we're seeing I
really like the surround sound headsets
a lot of people are trying to do maybe
multiple systems for that I think that's
pretty cool obviously the 3ds is
probably here that's going to be a huge
deal definitely the thing I'm most
excited about then I turned to just you
I'm gonna put my limited credibility on
the line here coming out next week 1
1111 okay why do an anonymous tipster
that apparently works at apple uh he
tipped off our own rick broida that
there will be a verizon iphone coming
next week actually been a verizon cdma
wow can assume that means verizon okay
generally put me at the Shady if that's
not the case alright but you're okay
that's good to know and we expect that
yeah but your 11th elects 2011 that's
imagine of anything else and i are no
