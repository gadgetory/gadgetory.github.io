buzz report the show about the tech news
that everyone is talking about this week
it's the dangers of texting while
driving laws internet wiretaps and a
singing doggy but first it's the gadget
of the week the gadget of the week is
the rim playbook sweet specs people the
PlayBook is a very cool looking 7-inch
tablet it adds a front-facing and
rear-facing camera a dual-core one
gigahertz processor multitasking and
HDMI port with full 1080p support hot
and integration with blackberry
enterprise servers and devices plus no
wireless contracts required I love it
however there was no real demo of the
device no specific ship date other than
the first quarter of 2011 and no price
given huh the specs you've always wanted
with none of the details does that come
pre-loaded with duke nukem forever or
wait maybe it'll be bundled with the
directv TiVo yeah no that was delayed
again this week too yeah until 2011
maybe you felt the disturbance in the
force as though a million direct TV
subscriber voices suddenly cried out and
were suddenly silenced and now for the
news a study out this week finds that
bans on texting while driving are not
working in fact in three of the four
states surveyed there were actually more
crashes reported since the bands went
into effect now I assume that it's
because instead of texting like this
people are now texting like this
dangerous or it could be that even if
people stop texting you still have
plenty of them out there who will try to
read the paper shave put on makeup
hopefully that's not the same person all
while driving our solution exploit the
technology voice activated services
hands-free systems that don't make you
look like a dingleberry self-driving
cars we get the picture seriously
self-driving cars it's the only way
moving on the US government wants to
make it easier to wiretap the Internet
the Obama administration wants social
networks VoIP services even p2p services
to change the way their technology works
so that federal agents can with warrants
intercept decrypt or
even tap into communications now the
government says terrorists and other
criminals are using new technology to
communicate instead of traditional
phones or cell phones that could be
tapped now obviously that would open up
a ton of privacy concerns not to mention
the fact that hackers would probably use
any technology backdoors even more than
the government would then again it's
true that it's harder for law
enforcement to catch the bad guys when
they can just hide all their chatter in
the cloud it's a complicated issue and I
don't pretend to have all the answers
but maybe we could just send all the
terrorists a cute puppy would a
terrorist hurt a puppy speaking of
puppies let's have a look at what's
clogging the tubes it's been a while
since we had some YouTube gold
especially the kind that combines cute
animals and autotune witness Mishka the
talking husky singing
she's on iTunes yeah seriously the
auto-tuned dog is on itunes there's your
beautiful technology future come true
people not quite how you envisioned it
was it and that's the buzz report for
this week everyone I'm Hollywood and
thank you for watching the texture that
dog is not a good singer I could auto
tune sing way better than that dog sure
you are a little promo okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
