people no Dolby for sound now the
company wants to do for video what it
did for audio for Pixar's inside out
Dolby cinema makes these animated
characters or the voices inside your
head more real than ever make a show of
force I don't wanna have to put the foot
down
the idea behind Dolby cinema is that you
are immersed in that world to be able to
sit in that space where there's no
ambient light there's this beautiful
picture in front of you and immersive
sound all around the cinema experience
combines a laser projection system
called Dolby vision with existing Dolby
Atmos sound technology dolby vision
delivers enhanced colors in contrast to
allow filmmakers to display a high
dynamic range image Disney's
Tomorrowland was the first film to be
released for Dolby cinema but here at
Pixar the challenge is how to translate
that experience for animation Pixar
films use a very wide colour space but
it normally has to be reduced for cinema
and home video releases Dolby vision
allowed director Pete docter to make a
strong visual statement with scenes set
in the inside world for him to be able
to take the scenes inside the head and
let them be super colorful and contrast
of levels that you don't normally get to
see blacks are so black that the room is
completely dark scenes in the outside
world use a simpler digital cinema color
space more like what you'd see in a
regular theater on the audio side the
Dolby Atmos system treats sound as
individual objects letting Pixar place
them anywhere in three-dimensional space
dialogue can be panned all around the
cinema so it sounds the same no matter
where you sit so we would often put
voices from inside your head all around
you which was an exciting thing to do
and help us tell the story letting your
emotions run high is all part of turning
a movie experience inside out in
