that matter right now
Bitcoin has passed the u.s. $9,000 mark
for the first time picking it over nine
thousand four hundred on Sunday it's a
record figure for the cryptocurrency
which started the year just under $1,000
while Bitcoin has had its share of
volatility experts say the currency
could end the year valued over $10,000
another day another hack this time image
sharing site imager revealed it was hit
in 2014 with 1.7 million user emails and
passwords compromised imager says real
names and addresses weren't breached
mostly because that data was never
collected and that it moved to inform
users as quickly as possible security
researcher Troy hunt who informed imager
of the breach said the company's speed
at handling the news was exemplary
and speaking of hacking new reports show
the FBI knew Russian hackers were
targeting US officials but kept the
information under wraps according to the
Associated Press the Kremlin linked
hacking group known as fancy bear
targeted the private Gmail accounts of a
number of officials but in interviews
the AP found only two of the nearly 80
people targeted were notified by the FBI
the FBI didn't immediately respond to a
request for comment but told the AP it
routinely notifies individuals and
organizations of potential strike
