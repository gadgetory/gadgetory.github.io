welcome to tomorrow daily at the best
youth talk show in the universe I'm
Ashley together and I'm Jeff kanata back
for another week of headlines here it
comes if you are interested in 3d
printing and you also love having pet
fish then this story might be for you
misawa design institution takes a
beautiful minimalist look at aquatic
sculptures with water scape a series of
3d printed aquariums coral and other
traditional fish tank structures have
been replaced with lattice domes and
other things for fish to swim through
and around and a few of the tanks even
have air pockets inside them for growing
land-based plants it's a little bit of a
glimpse into the future of fish tanks
which might not be a seismic shift in
the way we live but would definitely
enhance the view of our homes and
offices and make our lives a little more
futuristic no official word on whether
or not they're ever gonna sell these or
make them commercially available to
people but if they do I want one these
are awesome you know we talk about the
future of architecture being all about
3d printing I never realized yeah we we
can make tiny architecture for tiny
creatures yeah small stuff I can't wait
to see a 3d printed hamster enclosure
like that'll be really fun for that
hamster amazing you could really do a
great job if you're like me and you have
fond memories of half-life 2 or maybe
you didn't play half-life 2 but you
heard about it being one of the greatest
games of all time will perk up because
this mod is pretty cool youtuber
Valentin demchenko created a fully
functional city scanner from the game
cobbling together parts from various
objects into a really convincing prop
replica it's pretty large coming in at
about 2.7 feet long and 1.9 feet high
with a carbon fiber and polystyrene body
it's also got a GoPro on board and a
bright red light as a finishing touch if
you're curious as to how demchenko built
this thing and you want to put it
together yourself he's got a couple of
short videos about building a city
scanner on your own I kind of want to do
this I know it's gorgeous it looks like
it came right out of the game because he
aged up like made it look like
it was sort of a computer graphic way
and the oh my and it retracts never oh
it's pretty wild I mean it is the the
creepy Overlord world part of the game
so it is a little a little creepy just
keep on Tobar to swat it yeah you always
have to have your crowbar don't ever
forget to leave the crowbar don't don't
ever leave your crowbar at home that's
what we're saying yeah what should we
talk about on Thursday I kind of think
3d printed aquariums is pretty neat
maybe we'll look up some smaller
habitats maybe I'll find some other 3d
printed habitats um I'm very curious you
guys use the hashtag hey TD and tell us
if these things ever went on sale how
much you would pay for them and what
other kind of animal housing you think
should be 3d printed with using the same
technique you can always use that hey TD

your comments we'll incorporate them
into our long discussion on Thursday yes
