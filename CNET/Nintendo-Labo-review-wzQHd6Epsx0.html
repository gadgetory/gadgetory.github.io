part Lego part IKEA
it's a crazy new thing that Nintendo is
launching for the Nintendo switch that
allows you to make these accessories
that connect with it and I got to play
with this a few months ago with my son
what's it like to actually set up and
use there are two kits one is $70 and
there's a variety kit they let you make
five different things one is $80 and
just lets you make a robot backpack I
got both of them at CNET and we built
them and here's how they work first of
all they all start with lots of
cardboard sheets
a big part of labo is the make mode
where you construct everything out of
almost entirely cardboard it's
astonishing how Nintendo's clear
instructions and dozens of perfectly
perforated sheets of cardboard become a
variety of really clever switch
accessories it takes time though I built
the variety kits creations with my kids
and I took on the separately packaged
robot backpack by myself the robot kit
is a single four to five hour project
according to the Nintendo that took me
even longer kids under 10 should
definitely work on it with a parent the
variety kit has projects varying in
length a few extra pieces like plastic
Rawat's strings and rubber bands help
make mechanisms work all the creations
are powered by the joy con controllers
for motion vibration game controls and
every other smart function inside each
giant box you'll also get a game card
that has all the lab ou software on it a
big part of lab o is how it uses an
infrared camera and one joy con remote
to read reflective stickers that turn
them into actions but you have to be
careful with placing the stickers just
right the piano works like the robot in
that there are a little reflective
stickers on these keys that you jam in
here and then inside the infrared camera
on the joy con controller is reading
those in the dark and converting them to
sounds you pop them in and you have a
piano
toy Con House and other part of the
variety pack basically works like piano
it's got a dark space inside he uses the
infrared camera you pop it in and it
reads the inside and depending on what
you put in again these reflective
sticker coded things into it the camera
reads them and turns them into little
actions and you can combine them so you
could do maybe this and tap it out or
you could pop that out put in the crank
and twist that or put it on the bottom
and keep playing around with it all
sorts of weird combinations and play
with this virtual pet and I have no idea
what it does but my kid loves it fishing
is a complete little game that I haven't
even set up yet here but I got to use a
Nintendo's event the motorcycle
handlebars that you build have a variety
of racetracks that also allow you to
build your own tracks and then there's a
little RC car which is fun to play with
and is basically like a little bonus
pack in it's unclear how much more is
left to explore after one week but there
was still extra things I haven't
unlocked and the robot kit meanwhile has
various modes including time challenges
but it's mostly like a home version of
Pacific Rim meets starfox where you
control your own robot mech to knock
things down in various levels there's
also a way to estimate your calorie burn
it's crazily effective and it's a
strangely good workout but the backpack
needs a lot of adjustment on grown-up
shoulders like mine there's another
whole mode called discover that teaches
you how the parts of lab work and
advises on extra Easter eggs and
customizations you can try that I
haven't even unlocked yet and if you
want to go even deeper there's a toy con
garage mode that enables a whole type of
programming language that can remap
joique on controller inputs to do
different things like make one
controller vibrate if the others ir
camera sees a target
it could end up being a place where fan
groups cook up all sorts of ideas and
there's some extra projects hidden here
but it's going to be something that
younger kids are gonna find a little
harder to learn if you want to do more
you could always color in design lab Oh
which I didn't do but I'm sure lots of
people will just keep in mind intento
warns not to get the cardboard too wet
or it'll warp if you have $70 and a
Nintendo switch the toy con one variety
kit is a great Explorer pack for parents
and kids or lovers of weird accessories
the robot kit well that's more of a
specialist item I also worried about the
cardboard breaking down or ripping so
far it's been sturdy but I'm sure it's
going to happen the app has advice on
repairing and reinforcing the toy cons
but I don't know how easy it'll be to
order new cardboard or spare parts
hopefully not too difficult lab Oh feels
like a major step forward for Nintendo
as a toy company but it's not
necessarily something I'd recommend
anyone buying a switch just again
however if you have young kids it's a
pretty fantastic add-on experience for
switch owners</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
