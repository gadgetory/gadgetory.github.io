gotta go and talk about that like it's
yeah wait you're playing paintball this
weekend oh no okay your plane or your
bachelor party yes yes yeah among other
things yeah okay what else yeah where
are you going no just in general where
for paintball yeah somewhere in Long
Island I don't actually know any okay
sure can I take Jeff spot yes welcome
all right as long as someone makes a
fiasco we got a lot to talk about today
but we're gonna get right into it
there's a lot of stuff that's been on my
mind really important stuff yeah so
maybe we'll like save that for a little
later
a longer kind of thing okay so I once
talked about a little bit of like gaming
stuff okay real quick cuz I just want to
get this out there of course when
Justin's here we're gonna talk about
video games be it wouldn't be a 440 yeah
so so listen to this let me tell you
what the what these guys are doing so
both Sony and Microsoft all right you
know Xbox one and PlayStation 4
yeah those came out like three years
right yeah I'm familiar forget this dude
both of them are gonna be releasing like
integral sort of update machines okay
like so basically like an iPad air -
yeah like a you know enemy yeah well but
it's not it's like a equivalent of like
an expo xbox one point five and a
playstation 4.5 right so it's not a full
new console it's in the middle it's in
the middle it's like a step up but it's
an actual hardware yes okay and like
they're more powerful they're better on
paper better machines what are you think
of that but if you already own the Xbox
one or the ps4 then you probably don't
need to upgrade right so that's a thing
right so like for PlayStation they're
calling its codename neo as in Keanu
Reeves and that thing is going to have
games that played on it look better
mm-hmm and maybe perform a little better
maybe but they're not gonna be any
different hmm so like basically they're
saying like hey we're gonna make sure
all the PlayStation 4 games work yeah on
anything you play always that's what I
mean again this is all theory nothing's
been officially announced but the that's
what they're saying whether that
actually ends up being true is another
question I don't know it's interesting
do you feel like it it feels greedy or a
bad move for them I feel like with at
least when they do that with iPhones
that's a big point the people don't like
that too much because they're expecting
more of more features but they're also
doing that annually
yeah right that's true like this has
been for you I'm in it's been four years
it's been four years no hasn't it's been
it's 2013 is when they came out really
yeah okay three years better jacked for
bullet it's jacked if you expect a
console lifecycle to be as long as it
has been in the past I don't think it's
2013
really
look it up what is this because a lot of
the technology for the games that are
coming out in alligator or something
just aren't supported by ps4 because
that wasn't around when that console
came out cool whoever says this guy
doesn't know his yeah well it's exactly
right that's right yeah cuz you know
what Xbox doesn't have a VR answer the
way PlayStation does PlayStation is
having a VR thing so they're like
 the bed oh my god what do we do
we can't compete so they're basically
the rumor is that they're going after
oculus yeah and they're like hey oculus
look look at this SuperDuper Xbox 1.5
that we got in the hopper then caught
the call its codename Scorpio yeah and
neo and scorpion so that's so stupid
like who is who is in charge of the
Mandarin yeah right I was like dolphin
that's so they're like hey oculus you
know wouldn't you guys like to have more
oculus is out there wouldn't you like to
sell a couple million more rifts then
maybe you will right now we're like
people need to own a super duper gaming
PC to have one of the what if this new
Xbox one also played nice with the ah
yes so there try it the rumors are that
Microsoft is courting oculus and saying
hey let's get into bed together and work
on a partnership we go after psvr and
all that stuff who do you think came
first in terms of pushing this idea well
I don't know how polite what oh who do
you think came first in terms of pushing
the idea of doing this like mid that's a
good question so like who called who so
this is my my interpretation of it is
Sony doing so well in this generation
also saw that okay we have this
PlayStation VR coming out if you play
games on the PlayStation VR well some of
them look cool they essentially are like
ps2 or ps3 generation graphics because
it has to run twice at a certain frame
rate for it not to look terrible and not
to make people nauseous so the current
system as it exists the PlayStation can
just barely get VR going it works there
are games that work and they look okay
but it's not like in the way that you
play a vibe game it looks amazing right
it's not that so I kind of feel like
this a lot of this is like well we need
a VR
our experience that like looks
comparable for sure to there and also I
would say like seeing games like no
man's sky and stuff like that you're
starting to really push up against the
power of the PlayStation 4 and that
might be part of the reason might be
delayed but um demand sky which is
currently the rumor so this is like I
think they ran into a lot of hardware
issues and then the second that
Microsoft heard that Sony was doing this
so like we have no choice because if we
let them go they're off to the right
they're already ahead they're off to the
races it's not even a competition that's
what's crazy is like man you know so
much leaks out right or you're we
get a lot of stuff more so than ever I
feel like yeah where things are almost
guaranteed to leak out yeah but I think
that's just the tip of the iceberg oh
I'm sure we're you know and hopefully in
a couple weeks I'm actually like all of
a sudden now kind of excited about e3
cuz it's like there's I don't think
they're gonna announce yeah I think they
will here's the property you're gonna
touch on it they have to here's the
problem with announcing that stuff is
the second they announced it their sales
take a big hit of course and that's also
you know they're also talking about
releasing like a slim Xbox one which is
always the freaking case yeah I don't
know it we'll see how it all shakes out
I don't want spend too much time on that
stuff it just like Justin's here it's
super interesting but yeah good stuff
that's what's that
so let's okay so let's get into like
some some drama okay so my journalism
free speech open media drama that panned
out that this story has not been getting
the mainstream attention than I thought
it was it's got an Internet attention
sure but like only in I don't know New
York Times covered it yeah pretty
extensively I think it's getting the
story's been happening it's been going
on for like three years now for four
years I think that tape came out in like
2012 right right yeah but so there's a
new generation cycle yeah so talk about
this Gosselaar the whole thing sure so
Gawker very top line so Hulk Hogan sued
Gawker because of the sex tape and
Gawker published it and that's somehow
pause on that
you haven't seen that I have no idea
like that yeah that does not first of
all he makes several mentions of the
Mane's of the woman's wife the I'm sorry
the husband of the woman that he's
correct no he's in the room next door
okay yes shopping for auto parts on his
computer because you're gonna hear him
talking about it through the wall dad
and this guy's name is Bubba the Love
Sponge yeah he changed legally changed
it because he's on the radio right ready
changed it to Bubba the Love Sponge yes
so that name gets mentioned a few times
in coitus which is hilarious but the
best part about that video is about
halfway through cuz it's a long one - he
does a good job halfway through he
starts talking about how fat he feels
because he just finished a huge sushi
dinner I can't believe I just ate like a
pig just two hours ago you don't hang a
platter of sushi he talks about how he
ate an entire party platter full of is
that like a boar thing like people like
eating yeah it's so yeah that's such a
weird day off with vomit yeah we should
say this is not really what we were
looking to talk about so anyway this
this trial happens in a pretty hostile
environment it was in Hulk Hogan's
essentially his neighborhood where the
trial was held and wait one last thing
about the sex tape the best part is that
you could see Hulk Hogan's speedo ten
like really very clearly you could
always see that yeah yeah that was kind
of there I remember there was a match
where like he's been in that coffin for
a while yeah Gawker loses this case it's
in you know essentially against them and
I believe were charged with paying 150
million dollars in damages which is a
staggering amount of money for a meet
internet media company for an idiot yeah
I mean it's a it would be
enough to pay that amount it be enough
to seriously basically distribute them
out of his daughter so recently in this
last week it came out that Peter Thiel
isn't teal or peel um he spelled Theo a
Mia might be pronounced differently but
it's spelled feel now explain his
background so he is a hedge fund manager
entrepreneur cetera he invested $500,000
in Facebook very early on and as you can
imagine is worth a little bit more than
five thousand dollars today quite a bit
more so he's his net worth is 2.8
billion dollars according to Forbes so
is he the one curating Facebook stories
no he doesn't work for Facebook he he
founded PayPal so he founded a thing
called the founders fund which again is
an investment company and but going back
in I believe it was 2007 Gawker
published a story which essentially
outed him as gay the whole I mean litter
deal because out it is gay soon this
Gawker story okay it was sort of as the
story is written it's sort of like an
open secret within Silicon Valley but he
certainly wasn't publicly out until this
story came out now again it's worth
noting that like there is including the
Hulk Hogan thing included a sizable
chunk of quasi ethical you know things
that unethical things that yes soccer
has posted and written about right so I
mean how you feel about it right that
they are in in in many circles
considered to be unethical
well they the crux the crux of the case
was that Gawker is like doing damaging
not newsworthy work to individuals that
don't deserve it essentially and and
just I would say it was probably a year
ago someone in New York City was outed
he was like a CFO of a company it was
like a really heartbreaking a really
very sad story and Gawker actually I
believe retracted it or published
apology or something like that
so they have there's certainly been
stories they pissed they also do good
work but like they have a reputation
especially Gawker prime and so this is
all stuff to keep in the back your mind
when you learn that
Peter Thiel again ten years ago he was
outed it turns out that he has secretly
been funding Hulk Hogan's case against
Gawker I believe gave them ten million
dollars to invite them to fight to pay
for the legal fees in Gawker's case no
that's that's scandalous but not illegal
right yeah a legal fees all the time
you're completely right so the ACLU it
exists to pay people's legal fees to
fight for things that they believe in
obviously it's just an interesting story
because this isn't an individual it's
not an organization and it obviously
brings up the idea of like okay so in
this case people could say sure you know
he was wronged by Gawker by being outed
and this is his way of sort of getting
back at them and but what to say it's a
case whatever a case of super racist
people and a super racist guy comes out
and supports their legal you know what I
mean
but these are like the the the it sort
of to make yeah is that and then the
takeaway and the thing that people are
all really kind of upset about yeah is
the fact that like this is a situation
where someone of great wealth right can
directly sort of manhandle a a media
company that they may or may not
disagree with right through these sort
of like back-channel means or an
individual I mean that's your right so
it's whether it's a company or an
individual and this is not news but
anyone with a lot of money has major has
a major advantage and the legal system
just because they can hire the best
lawyers and they could string out cases
for years and years and years and this
is but this is such a crazy example of
that because it is as you said could
potentially destroy a media company and
this is one guy throwing his financial
might behind it and it's like 10 million
dollars out of 2.8 billion dollars is
like nothing drop in this bucket like he
would I'm sure spend way more happen on
a weekend it's like what else are you
gonna spend some money I guess so we're
like so what does it all mean right
like yeah and I said it like them as a
bitch yeah yeah I guess so but what is
it like cuz cuz you understand what
we're saying right like does that give
anyone the right to totally go after and
essentially and threaten the the
livelihood of a corporation because they
don't agree with something I mean I
understood like it's also not right for
anybody to get outed before they're
ready to come out themselves
yes yeah but like you have to also think
about like you know free speech and Free
Press and but but according to the law
of speech is money like money that's why
this is the United thing and and you
know all the campaign finance stuff is
so hard to stop right it's because the
law says that you can you have the
freedom to get your opinion out there or
to give your money to other people to
get your opinion out there that's
legally fine so what so what how do you
think this changes the game like I think
it all it does is is highlight how
potentially unfair things are and again
I'm not saying that I mean this isn't
that's currently in the system that's
currently in place and I'm not saying
that this is an issue where like like I
agree with Justin that he was wrong so
like he should not have been outed in
the piece and you know but I think most
people would agree with like oh you
shouldn't just ruin someone's life right
regardless of what the information is
like I'm not saying someone coming out
of the closet would ruin someone's life
but like it's their Chow if there's
something in the public interest right
if you're if you're running for
president and you're campaigning against
gay rights and it turns out you're gay
that's in the public interests people
should only but like for unsolicited
sort of like gotcha rights just
like the way they did to the Hearst CEO
guy yes such a fucked-up story like I
couldn't believe what they did to this
poor guy yeah but then people don't talk
about how celebrities get you know no
they'll get lies printed about that
magazine I think it's just because in
this case Peter Thiel isn't hasn't
deserved it in our eyes because he's not
a celebrity and that's another sort of
element to the whole equation right
where you know the argument by the
team's use of the world is like well
they're public figures yeah
you know like they are a notable person
and I also think those publications
would say that if you're reading it on
TMZ or the National Enquirer then
there's maybe some assumption that the
reader thinks that you know maybe this
story isn't a hundred percent fact check
right where it's like not the most
sourced and right exactly whereas dis
Gawker have that kind of reputation I'm
not sure I feel like people read Gawker
and just believe what I'll tell you what
people can read TMZ like that yeah I
know might be giving people too much
credit i I have this weird kind of
relationship with TMZ I don't read it
only like ever maybe three times a year
I find I wind up on Asscher TMZ site and
but the vibe I get from them is that
like yet actually do you really do a lot
of research and like kind of back stuff
up and get source stuff like I don't
know the stuff I've seen where it's like
I mean they're not doing bat boy stories
that's I'm saying like they're not
they're obviously a tabloid but they're
not like a sensational they are they are
yeah
do you understand what I'm saying we're
like they they source stuff more than I
thought they would I mean I would say
they source stuff as much as Us Weekly
does which is just like a friend of the
star said okay fine fine fine I'll I'll
bet all backpedal a little bit and I'll
just say like man they break a lot of
 well but okay but this a break
Sherlock I think the reason that you
find yourself on TMZ is I would agree
with you maybe two or three times a year
they have this crazy stat there was a
story about mean they broke prints done
right don't Michael Jackson sure I think
they did they break a lot I would say I
don't think they're exclusively known
for that stuff but you're right they do
have such a massive network of like
investigative spiders my spider exactly
who the 30-mile zone
so it yeah I agree with you I don't know
we've gotten kind of out track with TMZ
but we have it's it's an interesting
story and I think it's interesting
oh it does this is bring to light how
much power someone could potentially
have over a legal system and I think the
other big thing to that's super
important that people need to understand
as what kind of fallout this causes is
like yeah right fine so nothing maybe
changes on the surface but think about
it like now there's
this quasi precedent that's been set
where maybe a free press corporations
not as aggressively pursuing something
that maybe they should be over fear of
retaliation where you know they would
not be doing that great kind of
journalism going after somebody or not
maybe going after somebody but going
after a story that they would be they
would be fearful that some entity could
come back and put them out of it yeah
it's weird though cuz like again it's
clear that Gawker did not do due
diligence from a story perspective
specifically Peter like I read the pier
Theo
outing story and like it was not like a
well researched or thoughtful piece I
mean but was like that guy's gay know
the core of the story ironically enough
was about how the the VC world which is
not based in Silicon Valley it's in
Menlo Park and is is very against or at
the time was against was very homophobic
well that's like Harry
so that was the crux of the story was
that like it's ridiculous that all these
guys which are like they described them
as like a jockey Freddy kind of crew cuz
essentially their investment bankers
were not really giving proper attention
to you know gays and and what-have-you
were having a difficult a more difficult
time getting stuff funded there and he
was gay he was presented as an example
of like hey this guy who is let's face
it gay yeah is found as starting his own
investment firm and so it's sort of a
next generation so it wasn't even like a
like screw this guy he's gay Dori it was
like a side it was a story I mean the
but the headline of story was like let's
face it Peter fuels gay oh so like
alright well look it's it's I would not
be proud if I was attached to that story
and again Gawker's done some good work
too it's just it's it's a very
complicated and interesting I find it
super interesting but I would also say
like it is also on the it's the burden
on the media to ensure that due
diligence has happened in the sense that
like this needs to be in the public
interest this needs to have a purpose
beyond ruining someone's life or what
ever and so if you're looking to go the
easy route SP nation I've worked for Vox
media SB Nation a few months ago had it
very similar issue where a post was put
up and not well researched and and and
really up but came out and I could white
and and the post was taken down and and
SB Nation apologized then the guy was
fired and you know I think it's
important to hold media to those high
standards but also know that like
someone could stop in there and really
muck up someone's story if they really
want to yeah it's interesting do you
think Gawker will be a website after
this whole a lawsuit is over the rumor
is they're looking to sell yeah that's
what it doesn't surprise me
yeah obviously that would make sense so
so if they sold how does that play out
do they stay afloat I mean they could
sell individual verticals potentially
and make enough money to sort of support
themselves that way the issue I think
for a lot of people is that the brand is
pretty tainted right but there's also a
huge audience for that kind of content
and and the reason they've developed
such a huge audience is because their
standards for what they would and would
not publish were different than a lot of
other media companies yeah so love it or
hate it it's popular yeah
alright that was that was a good that
was a good talk yeah that wasn't that
was educational and insightful and a
peek into the shadowy world of online
journalism yeah and Hulk Hogan's
Underpants is what that was in sushi
meal and sushi how did they find out
that Peter Thiel was behind it so there
was a rumor initially oh so there was
like rumors that he there was some
secret funding cuz that you know you
know the lawyers at Hulk Hogan is is
bringing in you know how much they cost
you know how much he's worth he probably
couldn't afford himself so there has to
be some sort of funding Nick Denton
actually said before it officially came
out Nick Denton said like you know I'm
very suspicious that he owns Gawker I'm
very suspicious that there's someone
behind the scenes pulling the strings I
don't know for sure at that time he knew
who was he didn't come and say like this
guy's getting help right well he said
he's
yeah he said this guy's getting help he
didn't say oh it's Peter Thiel right
whether he knew or not is up in the air
Oh obviously he's like how many people
but so yeah they knew and then and then
so the story was bouncing around and
then he a field just came out and
admitted it he was like yep it's me yeah
that takes a lot of balls to just come
and be like yeah it was me
well I mean I think yeah it's
interesting it does but you know if you
have 2.8 billion dollars I don't think
he's worried about balls or not you know
what like why do we put billionaires in
this category of what of like god no
it's not that it's it's that he at a
certain point you stop looking you start
looking at the world I think in a very
different light I understand like a
human light I think it's been painfully
obvious especially as of late yeah that
like we idolize people with so much
money I wouldn't I mean idolize
sometimes in a negative and a positive
light I guess so like my evil mortgage
Corelli obviously not well-received sure
but like you know just look at the
people who have like so much money they
essentially transcend reality yeah do
you know what I mean yeah and I just
like not all of them are smart not all
of them are good sure you look at like
some investors who've made billions is
like all right yeah you know maybe you
just got right place right time and
that's that yeah I don't know I just
think like we really just worshipped
that kind of mentality more than maybe
we should yeah we don't even ask
questions we're just like oh that guy's
worth eight billion dollars so he knows
what's up there's the Elon Musk's of the
world where it's like no he's important
we need him right and there's some other
jackasses around was like no F that guy
you know that guy's bad but and then you
look at like Warren Buffett who like
lives in a small house in the middle of
the Midwest and it's worth billions upon
billions of dollars and clearly is a
very smart investor very successful but
like generally the way he comports
himself is like a very professional like
pretty thoughtful right guy so it kind
of I would I wouldn't paint it with a
broad brush
I think the
billionaires there I'm sure there are a
lot of billionaires that like you don't
hear about because they're not cool also
assholes or we're pulling the strings
but you know and then there's boat you
know Bill Gates does nice stuff with his
money
oh I'm not again not trying to paint
with these broad strokes like you said
but there are you know it's it's it's I
think everyone just needs to like vet it
a little more think yeah yeah be better
when we make our first billion well let
me see what do you mean when you check
this weekend ok let's talk about this
Tesla thing you're bringing up ok yeah
so I was I wrote this story when it
first broke earlier this week but we
didn't actually publish it on CNET
because we weren't sure whether or not
this video that surfaced was actually
real ok and so I wanted to show you guys
to see what you think because it's kind
of an interesting story but so you wrote
the whole story I wrote the whole story
and then some other editors that work in
our car vertical looked at it and was
like ya know this could be faked ok
because there's a tech angle behind it
so earlier I think I was on Tuesday
there was a gift that was posted to
Reddit of a driver behind the wheel of a
Tesla Model S and that's rich version as
that is the more expensive ok yeah
driving behind the wheel of a Tesla
Model S sleeping sure letting the
autopilot feature do the driving for him
yeah down the freeway kind of like in
not stop and go not completely stop
traffic but pretty slow ok so it's not
like he's zooming down the freeway at 60
miles stop and go traffic it's pretty
slow yeah and this guy is just in the
front seat mouth open totally sleeping
so how do you prove whether this is fake
or not well ok so the way that specimens
work is that there's this dashboard that
giant dashboard that's in front of you
all the time while you're driving right
and Elon Musk actually 2 years ago said
himself that nobody should be falling
asleep behind the wheel of a Tesla
because it's not fully autonomous yet a
lot of times it'll take into
consideration you know certain cars
around you but it won't read signs
sure so if you need to make an exit or
something like that you got to be aware
and they recommend you always actually
keep one hand on the wheel yeah now if a
lot of times they'll also need your
approval to do things like change lanes
or
things like that though there's human
interaction with the dashboard and if it
prompts you for a question and you don't
answer it then it'll start beeping okay
and that's to assume yeah you're asleep
you're asleep and it needs to wake you
up
now people are claiming this video is
fake because the sound emitted is loud
enough to where somebody would wake up
so unless this guy was straight-up
passed out or something like that
or dead he could be doing like a burny
but most people just think that it might
be fake and definitely not on behalf of
Tesla because although it might seem
like it would be the greatest marketing
stunt of all time I don't think they'd
ever actually put their their
commercials behind that yeah I was
listening to a podcast the other day at
least you guys are talking about the
autonomous autopilot feature oh yeah
Tesla and I forget the context but when
I was like music man have you ever taken
your hands off the wheel on a Tesla yeah
they say like the fact that like you
need to try it you know anymore it's
like you have I give us that cool i
given live you haven't seen the future
sure and apparently and he was going on
about like yeah that thing could
basically drive yeah get in the back
seat yeah it looks in this traffic that
he's in it looks like he's not changing
lanes this looks like very it looks like
manageable traffic simple counters right
sure yeah but there's been a lot of
stories recently about Tesla's actually
crashing so it's a it's a real
possibility that this guy is putting
other people in the freeway in danger
sure maybe not at a high speed rate but
you know it's possible for him to get
into a fender bender actually later on
in the week there was a rack xual real
story that was published actually I
wanted to show you guys this gift of so
this shows a sort of a dashcam of a
Tesla crashing into the back of a car
because on the freeway this car has
stopped in an emergency in front of him
now the Tesla was actually tracking this
other station wagon that you see pass
around the front of the car that's
parked in front of him and so it didn't
see that van in front of the car that it
was tracking that's one problem with
autonomous vehicles where you actually
need human foresight to most of you
ahead of what you're the cars works I
mean weird that it did not recognize it
should like that to me is like know that
something that is not totally uncommon
right right people are idiots and cars
die all the time right and they stop in
the middle of everywhere and you just
got to be you know you're having your
head on a swivel I'm surprised to test
we're not really there yet I think
everyone kind of jumped to this idea I
was like oh my god we've been waiting
for so long you know we can you know
pull our Jetsons and just shave in the
car but that's really not what's
happening yet I'm with you we're not
there yet
but at the same time autonomous cars
have tens of millions of miles already
driven for sure and the in the more and
like the death is rate as zero right
there the Google car has at Gao
accidents one was human intervals right
one was a 2 mile an hour fender bender
right okay yeah you know oh I trust
robots way more than human yes I read
that way for a lot of autonomous cars
the problem is um since other drivers
human drivers you know that those cars
will be sort of giving leeway humans
they'll actually take advantage of
knowing they'll always get the
right-of-way so funny and that's another
thing like I don't think there's gonna
be like this transitional time we're
like half the cars in the world are
autonomous and half are human like how
could that be a thing uh yeah that'll
happen yeah sure I mean aren't we like
halfway there now uh I don't know I
think we're so a lot of cars now like my
dad just got a new caddy and it's like
it's a lot of these cars are like all
about accident prevention sure not
autonomous driving but accident
prevention where it's like hit the seat
will vibrate if you yeah veer out of
lane yeah stuff like that I you're right
we're not there yet in the sense that
like this will all get held up by like
legislation right like we the technology
is here where the cars are really smart
and they do a lot of amazing autonomous
stuff but like you're gonna need to have
a world where the entire Department of
Transportation and the infrastructure
built within that needs to be updated to
support robots do you know any me yeah
laughs and that
and that's a place where we're not at
yet I mean that's something that's gonna
take for ever right forever you know I
think I think the idea of like people
being on highways and it being
relatively relatively autonomous is not
that far off from like cruise control
yeah okay fine highways you yeah I'm not
fine I'll give you a highway so what
you're saying is but that's not like fir
actually autonomous like you never would
never have to touch anything you're
carving right in there that I mean I
think there'll be time in the future
well maybe we'll have a lane on the
freeway that's only for autonomous cars
yeah I've heard that it won't be like a
street right aren't there like the
Google cars do that so like they do that
right now what Google cars can
essentially drive themselves I believe
so go bike but again like only being
tested in certain cities there's not a
lot of transparency like you read the
headlines where check this Google car
saved a kitten they are like wow you
know there's not enough of a report out
anywhere like you get these data points
and you get these other things but like
right I really understand it but you
know that the idea of like it's
definitely gonna happen where there's
gonna be humans and autonomous cars yeah
because let's say like eventually you
agree that there's gonna be a moment
where there are autonomous cars they're
not gonna take it's like good taking
guns away from people in America they're
not gonna take like your dad's Chevy
away from him he's a caddy
whatever same diff that's a big deal you
you're not allowed to drive a car
anymore right do you think they'll be
like this grandfather thing we're like
yes you fine you want to keep driving
that an analog death machine you know
for and there's an attacks or whatever
on up with like having full control over
your car imagine you got to pay more you
want a driver's license that's that's a
thousand bucks yeah fine with me save it
for the video good I'm fine with that
don't you want to keep driving oh no no
I'm fine with charging people if it gets
to the point where autonomous driving
prevents 99.9% of accidents behind them
it's ready it's yes so it'll happen so
anyone that doesn't want to do that
should be charged some sort of
government right yeah yeah I guess and
if you get into an accident then you're
100% liable Briana well yeah well that's
Robo insurance
there's gonna be rolling chance in the
future did you guys speaking of Google
cars did you guys read that story about
I think it was in Philadelphia there was
a Google Maps car with the stickers on
the side like her backers posted on the
side that actually was exposed as an
undercover cop undercover police
officers are using Google map marked
cars that's funny as smart covers smart
I mean you see that in this video all
the time all right well because you
would you you don't pay the attention
you pay to the Google Maps car is now
well it depends on what neighborhood
your head let's say you're dealing drugs
and you see a Google Maps car kind of
like show on the corner selling drugs
are you gonna maybe wait for now I
didn't have that camera turret on top of
it yeah yeah which kind of would seem
more I need back but a little bit
because just show me like oh yeah it's
not like the vinyl wrap that though not
even that good and Google came out was
like this is not okay not in partnership
with you guys yeah it's actually a
Frenchman yeah although one time when I
was in the city so everyone knows oh
well maybe not everyone but if you come
to New York a lot of times the yellow
cab that you see will actually be cop
cars and cover and sometimes you'll just
see a yellow cab and all of a sudden the
lights will go off inside the car where
the siren it's not the Cash Cab
no it's police you're under here under
arrest but they also one time when I was
walking with my friend I saw an uber car
with the placard inside you know how
they have it on the dashboard right
underneath the windshield I saw an uber
car also have those flashing lights
internally so they're definitely using
that too and I googled it no stories
have covered the uber Undercovers so
watch out but that you break that once
you break that yeah I didn't get a
video of it or moto really understanding
like how is that better than just being
a normal car like why do you need the
Google icon is like what does that
connect
I think cuz it's it's ok for a car like
that to just be idle on the street you
know if you saw an uber car park
somewhere
okay that's fine I could show okay while
he's waiting for a picture yeah that's
that's funny
but it depends on what neighborhood
you're in if you're in a Google car in a
bad neighborhood and maybe people will
be like this guy yeah that's pretty good
so I got I got to a conversation with uh
with Vinny from Giant Bomb I don't know
how this happened
and it's definitely making a left turn
here but like you have some weird
conversation with people in the office
by the way oh I walked into the kitchen
the other day and we had like a
20-minute conversation that I had jumped
into you guys were already talking about
this yeah about fart about farts yeah in
the office well yeah that's the thing
who was well everyone can relate in
the kitchen gives fart theory it was
fart theory okay trying to identify
farts based on smell no no nothing like
that was more like the the science a
little bit okay I like understanding
digest is really here you know it wasn't
like a it wasn't like a kindergarten
conversation okay there were moments
theorem oh okay all right
so what conversation were you having
this time and this is something that I
think about a lot and I've never we've
never vocalized it it's the whole like
kiss on the cheek hug or a handshake
thing okay so so Vinny from Johnny bond
was like ask me as like so when when do
you go in for the kiss on the cheek
because we've been having a thing on
that show where like we we send out a
kiss on the cheek through the airwaves
of the podcast that's very nice like a
kiss on the cheek okay okay looks nice
but in reality like where do you draw
the line when does that happen
so then we were like creating scenarios
with each other where it's like okay you
are at a bar yeah and a friend of yours
brings their significant other and how
long how long have you known them that's
the thing like how long have you known
the friend right how what kind of night
did you have at the bar with the with
the significant other wasn't like what
was okay nice because all that pleased
all that you know please into the
calculate no variables involved setting
that stuff up I would say and it's the
first time I'm meeting the significant
other and and it's a female yeah I'm
gonna say just for
easy so the first time I meet them
handshake at the beginning of the night
right hey hi hey nice to meet you Ross
how are you Danya end of the night
assuming things went normally not even
like gangbusters great or not hook hook
okay so I think his logic is like a real
road bike that's down the road I think
yeah chic I've done kisses on the cheek
on the first meeting whoa Wow yeah but
were you in Miami but they're contextual
yeah the kiss on the cheek only shows up
if it was like such a fabulous first
impression
we're like the night is great and we
were laughing and everyone's getting I
mean that's Oh at all I would if I yeah
I don't know man that's one we're
talking about one kiss on the cheek not
like a double double would almost be
best cuz it's like a double is like an
accepted greeting yes that's like
computers kissing a Greek person I'm
gonna be honest with you yeah I think
it's contextual I think like I don't
keep that you can you can escalate to
that level and and and I've had it
reciprocated not like where it's like oh
I didn't wasn't expecting a kiss on the
cheek but like where someone reciprocate
and it's like a mutual kiss on cheek and
it's like a WoW okay so do you actually
put lips to cheat or are you kissing
great point and if your cheek kissing do
you make that mwah right great point
there are many subtle levels there are
and what do those mean because sometimes
it's just like hey let's touch ears
yes like that we're like you're touching
perfect greeting but sometimes it's also
like let's touch cheeks but not kiss and
then sometimes it's like oh I want to
lay a fat one on your cheek cuz you're
like my that's gotta be a really you
know really good
yeah real old friend and I haven't seen
in a while I love you that kind of thing
do you so let me ask you another thing
do you any of your friends your male
friends kiss you on the cheek no no see
I have that a lot I met your friends
nothing's wrong with that though
actually I find it in dear that's
vegetable yeah like kind of like a
Goodfellas thing they do that in
Goodfellas don't say I'm not gonna like
directly related equate it to like a mob
yeah but there are a few a is when you
do it though hey I'm sure the reason
you're not I don't think your blood
brother is with these people now I think
a lot of it too is like so like all my
friends dads yeah like if I see my
friend's dad I haven't seen them while
gives you kiss on the cheek
what yeah that's not what I want say
weird cuz culture and all that stuff but
like that is not an experience I am
familiar with yeah I have friends
under the right circumstances yeah a
wedding okay where it's like a so age
it's gonna escalate it's like my friend
yes note on the not on the lips but of
real she kiss real cheek guys yeah on
the on the cheek you guys look like the
two worst dudes to kiss on the cheek you
guys that well that scruff on there a
little course we could start it up is
that what this whole conversation is
about you just wanting to us us to kiss
you on the cheek
nudity not only that I know I'm not
trying to like bring the kisses on the
cheek back yeah I'm not trying to do
that do you think it's an so it's a
generational thing I don't know what it
is I just find it fascinating cuz like
Vinny was saying he's like so yeah who
do you kiss on the cheek yeah cuz like
kissing on the cheek like I said it's
become kind of a joke on that show
mm-hmm and I was like yeah there are a
very specific set of rules that I
internally have for that that they are
on autopilot they get activated by
themselves I don't I don't go into a hug
with someone I'm gonna kiss this bouquet
here's my question it's kind of a dumb
question but right or left do you go to
your left
it's to the right the person I'm hugging
they aren't on my right like their head
will be embraced okay right okay so
follow-up question disaster scenario
you're both thinking the same thing no
that's that yeah never happens if you're
both thinking right shoulder you'll go
in just fine okay but let's say she kiss
at the same time right then you go you
fail turn the same tour
facing each other okay I have a couple
yeah sure it happens every now that okay
well usually does like that thing
quickly corrected okay where it's like
up round check where no problem right
yeah easy
good okay sometimes it gets awkward you
just have to make out right like
actually going for it look we're this
far tongue yeah I find that my
girlfriend really really enjoys watching
me either
hey I like see someone for the first
time that I haven't seen in a while or
meet somebody that had never met before
because for some reason she gets a kick
out of dudes deciding whether or not to
handshake high-five or like cool guy
Hinch okay cool cool guy hug yeah which
is like the arm in between I'm hugging
you but I'm hitting you yeah yeah I got
another one for you that happened to me
not this morning yeah okay yeah awkward
handshake
so here's situation so I've been going
to dermatologists a lot lately
yep the guy as you may know and I had a
little follow-up today and woman's very
nice very nice woman this is that there
dermatologist yeah guys woman and we
know each other by now I've seen her
like almost eight to ten times Cheryl
last couple months uh and we you know we
ended the meeting today and she kind of
like she kind of like put her hand up
for a high five yeah shake well Jeff is
great seeing you
I'm like YouTube you're cool like you
hugged before no never like any kind of
McConaughey that's the handshake
handshake yeah so she like put her hand
up for like hey it's Friday Simon you
know that kinda yeah yeah and I was just
like I was like oh okay
sorry I slapped it sure but then I still
like shook her head right effort yeah
this is like yeah we're doing the
high-five because it's like Memorial Day
weekend yeah like alright let's get out
of here okay move professional yeah you
ever shake somebody's hand when they
weren't offering it to you before with
somebody in the office that tell you who
it is after the show's over this person
came up to me one time when I was
sitting at the desk I was at before yeah
and I think he wanted printer advice and
he came up to me was like hey what's up
how's it going and like just went like
like kind of just made a gesture with
your hand like this but it to me it
looked like he was offering his hand
sure so I just grabbed it
hey I just grabbed it was like kind of
sugars like hey what's up bit and then
you could tell I knew immediately that
it wasn't these because he was like oh
thank you it's like oh oh oh oh thank
you very much every cut it's like shook
for a second but I was like no this is
way too formal for what you're trying to
ask me and I was embarrassed and from
then from then on whenever I watch like
a like a late-night talk show or an
interview on TV I'm always like that's
on a handshake alright I gotta I gotta
watch out for that now cuz it's my first
instinct it's just it's not leave
somebody hanging you don't want to get
caught up in it we've always we've all
been there before
yeah I hate to put someone in that
position so I got a watch out to do it
prematurely and then like the handshake
that goes on for too long yeah yesterday
Oh what is wrong with those feet with a
guy in here and he was like I'm like
we're going up and down I'm like we
gonna are we going out together yeah
when you have to throw their hand down
at the bottom of now that they're
talking about cheek kissing when I was
dating and this is again many years ago
probably six seven years ago when I was
dating at the end of a particularly good
date of someone that I could see myself
dating for a longer period of time um I
do this move which is you know we're
getting to the point where we're gonna
say goodbye whatever I'd do this I'd
point to my cheek in like a when Tommy
yeah and it was always well received
okay get the kiss because it's like it
gets rid of the pressure of like oh
we're gonna maybe kiss now that's too
fast for some people they don't want to
kiss on the first date and so this is
like it's kind of my part what can I say
and on their part you know it kind of
gives them all the power even though
it's an alpha move on my part do you do
say anything do you vocalize the little
mumble
I posed like look away yes never
complete sin it's like hey kiss me on
the cheek right now yeah I don't miss
that's good that's a great tip for every
single yeah if you're single out there
give it a shot
it shows that you're very polite works
for women too I think I would love that
yeah it was like hey I think for a lot
of it it's like the you can't really go
wrong with the hug with the friendly hug
yeah especially of you know when it's
the situation allows it I think most
situations allow the buddy hug I would
say unlike unless it's the very first
time you're meeting someone and we're in
in which case a hug is weird even again
meeting that unless it's like unless
it's like your best friend's wife that
you've ever met fine fine oh I'm kissing
that person I mean never to bring pee
around kissing my girl I've given her
hug I'm not sure I've given her the kiss
on the cheek lips do so I know where
we're going I'm just saying it's a thing
it's a thing that I think about creepy
that you're planning this all out to
well obviously I'm not doing it perhaps
maybe making mental notes about it
occurred to me like oh no not only do I
have like a very specific set of rules
for that but it's like yeah I can tell
you yeah maybe I kiss more than I should
do you guys have any friends that are
uncomfortable with physical contact even
with friends mm-hmm I have one friend
who and I always forget that she's like
this but she I could tell she kind of
like tenses up every time I was
expecting it so I always like kind of
come in and then like oh wait sorry it's
very awkward yeah I don't know people
like now I've seen it I don't know them
I don't know a lot of people like that
person ever then yeah I 5 yeah yeah
we're like elbow bump gloved I have a
male friend who refuses the bananas in
public God he just pictures himself from
the side corn yes
so when Stacey and I were going out
early on we were friends with this other
couple and the girl in the couple would
always give me the kiss on the cheek to
say goodbye was behind it was
reciprocated and Stacey would kiss the
guy too but like she would kiss too
close to the mouth oh where oh it was
basically always vertical you know what
that reads as is like she was protesting
a swap situation I don't know if we're
gonna go that far I never bite into it
I mean I even as the juvenile it's so
much cheek area there's no reason you
would ever get that close unless you
intentionally were going that close I
mean maybe she just wanted to get close
maybe that was it Stacey always like
kind of brushed it off but deep down I
think it bothered she start getting
closer to his man this is why you don't
do that I don't know I always to me
Italian and here's and here's another
thing I do have a lot of time that hid
my bed and here's the other thing okay
you can never go wrong with turning a
hug into the kiss like don't be scared
to go for that hug i but then that hugs
yeah like I'm not saying you're not
gonna go into the hug chair and then
come out with a kiss but maybe that hug
whilst embracing will come anytime you
could be like you know why it's risky
because it's an it's a tacit agreement
between the two people so what if you go
in for a kiss and the other person
doesn't kiss her on the cheek then
you've just kissed a person on the cheek
that's happened to me no no then maybe
next time you'll get it back yeah you
know me for me it's like not I'm just
gonna hug this person yeah maybe maybe
maybe like there are dozens of people
who know me who are like oh this guy
sucks Yeah right please stop already
with me on the cheek yeah guy girl
doesn't matter it's getting close to my
mouth too intimate
all right I want to know what you think
eight six six four four seen it this is
something everyone definitely has an
opinion on yeah yeah so leave us a
voicemail
and the people you see on Memorial Day
think about it right now don't think
about it going into it cuz it a little
 you all up and then you might wind
up kissing someone on the mouth you
don't want to do that no for me well no
you can get a disease from a kiss on the
cheek right not that I'm aware of but I
wasn't thinking about going down that
ankle I feel like the only scientific
way to do this is to kiss exclusively
kiss everyone that you meet on the cheek
and or exclusively don't do that oh yeah
yeah I think you know also let the
person lead you a little bit just like
in dancing okay I can like say like oh
maybe we'll see what how this person
wants yeah you can let get in because I
think the hug is by default you go in
your hug maybe it's either way the worst
of sorts that can happen with you and
then you do one of these like and then
kiss that see that would prompt the kiss
yeah people that do that too the
preamble to the hair because like if
there's I like that there's drinks
involved
yeah bit a little looser yeah come on
now point first
hey keep those close friends yeah let me
just say it tell everyone something give
those close friends that peck on the
cheek they'll appreciate if they're a
close friend they'll appreciate
especially for the key party a key party
yet with that Jesus wait what you don't
know what that is no I've never heard of
a key party where everyone like puts
their keys in a bowl oh oh no one's ever
been to that that's just like though
yeah it happened yeah in the 70s man why
we need them bring it all back that's
gonna do it for us guys thanks so much
for tuning in hope you had fun today
always fun with Justin you follow them
on twitter at malice Brutus and read all
the stuff on the C net yeah because I
know you like doing that that's right

this week Russ I just reviewed over
watch something interest I believe it
was an 8 nice out of 10
I agree with that number okay good job

words that support interests
come on people only care about that
score yeah so you can check that out on
polygon I've been doing a lot of live
streaming on polygons Facebook page if
you want to check that out just streams
a terrible TMNT game and yeah that's
it's a top one alright cool we're gonna
be doing a lot of Facebook live stuff if
you haven't already noticed on CNET I'm
gonna be dipping my toes into that next
week so there's something to look
forward to there if you forgot what I
look like anything else Justin I think
that's gonna do it thanks for having me
