was mocked for its oversized proportions
but looking at the devices of today it's
clear that Samsung was onto something as
we prepared for the 4th galaxy notes
here's how Samsung changed the
smartphone status quo
in 2007 the iPhone set the template for
what a smartphone should look like fast
forward to 2014 and only one thing has
really changed the size there's one
gadget that's more than any other is
responsible for sparking the big screen
revolution and it was first pulled from
the pockets of a Samsung executive in
September 2011 ladies and gentlemen here
is chemic snort today it just looks like
a normal sized mobile but at the time
Samsung claimed the Galaxy Note was a
whole new category not quite a tablet
but more than a smartphone such details
went way over our heads however we were
too busy asking questions about the
notes bizarre size whilst the 5.3 inch
screen really practical would it fit in
your pockets and would using it make you
look ridiculous the note has several
tricks up its massive sleeves however
including a powerful processor a quirky
stylus and doodling apps as well as a
battling Li simple its Galaxy Note 2
slogan that got the name stuck in
shoppers minds wonder how they came up
with that one it's not a fun it's not a
it's Galaxy Note yes its Galaxy Note not
to boast but I was actually in the room
when the Galaxy Note was revealed and
like a lot of people I wasn't convinced
maybe it would find a niche audience but
the consensus was that it was just too
weird to be a bonafide hit the consensus
however was wrong before the end of the
year Samsung revealed it had shipped 1
million galaxy notes a figure that would
rise to 10 million 9 months after launch
rivals quickly cottoned on and over the
next few years
smartphones ballooned in size a change
that even Apple couldn't ignore
in 2012 revealing the 4-inch iPhone 5 it
was only half an inch bigger but it was
a symbolic 1/2 inch proving the big
phones were the future and in retrospect
is easy to see why we were so keen on
these palm stretching mobiles
hand-in-hand with the smartphone
revolution came faster Datatech video
services and games that changed what
these devices could do even as the
availability of tablets gave us a taste
of how good movies and TV could look on
a big touchscreen popularity in the
Asian market boosted sales of big screen
phones while shoppers found themselves
unable to go back to a smaller screen
having had a taste of something larger
who would be like going back to sterlet
caviar after Beluga Samsung initially
talked about the Galaxy Note as a new
category of device but it's clear now
that it was selling itself just a little
short this wasn't an alternative to the
smartphone but a new template for how
phones should look and successful
sequels followed having pioneered the
second phase of smartphone eeveelution
however there's a note of caution for
Samsung's big-screen future Samsung
draws its power from the volume and
variety of gadgets it produces but now
smaller phone makers are building
powerful rivals to Samsung's cheaper
Mobile's while if rumors of a bigger
iPhone 6 pan out Apple could reduce the
reasons to buy even Samsung's more
luxurious larger devices whatever
happens next however the Galaxy Note has
secured its place in the annals of tech
as the influential device that taught us
bigger could be better are you a fan of
massive Mobile's or do you prefer
something pocketable let me know your
thoughts and check back next time for
another adventure in tech</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
