here at the front door of the C net
smart house testing out the Schlage
sense Bluetooth deadbolt and this is a
new deadbolt from SH leg that has home
kick compatibility built right into it
and that means you can use it with Apple
smart home platform on your iOS device
and that you can control it with Siri so
put your phone out of your pocket and
ask you to unlock or lock the front door
and she'll take care of it now this
isn't the first smart deadbolt we've
seen from Schlage far from it they've
actually been doing it for a couple of
years now with models that have z-wave
radios built-in with z-wave you connect
the lock to a hub the hub connects to
your router and then you can access your
lock from anywhere with bluetooth things
are a little different because it's a
limited range you can't accessibly to
for more than 50 feet away or so and
that means that you don't get remote
control of this lock right out of the
box if you have an Apple TV you'll be
able to use it as the gatekeeper to let
you into your home network and unlock
the door from afar and so for that
reason I don't think that this deadbolt
makes sense if you don't have Apple TV
or you don't want to get one that said
it's a pretty good luck it's got a great
app it works well with other home care
products and it worked very reliably as
I tested it out the installation is a
little hands-on but the step-by-step
directions make it pretty simple all you
really need is a screwdriver and you can
get it done in about 20 minutes
from there you just sync the lock with
your phone and you're good to go you can
lock it unlock the door from your app
you can add specific codes for specific
people that's a nice way to see who
exactly is coming and going all of it
works well so if you're buying the home
kit I think it's a good purchase
but at 229 dollars it's a little more
expensive than other lock so z-wave
versions cost 50 bucks less I'd rather
have one of those if I'm building a
smart home setup from scratch and I
don't want home kit for more check out
my full review at cnet.com for seen at
appliances here at the CNET's smart home
I'm right Chris</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
