Crusoe
limited edition you see that's only 1
and guess who has it just kidding
limited because it available in only one
capacity of 750 gigabyte so it's
suitable only for those wanting a large
solid state drive now the drive screw
shows first attempt to 3d flash memory
as opposed to the traditional 2d flash
memory now if you think of this tuning
flash memory and 3d flash memory as
single family home or a high-rise
obviously the ladder allows for stacking
more people on the same patch of land so
3d is a more efficient way to do the
more storage in solid-state drive and
that means the m h304ee72 gigabyte and
it might get even cheaper in the next
few months now in testing the emic 300
was fast but it's not as fast as the
other SSD there's also u 3d flash memory
the samsung SSD 850 Evo it also has a
three year warranty which is shorter
than the 5 years of the Samsung
but the Samsung dry which came out more
than two and half years ago still cost
more now some thirty one cent per gig
now crystal say that the new drive here
come with very high and doing rating of
220 terrible that means if you right
hundred twenty gigabyte to the drive
here per day and everyday they would
take some five years for the drive to
become unreliable so you know if you're
looking for a large SSD to replace that
almost full hard drive of yours this is
a good buy
in fact it still is even if you are not
I know because I'm down low and I'm not
looking for anything in fact anything
everything and everyone is always
looking for me but it's you who found me
enjoy
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
