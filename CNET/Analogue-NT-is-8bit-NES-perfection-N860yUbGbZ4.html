System or NES just celebrated its
30-year anniversary here in the US now a
lot of people still have their original
NES myself included but odds are they
don't exactly work too well I mean let's
be honest they really never worked that
well so sure you can get one of those
cheap emulation knockoffs out there that
water down the experience or you can opt
for something like this this is the
analogue NT and it's a built from the
ground up reproduction of the original
NES this uses the same CPU and PPU chips
found in the NES to run games giving you
an exact replication of that system and
the way it played now this is the
ultimate console for NES purists for the
gamer who wants that uncompromised
experience on a modern TV analog really
did their homework here this thing is
gorgeous right down to this circuit
board and the consoles got some real
weight to it I mean this is a solid
block of aluminum right here it just
feels very significant it's clear a lot
of attention and respect was put into
the manufacturing of the device now out
of the box the console can play any NES
or Famicom game Famicom's what it was
called in Japan and that totals over a
thousand titles it's got two separate
slots for NES and Famicom cartridges as
well there's also for NES format
controller ports up front and the system
already ships with to to get you started
so I've been holding off a bit on the
price of the analogue NT and that's
because it starts at $500 which yes is a
lot of money and if you want the
impressive HDMI HD up converter
that's an extra $70 okay so if you're
thinking about getting one of these you
almost have to get that HD upgrade so
you can play games in 720 or 1080p but I
mean look at this quality it really is
like a pixel perfect experience there's
also a quick menu that's loaded into the
system that lets you mess around with
the resolution and
you other settings filters and
processing now the NT does a great job
of playing your old NES games and it
could actually breathe new life into
your old-school collection if you've got
a bunch of 8-bit games laying around
collecting dust I know I have a whole
trunk full of them at my parents house
now yes at $500 the analogue NT is
obviously not for everyone
but in the same way that an audiophile
is looking for an uncompressed rich
sound or the way a hardcore movie buff
wants that perfect reproduction of a
classic film the analogue NT does that
for original NES games if you're willing
to pay for it I'm Jeff Bakalar thanks
