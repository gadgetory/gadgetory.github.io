companies have tried to popularize new
formats they hope will sell by the
truckload two of these led to a format
war DVD audio versus sa CD
while neither were particularly
successful it did lead to a thirst for
better than CD quality music or high res
audio as it's called today neil young's
pono was seen as leading the charge of
high-quality digital music and two and a
half years after d booing the player on
david letterman it's finally here the
pono player is a 64 gigabyte high res
player which will play almost any format
you throw at it including sony's DSD
which funnily enough the bird with the
SACD as you can see it's kind of an
awkward shape but it does fit nicely in
your hand and the touchscreen and
multifunction button are easily
accessible the reason for the weird
shape a large battery but on our tests
it's only good for six to eight hours
use and takes four hours to charge
navigation is pretty straightforward
even if it's easy to accidentally select
things rather than swipe but it's a
select button that causes the most
trouble this all-in-one s-- which acts
as a play select power and track skip
which can get confusing the lack of a
whole switch and a convoluted hold
system means the buttons are easy to
trigger in the bag or pocket which can
lead to a rundown battery or
ear-splitting volume it's not going to
change the world unfortunately high res
audio isn't as exciting as new young
might make out and people will balk at
many things including their 399 dollar
price tag but despite its many issues I
really like this device it's fun it
sounds good and its distinctive sound
quality is a cut above your smartphone
as you'd expect and having another high
resolution store to choose from in the
form of pono music is also a good thing
