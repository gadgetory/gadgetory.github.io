smart light from an Austrian startup
called Luc Robert it's called fittingly
enough the Luc Robert smart light now
what's cool about it is that it offers
color changing light up above the light
and white natural tones down below it's
very bright with 3000 lumens going down
and 2000 lumens going up that's a lot
more than you'll get from Philips hue or
lifx and that's because it's got more
diodes inside it's got 312 diodes that
all emit light ability bulbs got like 25
so that's a very big uptick when you'll
get from a smart bulb now the cool thing
about this Android and iOS app is that
you can actually paint direction and the
color of the light that you want in your
room so if you want red light to the
left and blue light to the right you can
do that you can do whatever you want
kind of play with it sort of a playful
fun product this was successfully
crowdfunded and be coming to the market
in March and that time it'll be $700 I
also asked the geek Robert people about
third-party integrations like Amazon
echo and homekit from Apple they
wouldn't tell me anything but this is a
Bluetooth product so its options are a
little bit limited homekit might be a
good fit though because you could
connect it with an Apple TV we'll know
more when it arrives in a couple of
months but certainly something we're
keeping an eye on if you're a fan of
color changing light</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
