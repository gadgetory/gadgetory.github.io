luxury you might expect from a Korean
car is that it would run two days in a
row
things have changed let's give an
example from Kia where they're raising
the bar with a new top-of-the-line model
the 2014 cadenza we've got a
pre-production sample let's drive it and
check the tach Hyundai has the Genesis
and Equus sedans kind of way up market
this is gonna be a new high watermark
for Kia they don't have anything in this
space until this guy drops so this is
going to redefine what a Kia is now head
designer Peter Schreyer from Audi has
put some real nice sharp lines and kind
of young urban tones on this car that
said the overall shape and design is not
revolutionary it looks like kind of a
melange of GS and five series and a few
other cars that are on the market today
whatever their convex kind of like this
bulging out at you to me that
communicates an older kind of a car an
older customer when they're concave like
so that tends to feel sporty-er to me I
don't know if you agree or not but this
car is definitely in the former it kind
of bulges out to you very much like a
Mercedes does this day and age and I
think it prints a little stayed in here
as a result now within all that you've
got two screens we'll get to the head
unit in a minute
the surprising one is that digital
speedometer cars at this price point
don't normally have one of those it's
all LCD which means that the center of
that gauge can become an info display
for anything from your next navigation
direction to your media state what's
playing right now alerts from the car in
terms of its own maintenance needs
almost anything can show up in there and
it's a really beautiful piece of LCD on
the other hand that dial gauges around
it start to look even more dated because
of what's in the middle now into the
main event this head unit here of course
is the latest hyundai-kia rig with UVO
eServices but let's start with the
basics that's a great-looking navigation
screen it calls out street names really
well underway the navigation is
exceptionally clear as it shows you the
next event coming up it's almost doing a
sort of a Sim City to show you the next
intersection or what have you it's
really top-notch in that respect but it
does not have any of that 3d bird's-eye
stuff that's an interesting omission Kia
does not use a controller like I drive
or anything you just use touch or voice
touch command on this guy is rather
quick not the fastest I've run across
but very crisp but the real star here is
the voice command this is arguably as
good or better than any I've driven yet
even BMW check it out
navigation navigation street address
find address 235 second street San
Francisco so as you can see I convert
out entire street addresses I can say
two three five or 235 and understands
both there's a lot of good smart
comprehension in this system let's get
to media now you've got am/fm and
satellite radio of course with a very
clear display
is one of the least busy you're ever
gonna see when you have an HD station
pulled up you do have the tagging button
so you can tell your iPod to tell iTunes
to remind you later to buy the song
there is an ability to rip to a hard
drive here nobody cares
it displays HD radio stations very well
in terms of the one two even three
channels they're sending out under media
you're gonna find access to your aux
jack your USB port here on the dash for
iPod or thumb drive you've also got
bluetooth streaming audio of course all
of this stuff is standard as is rear
camera has his navigation on this car by
the way
what we're missing though is any sort of
apps base no Pandora no Yelp no Google
services nothing like that what you do
have is UVO eServices which are mostly
telematics you can use your phone app
with this car to remember where it's
parks you don't lose it to do
maintenance updates to do emergency
roadside service requests off your phone
but that's more in the telematics world
not the infotainment apps world that is
really hot today so this car is a step
behind in that respect and it's
interesting because the new Kia Soul
also a 2014 will at least have a Pandora
app support in an almost identical head
unit but this car doesn't have that now
one last note this car is a tech trim
level that's not a package it's a trim
level of the vehicle they're gonna be
bringing to market and that rolls in
three major technologies adaptive cruise
control so you can maintain speed and
distance and it's interesting the
digital speedometer here will show you
with a yellow band on the speedo where
you have your cruise control speed set
it's very digestible
you've also got departure control for
lane drift and blind spot technology
both of those though are passive they do
nothing to bring you back into your lane
they just beat like hell and make little
lights
up in the bow we've got nothing too
dramatic in terms of hyundai-kia they've
been doing direct injection gas engines
for a while that's what we have here 3.3
liter v6 front-wheel drive on this guy
rear-wheel drive tends to be what the
competition does on the German side but
that's not where they're going
293 horsepower 255 foot-pounds of torque
good numbers we don't have 0 to 60 or
the weight of the car dialed in yet
because this guy is pre-production but
we do know it 20 to 28 is the expected
mpg according the key is testing not bad
for a big boy with a lot of mass to move
around only one transmission choice at
this high-tech trim level which is a
6-speed automatic with interestingly no
sport modes so you do have paddles on
the wheel but what really intrigues me
is you can get a base trim cadenza with
a six-speed manual now that's
interesting let's hit the road
how do you know you're a pompous ass
when you're shopping for one of the
Affordable Mercedes models but refused
to consider a Kia or a Hyundai those
days have got to be over because this
car is an absolute contender in what
they call a the the near luxury or near
premium class it's not the really
high-dollar boats but the cars that are
really much finer than an Accord let's
say and the standard vehicles of 4-door
variety this is a really nice car in
specific the power comes on in a very
smooth linear fashion there are no
hiccups and no hesitations on the other
hand the transmission does mute that
performance or responsiveness to a
degree that's where I like to have a
sport mode instead all you have are
various versions of manual mode that's
not the same thing and for the most part
I think Kia's got the ergonomics down in
fact this is one that I rarely see the
visibility out of this car is actually
quite good never mind the fact that it's
got a standard rear camera you almost
don't need it and that's pretty rare
this day and age and every control and
button falls to hand properly and then
that is backed up by a ride that is firm
enough to be to feel young and to feel
like it's not an old person's car but at
the same time insulated enough from the
road so that it's a refreshing enjoyable
car to drive in everyday commuting I
think they've got a nice balance here
but of course I've got to see what the
pricing is for real and I also want to
know how the final delivery is going to
be on all this technology
this car is still pre-production as of
the day we're shooting today so I don't
have any hard prices for you he is
telling us low 30s faced with that
fascinating six-speed manual low forties
loaded up on the tech trim which will be
their top-end car so pre reasonable for
the amount of Technology performance and
I'd say refinement in this vehicle we'll
wait to see a final production version
to see how the pricing works but I have
a hunch I would take almost all the tech
options because of the value and how
well they seem to work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
