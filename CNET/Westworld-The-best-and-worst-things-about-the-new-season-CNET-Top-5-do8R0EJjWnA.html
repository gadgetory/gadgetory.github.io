about the new season of West world for
this video we're only going to cover
things that happened in season 2 episode
1 this video will have spoilers for that
episode and for season 1 if you just
want to know what was bad about the show
just gifted this timecode otherwise
let's get to it and number five is the
Bengal tiger again spoilers are ahead at
the end of the episode West world
security comes upon a Bengal tiger and
are surprised it belongs in park 6 not
west world now we've known their
multiple parks other than West world but
we haven't seen the other parks yet
according to the World Wildlife Fund
Bengal tigers are primarily found in
India this suggests that Park 6 could be
an Indian themed place that's fun world
building right there and number 4 is
Bernard when it's revealed he has
critical issues the tablet lists off
symptoms Bernard will face loss of motor
function cognitive dissonance time
slippage aphasia and prosopagnosia I
looked up a couple of those aphasia
means Bernard will lose the ability to
understand or express speech
prosopagnosia means the inability to
recognize faces of familiar people all
of those symptoms seem like they will
cause a lot of problems and fun
storytelling for the rest of the season
number three fun with time the first
season showed us multiple timelines
which was a great twist
since we're expecting time to be messed
with in this season timelines are
established right away it's been two
weeks since the season finale footage
taken from a fallen host is eleven days
old so we have gaps in time Bernard has
time slippage issues so we still have
problems knowing when certain events
happened coming in at number two with
the revelation that Delos is collecting
data
Bernard believes that Delos is login
guests experiences and also is
collecting the guests DNA Charlotte does
not confirm or deny it but Bernard has
to be right in the Delos terms of
services website it says that Delos
controls the rights to all skin cells
bodily fluids hair samples etc
that Delos reserves the right to use the
property in any way it sees fit that has
some pretty big implications before we
get to number one let's talk about the
bad parts of the season premiere and yes
these will be nitpicks because it's a
really strong show these are presented
in no particular order first up no other
parks yet ok I know the show is called
West world's but in season 1 they teased
multiple parks it would have been nice
to get a glimpse of another park in the
first episode it's also missing some
characters in the first episode we don't
get to see young William Logan or
armistice next up where is West world we
do see that Delos essentially has full
control of the island West world design
where exactly on earth is that island
and the number one best part of the
second season premiere is Dolores we see
her become the different characters she
has been like the ranch's daughter and
Wyatt in one scene but she's got a whole
new role as herself Dolores is motivated
and is not content with just taking over
West world she wants to take over the
entire world
Dolores is setting up a gigantic
storyline for the rest of the season I
can't wait to see how this turns out
what was your favorite or least favorite
part of Westworld are you going to
follow all the theories that pop up let
me know
I'm Aya's Akhtar and I'll see you online</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
