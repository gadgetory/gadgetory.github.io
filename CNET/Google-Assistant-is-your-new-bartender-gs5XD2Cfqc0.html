new homes here at Google's Developers
Conference previously you can only use
the assistant if you had a couple of
Google phones or the Google home now
people are actually building it into a
variety of different pieces of hardware
so Google released the developers path
for the assistant meaning you can place
it into devices like oh say a cocktail
mixer here and not only do you get the
standard assistant but you can actually
build specific conversational
back-and-forth for your device hey
what's on the menu on tap today I have a
pairing mode in bang IO whether it be
insisting now it actually knows what's
on what's on tap today what's on the
menu
can I have a mango no problem this
conference is topical and tropical so
now it's actually gone from my voice to
the assistant service through the speech
recognition and natural language
understanding and triggered an intent
that's an action on Google that
understands what drink I want what
ingredients are made up in or make up
that drink and how to actually trigger
the client-side code that dispenses the
liquid that you see down here below and
because it's running on a technology
called API - AI and I can have a
conversation with the device I can say
things like hey mixer can you tell us a
few jokes I've got a great UDP joke for
you
but I'm not sure if you get it so thanks
to the mocktail skill I'm now about to
try a sip of the mango IO cocktail
Cheers
it's good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
