Mobile World Congress in Barcelona we're
taking a look at three new smartphones
from yes a miami-based company that's
looking to take on samsung and other
major organizations all right let's
start with this it's the years a5 QP now
the first thing i noticed picking up
this phone is that it's extremely light
if you spin it on its side it measures
just 6.9 millimeters thick and it just
feels very very portable I like it if
you have a look on the back there's a 13
megapixel camera while on the front you
get a 5 megapixel camera despite being
super light this thing should be very
powerful it's got a 1.7 gigahertz
octa-core processor on the inside I
can't wait to check out some benchmark
tests and see just how powerful this
thing really is this 5 inch display has
a 720 x 1280 pixel resolution and
another thing that's kind of neat about
this phone is that it's got metal
plating on the inside which yes says
will make it quite tough and hard to
damage it's running Android version 4.2
now that's not the latest version but
i'm told that getting an upgrade to 4.4
Kit Kats might be possible by the time
this thing goes on sale yes also has its
own app store on this with 50,000 free
apps what's cool about that app store is
that you don't have to register so no
putting in your email address you can
just start downloading apps as soon as
you get the phone I'm told that this
thing will cost less than three hundred
and twenty euros is coming out in Europe
and the UK in April before a US and
latin america release in May next up is
this is the a5 VP now unfortunately this
thing isn't a real phone yet it's just a
dummy model at the moment but I'm
assured that eventually this thing will
have LTE it'll have a 1.2 gigahertz
quad-core processor and it will be
coming out in May in europe latin
america and the u.s. last but not least
is the a zed 4.5 now this phone is
interesting because it's aimed at
seniors so it has a couple of really
interesting features for example if you
have a look down here these touch
buttons are really really big so they're
easy to see all the icons are very
simple the interface is very basic if
you flip it around there's an SOS button
here in case of emergencies there's a
5mm
pixel camera two and on the side there
is a flashlight control and a switch
print FM radio so some inventive
features and it's always nice to see
some devices from a company that's an
underdog but what do you think let me
know i'm luis rey tew/cnet here at
Mobile World Congress in Barcelona</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
