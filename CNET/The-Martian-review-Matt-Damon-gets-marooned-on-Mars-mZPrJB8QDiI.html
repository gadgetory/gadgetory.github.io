here was supposed to last 31 Sol's for
redundancy they sent 68 Sol's worth of
food that's 46 people so for just me
that's gonna last 300 Sol's which I
figure I can stretch to 400 if I ration
so I got to figure out a way to grow
three years worth of food here on a
planet where nothing grows luckily I'm a
botanist
the Martian a new interplanetary sci-fi
film from director Ridley Scott is
blasting into cinemas soon with me as
someone who's seen the film it's my
colleague rich trenholm hello now rich
this movie is based on a very very
popular book by Andy weir so the first
thing to ask for fans of that novel is
how close is it to the source material
it's very very faithful to the source
material and this is a book that sir
beloved of fans for it's nerdy attention
to detail it's all about this very smart
capable guy in a very very difficult
situation but using his smarts to
overcome every obstacle that that is
that is put in front of him as he faces
this long long wait to be rescued from
where he's been marooned on Mars it's
really enjoyable watching like a smart
guy in teams of smart people pulling
together and solving this problem so in
that sense it's really really faithful
to the book we know that a great book
doesn't always translate to a great
movie so as a standalone cultural
artifacts yes how does the Martian stand
up it doesn't really introduce enough of
a sense of threat I mean compared to
gravity for example which is this kind
of white-knuckle ride where there's
constantly three things going wrong at
once and it's a you feel that you've
kind of gone through it got over a
roller coaster when you come out of it
the Martian is very sedate so I think it
could have done with i'm not talking
about manufacturing xed near drama and i
think what i'm talking about is it's
maybe kind of emphasizing what a hostile
environment space really is for human
beings so speaking of space as a hostile
environment this is a movie that's
directed by ridley scott's who is
probably most famous perhaps for alien
and Blade Runner and is a huge
historical sci-fi presence so exact that
was the direction here it's it's good i
mean he he did completely invent a new
language for science fiction and i think
this is it's a bit more comfortable
there's lots of sci-fi tropes that we've
seen before like for example the text is
all spelt out and like bleeping letters
across the bottom the names and
character locations and we see a lot of
shots of worried looking scientists
we're thinking what how we possibly
going to solve this question we might as
well just and then they tail off in
mid-sentence and they run to a computer
they go I've got it and I've cracked it
and they've cracked it yeah in terms of
you know smart people doing smart things
and you know a character you can really
root for it is so it is really really
good fun the book is quite a love letter
to space travel to written
with a real fondness for the endeavor to
to travel into space exactly i'm across
in the movie as well yeah very much so
there's kind of a subplot of humanity
uniting to get this one guy back and it
it's very much about you know people
solving these problems and there's look
there's a huge cast and those are stars
it as chua tellegio for and there's Sean
Bean Kristen Wiig and Donald Glover and
loads and loads of big names jeff
daniels and it is great to see them kind
of working together and you do find
yourself rooting for these rooting for
these people to solve this kind of big
problem and and just to continue to to
like enjoy the the majesty of space i
guess so it sounds like it doesn't maybe
break much new ground in terms of sci-fi
on screen but from what you described a
fun blockbuster especially for fans of
the book does that sound like a fair
assessment yes absolutely okay well
we've got a full written review of the
Martian available on cnet com so do be
sure to check that out in the meantime
let us know what you think and stay
