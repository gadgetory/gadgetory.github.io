crossover segment
it certainly solidified it so the
company has a lot at stake when it does
a major refresh the 2012 CRV is exactly
that let's drive it and check the tech
now the first thing you've noticed I'm
sure about the new CRV is well that's a
CRV it doesn't look so pedestrian
so cheap to be honest it looks like a
much richer car it's got a bigger
presence on the road especially from the
rear it is interestingly now also the
entry-level SUV from Honda since the
element is gone now this new CRV for
2012 starts about 23 grand but that's
not the CRV we're in we're in the top
trim level with the top technology this
is an e XL with navigation and only the
EXL trim level can have navigation bear
that in mind you can't get an
inexpensive CRV and have that head unit
which might be okay because that nav
system annoys me it's functional but
it's fugly that should be their new
trademark it's okay to use it's fine it
tortures a bunch of the letters and the
readouts it's one of the oldest systems
on the market today and it's got nothing
that recommends it more than me so take
it as what it is standard audio in this
car is 160 watts and 4 speakers but of
course we're in the high trim car so
it's 7 speakers and that includes a
subwoofer
and we've got 300 and something watts
instead of a scan hundred and 60 now
what's coming out of those speakers some
new choices first of all check this out
I've now got Pandora integration through
an iPhone connection that's pretty cool
and you can get to your station list you
can operate the transport you can do all
of that right there from the screen
that's a first for Honda you do the
thumbs-up and thumbs-down function that
key Pandora feature
but you can't create station so you got
to do that back on your phone but they
do show up nicely now this 2012 CRV also
has built-in Bluetooth hands-free that's
fine but also bluetooth streaming we've
also got a USB pigtail down here where
the iPhones plugged in you can also plug
in a USB thumb drive
so you've got almost all the modern
options for audio with the exception of
HD radio and no hard drive which is no
problem to me now the Bluetooth
hands-free technology's got a new trick
in it as well
now built-in base you've got text
reception and reply on the screen check
this out there's my text coming in and I
hit the read button and it shows me it
visually as well as reading it to me in
her goofy voice yo dog saw you in a 300
now you're in a Honda's business back
then I've got these canned responses I
can send back as his current Honda
fashioned and I like it they've got this
multi display up here that goes to about
four or five screens there's your media
readout your efficiency readout that
could be a piece of wallpaper put a
photo there real dumb or you could go
back to your basic clock and of course
navigation can always take on this
screen now and let that become sort of a
rich helper screen one choice only on
this guy for a gearbox a five-speed
automatic they get a CVT in the Japanese
market I understand but here strictly
the five-speed no manual notice when I
go into reverse what happens I get a
rear camera with three views now I
checked it out just walked around back
there and it's just one camera so
they're doing some cropping basically of
the image or taking a different piece of
the sensor it works okay the visual
quality is not the best I've seen and
notice you do have guidelines but they
don't predict trajectory they just give
you a basic sort of a distance read
tried and true up here in the engine bay
a Honda 2.4 litre inline-four sitting
sidesaddle front-wheel drive is bass all
wheel drives available 185 horse 163
foot-pounds of torque both of those are
up just a little bit from the outgoing
CRV gets this guy 216 about nine seconds
weighs well over two tons by the way mpg
is 23 31 and front-wheel drive get the
back wheels to start helping out you
lose one mpg per count then there's that
econ button in the dash that intrigues
me let's go drive the whole package
okay let's go for a ride now I've got
the econ button on I'm getting these big
green bars on either side of the speedo
there and that's going to show me that
I'm driving in a green fashion almost
too obviously and if I step on it that
goes away really numbs out the throttle
response when you're in econ it seems to
be one of the first things it does and I
suspect it's holding gears a little less
lengthily the rides nice it doesn't have
any of those harsh moments on kind of a
crappy Road right now and I'm not
getting those pointy inputs from the bad
asphalt which is a good thing as this
car has gotten nicer looking on the
outside it needs to ride in a way that
goes with that CRVs to me I've always
sold well partly because they feel light
they're not a big handful to drive and
this continues that trend if you like
the feeling of a lighter
well most a one-finger driving
experience the CRV is still your boy and
we've got the all-wheel-drive model here
and I can tell you this Honda has
upgraded that all-wheel drive technology
a little bit so it isn't rare that you
get the rear wheels in the picture they
are feathered in I understand a little
more frequently in everyday driving than
they used to be not that it's an
off-roader but it will give you better
traction in challenging driving
conditions and that mir-1 MPG drop for
all-wheel drive that's a pretty good
sacrifice
