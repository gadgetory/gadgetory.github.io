very long time since 2009 that's a long
time that's funny that you say it's very
long that's like a it's a virtual
currency right so it's this very
anonymous interesting development within
2009 this comes out kind of as a sleeper
for a couple of years that no one's
really thinking it's a financial crisis
right and it comes as a result of this
idea that what is currency worth and
Bitcoin kind of came around because
people were freaking out they're saying
like well you don't know what anything's
worth anymore right and the market was
tumbling and everything was nuts
so flash-forwards at about 2011 and it
went from say a few cents of per Bitcoin
to like a dollar a Bitcoin to two
dollars like $13 per Bitcoin in the
beginning of the year at which point
things start to get kind of interesting
because people are starting to pay
attention and now all the sudden we saw
Bitcoin go from say 13 14 15 dollars up
to the 40s yeah then right when Cyprus
was basically going in to bank accounts
and saying okay you've got money here
we're gonna take money out of your
account to pay for our bail out Bitcoin
went to 266 bucks now it's back in the
40s and the 50s and people are really
starting to say well maybe this idea of
an electronic currency that's constantly
changing has some merit now there's a
downside it's not regulated right and
you know that's kind of crazy now I
messed with a little bit totally can be
messed with could be manipulated could
be speculative and and from the from the
Federal Reserve's point of view and
which I think they're gonna start to get
into on this as they say it also can be
used to launder money the concept of
Bitcoin is one of these it's it's it's
like flirting with quantum physics you
know it's like this intangible sort of
abstract idea some people really get it
some people don't
I think that it was really created
because people were saying why is it
that we arbitrarily say a dollar is
worth a dollar right right I mean so
this is like a ver
existential sure financial conversation
and and it's fascinating because it is
true that the only reason a dollars
worth of dollars because we all agree
that that's the case but when you look
at Bitcoin I think that there are people
who are you know let you know honestly
their programmers they're super smart
people right they're saying well why is
it that the dollar is worth a dollar</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
