and today we're going to take a look at
the LG G pad 8.3 google play edition as
you may know we've already looked at
this tablet before when it originally
launched with LG and the Optimus user
interface however as the first tablet to
be reworked as a google edition tablet
the G pad now runs the vanilla Android
4.4 kitkat OS now this does mean the
device will lose some of the built in
software features seen in the first G
pad such as LG's quick memo app and the
Bluetooth connecting feature Q pair by
having a Google branded device does have
other benefits for example users will
get the newest updates from google as
they roll in in fact the first time we
started up the tablet it prompted us to
install the latest four-point 4.2 update
Google's G pad also has a bit more
available internal storage space though
both editions have expandable memory
upto 64 gigs via a microSD card and it's
a tad bit though noticeably faster
chrome and the apt or launch is quicker
it took a shorter amount of time to load
the first level of nova 3 and it scored
better results on our 3dmark bench tests
hardware-wise however the tablets are
identical the g pad still has an 8 point
3 inch HD display with in 1920 x 1200
pixel resolution and 273 PPI it also has
a 1.7 gigahertz quad-core Snapdragon 600
processor a 4.6 ampere our battery and
two cameras with a 5 megapixel shooter
in the back if you're interested the
Wi-Fi only tablet is available at the
Play Store for about three hundred and
fifty dollars again I'm Lynn and you've
been checking out the LG G pad 8.3
google play edition
