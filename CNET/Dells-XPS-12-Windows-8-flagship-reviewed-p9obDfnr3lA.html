a look at the Dell XPS 12 this is a
brand new Windows 8 laptop one of the
first laptops built specifically for
Windows 8 and like a lot of those other
early Windows 8 laptops it is what we
call a convertible which means that the
screen will either twist or rotate or
flip in some way to turn it from a
clamshell laptop into a tablet in this
particular case it goes like this you
pop the screen out on the back it's
hinged here on the side and you flip it
all the way around like this and when
you do that it's actually pointing out
from the back of the lid as you can see
the auto rotate is still a little wonky
it's something we've seen in a couple of
Windows 8 systems but then you can fold
it all the way down like this and you
have got a slate style tablet that will
work either in portrait mode or in
regular horizontal mode and again not
getting a lot of auto rotate love right
here now if this looks familiar to you
that's because we actually have seen a
design like this once before
also from Dell that was about two years
ago in something called the dell
inspiron duo which was basically a
bigger thicker chunkier heavier version
of this that had the same kind of hinged
in the middle almost ferris-wheel style
rotating screen that was a clever idea
at the time but because it had an Intel
Atom processor it was really
underpowered and it just didn't come
together and I don't think Dell sold it
for a particularly long time so please
see this comeback Dell was actually
originally gonna call this a duo at the
last minute they change the name and
just called it an XPS 12 because it has
a 12 inch screen you can get a fairly
high-end version like we have with a
core i7 and a 256 gig SSD that's a
little bit expensive that's about 16 99
or you can get a much more entry-level
version for I think 1199 which is a Core
i5 and a 128 gig SSD which does seem a
lot more reasonable because for what
you're gonna do with this web-surfing
often stocks maybe some social media
maybe watch some movies online you're
not really gonna need the core i7 you
might as well get the less expensive
version which at least seems
understandable I'm not really sure as
clever as the rotating screen is if
anyone
really gonna want to spend 1699 on that
as far as the first generation of
Windows 8 laptop / tablet / hybrid /
convertible systems goes this is one of
my favorite ways to do it because it
doesn't really compromise that
traditional clamshell laptop experience
you've got a nice backlit keyboard
you've got a big touchpad over here and
at the same time you also get besides
the tablet view which is you know
marginally useful depending on what
you're doing I really like the ability
to flip the screen backwards to show
somebody on the other side of your
computer what you're working on are
really great for sharing in meetings for
example I'm Dan Ackerman and that is the
