roundtable I am Rick needle in San
Francisco hey since Yahoo launched in
1994 has been a major factor in the
growth of the web but it looks like that
growth is coming to an end 2000 yahoo
employees will be losing their jobs
that's about fourteen percent of the
company's workforce this company is sort
of rudderless and struggling to figure
out which direction to go and getting
hit it in all directions of its business
well Yahoo began as a web directory it
quickly diversified into several hundred
sites trying to find a foothold as a
search engine mail server and news hub
yahoo for 56 years has been this company
that people keep saying what do you do
right are you in search sort of but
Google is doing that are you in social
they tried to buy Facebook didn't didn't
happen experts say these layoffs won't
affect yahoo websites that see 700
million users a month but too many
consumers it's a non-issue I don't use
yahoo mail at all so it's just not as
cool as Gmail I like gmail has
everything I need their search isn't the
best but there's still some things that
they're good at rest in peace sort of
unfortunate but it seems like that's the
direction they're heading analysts say
this perception is what could be the
final nail in the coffin yah whose
reputation is terrible this is no way
around it to people around the world who
use yahoo mail fine to people who use
yahoo sports sites fine they have plenty
of good properties but as a company and
for the people who work there it's got a
bad reputation and that's not helpful
what will lean or yahoo look like we'll
find out on April seventeenth when the
company releases its quarterly earnings
statement in San Francisco I'm Kara
Tsuboi cnet.com for CBS News so to talk
about what's going on today with Yahoo
and their patent suit against facebook
we've got two great guests first here in
the studio seen at News executive editor
Charles Cooper Charlie thanks for coming
in my pleasure and joining us via the
miracle of skype kara swisher co
executive editor at all things d thanks
for coming in or
joining us remotely appreciate it
problem so um cara first of all what
happened where did yahoo go wrong well
many places actually over the many years
so it's not been just one single event
it's been like a series of continual
events most of which are missing major
trends and not changing when you need to
I think you could probably go way back
into until when they competed with
Google when they decided to focus on
competing with google over focusing on
how they were found it which was at as a
distribution vehicle for Internet
information and as a place that people
that was easier to use the internet and
they focused on search and of course
they lost the battle to Google very
quickly go ahead I think that's right
knee I would just add that mm you know
early on there were a lot of zigs and
zags that didn't help their case at all
you know after Tim Google who the first
CEO was forced out they brought in some
folks who decided okay we're going to go
show biz we're going to open up
operations in Santa Monica we're going
to go more strongly towards becoming a
full-fledged media company whatever that
meant within the context of web 10 or
web 20 way back when and once they got
rid of Terry Semel then there was
another shift and another shift and
they've had what five CEOs over the
course of 17 years so what happened to
the founders how did they let this not
very rich that's what happened to they
said they cashed out no not at all
that's not true at all since the
beginning um yeah it's never been about
money for those two if you know David
Philo even slightly that's not even
accurate in any way but um you know I
think one of the issues was that they
were founders that may be needed a lot
more help the way Pierre Omidyar brought
in other people to help him realize the
vision of ebay I think they probably
needed that or Larry and Sergey brought
in Eric Schmidt they never had that
happen as much as they needed to and the
other thing was there were all sorts of
cross ideas of what Yahoo should be and
one of the things they've never been
able to do is dis be able to define what
the company is even though everybody
knew what it was at the beginning and it
sort of still is what it was when it
started and so that was one of the
problems i think is a definition Charlie
what is Yahoo I mean
that's one of my big questions here I
mean is it a search company media media
company what is younger what should it
be I don't know what I mean they bring
in people far smarter than than than the
three of us who you know have been
charged with trying to but they haven't
done such a good job so what is well I
think you know what they need to do and
this you know responsibility goes back
it's not so much you know you know
Jerry's fault but you know the board as
well that they early on to not bring in
somebody who had a really strong idea
strategically and also was strong on
tactics who could say this is what we
are this is how we can define our place
and when the internet changed when it
became more about search you know they
just were not able to come up with a
concrete plan that would you know get
them going in this new world order and
right now if you ask what is Yahoo you
can get five different answers from five
different people so we're asking what
Yahoo was I mean kara yahoo has nearly
700 million users to those users is that
a sort of a uh how am I going to ask
this Yahoo is it sort of analogous don't
I wouldn't make this it's an inelegant
analogy but you know sun microsystems
for several years just lagged on and
they could have continued along the same
every path they really weren't a
world-beater but they had what six or
seven billion dollars you know in
reserves you know Yahoo's not going out
of business but you know the the pie is
shrinking yes so they can hang on but
it's not a business that business model
what they really want kara want to talk
about two divisions in actually that's
also not true sorry Charlie sorry
Charlie haha funny it's a very
successful business it's a very good
advertising business is a very good
audience business they have 600 million
people using a lot of their facilities
including email yahoo news i think is
the number one Yahoo Finance's number
one Yahoo Sports is neither remember one
or two so this is not a dead business by
any stretch that wasn't what I was
suggesting Kara I'm saying that if they
want to again impress investors on Wall
Street which may not be their first
aspiration they need to come up with a
compelling story obviously they have
those hundreds of millions of eyeballs
in this great Yahoo Sports is wonderful
I use it all the time but they need to
decide what they want to be when they're
a big boy now we know what they are I
mean they have an advertising business
it's just I think the problem is they've
never they've even in so many businesses
it's like it would happen with Apple
when they went down to four products I
mean they have some core products that
they're very good at and they're just
not as exciting a business as search
would be or social right now and so when
the problem is whenever they never been
comfortable in the costume they were
supposed to wear they've been very
comfortable in other costumes that don't
fit them and so I think they've always
had that very good core business though
that's that's just not been quite as
exciting to them even and they haven't
really invested in it in the way they
should and what they're actually good at
to me is what's gone on I don't think
we're disagreeing what I'm saying is
that if that story was compelling then
their stock wouldn't be in what the low
teens well as they change as they change
their model from being one thing to
being another thing that's going to be a
wrenching move isn't it's going to cost
people is going to cost market share
well it just costs 2,000 employees it
cost them their jobs that's right any
more to come isn't that right care well
that the layoffs were inevitable I mean
they're too big for what the how their
growth is their growth is negative so
it's not a question they're profitable
it's the growth is not going well and so
they're too big a company they've grown
too big as because of bad mismanagement
these people shouldn't have probably
been hired in the first place and so I
think one of the issues is that these
things happen creep happens at companies
at all companies and so they they
creeped into a two largest size for the
business there in at this point and
again it's a good business if they just
you know get to the right side is it's a
terrific business is by a good business
do you mean media do you mean ads do you
mean search or some combination of those
what do you think is the good business
here to me it's the media business I
think the media businesses besides the
things they own like Ali Baba and the
things that they're getting credit for
the ownership of other things that's
separate that's like owning a really
nice house and a nice part of San
Francisco or whatever they just happen
to buy it at the right time you know I
think their business the core businesses
and media business really a Miss media
distribution business not unlike you
know what the Wall Street Journal does
what you know all kinds of there's a lot
of kinds of me look not what Cena does
and so it's just not as exciting or
lucrative
search business and it's not as sexy as
a social networking business and but
it's still a business what is the
product division that we keep hear about
getting decimated what did did it do or
does it do that that didn't work for
Yahoo one thing they do at Yahoo is they
keep moving around the chairs and so
they decide this system works better
over this system it happens in a lot of
companies this is not a lot of companies
debate over where to put product and
where to put other things and so what
they did is that products were were
created within the individual units so
if you're in yahoo finance you made the
yahoo is finance products and then some
someone i think with sue decker decided
it would be better to have one product
organization serving all the units and
so they created this mega product
organization in the middle that then
serve the products to this to the
individual parts depend whatever it was
flickr or so they would have a product
lead and anna content lead and a
management lee and so you know it's it's
it's one way of running a company it
just didn't work here and so now they've
decided to change just the way HP just
decided to connect you'll bring print
and whatever the printer division with
the pc division and then they brought it
apart now it's back together so it's
just what companies do let's talk a
little bit about the CEO now Scott
Thompson who is this guy it does he have
what it takes to rescue yahoo to turn
the ship in the direction it needs to go
kara Charlie either you Charlie if you
wanna start I have a lot of things about
him but I love ladies first uh well I
think he's you know he cold emailed his
way into the job he wasn't on the list
of possible names they were looking at a
little bit because he had been placed by
the talent search firm at de paypal but
he emailed them and studied be great at
it which was kind of an interesting way
to get a job but I think he's which I
kind of like it kind of like that idea
the gumption of it he's very tough he
doesn't know a whole lot about media um
but he doesn't hesitate to talk about it
I think within yahoo he's a little
controversial because he's pretty tough
on them the meetings right before the
layoffs he pretty much playing the
existing management for the disaster and
told them so is that a good thing
probably is that a good thing at the
moment probably not so he's kind of an
interesting character in terms of being
very brash and cutting things I would
say there's probably the biggest
complaint about him right
now which dan loeb articulated was that
he did the cuts before the strategy was
unveiled so it's kind of interesting one
person at yahoo said it's sort of like
right before a war killing half your
troops and then telling you what the
strategy is so it sort of hurts morale
with the rest of the Living groups it
must be tough to be a yahoo right now
I'm sure it is i got an email from a
yahoo yahoo were overseas who was
complaining that they hadn't received
anything in terms of tricked direction
or what's next no word on what
businesses are going to depart etc etc
you know in theory there's nothing
necessarily wrong about bringing in an
outsider you know didn't work with carol
bartz who you know i have a lot of
respect for but she wasn't the right
person for the job you know Lou Gerstner
came to IBM and didn't know squat about
computers but he was expert at listening
to customers he understood the mechanics
of business and he said about it was
about five or six months of his own
listening tour before he unveiled his
grand strategic plan and he saved the
company if you remember back then his
predecessor I mean the idea was well
we're gonna break up IBM into baby IBM's
and gerstner said no I'm not going to do
that we're going to go in a completely
different direction so Thompson's been
on the job what came in in January this
is now going on for months he's reaching
the point where yeah the company the
people the employees really do deserve
to know what the direction is going to
be do you think they're gonna break it
up I have no idea Karen you think are
gonna break up your home to component
parts I think they're gonna slim it down
i would say probably you know i think
probably it would be nice for them to be
able to sell it i think some people
there want that to happen and i just
don't know who could buy it a large
company bomber must be pretty happy
right now that he didn't make that
acquisition in fact he said that didn't
he yeah you know who knows with that guy
uh go ahead sir he M you know I think
that they're they're trying to decide
what what the core company is and you
know it certainly could if they sell off
a lot of those Chinese assets which make
up a lot of their value at this moment
from our financial point of view they
could be sold to a private equity
company take it private that could be
cut someone interesting what they could
do privately would be probably and get
out of the public eye I think probably
in the public eye so much has been hard
on them and
no that's good that could happen that's
certainly it's a big it's a big number
they could certainly begin to sell off
parts in the probably get rid of things
like yahoo answers I'm guessing they may
even try to flip off look flicker and
all kinds of stuff you'll start to
really this guy is going to shed stuff I
think there's no point and then he'll
buy stuff that is I think that's court
to this that is in the areas with their
focus on a used to be very hopeful exit
strategy for companies in the valley you
get acquired by Yahoo Microsoft Google
Yahoo back in the day and you remember
there was a well hot and heavy delicious
acquire seen it yep goodness they're
gonna sell off their ads their ad
technology business I think or something
they're gonna do something with that get
out of that business and so there's
people arguing that they should keep it
inside but a lot of I think probably
they'll they'll spin it off in some way
and then they'll probably get out of
search it's sort of a losing game for
them they could buy a company just for
their patents and I want to talk about
that briefly so Yahoo sued facebook on
10 what they say our fundamental patents
and Facebook countersued and it's going
back and forth that's an interesting
strategy considering the timing i mean
as facebook has said it was confusing to
be sued by somebody who they saw as a
partner Charlie what do you think of
this patent suit in the timing of her in
particular well a million speculates the
cows come home I mean one thing that
Facebook did they help themselves with
that purchase of patents from IBM a few
weeks ago which protected them against
well gave them a way to bargain with
yahoo if Yahoo isn't a mind to bargain
you know whether or not they'll be able
to extract this cash ectomy that they're
looking to extract whether or not it was
a cynical move just prior to the
facebook IPO I mean again we can
speculate as to motive kara what do you
think of the yahoos patent suit against
facebook very bad timing ill-thought-out
no I thought it was I was fascinated
they really did I don't know what there
must have been someone who managed to
convince Scott Thompson that was a good
idea and I thought it was it was timing
they didn't they could have gone for a
better partnership with Facebook you
know here's a career as a company that
can really help Yahoo and has helped
yahoo recently with a lot of the stuff
they've been doing
with with integration has been really
good for Yahoo Yahoo doesn't have a
social strategy social strategies
facebook has been facebook so i don't
think you kick a partner in the teeth
quite like that at a time that is
particularly inopportune right before an
IPO and you know when it happened i was
talking to someone relatively high up at
yahoo and I said Facebook is gonna
really hit hard back and they were like
no they won't they'll settle and I said
they're gonna hit hard back and that's
what they did this week they have their
own lawsuit and I think they'll drag it
out as long as they can I don't know
pyaar whose advantage to drag this thing
out and that's what they're gonna do
they can't be surprised that that
Facebook slammed back at them I mean
this is the way this dance is danced
yeah 10 that especially that company
like Mark Zuckerberg Facebook doesn't
mind being sued there was this whole
movie about him being sued and it won an
Oscar like you might notice this guy
doesn't mind a little bit of litigation
example cues from the film Charlie no
cure they don't care at Facebook in that
regard well one thing it's done it's
it's made them extremely unpopular but
it's helped some competing companies
Yammer put out a 25k twenty five
thousand dollar bounty is starting to
get engineers coming in from yahoo as
well interesting what's interesting is
that it's it's where's where's it going
to go and I think it's really hard to
make Facebook victim and believe me
facebook to make facebook look this good
is really a difficult thing to do who
knows to yahoo for doing that how about
yahoo a victim of their own success of
victim of their own user base of all the
time the water under the bridge on the
internet can yahoo rise again I mean you
know look the 1969 mets won the world
championship I you know Never Say Never
these are smart people um you know they
made mistakes but you know you can cry
over all the mistakes and it's not going
to get you anywhere if they get people
in there if Thompson shows is his medal
if he's as good as he apparently thinks
he is that the board thinks he is it
comes up with the strategic plan takes
the hard decisions yadda yadda yadda
they can uh sure I mean this dude
there's a ton of ifs of course there a
ton of this but you know it's a tough
business okay yes absolutely it's a
fantastic brand and here in Silicon
Valley it seems like you know
yahoo has the image of a you know a
crazy old man shaking his fist at the
internet but it's not it's a great brand
globally a lot of people use it there's
a lot anything with that many users can
be turned into something valuable as far
as I can tell it's still a great brand
this is not a 0 L here this is not you
know think about AOL is still hanging
around you know and it's got a whole
bunch of problems very similar some of
them similar some different but
worldwide this says it's a wonderful
brand it's got a lot of users who are
very happy with its services wonderful
employees I mean the problem at yahoo
has been a crisis of leadership leaders
matter and the problem is Yahoo's
employees have not been well served by
the leaders and they deserve better
leaders because there's some fantastic
people who work there and I you know one
of the reasons I write about it so much
is because I won I think it's offensive
to shareholders what they've been doing
and to its offensive to the really good
employees of y'all so well on that note
