the hell it is for you wherever you are
in the world episode 176 of the 359
podcast on Wednesday februari eighth
good morning afternoon evening on and on
because we're all over the world let's
get a go come to Roger Cheng and our
special guest at Scott Stein today
thanks for living beyond time good to
see you yo well that's a very
appropriate thing to say James will be
dedicating the entire show to Android
wear two point oh and wearables watches
is that something people care about
still people care about time the concept
of time is purple do you care about a
SmartWatch this time travel a part of
the Android wear two point oh yes you
can now travel through taken three point
oh uh yeah it's tough to get people to
care about smartwatches we know that um
but no work we'll probably no dinner
we're gonna break down all the details
Scott has had an extensive amount of
time using the software as well as the
new LG watch watch his watches and he'll
break down and answer all your questions
as awesome as always if you have any
leave them in the comments section Brian
will pick them out and we will answer
them in about four minutes or so all
right let us get through the recording
and we'll come back and hit all your
talking points in the chat and exactly
three minutes and 59 seconds from 32
welcome to the 359 when we talk about
the top tech news of the day only the
crap we want to throw in I'm Roger Cheng
and with me is a very special guest The
Wizard of wearables Scott Stein thanks
first time I've ever been called that
and opaque I called it every time well
Scott is here to break down Android wear
two point oh just got announced as well
as a couple new LG watches yes Scott
first to break down the underwear has
had you know tough time right the
initial launch was kinda iffy people
weren't really on the bandwagon what
makes Android wear two point O different
and better so I'm sure Google knows it's
standing in relation to Apple watch but
you know now Andrew where to is giving a
lot of stuff that should have been on
the watch before and if you have an
Android SmartWatch you'll be really
excited to see a lot of these features
they're going to come to a lot of the
watches android pay so if your NFC you
can academic payments now watch faces
have gotten better particularly if you
know the term complications basically
it's little bits of info that live on
your watch Apple watch as these
basically we get the weather gets steps
and then they're kind of like widgets on
your phone kind like little widget
Sandra were already has some of these
but they're not really like formalized
in the system now you can add a lot some
watch face allow you to add like eight
which sounds crazy but it's really good
cuz you get at a glance info and those a
lot of times become app launcher so
that's how i like to use watches you got
that Google fit has gotten better is it
as good as a Fitbit no but it does more
activity tracking things like that
obviously that's where wearables lie and
those are the main things you know and
it also just runs more on the watch the
apps are meant to now download
completely in work better in offline
mode which is stuff the Apple watch does
Samsung's watches do but then I've only
used them so far on LG's to new watches
which is a different story also a bottom
line how does android wear two point oh
how does the experience compared to
apple watch not as good okay but I think
also i'm looking at the story yeah and a
story done but it's also beta software
i'm looking at this is his pre-release
so it could get better a lot of apps
have not hooked into it yet I found that
something's got a little sluggish times
Google fit didn't seem like it was
thinking quite right but that you know
again might get ironed out I I think
it's a lot more cocoa glanceable it
pop stuff up in your face I'll get used
to with Android wear for Google now
assistant now is like Siri or the others
we press a button and bring it up right
it doesn't speak to you it shows you
text it doesn't really feel that much
different it's not going to feel like an
Amazon echo or Google home it could hook
into more thing so it's overall it's you
say thank goodness it's better but it's
not the best and that could be a problem
you need great watches to take advantage
of it and that's where google and its
relationship to the hardware partners
well speaking of which you spend some
time with LG's two watches which are
sort of the flagship devices for android
2.2 l g watch sport and as you watch
style yeah glad they ditched the weird
or bane name because that didn't make
any sense yeah I'm gonna forget air
being ever excited how are those watches
what's experience like what does it work
to play you basically i want the one
that's in the middle that doesn't exist
because style is thin but it lacks heart
rate elects NFC for android pay so it's
a launch watch it doesn't have android
paid kind of strange it does your basic
stuff at the battery life is really
short it lasted less than a full day as
we've been wearing it which is not great
but it looks kind of clean it's 250
which is not the cheapest android wear
watch right then sport ties everything
in like the Samsung gear s3 it's an LTE
phone ok plus gps + SmartWatch it's huge
it's a gauntlet and it's on your right
it actually makes the f3 look smaller
yeah I know it makes s3 look really
small that's insane which is insane it's
really big I it definitely works as a
phone in standalone mode that's kind of
cool if you if you want that but you
have to pay for data service for that
like ten dollars a month yeah um it's
$350 not an unreasonable price but the
battery life was kind of a because
that's what happened I took a look at
both his watch is that they are kind of
on the bland looking side right yeah
they're a little bit futuristic generic
right is what I would say so it's not as
good as the samsung gear s3 which in and
of itself was not as good as i would
have liked it to be so you're in the
middle okay well that more of these
stories for more of these stories check
us out Cena I'm Roger Cheng I'm Scott
Stein stay tuned thanks for listening
good talk yeah that's a very exciting
new passion a lot of animation yeah I
was trying applause I know it's like a
marathon of just information Gus you
have mixed feelings it's so hard to give
us x and right rightfully this is here's
the problem you're looking at beta
pre-released ups you're like what is our
final judgment that's why we don't have
rated reviews right on these watches yet
because you can't come to a consensus
you got to give it a fair shake through
launch do you think it'll actually get
better once you get sort of the main the
full software intact or I think it will
but look are these gonna make people
care the bottom line or these gonna make
people care more about smart watches no
yeah that's really kind of the takeaway
because the Apple watch is sitting at
the top in a war of attrition I think
where it has a lot of companies going
out of business they've made some good
solid improvements nothing ground
shaking but useful yeah i think the like
when apple last year started focusing
kind of pivoting i hate using that word
pivoting towards the device is less of a
fashion item but more of a activity
tracker kind of capitalizing on the
fitness aspect of yeah yeah that was a
smart move that in I'm not sure Samsung
has done that I'm not sure you know
android wear has done that really well
like they're still trying to present
this as a SmartWatch and I think people
don't want a smart watch it I care about
Apple watch as a SmartWatch they care
about it as a fitness tracker yes and
they care about it as a statement or
something that they can feel hooks into
their stuff and there's something's
apple watch does that are pretty simple
there are other things that are really
complicated about it that um that don't
work that well and that's probably the
best because you know pebble I always
liked but pebble does not exist anymore
it put it in what it ever was so now
it's part of Fitbit who knows what's
going to happen and even that hit its
wall was more about certain features
samsung yet samsung samsung makes great
hardware those watchers are really
interesting it's a problem because if
you hook them up to an android phone
that's why i have a hard time
recommending them there's a lot of hook
ins yeah you have to get into samsung
stuff you're already using
you have to create a Samsung Account you
really be in the full samsung ecosystem
take advantage of it like I use a trick
soul what the s3 yeah and it's not the
best experience and I switched it over
do an iphone it's even worse like it's
it's kinda like this this kind of half
experience that you're getting right
it's a double hooking and at least when
you know the the Apple Apple watch
experiences is is the idea that you you
set it up it's not easy to set up and
remove stuff it's kind of annoying but
but once you're in there it's it's fully
hooked in its part of one account system
yep you know versus Google and Samsung
NS health and a lot of permissions a lot
of things I'm granting in bridge conduit
a feeling super comfortable with all the
permissions of yo in this age it freaks
me out yeah I know it's like you can't
it's hard to keep your eye on what's
going on but it when you know you think
like I am agreeing to so many different
things right now it's like eula city and
then um I yeah I don't know it's it's
numbing then if you want third party
apps you got to have bridge conduits for
that and boy this sounds like fun and I
look at wearables and I'm exhausted so
right the average person forget it
Google at least when you get say this on
the four minutes the reason I'd be more
likely to recommend Andhra whereas at
least it's part of your google life yeah
and if you're an Android user that's
what you're after so you've got
assistant that's what you want you want
assistant on your wrist you know it's
going to be hooked in better I don't
think it's perfect right now but it's
more of a watch and Google's and Adams
watch family I have an unfortunate
battery dietary died but because it's
it's who this thing this is the style
this is the smaller room how'd you watch
style which is not the most stylish
watch it's an unfortunate name for the
style it's okay I like a dinner are
definitely over sells itself by calling
itself the style I would call it the LG
watch neat it's like a nice clean air
called not on the rocks right it's a
clean hair cut it definitely I wouldn't
mind wearing it I think is a clean it is
clean I'll give you that so many watches
I hate when they start looking like
things that escape like a fancy jewelry
shop from the 70s right I don't know is
like for like bangles and bulb I
actually like this I like the f3 design
like I know you you thought it looks too
much like an actual watch I thought I
kind of liked it I like it I like it
more going back to it that
the thing is following up boy that is a
lot nicer to me than the two Colonels
right so let's let's throw some
questions yeah we're gonna run out of
time quick but let's let's hit the chat
Jim and Jacob let's talk when in and who
the updates coming for Jim and Jacob are
hoping that their Sony SmartWatch 3 and
moto respectively are going to be on the
list for the young day so good question
we actually put a story up on Sina today
about all the watches that are getting
updates I forgot which one specifically
are it's a long list but the list is on
cnet com yes look blog I can definitely
check it out there but be comfy
comforted knowing the list is actually
quite long and here's the list I'm
actually going to pull it up and talk to
you about it Sony's is not on I'm sorry
to say but moto 360 is which all of them
the 2015 now if you have the first
generation moto 360 you probably had a
lot probably out of luck yeah it's a
long list it's it's more current things
aces n watch two and three casio fossil
q founder no one's bought these watches
you got a fossil q like exactly now the
ones we care about more i would say
huawei watch which has always been our
top android wear pick for a while man
that gets it the new Moto 360 was a new
meaning 2015 onwards those get it um the
tag tags connected watch yes I better
get updated if yeah I know I wanted to
be updated for life I wanted to
regenerate and for more how much is that
thing cost it's a couple thousand
fifteen hundred thousand fifteen I mean
to be there are actual tag watches are
way more expensive so they can look at
vango look it's it's a it's a bargain
but they're also ones like actually
watch urbane LTE gets the updates if
makes sense though LG's super cuz of
Google and watch urbane and LG watch are
not the very first generation of Android
wear watches if you had that makes sense
you have a gear live or a LG watch not
the round but the original school
err you're not gonna be in luck what
other questions do we got uh what about
LG watch sport is that on the list LG
watch well jus export is the new one ok
so that's coming that's the one that we
just looked at got it is there another
is an earlier version of there was the
LG watch are the LG watch urbane and the
watch urbane LTE got those knees are
ridiculous all the names are always dum
la de calor of Smart Watch history like
you have to pull a strange chart out
they've run out of letters in terms
names for these things and let's talk
about specific time when is this rolling
out good question there's not been so
these watches the the watch sport and
the watch style are available at the end
of this week they're gonna be the first
to get it the others are getting it on a
roll out now you know how Android is
work oh yeah they Google had said that
these are coming but there but there's
no unfortunately this time around
there's no like carrier feirense aside
from some of the I guess the lt1 but
right so these are can be updated
yourself I think that these should be
happening pretty soon yeah but they are
going to be rolling out might not like
all of a sudden on Friday you're gonna
get your update maybe maybe not but it's
not there's no specific date updates
that we've seen so you may have to hang
in there but those will get it I imagine
and you'll be I think you'll be better
off however we have not tested Andrew
where to point o on old watches I don't
know so that's why we have not said it's
aiming to make it better it should make
it better i would i would imagine we got
imagine the timing for the updates are
gonna differ from manufacturer
manufacturer just to make sure because
things are they tweak the software
different ways yeah they've got to go
and we've got a vet all this stuff so I
measure the battery I wouldn't happen
anytime soon I want help I hope the
battery life doesn't get impacted me
again we're testing this on on new
watches that we've never had any
comparative results on so if you put it
on an old watch what what is the battery
life difference Google didn't talk about
any gains or losses in battery life with
Andrew were two point oh so we don't
know alright so our buddy Michael is
back in the chat he's been with a long
time data Michael Scott he wants you to
put apple watch side by side with the LG
support
I don't have the Apple watch on me
nothing not literally Oh side by side oh
that's what I thought he'd meant to like
Oh at least side by side to come here
give us your lap spective um but give it
to us in like 15 seconds I think the
Apple watch is a much more polished
experience the one thing that Apple does
right now they think is really smart is
they're not creating too many variants
in lines yeah in fact what's really cool
is that their entire lineup does heart
rate their entire lineup does Apple pay
now you're going to have some manager
watches that don't have android pay
you're gonna have some that don't have
heart rate I mean whatever reason core
dilemma though is less rain unless share
an iphone user Apple watch is irrelevant
to you right hmm exactly yeah you can't
use it anyway yeah yeah so would I would
I go switch over just to use an Apple
watch I mean probably not um I think
it's more about iphone in total iOS
experience but I like that it's all in
there however I'm not wild with Apple
watch a series to that the GPS functions
are made so automatically invisible that
you really have almost no awareness of
them you can't turn gps on off it only
works with certain activities it works
when Apple wants it to and it hooks into
things that Apple deems it to hook into
so it's so invisible I guess all GPS
works when at one when an app wants it
to but it just feel you do feel like a
little removed like where is it I don't
even see it I'm not aware of it I love
that the Apple watches swim friendly
right that's something that there are
some Andrew watches that do that I think
it's like water resistance is always
nice um it have more of it but i also
get so much smaller that's the thing
that kills me about LG watch sport is it
super big so if you want a gps sport
watch you may not want a monster watch
and at least apple watches is pushing
that other they can be fair and more
normal size to be fair if you're a
runner you're probably used those big
clunky gps watches right you are but
even dan graziano who wears running
watches all the time basically looked at
the sport was like oh my god yes i want
what is that um it's super big it's
super big and i don't know how many more
times like I said it's it's
and it doesn't feel like it needed to be
that large so we're hoping that it's
going to scale down hopefully some point
the price is going to come down as the
math you in the chat is mentioned the
asking if we know any speculation about
when android watches are going to start
to come down I can't really imagine that
we have much to say about that outside
of we hope to yo guesses I mean I think
you have so many people making watches I
think that's going to start happening
asus has made a couple of really
competitive priced Andrew where
smartwatches I mean Marvin Chevron's and
watch two yep yeah super cheap does em
watch three which we actually never did
a full review umber we're going to now
that it's gained the 2 point 0 update
we're going to do lots of quick reviews
on all these watches to try to get you
an answer as soon as possible about what
the best one is because that we're
curious I think it's going to be a
surprise as far as like ones will emerge
you go this is now the grit best one I
think they'll get really super
affordable $150 you'll see once floating
out there you know I really hope this
becomes the beginning of really
customizable Android wear watches that
start looking very different from each
other so that you there's a reason to
buy one versus another not locked on to
that that you can only get those
features of that watch but just
something a little yeah they all do kind
of look they don't kind of the same
shape and design there I'll come off I
know that's why I said Jan Erik looking
because they all kind of look similar
but then then I also feel like at the
same time so I say well I want them to
all be different and then I think well
how annoying would it be I don't like
that Apple made its own nike sport watch
in the sense that has a few features
that are only baked into that one it's
like special edition game consoles it's
like it's like now I can only get those
Siri hooked in nike controls on that
nike watch will widen or that watch face
Apple dozen have a watch space store
which is crazy why can't you get that
Nike watch face on your regular apple
watch by a special version like I
wouldn't want to have the casio one have
one thing I like and then i go by can't
get that although you know what that's
really that's really the reality of how
these companies think they need to have
something differentiates it's true well
rightly so rapid-fire last couple of
points yeah Mike's rebuttal is he's
waiting for the Google pixel watch yeah
which by the way we talked to Google
about that that's a follow-up story did
so far there
that they're not really hot a lot of the
rumors were that they were gonna have a
pixel watch for Andrew where to point o
obviously that's not the case we came up
we have the LG watches instead so I
think it's good I wish it were rats
gonna come down we should wrap things up
yeah thank you Scott very much for
joining us ya know always a pleasure to
have you if you like anything you saw or
heard here trick us on a cnet our
