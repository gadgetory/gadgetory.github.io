cnet today we're going to take a look at
the Logitech cube mouse so this tiny
little mouse is designed to be both a
mouse and a presentation device you can
use it just like you would any Mouse put
it on a table scroll around it works
fine in windows you can click left and
right and it recognizes that it even has
a scroll function based on touch if you
drag your finger down and behaves just
like you'd expect right on the screen
for presenters though as soon as you
take the mess up off the table if you
come as a click device you hold it
upright and click and it will advance to
your next page in a presentation turn it
upside down and click the bottom side
again and it goes back up so it's
obviously a wireless mouse but it's also
a member of logitech's unified device
family now that means is it comes with
the USB micro receiver that can receive
signals from up to six different
logitech unified input devices so if
you're using this and you have say
keyboard and some other set of logitech
gear you can just use a single USB
receiver to kind of simplify the
connection now it's certainly a welcome
feature and we also like that it's
rechargeable you can see this little
micro USB input here you can connect
that are to your system to charge it
using it as a mouse is fine and short
bursts it works say on an airplane tray
but it's not great for precision work so
if you're fiddling around with a lot of
spreadsheets your gaming may be using
some design apps it's really not going
to do the job for you for presenters
it's a nice little product it's small
fits in your hand it's obviously very
portable and the advance and backward
features work well enough but we wish it
had a little bit more functionality say
a laser pointer or maybe you can scroll
to the right and left something else to
sort of justify the price tag of this
thing because logitech wants seventy
dollars for this cube mouse now it's
certainly appealing it's portable it has
a nice functionality but i'm not sure
seventy dollars is really what i want to
pay for something as small as this
particularly we can get other
presentation mice out there they're
fully featured devices and come with
laser pointers all that said the masses
of course pretty unique looking so i
expect logitech will sell some pretty
much on the strength of this design now
while the cube moss does work well
enough i wish there was a little bit
more value here to justify its price so
i'm rich brown this is the logitech
cuteness
