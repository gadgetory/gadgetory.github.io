available to order at the end of April
at the earliest the more mainstream
price computers with the new core i5 and
core i3 processors will appear around
the end of May there won't be any
special sticker in the store you'll have
to check the model number to see if it's
the 3rd generation the part number
begins with a 3 you probably won't
notice the difference of performance for
everyday use the big improvement though
is with graphics Facebook has whipped
out its wallet again this time for
patents facebook paid 550 million
dollars to Microsoft to acquire several
hundred pads these are patents that
Microsoft just bought off of AOL a few
weeks ago so now Facebook owns 650 of
aol's patents and it also snagged 750 of
IBM's patents last month Facebook is
going public next month and wants to
beef up its patents list hoping it can
also protect them against lawsuits and
in other news we're watching the Samsung
Galaxy Nexus smartphone has landed at
sprint for two hundred dollars the
positive it supports google wallet the
negative it'll run on 3g until Sprint's
4G LTE network is ready this summer that
is if you're in one of the markets with
the new 4g network skype version 1 point
0 is now available for Windows Phones
the free skype for windows app works
over Wi-Fi or a 3g network but for it to
work each person needs to have that
Skype app open this replaces the beta
test version that came out in February
and Google has cut back on several
programs and services in order to put
more focus in other areas some of
cuts include an end to support for
google sync for blackberry the end of
