precedent and one of the most hotly
awaited desktops of the air the new Mac
Pro is one step closer to being released
now we know the price it's going to
start at $29.99 and we kind of know the
release date is coming up sometime in
December now this file Oh like desktop
is lot different from Apple's
consumer-level systems and that it has
Intel Xeon processor instead of the
regular II of core i7 it's got an D fire
pro graphics then 4i and you know video
work graphic design stuff like that get
12 gigs of ram you get 256 gig SSD you
get a bunch of the other improvements
that have already come - other Mac
systems like that 802 got 11 AC Wi-Fi
that faster pci-e SSD Apple says that
this model is 70% more power efficient
than previous Mac Pro desktop and you
have to consider that's a really big
full tower system so it's kind of hard
to compare them they say however that
because it's so efficient it runs so
coolly it's very quiet you don't get a
lot of fan noise they say it is about as
loud as having one of those little Mac
Mini desktops next to you
having an extra client like that it's
going to be super helpful if you're
working let's say music production and
you don't want a lot of loud fans going
off while you're trying to mix something
so the Mac Pro desktop it's coming in
December we don't know exactly when it's
gonna be $29.99 I'm sure you can that
and all sorts of other options to drive
up the price even more I'm Dan Ackerman
with the Mac Pro at Apple's October 2013
