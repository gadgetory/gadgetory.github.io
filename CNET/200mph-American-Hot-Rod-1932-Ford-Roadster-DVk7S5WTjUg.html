raised California and this is a 1932
Ford American hot rod designed to run a
Bonneville story behind the car is that
in 1940 a Southern California guy named
Jack Kokura k UK ura bought the car as a
32 roadster he then went off to war came
back in 45 in 46 he started hot riding
it he put 1946 Ford hubcaps on it things
like that they ran it at Bonneville that
year and every year after that until
1960 so in 1946 he ran with a Ford
flathead engine and in Stromberg
carburetors a standard hot rider setup
back then he ran 97 miles an hour and
then every year subsequent he would do
more hot rod stuff lighten the car go to
three twos two fours different
carburation and and his times moved up
from there then in 1956 he put a 454
cubic inch Chrysler Hemi in it with a
supercharger built by Don Hampton and he
went 163 miles an hour and then in 1957
he went 171 and in 1958 he 183 miles an
hour and then the last time it ran with
him driving with his arm in a cast
because we have home movie footage of it
he ran 200 miles an hour through the
first trap at Bonneville and the way it
works there you have to do a run this
way turn around come back the other way
for it to count and he declined because
he spun after he cleared the trap so he
spun this car at 200 miles an hour and
the way they taught the drivers back
then when you started the spin in
you don't panic you floor it and you let
it run out of fuel because they ran on
nitromethane on very small tanks not
gasoline and so they generally occur
like this would have enough fuel in it
to make a run the equivalent of five
miles and warm up to them make the traps
and then run out of gas at the end you
kind of counted on that and so rather
because if you let your foot off the gas
on the surface like that then you roll
so he spun this thing until it basically
died out at 200 miles an hour so he was
a better man than me or any of us and
then he kept it until he died in 2005 he
was a founding member of the gear
grinders Car Club in Southern California
he was in Bell California which is Bell
helmets later became a big hot rod thing
and we have a picture of him from 2005
right before he died with the car and
then other pictures of him family photos
as a young kid out of the army first
with the car so there's a record of all
that with the car and then before he
died he made a several pages of
handwritten list of everything ever done
to the car by him or any of the other
three people who worked on it for 65
years
well the way I ended up with it was I
wasn't looking for a hot rod I tell you
the truth I never believed that that
there was a car like this that existed
because my interest has always been in
original cars all the other cars I have
are just original unrestored cars of
various makes but on eBay the car had
been not listed for maybe two hours and
there were over 200 responses to this
car everyone stunned no one believed it
could exist and so when I got on there
at about the third hour bidding had
ended so when you see that you assume
well somebody with deep pockets saw this
and got like maybe it's gone to Jay Leno
or whatever and so I assumed that was it
but there was a phone number and so I
called a number I left a message and I
just said you know I saw this amazing
four
I know it's gone I get it I know there's
not another one but if there was ever
anything similar please give me a call
ten minutes later I get a call and it
was the broker and he said we've still
got the car and I said you know like how
can that even be true and he said well
we got such response so fast that eBay
thing we realized our reserve price was
too low that there was such a demand for
the car so we we ended the auction and
we assumed that all these people would
call us and he said we've been waiting
by the phone nobody's called you're the
first guy so I said how much and told me
I said done and then we put on a trailer
in New Jersey and bought it to
California where it's back in its home
now that's an adventure ride you know
it's it the way it is right now it's
still set up to run 180 200 miles an
hour on a flat surface and it has a
push-button desoto transmission rather
than a clutch and a shifter which was
common with a lot of the big horsepower
things because it's more efficient way
to do the power doesn't the torque
doesn't blow the transmission it easily
and to drive it because it's set up with
so much play to go fast and plate line
it has an enormous turning radius so it
would be not just thrilling but you know
dangerous to drive around something like
this so I live in a small town in
Northern California when and every month
I meet with other crazy car guys and we
just bring an interesting car and we
drive ten minutes the little coffee
place so I take it there and I do that I
it's legal I mean it has California
plates it's a legal car to drive but
it's illegal with the exhaust and it has
some of the first disc brakes taken from
airplanes after the war Earhart discs so
it has 1946 airport Earhart disc brakes
which you would think would be a great
thing as opposed to a drum brake but in
fact there were terrible brakes and
and but people like them because they
were discs so it's like a big deal that
they're on there but when you drive it
the calipers the pots on it tend to
stick and grab or crack and so you're in
it you can't hear because it's so noisy
you're moving the steer wheel back and
forth to go at all you're paying a lot
of attention and and when you hit the
brakes
often one the front right will grab and
release the other way so you often it's
as if you're just starting to go on and
it feels like some giant grabbed a wheel
and yank you forward so then you have to
punch the brakes to release that you
know so you know it's good for an old
guy because it you grow neurons you know
what I mean the way they tell you do
learn a language it's like learning a
language you know it's a it's it's only</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
