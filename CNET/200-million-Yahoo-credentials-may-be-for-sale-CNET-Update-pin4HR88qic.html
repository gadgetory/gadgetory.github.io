a seller going by the name of peace of
mind is currently selling what is
claimed to be 200 million Yahoo user
credentials the data is available for
sale publicly at the price of three
bitcoins that's around 1800 u.s. dollars
or around 1,400 British pounds the
sellers also known as peace this hacker
has been connected to the LinkedIn
breach that's a mark zuckerberg Twitter
account hacked peace also has ties to a
myspace act that compromised over 300
million accounts and a Twitter breach
affecting over 70 million accounts yahoo
says it is aware of the sale but has not
confirmed whether the data is legitimate
the breach was first reported by
motherboard the publication also
obtained five thousand records and it's
limited tests of two dozen motherboard
found many to be valid Yahoo credentials
peace told motherboard that he's
privately traded the Yahoo data that
he's now publicly selling he also said
that data is most likely from 2012 so
should you panic if you have or had a
yahoo account according to Zack
Whittaker security editor for ZDNet
maybe not he says that data sold by
piece are hit or miss since the data
could date back to 2012 it's likely that
the majority of credentials for sale may
not work Whitaker added that the Yahoo
data was not likely due to a new hack it
could be the product of a larger hack
someone would find all the yahoo email
addresses related to that hack and tests
already exposed passwords in the case
that password was used on multiple sites
and that does it for us amaya's Akhtar
