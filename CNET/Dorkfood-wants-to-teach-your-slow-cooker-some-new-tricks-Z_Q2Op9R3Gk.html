we're going to take a look at sous-vide
cooking which means to cook things at a
consistent temperature in a water bath
with circulation and vacuum sealing to
help keep the flavors in you're probably
saying that's a crock pot right
that's not a sous-vide cooker well with
the dork food DSV it can be a sous-vide
cooker now the DSV is really just this
device here it's an industrial-grade
temperature controller that uses this
black rubber probe to monitor the
temperature of the water so you're going
to stick this into the crock pot filled
with water make sure it's not touching
the sides and then it'll start reading
the temperature it'll tell you at 71 you
hold down the set button and that is
going to set it to the temperature you
want so you just get up to 136 140 145
whatever you want hit set again and then
BOOM
it's going to start heating up to that
temperature using the crock pots actual
heating element you'll plug your
crock-pot into the door QD sv and it'll
cycle the power on and off to get to
that target temperature and keep it
there now this approach won't work with
all slow cookers you need a slow cooker
that as soon as you turn it on its
heating up so this really means this one
of the physical dial a cheap one like
this one where you can turn it to high
leave it on high as soon as you plug it
in it's on high that'll work
if you aren't sure if yours will work
just set it to high and unplug it and
plug it back in if it goes back to high
it'll work with dork food if not you
might need to get a different one now we
tested the DSV alongside the Innova the
nama coup some other sous-vide cookers
that are a little more comprehensive
those have built-in heating elements and
built-in fans for circulating the water
and maintaining that temperatures
consistency the dork food doesn't have
that doesn't have a fan so I wasn't sure
be able to do as good of a job but lo
and behold it did great
it poached eggs it cooked salmon I was
able to get nice medium-rare edge to
edge pink meat in it pork ribs you name
it it kept up with a Nova nama COO in
every test did a very nice job the dork
food DSV retails for $99 and that's a
pretty attractive price point compared
to the Innova cooker which costs $1.99
and nama coo which sells for $2.99
unlike those though the dork food
doesn't have the attractive design or
the all in one aspect doesn't have a
touchscreen or a physical dial you can
only set to whole
degrees you can't set to tenth of a
degree like you can with nama ku but
still I think it offers a lot of value
for anybody looking to experiment with
sous-vide who doesn't care so much about
a glamorous looking kitchen so all in
all kind of a dorky approach to
sous-vide cooking but one that I think
does the job really well thanks for
