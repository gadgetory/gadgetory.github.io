the buzz report the show about the tech
news that everyone is talking about this
week I know you're watching this from an
ipad line but hey at least you didn't
lose your phone that would be terrifying
plus the end of the encyclopedia age but
first the gadget of the week the gadget
of the week is the HP envy 14 Specter
and man is this thing pretty the design
is pretty brand-new in the laptop world
and that is saying something the lid is
one hundred percent Gorilla Glass the
body is a 14-inch ultrabook and once you
open it up it looks just enough like a
macbook air to make sure you feel like
one of the cool kids I do wish it how to
standard 256 gig solid-state drive
instead of 128 don't get me wrong this
ain't no netbook the spectre starts at
1399 so plan to pay extra for the design
although it is the kind of design worth
paying for if you're not a fingerprint
phobe of course because smudge central
and now for the news the only gadget
will be talking about come next week is
of course the third-generation iPad
which goes on sale on Friday Apple has
cleverly stopped taking online orders so
that they can guarantee big lines of
excited people out front and that's
actually really all we have to say about
it except you know expect the normal
like the big lines and the excitement
and way too many news stories then the
iPad actually seems to warrant and of
course are full and in depth review on
cnet com it's actually pretty amazing
that iPad hysteria is getting kind of
boring while no android tablet has
really made it off the ground yet ouch
in other news this week Walmart's will
allow you to bring your old DVDs into
the store and buy some digital access to
them so you can stream your own movies
back to yourself for a small fee about
two to four dollars Walmart is using the
new movie studio drm and digital
distribution scheme called ultraviolet
or as i like to call it pay me again
this is why they won't let netflix have
any good movies really speaking of
coming into the digital age after two
hundred forty-four years the
encyclopedia
your Britannica is going out of print
and it's going online only the president
of Encyclopedia Britannica said the web
is just a better tool for information
it's constantly updated and it's much
more interactive and man somehow this
seems like huge news I mean I really
thought they'd get rid of the a and
encyclopedia way before they would go
digital and finally let's have a look at
what's clogging the tubes it's you on
your phone constantly and so connected
that you're actually afraid to be
without your phone a new study finds
that a fear called nomophobia is on the
rise noma phobia is the fear of being
without your cell phone this digital
password company did a study and
reported that sixty-six percent of the
people polled said they were terrified
to lose or be without their phones and
women were more afraid than men also
seventy-seven percent of people aged 18
to 24 reported feeling noma phobic
treatment includes gradually spending
more time away from the phone or just
imagining spending time without it
that's just ridiculous I mean come on
people it's ridiculous and that's the
buzzer port for this week everyone I'm
Molly wood and thank you for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
