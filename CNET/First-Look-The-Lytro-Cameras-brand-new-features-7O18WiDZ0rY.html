and we wanted to give you a first look
at some of the new hot features for the
Lytro camera is text most buzz-worthy
camera and it's shipping right now from
Lytro com now to catch you up to speed
the light rail camera is unlike any
other with a unique design that uses
light field technology to capture all
the light information color intensity
and direction the light is moving in a
single picture now you won't need a
focus you just take a picture and with
all this information you can choose the
subject or your object you want to focus
on after the fact with what they call
their living pictures now they've added
a few new improvements to their
interface where you can swipe from the
bottom of the screen and you'll get a
menu bar for battery life and the amount
of picture space available but you'll
also get a new mode called creative mode
by default the camera is set to light
rose everyday mode with their default
settings that's set to a 3x optical zoom
but it has limitations with how you can
compose shots creative mode unlocks the
8x optical zoom range and allows you to
control and composure shots like let's
take an extreme macro shot we've seen
shots like this in popular food
photography and also to showcase
textures or you've seen portrait shots
where subject is in focus but the
background is completely blurred out it
will also allow you to zoom in and out
of a subject after you've set the focal
point for a more dramatic effect and
better shot composition control now this
is all part of the creative mode but an
all in focus mode that point of shoot
camera users are familiar with will be a
software update in the first half of
this year now you can also interact with
your pictures directly on the camera
screen but sharing is a big piece of the
puzzle now the software lives locally on
the camera and you can install it when
you plug it in it's only currently Mac
compatible but lytro says there will be
a windows version of the software coming
by the end of 2012 now each picture is
stored locally on your computer that
takes up about 16 megs through their
Lytro app you'll upload your living
pictures that are stored on their own
servers they said it's unlimited storage
right now and they'll process them down
to about a 500k 21 Meg file depending on
how many multiple perspectives you have
now you can then share that living
picture through social networks like
Facebook Twitter and Google Plus or
embed them in light shows flash or html5
player you'll also be able to right
click on a picture and convert it into a
1080 x 1080 jpeg file that's compressed
down to size for you
now the light show camera is only
available through their website at lytro
calm starting at 399 for an aching model
and they say it will be available in
unnamed retail channels later this year
so there you have it I'm Bryant on with
your quick first look at some of the new
features with the launch of the truly
revolutionary light show camera</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
