to the future of a show where we take a
look at a major tech company and where
they might be going next year in 2013
today it's all about Facebook and who
better to talk to us about Facebook than
executive editor Paul Sloane so Paul yes
next year what will change with Facebook
as far as the user is concerned yeah I
think you're going to see more of what
we've been seeing the last few months
which means more ads great I mean
they've been rolling out adds a lot of
mobile they say they're not it's not
overkill but it's starting to get a
little you know a little crowded and
cluttered but this is where they're
making money and this is where their
focus is and as much as Mark Zuckerberg
talks about you know this sort of social
mission of connecting the world the fact
is they're now a public company as we
all know and the pressure is on and his
employees want the stock to go up and
that means more advertising and the
question is how much more can they do
before they upset people absolutely
before the users start to you know turn
off just go to another site yeah I mean
I've talked to the one of the head
designers at Facebook who designs for
mobile and he says the biggest battle
that he has is that little button that
takes you to the home screen he lives in
fear of how many seconds it is before
someone just checks out interesting so
something we've also seen developed in
the latter half of 2012 is Facebook
gifts do you think that's going to grow
yeah I mean this is a great sort of
niche business for facebook that i
actually think could become less niche
and quite big they're adding more and
more partners I think it's mostly
smaller brands they have some like baby
gap and they have you know some known
brands and this wine and there's sort of
but they're not they don't have you know
the huge brands out there because they
don't need facebook and they don't want
to pay Facebook but it does make
Facebook some money obviously sure they
take a cut they take a cut through every
true every transaction if it's your
birthday and I decided to send you a
gift you know and once once you accept
it it Facebook and I put in my credit
card information which is another thing
facebook wants is a lot of credit cards
on file yes they take a cut the cut
varies depending on the on the merchant
or the retailer but you know
it could be a billion-dollar business
what it'll be by the end of next year I
don't know it off would be quite that
but it will add up in 2012 we saw
facebook buy instagram a pretty big
acquisition what types of acquisitions
do you see in 2013 you know it's hard to
imagine the making big acquisitions
people have wanted and I would love to
see them by Spotify I know they've you
know it makes sense sean parker's
involved with Spotify he was the
founding president of Facebook sure in a
lot of ways Spotify is really tied at
the hip with Facebook however I can't
imagine it happening just because of the
difficulties of negotiating with the
record labels and Facebook sees itself
as this platform it wants all this stuff
to happen via and on facebook and
doesn't want to be the source so it
might want to lead you as a place to buy
things but it doesn't necessarily mean
it wants to be amazon right it doesn't
want to have to fulfill all it doesn't
want to you know be that part of the
equation and i think it's the same thing
with music is that it is entertaining as
it is the idea that it would buy Spotify
I also think it would be interested in
Pinterest for different reasons I don't
think pinterest would want to sell I
think Pinterest has its eyes and going
public yeah and growing bigger and yeah
yeah and they're too though it's you
have to ask just because you're really
successful on pintura de they're very
successful on Facebook does that mean
Facebook has to own them or can they
just use the traffic use the engagement
and use the data which is really what
they want that's credit card numbers
quite well more than that they want to
know your age your gender what you shop
for when you give to how much you spend
they want to know everything so that
when you're walking around in your phone
since facebook's mobile mobile mobile it
knows what to target you with 2012 is a
huge year for Mark Zuckerberg not only
did his company go public in May but he
got married he kind of came out as a
businessman this fall what's next for
him well he turns 29 yes let me die old
man you know there was a lot of doubt
after the messy IPO about whether Mark
Zuckerberg was the right man for the job
that really changed in early September
when he gave this one lock particular
live interview in which he just sort of
went from being this guy with the social
mission to this guy who was coming out
strong as a businessman he hit on start
of talking about the thing that everyone
was worried about which is mobile
and he just kept talking about mobile it
suddenly mobile wasn't a problem for
facebook as it was before the IPO and
around the IPO but it was an opportunity
which is all they talk about now is
mobile at mobile as an opportunity yeah
and you know he just he just kept
talking about how the user experience
could be great and we could make a lot
of money and Wall Street wanted to hear
that and really since then there's been
ups and downs but you know the company
has been doing quite well in the stock
last month or so is done really well I
mean it's still you know ten dollar shy
of IPO price but it's going the right
direction and so I think you know
Zuckerberg just has to keep the campaign
up and be really vocal about you know
commitment to Wall Street right the
mission to move forward yeah well
obviously a lot to keep our eyes on next
year with Facebook clearly millions of
us around the world will be so thank you
so much for the predictions sure Paul
Sloan I'm Kara Tsuboi thanks for
