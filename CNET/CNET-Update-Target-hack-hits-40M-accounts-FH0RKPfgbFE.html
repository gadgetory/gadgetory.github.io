they have to cancel their credit cards
I'm Bridget Carey and this is your CNET
update hackers have stolen information
on 40 million credit and debit cards
from Target store shoppers hackers were
able to get customer names credit and
debit card numbers expiration dates and
also the three digit security code on
the back of those cards this impacts
anyone who's shopped at a u.s. Target
store between November 27th and December
15th of course that's right smack in the
middle of the biggest holiday shopping
time Black Friday weekend if you shopped
at a Target store you need to watch your
credit card or bank statements for any
unusual activity right now it looks like
online shoppers were spared and Target
says the system is safe now to use your
card if you go shop now target is
working with law enforcement to hunt
down the hackers many airlines won't bug
you anymore about turning off your
electronic mobile devices during takeoff
and landing but you still can't make a
phone call on the plane that may change
because the Federal Communications
Commission is considering to allow
in-flight phone calls there is some good
news for those of you that would be
irritated by chatty neighbors both Delta
and JetBlue said that even if the FCC
allows in-flight phone calls they won't
both airlines said they want to keep
flights quiet for customers but
customers would be allowed to text and
send emails on mobile devices for those
of you with a Windows Phone there are
two new Xbox media apps available
there's Xbox video and Xbox music
preview these apps let you stream movies
shows and music it's handy for switching
viewing between devices so say if you
start watching a movie on your phone you
can switch to the TV with the Xbox and
it'll pick up where you left off Google
often hides little tricks into its
software or websites the latest trick
helps you get into the holiday spirit
with Christmas carols first you have to
open the Google Search app on iOS or
Android then you launch a voice search
or you can even type in the phrase ok
Google now let's go caroling in response
you'll get a list of carols along with
lyrics and a bouncing ball and the song
can play from your phone it's a bit of
activity for kids and for spreading
Christmas cheer for all to hear but if
you're not the sing-along type you can
still get in the holiday spirit with
lots of free holiday music many
streaming media services have stations
designed for the holidays you already
know about Pandora but there are also
preset Christmas stations on slacker
Songza and tune in radio that your tech
news update and you can find more
