bounds understanding the bounding
conditions that we have there's
technologies that are in the zooks that
we actually are working on today we have
in prototypes that we've shared though
it doesn't look anything like this as
part of every Lego design process
whenever we're raising new products
whatever they are we always of course
involved the kids in that process we get
a lot of input things that work things
that don't work things they understand
they don't understand and then we make
sure we we turn up those things that
they would really want to see in the
models and then during the creation of
the models where we're really going into
the details about how the models are
made and we're continuously putting the
models back in front of the kids
to get them to play with them to get
them to make sure that things don't fall
off when they drive them around I think
every generation has something that is a
challenge to accept my generation it was
mobile phones the first mobile phones
had fake aerials so that you believe
they could actually communicate and now
you give kid a piece of glass and it's a
nerf of course it can it and I think
that's going to be the same with this
technology as well these machines work
in a site where yes there's no operator
with the machine but there's still
people in a site that are managing
multiple machines or different work
steps within a site and so again to have
that personality or that bit that
connects with the individuals that are
still working and the site is extremely
important and in a lot of cases with
autonomy we want to get people out of
dangerous environments first
it provides that opportunity to take the
person out of dangerous spaces and
allows them to work in a safe
environment they understand that this
machine is something different because
there is no driver's cab there is a
camera there is this little nothing
drunk and they tell us lots of stories
about how it could go in dangerous
environments how it could go places
where we can't go to but be great
because then it could do this or this
you know all sorts of stories and it was
really interesting to draw from their
knowledge about what they expected to
see in these types of papers we have the
you know the really knowledgeable guys
and engineers from Volvo that have this
you know incredible knowledge about how
a machine should work today and how it
could work in the future and then you
have the the LEGO Technic designers that
have a huge knowledge of how machines
work because they're making different
versions of them but again maybe they're
not as restricted as the as the real
designers because no one's ever told me
you can't do it so it gives an amazing
opportunity to to get those two teams
together you get the knowledge and you
get this kind of naivety and you put it
together and this is kind of like the
result of that the main purpose that we
have with the wheel loader is to move
material to point A to point B and so
right now an operator is physically in
the machine and doing that now an
operator could be running multiple
machines to do multiple steps of moving
material so still working as a partner
but not actually in the machine to to
channel the work effort the vehicle
knows where it is
the biggest question is you don't
necessarily know that it knows and you
can have that sense that okay it's fine
I believe it's wrong but you miss that
interaction you get just from simply
crossing the road and you see a car
waiting at a junction you instinctively
make eye contact with the driver you
know that they've seen you you know it's
safe to walk across in front of them
it's the same kind of thing this but how
do you get that interaction so by having
this this movable camera which pilot
started as a
to a camera and we said well machine
doesn't need it it's got sensors and
then we kind of realized that well no
the machine doesn't need it but maybe we
need it and so by having this camera
which you know sort of just just turn to
look at you as you walk past or as it
drives past you it gives you that
confidence to know that the machine is
senior and that's really the kind of the
human element for this is is really
important to us and it it really became
I think one of the most proudest
