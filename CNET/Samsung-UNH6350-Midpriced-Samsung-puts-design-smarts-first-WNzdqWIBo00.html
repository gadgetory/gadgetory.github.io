next to one of samsung's mid-range tvs
for 2014 this is the UNH 6350 series
this set doesn't have 3d or a fancy
remote or any of the extra features
found on some of the step-up models but
then again it's pretty value priced one
of the things that I really like about
this set though for the price it's
excellent design if you look at it it
really looks like it's almost all
picture the bezel is only point 3 inches
wide around the top and sides so it
really kind of disappears into the
background the bottom is a little bit
thicker and it's got a little strip of
chrome hear the TV sits atop Samsung's
patented spider stand it's got a nice
swivel to it this TV is available in
sizes from 75 down to 32 inches the very
largest TV doesn't have the swivel stand
in there a little bit bigger but again
this is a really wide range of sizes for
this TV series as a mid range set this
TV includes samsung's full smart TV
suite that includes a quad-core
processor and the best selection of apps
on any TV that includes HBO Go and a
whole bunch of other apps including
games Samsung is touting games a little
bit more than usual this year it does
include a dedicated panel in the smart
TV suite for that the suite itself is a
little more complicated than some of the
others out there namely LG's webOS
system although in a nod to simplicity
when you hit the Smart TV button this
year pops a little band with some of
your best used apps and then you have to
click again to get into the main system
this TV can also control your cable box
the idea is to kind of replace the EPG
and the rest of the on screen displays
of your cable box with Samsung's own
system it works marginally well but
there is some delays when you doubt
those signals through the TV into the
cable box and if you do a lot of DVR and
it's really not the best way to control
that I'd stick with your standard cable
box remote around back there's plenty of
connectivity including 4 HDMI a
component video input and three USB
ports so it also has built-in Wi-Fi now
this price level this TV is mainly about
the design and the features picture
quality is not that great the real
weakness here is black levels as TV
doesn't get quite as deep as some of the
competitors at this price range are even
less expensive on the flip side we did
appreciate its accurate color solid
video processing and very good bright
room picture so all told is just average
picture quality not great but again at
this price range you can do a little bit
better
that's a quick look at Samsung's UNH
6350 series of mid-range 7 2014 I'm new
house plans</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
