box is a black box there really aren't
any black boxes it's kind of like in
airliners and what this really is is the
air bag controller from a 2003 Camry you
see air bags can only work if they know
what's been happening to the vehicle so
they can predict if they need to blow
the bags in the next few milliseconds
this becomes a data recorder for that
purpose and a data processor hence its
existence now here's the business end of
it
what do you see all those connectors in
there couple dozen maybe three dozen
metal connectors this is where the
sensors are wired in from all over the
car
that this thing is monitoring and
recording and those sensors can include
a lot of different things including G
forces that are acting on the car the
accelerator and brake pedal position
steering wheel angle what where you
pointed wheel rotation and vehicle speed
kind of the same thing but not always
depending on the traction situation and
whether the seat belts were buckled and
even if you had someone in the
passenger's seat there's a lot of
information coming in here now what's
not coming in as far as I know none of
these devices yet record GPS coordinates
or cell phone status were you on the
phone texting what have you but probably
it's a matter of time oh by the way in
addition to these sensors and many more
Mercedes cars even capture the position
of the sunroof because in an imminent
rollover they close the windows and the
sunroof thanks to the computations of
their black box now what's inside the
black box it's basically one circuit
board that has got several processors
but what's key about all these
processors is they also have storage
attached to them and that's where this
thing can record some degree of
look-back of all those sensors we talked
about it could be a few seconds up to as
much as 30 seconds I understand
now about 96% of all new cars sold in
the US have a black box right now but
the US government's on the verge of
requiring every car have one going
forward which brings up four interesting
questions first of all what data points
will be required they want to conform
that so every car makers gathering the
same stuff how long of a snapshot is
going to be held of those data points
what kind of technology software or
hardware is needed to read what's in
here there's no USB port believe me and
most importantly who has the right to
that data and when and under what
conditions now at the state level in the
u.s. about 13 states have laws that
specifically govern who can get the
information off these memory chips on a
black box in your car after an accident
it's a very contentious issue another 12
states or so are considering laws the
rest are if you will a black box
the ownership of this thing is
interesting it's in your car so it
belongs to you but the rules of
investigation under Criminal Code will
often trump that and then what if your
car is totaled it just got bought from
you by your insurance company now it's
there black box</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
