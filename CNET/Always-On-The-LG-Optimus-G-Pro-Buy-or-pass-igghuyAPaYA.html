pro i personally am totally in love with
this phone have any of you heard of a
phablet or just that silly name you know
no yes so what we're gonna do today is
each of you will take one phone out and
look for specifically design the
features and the kind of usability of
the phone and then report back to me
okay alright here's your LG optimus pro
for you for you for you feel like Santa
right now hey I'm Peter Brown I'm an
editor at gamespot gamer by day techie
by night and I really like playing
around with mobile devices hey I'm
summer hub and I'm the beer up here in
San Francisco and my favorite thing to
do is off on the back my boyfriend's
motorcycle jump across the Golden Gate
Bridge hello my name is Alex Brown I'm a
student filmmaker and I love shooting on
my tablet device are my phone or
whatever I can really get my hands on
I think the phablet form factor for the
device is probably a strength for gaming
because I think you can obviously see
things a lot more clearly and the
dimensions really help it doesn't feel
like you have to really like very the
device to deepen your hands to get a
good grip on it I can hold it kind of
ginger leaks so that way I can you know
see more of the screen and I'm not
worried about dropping it I really like
the design the smooth edges it's big but
it's nice and thin tough feels like bold
you know put it in my pocket doesn't
even feel like I have my phone in my
pocket simply awkward as far as talking
on the phone maybe it's because I'm a
woman and my hands are smaller my
fingers something that I like to do all
the time when I'm talking on the phone
with people is being able to do stuff
with my other hand but I feel like with
this I kind of have to I don't know it
just it wasn't working for me and it
just didn't feel normal or right so how
many cases of peroni do you think that
you go through for a week or a month
year I'll who say about help of
character week I love that you just as a
joke using this phone with my retailer
is not very easy it's not user-friendly
and I was having a hard time taking
notes with him and I couldn't figure out
how I would open up a presentation to
show him also I couldn't figure out how
to open up an email to show him numbers
of how my businesses and how it's
healthy and I couldn't figure out how to
take notes on it the keyboards nice and
large that big fingers I don't have a
problem hitting the keys and hitting
double keys I can see myself leaving my
tablet at home and just taking this to
class and using this taking notes and
stuff I can't see really any downsides
to the phone seems pretty fast it's a
nice size it's definitely a good
crossover
I was just trying to play a game at the
screen got dark and so when I went to
the settings we need to try to up the
brightness I got a message saying unable
to brighten more due to temperature
increase which is really strange but I
guess it was playing a 3d game and the
processor got a little too warm but I
was only playing the game for 30 seconds
a minute before that happened so that's
kind of a downside it doesn't seem like
they've got a good control on the heat
management fortunately Wow the camera is
really good I can catch some b-roll
shots with this it's pretty good it's
definitely 1080p really clear the
clarity is really nice that grainy at
all doesn't look like i'm shooting with
a cell phone it looks really good only
thing it lacks is I can track focus but
it's a camera on the phone so it's
really nice great camera I can
definitely probably shoot with this I
should have film with this one of the
things that struck me as odd is this
button right here it sort of brings up
an odd memo overlay and so what I was
trying to just do something simple I
found myself inadvertently pressing this
and then drawing on the screen and
having to back out it's kind of got in
the way of productivity I'm trying to
find actually where the camera function
is and I can't actually seem to find it
which is very frustrating are oh there's
a camera Carrie I'm silly Sally now ok
cool that actually looks like it's
really good quality the detail is
actually really beautiful I'm impressed
with that having a phone that takes
really beautiful photos is very
important to me are you guys spent a
little while with the phones testing
things out let's go let's go kind of
down the line what if what are your
first impressions after using it I loved
it I loved the screen I was a bigger
screen I really want to
really yeah really motivate to upgrade
ok so we've sold one LG optimus g pro so
far let's move on to summer what did you
think I was actually extremely
frustrated with the phone I couldn't
figure out a notepad I couldn't find the
camera forever the operating system is
very different for me so yeah ok I would
I wouldn't buy it alright cool and
you're the rubber now cuz we've got a
Thai verdict here yeah that kind of
mixed feelings about the device I like
that it's really light I think the size
is pretty good the build quality is
pretty sturdy I life you can take the
back off to to replace the battery if
you want or add memory from a gaming
standpoint not strong enough right but
as a phone it's a good phone so I think
I know what you're gonna say but would
you buy it yeah we're buy it I'm gonna
be waiting for this to come off all
right think you know no no no what about
you unfortunately no doesn't it just me
ok so to knows any yes I guess that's
kind of a failing grade for our LG
optimus g pro</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
