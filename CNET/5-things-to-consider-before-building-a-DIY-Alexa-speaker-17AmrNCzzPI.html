the only way that you can take the
Amazon Alexa platform for a test-drive
in fact if you have a Raspberry Pi a
speaker and a microphone on hand you can
actually make your own relatively easily
hello as enticing as the DIY Alexa
project may sound however there are some
drawbacks here are five things you
should consider before building your own
Alexa speaker I know what you're
thinking if you build your own Alexa
speaker you can save a little bit of
money that may be true if you have all
the stuff already but if not that's not
true at all the Amazon echo is a hundred
and eighty dollars but you can now pick
up a generation two echo dot for just
fifty dollars if you want to build your
own and you don't have any of the
materials you're gonna have to pay $35
for the Raspberry Pi another ten for the
power supply then you have to buy a
speaker and a microphone and if you go
with something like the matrix creator
which is an add-on IOT dev board for the
Raspberry Pi that's another 100 dollars
and that's not even including the
speaker now you could come out cheaper
than this of course but these components
are going to add up so it's not the
cheapest route you're also sacrificing
appearances the echo echo and Amazon tap
are all pretty discreet devices they're
designed to blend in amongst the things
on a bookshelf or on your kitchen
counter that's not exactly true of
something like a Raspberry Pi if you're
building your own Alexa speaker you're
gonna have to build your own custom
housing for it that doesn't interfere
with the microphone and that's not
always easy of course if you're like me
you may find that the matrix creator and
the Raspberry Pi look cool with exposed
circuitry but that's not for everyone
and you can't just hide it behind
something because that will interfere
with the microphones and it may not hear
you but it also brings me to the next
point not every third party or DIY Alexa
speaker comes with a wake word if you're
using many of the existing tutorials out
there they're not updated to incorporate
the latest API update from Amazon which
includes support for awake word so
instead if you use something like the
matrix creator you have to wave your
hand over the IR sensor to activate it
to tell Alexa to listen and many of the
tutorials out there incorporate a button
press a switch or something else in lieu
of the wake word and what that means is
if you're not in arm's reach of the
Raspberry Pi or the DIY speaker
have to move over to it to wake it up to
speak to it which kind of defeats the
purpose then you have the issue of
response time the official Alexis
speakers tend to get back to you pretty
quickly within one to two seconds
depending on your connection speed but
the DIY option that I've been using for
almost four days now is not so snappy
Alexa what's the weather in Charlotte
it's 63 degrees with mostly sunny skies
today's forecast calls for more
currently and Shawn 63 is agree mostly
nice guys all of this is assuming that
everything goes to plan you're not
dealing with the same reliability as you
would if you went with an official Alexa
speaker if you go with a DIY build the
matrix creator which explicitly states
that it's a LexA project is for
demonstration purposes only is hit or
miss one time you'll boot it up and a
work flawlessly the next time not so
much if you don't want to have to go
through the trouble of building your own
Alexa speaker you can actually test it
out in your browser or by downloading
one of the third-party apps for Android
or iOS but I still think this project is
well worth the time and the effort if
you have the components on hand already
you don't have to spend any money it's a
great way to see how Alexa might fit
into your home without spending a dime
and hearing a Raspberry Pi say hello and
Alexis voice for the very first time
makes all the trouble worth it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
