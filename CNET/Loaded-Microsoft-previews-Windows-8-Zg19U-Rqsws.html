get loaded at the build conference
Microsoft preview the next Windows
operating system and it works on both
tablets and standard desktops and
laptops windows 8 will feature a new
user interface mode inspired by Windows

interface gone are the classic start
menu and icons instead it uses
rectangular tiles to display apps and
information like upcoming calendar
events email and news feeds to encourage
programmers to build apps for Microsoft

into categories like work school family
and city based on information in their
profiles users can also lump connections
in categories called close friends
acquaintances and restricted but
Facebook won't automatically decide who
goes in those categories that's up to
you don't worry any previously created
list will still be there hoping to
compete against plans offered by virgin
mobile boost mobile and metropcs Verizon

prepaid plan on Thursday for fifty
dollars a month the Unleashed plan gives
prepaid customers unlimited talk text
and web but it's only available on three
