cars today hey that even Ford's humble
little c-max comes in two versions that
not everybody understands there's the
hybrid and then there's this one the
energy which is a plug-in hybrid which
one makes sense for you and what's the
big difference we'll check that out now
as we drive the 2013 C Max Energy and
check the tech let's begin with a
refresher on what a c-max is in the
first place before we even get to its
variants it's bigger than most compact
cars but smaller than any crossover
think of it as a head-on competitor the
Toyota Prius V which is kind of an odd
little category into itself it's a
compact with a skosh more room as they
used to say about sansabelt trousers so
it's ideal for Americans
now a couple equivalents got an electric
foot activated power rear hatch at the
Ford thing and also a four segment LED
ring around the charging door to tell
you where the charge is that when you
plug it in those are cool but they seem
to me in an electrified car highly
electrified that should treat every watt
as precious they're kind of a weird
thing to put in they're kind of wasteful
familiar Ford design inside the c-max
you've got a head unit here you've seen
before we'll talk about that in a minute
the other economic Tsar very Ford you
could be in a fusion you could be any
number of their cars now sync is in here
along with my Ford touch as you can see
and that's gonna be standard on your
energy you don't have any kind of
lowbrow non-sync non LCD head unit going
on but navigation is optional you don't
have that as a standard feature and the
Ford apps I've shown you before not
available in this car interestingly your
media choices are well understood AM and
FM satellite radio single slot optical
up here USB two of those in the console
actually as well as an SD card slot
streaming Bluetooth stereo and RCA jacks
here now the rest of the interface is
over here on the Left where you've got
the two wing screens you've seen those
before I want to call your attention to
the one on the left of the speedometer
which Ford's done some changes to you've
got these different modes you have
engaged and you've got empowered as you
can see depending on where you are oh
there's also enlighten you have varying
bands of information to be honest it's
just too damn complicated it should
basically be telling you how to drive
efficiently or not and give you your
battery and fuel level it does the last
two well but telling me if I'm driving
efficiently it doesn't get that across
simply I just want a light that goes on
it's just that simple look at the recent
Honda Accord we did which has a couple
of big old green lights when they're on
your driving efficiently when they're
off you're not end of story but I do
like the brake coach it gives you an
example of how gradual forward-looking
braking put some more energy back into
the car than stabbing the brakes the
last minutes a very good point to get
across and that coach does it like no
other vehicle in terms of parking rear
camera is part of a package it's not
standard on this car and as you can see
you've got some trajectory lines there
as well also optionally as Ford's
outstanding Park Assist which is one of
the better if not the best self parking
technologies on the market for a pretty
modest price
now the energy part of the name on this
c-max spell disturbingly like Snooki
means that this car's got a much bigger
battery than a standard hybrid and here
it is say hello to your new best friend
folks that is a big old lithium-ion
battery to charge that you have to plug
this car in you couldn't begin to charge
it on the usual regenerative braking
that a standard hybrid uses the benefit
is you get a lot of additional miles of
pure electric driving which will detail
in a moment
the downside is as you can see it's not
knowing anywhere it's like you're
traveling around with a very large
suitcase or two everyday and of course
the reason that big battery lives in
here at all is to help this power plant
let you run more electric more often
this energy c-max can run 15 to 20 miles
on pure electric power before the gas
engine ever kicks in at up to 62 miles
per hour in that range
once that charge is depleted you go back
to a traditional hybrid mode 2-liter
lean-burn
inline four-cylinder engine sitting
sidesaddle driving the front wheels only
through a CVT gearbox the numbers are
188 total horsepower electric and gas
combined Ford doesn't publish a torque
number I'm gonna guess somewhere in the
low 200s based on the horsepower figure
and how this thing drives zero to 60
happens at 8.1 seconds which isn't
exactly sporty except this guy weighs
somewhere pushing thirty nine hundred
pounds kind of porky so that's actually
a very good number so is the mpg it's
rated at forty four forty one EPA or one
hundred mpge because it has the ability
to run pure electric for a substantial
amount of time
the c-max is jekyll-and-hyde depending
on whether you've plugged in or not if
you have off you go with eerie silence
and electric power for like I said 15 to
20 miles even up to freeway speeds then
once it gets all petered out
it goes into hybrid mode it'll still
creep electric only at low speeds but
not much more than that once the battery
is down to hybrid level see this Evy
button down here if you push that you
can roll through three different modes
that will put the car in either an
automatic forced or no Evy mode you can
decide if you want to go electric or if
you don't within the parameters of the
battery having enough juice it's not
magic you can't just make an electric
car by pushing a button but regardless
of what mode you're running in electric
or hybrid I find the c-max of fun little
car to drive it's not a performance car
by any stretch but because it's highly
electrified you've got good torque when
you dig in for it the CVT transmission
those are normally not a driver's
favorite but this one is pretty good I
don't get a lot of rubber band e
elasticity out of it which is their
Achilles heel the c-max is one of my
favorite Ford's to drive it doesn't feel
so light as they're smaller cars can
sometimes like Fiesta nor does it feel
as big and kind of all-consuming as that
giant Taurus we've had recently and I
think for the everyday driver this is a
nice everyday car I am a little
concerned though about that reduced rear
cargo capacity I want to take a few
things down to the dump today and the
recycle center I couldn't fit them all
in so I didn't do it at all because I
didn't want to pay two fees to get in
those are real-world decisions you can
get stuck with when you're just a few
cubic feet shy of the capacity you need
okay let's price our c-max Energi now
this guy starts off about 33 7 delivered
once you add in package 303 a which is
all the C net tech stuff HD radio
navigation backup camera power liftgate
Sony audio and more that's twenty four
ninety five extra power sunroof I would
like that for 1200 now we're somewhere
around thirty seven thousand four or
roughly forty three hundred dollars more
than a comfortably equipped non plug-in
c-max
so how do you justify that money it
comes down to two things what kind of a
commute do you have is it within the
universe of this cars electric-only
range a lot of people's are and you have
the discipline to make sure you're
always running evey and charging if so
this guy could pay off its Delta rather
quickly and put you in a very green
space</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
