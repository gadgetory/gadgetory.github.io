the buzz report the show about the tech
news that everyone is talking about this
week it's Nokia's Hail Mary phone Steve
Jobs is secrets at last and political
suicide on YouTube but first it's the
gadje of the week the gadje of the week
is the Nest Learning Thermostat yep
thermostat they're actually calling it
the ipod of thermostats partly because
nest labs was founded by tony fadell who
led the design team that created the
ipod so he has some nerd cred anyway the
thermostat it's programmable obviously
it's also networkable over a Wi-Fi and
you can control it remotely with a
mobile app you can Network several
thermostats together and control them
all at once and it has a motion sensor
built in so it can see when people are
in the room and then it supposedly
learns your habits and auto adjusts to
suit your heating and cooling needs ness
says the thermostat could not twenty to
thirty percent off the average utility
bill which is good since it costs two
hundred and fifty dollars although best
part of all look how easy it is to
install
that is amazing let's watch that again
in slo-mo uh-huh have your electrician
on speed dial for that one other than
that it's actually pretty awesome for a
thermostat now the other big gadget news
of the week is nokia showing off its
first born child with microsoft the
lumia 800 is Nokia's bet the farm
smartphone and Microsoft and Nokia both
are calling it the first real Windows
Phone it's kind of a tricked up n9 it
has gorgeous hardware although the specs
are just okay single core processor 16
gigs of onboard memory the camera will
be pretty amazing though 8 megapixels
with a Carl Zeiss tesar lens and on
phone editing features plus HD video
capture and since Nokia never ever
learns the phone will debut in Europe
for about four hundred and twenty euros
with no word whatsoever on a US release
and that my friends is why the
thermostat is the gadget of the week in
other news this week the official steve
jobs biography came out monday and it
was full of fascinating stories not all
of them flattering on the one hand
walter isaacson's biography portrays a
cool counterculture genius who left an
incredible string of achievements and
inventions behind him on the other hand
abusive manager bad temper family issues
calculating more than willing to screw
his partners out of money brittle
personality stuff like that but the
worst thing that he did by far even
worse than abandoning his daughter or
worse even than the newton was that he
hurt the feelings of that cute cute
jonathan ives the vice president of
design at apple in the book I've says it
really upset him that Steve Jobs would
often take credit for his fabulous
designs and then get all the credit for
being the only innovator at Apple Johnny
don't worry sweetie we always knew
you're the smart one and we here at buzz
totally appreciate you moving on Netflix
the company's quarterly report said that
after it hiked prices sixty percent way
more customers actually cancelled their
subscriptions than netflix expected like
800 thousand of them Netflix is stock
fell thirty-seven percent on the news
and limped along down there all week see
and now i'm not in the stock advice
business and I'm not allowed to buy
netflix stock but netflix also reported
record revenues they're expanding into
the UK they're not splitting up their
business after all maybe calm down
investors and ask for the rest of you
buy low i'm just saying although that
streaming catalog does still suck
speaking of panicky investors even
amazon was down this week after the
company reported a dip in profits
because it's been a lot of money making
kindle fires and the rest of the new
kindle lineup amazon also said though
that it's rushing to produce way more
kindle fires than expected because
everyone apparently wants one and then
when everyone has a kindle fire amazon
may take a loss on the hardware but
they'll sell bajillion zuv $15 ebooks
plus movies and TV shows and magazines
all with the little one click genius
then they will be printing their own
Kindle branded dollars but what do I
know Wall Street's done a great job with
America so far and now it's time for
what's clogging the tubes this week it's
the Herman Cain crazy train the internet
went crazy for his most recent campaign
video which features his campaign
manager aka the smoking man from x-files
together we can do this we can take this
country back
so that was baffling but then we all
realize that Cain's campaign has been
doing this for months go to his YouTube
page check out the yellow flowers video
it's like a four minute video with some
guy claiming to be a famous actor and
talking about how herman cain is great
except the unknown actor dude is a total
a-hole who can't drink a margarita
without a straw and is rude to everyone
around him and isn't good at his job at
all so like how is that hoping herman
cain oh I get it it's viral he's
trolling America smart maybe you know
I'll bit say you're as yellow as those
clouds right now why has it always got
to be about color what do you got
liberal car care and that's the buzz
report for this week everyone I'm
Mollywood and thank you for watching
no that's unbelievable yeah like you
know anything no eye contact and
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
