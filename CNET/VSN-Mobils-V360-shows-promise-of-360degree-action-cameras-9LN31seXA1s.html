maybe not but at the very least it's a
new direction for the category
I'm Josh Goldman with CNET and this is
the VSN mobile V 360 one of the first
360 degree video and still cameras for
consumers that you can actually buy it
uses a single camera to capture 60 480
by 1080 resolution video and up to 24
frames per second and grabs 8 megapixel
panoramic photos with a single shot
you can do that with this little
included remote or you can use an iOS or
Android device to start and stop
recording
change shooting modes and settings get a
live preview and review your photos and
videos since it's a single camera there
are no visible seams and there's no need
for stitching that you might have with
models that use multiple cameras the
video and photos can be viewed with the
app or with a desktop player and you can
upload them to YouTube and there's
Google cardboard support unfortunately
the quality is just ok with a lot of
visible artifacts which might be
disappointing given its 450 dollar price
tag plus the vertical viewing angle is
just 60 degrees so doing something like
mounting our handlebars might cut off
heads the size and shape make it awkward
for a helmet mounting too and you'll
likely get some stares and questions
regardless of how you mount it also
while it's shock vibration dust and
waterproof there's nothing to prevent it
from getting scratched you can read the
full review on cnet.com but like a lot
of first gen products it has some quirks
so it's not perfect and you'll have to
look past its faults to see the big
picture
I'm Josh Coleman and that's a look at
the VSN mobile V 360 360 degree camera
