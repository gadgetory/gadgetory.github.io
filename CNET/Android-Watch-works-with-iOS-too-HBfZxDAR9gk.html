tech show in New York and this is an
Android watch that runs on iOS well it's
not really an Android watch but it is an
Android watch it's a company called
Android that makes watches and actually
they've had the rights to the name
Android since 1991 so they're going to
be the only android watch you're ever
likely to seek but it doesn't run
android operating system it actually
runs its own operating system that works
on android phones and iOS and it's got a
full feature set bluetooth it's got a
pedometer it's got a stopwatch it's got
voice memo it can make them receive
phone calls it can get messages it's
even got music controls and it runs on
Android and iOS phones alike and these
are available for two hundred dollars
entering a pretty crowded marketplace
but available in a variety of funky
colors and it comes with an actual
genuine leather band that matches the
color that you choose it's here at the
luxury tech Expo but it's not priced too
far out of the market compared to other
smartwatches I haven't tested it out yet
but it looks big but it is however fully
featured so that bear is some
consideration I'm Scott Stein and that's
a look at the android smart watch here
at the luxury tech show in new york</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
