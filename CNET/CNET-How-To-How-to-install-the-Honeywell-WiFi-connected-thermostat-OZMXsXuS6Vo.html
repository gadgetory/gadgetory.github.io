I'm gonna show you how to install this
Honeywell Wi-Fi smart thermostat I'll
assume that you've already gone to your
circuit breaker and turned off your AC
and that you've removed your old
thermostat so these are the wires I have
behind my old thermostat this is the Y
wire this is the W this one's the G and
this one's the RH the thing about this
Honeywell thermostat is that it needs a
CE wire to operate optimally I don't
have a CE wire so that's a bit of a
problem for me there are some
workarounds that you can use if you have
access to your HVAC unit but
unfortunately my HVAC unit is really old
and doesn't actually have a terminal
port if you don't have the CE wire a
really easy workaround is this power
cord that Honeywell provides but it's
not ideal because it's a big power cord
there are some other ways around this
without using the power cord but you
might need to get an electrician to help
so the next thing you want to do is put
on the wall plate
once your wall plate is screwed on and
level you're ready to put the wires into
their ports the RH wire doubles as the
our wire so I'm gonna put the RH wire
into the our port tug on it to make sure
that it's in the right way then we match
the other wires to their respective
terminals if you have to see wire you'd
be done with the wiring portion but
since I have this cord I'm gonna put
these into the sea and the RC ports the
next step is to push all the wires back
into the wall and then you're ready to
add the base plate now that the
faceplate is on you're ready to plug it
in and turn the air conditioning back on
once you get everything set up
it should power up and then it'll ask
you a couple questions
language thermostat installed for home
or business name of your thermostat if
you're using it for cooling or heating
these are important questions you need
to be able to answer correctly to get
this set up the right way I'm Meghan
Malaysian for CNET and this is the
Honeywell Wi-Fi smart thermostat</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
