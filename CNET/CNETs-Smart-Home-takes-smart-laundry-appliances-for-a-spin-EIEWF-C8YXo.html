stuff at the scene ed smart-home our
place in the Kentucky countryside for
reviewing and equipping this home with
all kinds of cool tech but now we're
moving from small gadgets on up to large
appliances starting with this whirlpool
smart Cabrio top load washer &amp;amp; dryer
pair so we actually haven't had a lot of
luck testing smart large appliances in
the past the apps were clunky the
interface was weird and just didn't add
a ton of value but this pair actually
does a lot and contributes functionality
to this unit smart home what you have is
a standard top load washer and dryer but
when you factor in the related Android
or iOS app it can kind of do a lot you
can actually remote start and pause
cycles on a washer and dryer and if you
have a Nest Learning Thermostat you can
do even more through the works with nest
initiative basically a program that
pairs nest products with third-party
products like this whirlpool unrepaired
so when you set your nest thermostat to
away and your dryer is running it'll
actually engage a wrinkle shield feature
so that's even after your dryer has
ended they don't know you were away and
continue to intermittently tumble the
dryer to keep the clothes fresh even
when you're not home and when your
thermostat is set to home mode it will
enable a quiet mode feature basically
making your machines run more quietly so
that you're not annoyed with any loud
noises so Noah doesn't interact directly
with the Amazon echo or any other alexa
related products but it is pretty smart
it's the smartest lawn to repair that
we've seen to date and that's the reason
why we're sticking it into this part
