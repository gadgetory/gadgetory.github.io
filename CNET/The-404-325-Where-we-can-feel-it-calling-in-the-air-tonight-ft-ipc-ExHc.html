leading campaign for tourism ya know the
is the bat for mini bat fight come on
imma show yet all of my friends are
filipino yeah I love my don't know its
brothers intestines check it out let's
get into today's stories you know it'd
be nice if one day we could actually
talk on our show without mentioning
Twitter yet maybe we should do that
today and not all there's a bunch of
stories there's a really know it is you
know it is what is blowing up so over
when Mother's Day Internet well it's
true twitter twitter is the internet now
I remember the days where we only used
to have stories about facebook right now
it's only about Twitter ah so you're
saying how that's working okay so what's
the new Twitter story in the news today
well uh pizza hut is is searching
Twitter mmm for an intern oh yeah the
entire company the billion-dollar
company one interested companies looking
for one in ten the problem with today's
economy is that they can't hire like
CFOs and CEOs anymore they just got a
higher 30 in turns to do the same job
like true and their unpaid a11 intern
with the twitter account is as equally
powerful as a CEO jersey that's beyond
well that's like the whole marketing
department now yeah yes as you said the
right Twitter and you could destroy a
company yeah or uh all you gotta do is
set up a Google News Alert for pizza hut
and then respond to that you're fine
yeah so they're actually the work or new
intern for pizza no they're looking for
in turn to Twitter oh yeah yeah I
misspoke so a lot of companies do this
isn't something that's very new like
Paul my notice at a Twitter this morning
and so I guess they would just look up
people that were mentioned pizza hut and
then respond to complaints and whatnot
on the web don't know like they've gotta
like really drop some some sort of
interest in this yeah I me other things
I don't want to get to where dominos
pizza was yeah right well I mean there's
plenty of ways to avoid those types of
situation right you know hi just regular
hygiene you know that you'll be really
easy for them to do like contest all day
yeah things like that like they
correspond to this Twitter
real quick get a free uh you know when
afrodita what they should have done is
done a special promotion for yesterday
which was for money that's just like any
other day that's just april twentieth i
was nothing special very special but
very proud of us that we didn't even
mention it no we didn't and you know we
had we had some guests on yesterday we
had Adam clearly look that they've been
celebrating okay now well come on now
Joe I kid I kid but yet what did you
guys do yesterday anything special just
hang out with some friends uh no I just
watched playoff hockey like a gentleman
you know we were talking about this
yesterday jeff i noticed that g4 was
running a special they were calling it g
for 20 they were showing uh half-baked
alt yeah they showed they should have
baked and they showed the UH the Doug
Benson super high me documentary right
have you seen that I have seen it it's
really bad yeah it's not that is not
good at all I actually think it hurt the
movement yeah it did actually what way
it was like it was almost you know the
negative effect of the Holy See like
nothing but stoners yeah while high
right trying to explain what is the
worst representation of the whole idea
of the movie was like oh I'm gonna smoke
weed every day non-stop for 30 day right
I know so many people who do that yeah
and they lived completely normal what
like it wasn't it wasn't revealing
anything yet at least when they did the
the Super Size Me movie he sort of went
and depth about the you know the fast
food industry and the legal and over me
you'll learn you don't learn dick you
think that the movie we expose people
that are actually functioning potheads
right out of that don't really created
something Doug Benson sits around for a
month yes stoned out of his mind doing
mediocre stand up well you know a super
baked every day for him it just felt
like 10 minutes yeah but I've been
talking for three days you know the only
thing that was borderline funny about it
was that for 30 days before he didn't
smoke weed for 30 days right was like
jonesing for a joint the whole time
guess you like a 12 year old on it just
shows you how like yeah even the biggest
potheads they go 30 days and they turn
out okay Lee I don't think you know no
one's like you know scratching their
neck feeling fiending for it yet no but
I just think 420 is kinda ridiculous
later why do you need this one day it's
like it's like Valentine's Day
or Mother's Day you should need one day
to celebrate school we were talking
about on the walk home smoke weed
everyday actually on the Twitter
yesterday yeah I got like a bunch of
sweets at 420 on 420 really be like
hahaha yeah way once once for 23 Twitter
the joke is over the on is over and the
most ridiculous thing about 420 is that
everyone has their own idea about where
the original 420 came from the Bullock
it's an old police code it's what the
cops used to say before the posted oh
yeah that's how long your joints should
be four feet 20 inches men what that is
not where it came to be dated yeah I've
even heard people claim that they
started it like at their house yeah well
I read something in the New York Times
yesterday that said that it was started
by these kids in Northern California yet
really decided to smoke weed at 420
that's all it just caught on from their
golf that's all it is is no like you
know crazy etymology behind it it's just
yeah regular stoner attitudes like
random son so now we were talking
about now we're like right so four
twenties of actually ruined now right if
it lost all legitimacy for me back in
high school coach is not a big deal
anymore right but now g4 comes around
the lake hey man it's g for 20 before
leashing let's totally exploit this you
know everyone well that's not all
over oh gee for cuz i'm not interested a
joder hahahaha did kill for 20 well i
mean i think no matter what g4 does
people are still gonna enjoy 420 all
right okay well let's move on a little
bit i should want to talk about another
sort of experience changing substance
right beer beer is not fair there's now
this i'm upset with this article this is
at a Reuters UK they're saying uh beer
goggles are non-existent i'm sorry there
you are i don't care what anyone says
dude i know i've heard things that that
abetted the refute this that's a no yes
you're more likely to just write more
likely to just be I guess actually I
think it's the liquid courage yeah it's
not all true no but beer goggles mean
that you would hook up with someone that
you would normally you got what what I'm
what I'm saying is that uh yet they
don't may actually change your
perception of what people look like
right I think you're just more willing
to be like well do anything I guess
she'll do yeah that's really right oh
she has female parts yeah sold sold oh
when I you're like look at your watch it
like oh it's 3am yeah wasted like I'm
not seeing a bulge in your pants you'll
do you'll do that'll do donkey Shrek
with beer goggles oh do you have legs
don't get you will do your mouth Duncan
you saw us talk don't care just talk
with a human voice so you'll do aa
terrible so the study no but you know
what speaking we can bring this back to
the 420 thing I think there's such a
thing as we goggles too what do you
think because your eye I feel like we've
gotta work for food no well you'll eat
anything like Oh durian fruit bring it
on now the only thing I think we'd uh
really does to you and I must speak of a
personal experiences yet read about this
of course armida scream you know just
makes is not do anything for so if you
know yeah you will I mean you know some
people fall asleep yeah some people you
know I was gonna say to my friend Dustin
yeah when he smokes weed and I encourage
him not to do so only all right that's
it that's a crime but my friend Dustin
sort of gets you know the weed goggles I
care and he's woken up you know next to
people that he wouldn't normally wear
you don't donkey without without that we
an assistant is understandable but
anyway I don't know i think this this
article is total no no it's
absolutely true you get into the sides
the whole point was that they they got a
bunch of people drunk yeah it sounds
good already real scientist said i got
anyone before and after they showed him
pictures of attractive or not so
attractive people read and the responses
were pretty much similar was that but
they're not like people who you found
unattractive before you were drunk right
you still thought they were unattractive
difference between finding so many on
active and not wanting to do that that's
the thing they should have said now
given your opinion on ya in your current
state of inebriation would you still do
would you do then we're just still there
yeah like maybe you wouldn't try so hard
but if it just literally fell into your
lap and yes you would do that that's
what it is beer goggles aren't they're
not goggles their brain god it's like
the would you do question you know it's
like a you just jump to these
conclusions yeah maybe you want to marry
them but boss for sure for sure but in a
little bit right along our man we have a
great run down today let's talk about
this a little bit a bunch of you know
all the teenagers who do listen to this
show might get a kick out of this the
sidekick LX comes out May thirteenth you
are event the a fan of the sidekick when
i'll try to find a new phone she comes
before i had this weird thing was trying
to get rid of my iphone you were really
pushing me to get in aside okay like if
ten years old man do but like if you
love messaging people yeah yeah but you
love swarovski crystals yes I you know
and you're really into hello kitty yeah
get a psychic I had a sidekick when I
was uh 15 yeah 16 no no later on they
came out later uh I hated it yeah it was
so annoying to have and to hold and just
you know they happen to hold it just you
know that do you I had the first one
that was in black and white all right
Rick mark right like a way like two
pounds and you know it big it isn't it's
not good that the best part of a
sidekick is that flippy function yeah
yeah you know it's not like a software
or the cool keyboard it's the flippy
 and now I just associate sidekicks
with people who don't look where they're
going when they walk down this is
definitely i just saw her sidekick
person okay the thing though like with a
blackberry you can message with one hand
oh yeah the sidekick you got it no you
gotta you gotta double grab bag double
yeah nothing is too big i don't like
that you have to carry around a fanny
pack in order to put around with the way
true yet but the new uh the new sidekick
comes out today it's got like a better
camera finally yeah cuz i think the
before was like a point three megapixel
writing now it's a two mega 2.3 whatever
mega perfect for taking naked pictures
of yourself only to your friends sexting
ever
perfect uh cell phone for a sec between
hobby right now that's why I'm getting
one I mean I wouldn't know that for sure
my friend Dustin was telling me that a
lot of kids sex message they do it's the
future but it you know it's 3g enabled
to get gps on it so now you'll know when
your other friends are around right
welcome to the 21st century and it's the
thinnest psychic ever well congratulate
meaning uh it only has to be thinner
than an inch nor difference page work
for tmobile or are you heavily invested
in danger yeah why why are used to
proponent of the cell I'm just surprised
at the number of people who do you say
I'm not at all yeah I mean you would
always rather have a black bear to me
tell you it sort of I think it it was
one of the first sort of like a status
symbol you know devices I've right you
know how about the iphone is now the
sidekick was in you know 2004 whatever

more for you guys tomorrow and we thank
everyone for calling in Michelle back to
the rundown ooh so we were talking about
phones early i wanted to talk about this
yeah let's do it Jeff you were thinking
about maybe getting a new ipod I think
you should get a new iPhone because a
hulu app is finally coming to the iphone
ok i cool now this is this is definitely
a very big deal yeah for me I'm coming
up on my two year anniversary of paying
thirty dollars a month for service I had
explained really quick to people that
don't know how do you get that back in
the day ten years ago sprint was
offering this plan called the sero plan
right which was a splint a splint sprint
employee referral offer are you Chinese
no just a splint I didn't sprint
sprinter split uh so basically what was
going on is all you needed to do was log
in and sign up with like a fake sprint
email pen right right I'm sorry email
address hmm did that got knowledge it
was just me for free I didn't I didn't
you know i do someone who worked it
right I knew someone thats pretty
zygarde use my email address in school I
use his email he's like it's no problem
everyone's doing all the cool kids are
doing it I did that it was Justin's
friend does was Justin's right Dustin
hook it up and for two years I was
paying thirty dollars a month for 500
minutes unlimited nights and weekends
and limiting data and texting do you
believe that that is crazy that is
coming up
expiring uh in July yeah so it's a hard
argument to make for you to jump up to a
hundred dollars am i clear you know is
that is that the most expensive I'm
Cecily cheapest that's the cheapest for
you get yeah you got me unless you do
like somehow get the first generation
which is I'm not as yet you would have
to at least pay around 90 maybe a
hundred dollars with tax don't forget to
if you work for a big company not CBS
though yeah uh there are corporate
discounts all right people can do that
as well but you're gonna end up paying
at least seventy dollars for sure but
it's pretty cool that a hulu app a free
one at that is coming to the iphone it
is cool and i personally prefer CBS is
TV junkie nap cuz i can't get enough for
two and a half minutes exactly you know
and CBS is great I personally just don't
get that who anything all night I love
Charlie Sheen guys watch him all day
chargeable model yeah emailed him he
might be on the show down the road right
and who can't get enough of that fat kid
eating food yeah man talk about fun to
watch half hour all day looking of
ditching your cable box yes it does
sound like that you know look if they
come out with a 64 gigabyte iphone yeah
by the time my sprint deal is up I'll
consider it and you can't just carry
around two devices any more like in age
of conversion I don't care too bold
about me look at me though I got care
around like six little gadgets all day
ya know let me tell you discuss but
check it out my mogul phone um it did
break the the SD card slot broke yeah I
can't listen to music on it okay
what you should do is just use your
shuffle until the summer time I don't
have a shuffle I thought you had one no
okay I just got to go to get a cracker
jack box and yeah humming to the analog
mp3 player but I'm dead serious an
iphone will be maybe consideration if it
does jump up to 64 gigs and i think that
the gun oh i think at the very least I
could do a 32 gig night see don't say
have a 32 gig or no no it's just engage
right now I want if the ipod touch yeah
that comes out with the with the 64 gig
I'm gonna be getting that what they
should do is come up with a 32 gig with
an SD card slot yeah well never gonna
ever get ever get that you will never
see expandable memory all about a turtle
store never gonna see it but speaking
about the whole dish in your cable box
in like I was talking about earlier arm
yesterday I got mine
display to hdmi output for my macbook
that is so sir you gotta listen listen
so now I'm hooking up my macbook to my
HDTV I don't even in my cable box
anymore man i got this wireless keyboard
your buddy rich was able to hook me up
with course i'm living the dream with
this thing hulu by watch five episodes
of uh always sunny in philadelphia
yesterday didn't even realize I was
watching cables fantastics pretty cool
yeah pretty cool pretty cool sure well I
actually something I saw on hulu
yesterday too was uh the first episode
of sit down shut up was that from Mitch
Hurwitz the creator of arrested
development heard very good reviews
about that well see what's funny is we
we were pimping this show for months and
months and months it aired sunday night
i watched it sunday later on Sunday not
very good how can we learn at inherit
Henry Winkler go wrong now I don't know
it was due I don't think it was terrible
it was it was also the pilot was a pilot
and like when I first saw the pilot
arrested development didn't like the
show yeah I was really boring it took
like two or three episodes for me it
took me a little while to get into when
it was brilliant you don't forget arm
you know the the sedan job it's
self-aware to just like oh yeah we're
like this has to be good it's the pilot
my bad favorite was uh when he was like
can we get a flashback like now well on
the money for that that pink uh get
really even say that was that was fun
yeah I mean that sounds funny but you
know what at the end of the day I prefer
my classic shows si si we got harper's
island i watch every night of course
survivor right all the CBS hits I know
how i met your mother how i met your
mother The Amazing Race 60 minutes in 48
okay I'm good I'm gonna geek out a
little bit yesterday I also saw Caprica
how would I know that it okay none of
you guys know but uh for people who were
in the note Battlestar ended like last
week yeah weeks ago right this is the
prequel to the series and it was
actually pretty damn good and there were
boobies in it while some nerds really
just don't have a reason to leave their
TV there's like it and there were
boobies your boobies in it compare the
first set I've ever seen but it looks
good too from what my mom told me they
look just right
we're bad yeah it actually ended up
being really good like I was quite
surprised because normally like you hear
about the sci-fi shows always about like
 blowing up in space or whatnot yes
they're robots in this one mmm but it's
all about like religion sex uh mafia the
Mafia with our galactic my channel is
this this is on the sci-fi channel Zach
didn't actually air was on DVD yeah yeah
oh no way to like a CBS yeah really good
really right do they pick that one up
right uh speaking of terrible terribly
bad ideas yeah I want to talk about this
video game mashup that's coming out from
harmonix soon I don't know whose idea
this was this is the last two games that
I would ever think have a future
together but for some reason or another
yeah lego rock band what's what's coming
out why would you combine Legos and rock
band what oh I can understand this I get
it they just it's just another way to
get new fans on to the franchise rather
they have really cool songs it sounds
like they got like blur song number two
big deal cool why not feel heavy metal
no I just honestly want like we're aware
in these in the thought process does
this Lego come into Rock yes I
understand beatles rock band that is a
good idea people will buy that up yeah
why would anyone be like you know what
they got Legos well I thought star wars
legos was good well that was it that's
an anomaly on the other that's
phenomenal it was actually really good
for some reason people really dig the
lego thing yeah and I understand you
know lending the Lego franchise to
Batman to Indiana Jones 22 whatever and
Star Wars that's fine but but now it's
sort of like well there's no characters
in rock band anyway except when they do
bands and stuff volt it to me just
doesn't make it's not a logical
collaboration right are all the
instruments made out of Legos cuz that
would be cool if you actually had to
like build the whole thing yourself i
say i do Legos get a one-off joke yeah
that's the joke about it is that is it
but it's not actions not ways there's
it's probably all you can play it with
guitars that come that you already have
from guitar or rock right actually
though in the same vein a bunch of video
game publishers actually coming out with
like a new generation of music games
right now DJ hero and
gretsch the ultimate Egypt DJ hero
looked actually yeah it's actually for
like the generation who like you know
didn't grow up in the eighties and like
love the whole rock music think the
generation rope in the nineties yet hit
ya nineties when while we're finally
beyond the young guy I feel old DJ hero
DJ hero turntable DJ Tanner hero oh I'd
be into that actually um the you push
the button and then scratch the same
time I guess that would be how it works
yet when you don't ruin any vinyl which
is actually very similar actually how a
lot of modern DJ's DJ they don't even
use you know actual vinyl that's all
about serato it's that program where you
have have the laser thing all right
analyze your mp3's and you can actually
scratch your breath yeah that's pretty
cool it's not bad so I don't know unless
they actually come out with a Lego drum
set I'm not gonna buy this but it's kind
of weird because i was actually blogged
about this the other day lagos making a
big push um toward like the electronics
industry they just had a new boom box
come out that you can put your iphone
into so i don't know maybe boom bunch of
lego boombox not made out of legos it
looks like a big Lego brick and you just
put your iphone into and plays music out
of it which is pretty cool although I
gotta say I you know thinking back to it
when I was little Legos were like the
greatest thing ever Legos were cool I
preferred connects can you know that was
like the numbers way to come yeah i was
gonna look at hard i see that was like
the legos for the rich kids yeah yeah
yeah like you want to build a satellite
hahaha by disconnected no you could
really build like a freakin fully
functional role yeah it was cool that I
like to woo you could okay with Legos
you would always inevitably inevitably
build a house right the only thing you
could build with a loud doll or a
what I was most impressed with Lego was
the the instructions in how you would
start off this little like nothing and
then you have you know the Millennium
Falcon yeah actually one of my favorite
thing this gonna sound terrible but one
of my favorite things to do was to build
like a Lego contraption and like throw
it against the wall to see it shatter oh
my how sadistic no that's kind of MOOC
is like it would explode right why mrs.
Wilson you strike me as the kind of guy
that would get into the was it called
you rector set yeah wreck you strike me
as the erector set guy you can loosen up
landline reference you can no one ever
EFT with the erector set no nothing was
real seal yeah you could literally build
a shovel without a fraud and still a man
built it and the man that built the
wheel funny when they got to the moon
that's a new excel in the 50s here's a
bag of steel kid yeah have foot up
together with these nuts and bolts it'll
help your engineering job later it was a
welding torch yeah that's pretty good
