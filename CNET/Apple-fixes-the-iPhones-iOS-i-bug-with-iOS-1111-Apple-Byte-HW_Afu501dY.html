welcome to the Apple buy for everything
good and bad inside the world of Apple
the hottest story of the week that is
bugging the crap out of many iOS 11.1
users is the letter AI bug that
autocorrect when users type and I buy
itself to either an exclamation point or
replaces it with the letter A followed
by a question mark in a box I know
you've seen it now I have the bug on my
phone but it isn't affecting all users
just a whole lot of them and mine didn't
even show up until a couple days ago but
it can really water down a message you
know for that's special someone or
completely ruined the lyrics to your
favorite song heck even Apple isn't
immune to it see that one's too good we
got to give props to Jeremy Burch for
that one legend you squash Apple has
just fixed the bug with the release of
iOS 11 point one point one so take a
moment and go get it now back to our
regularly scheduled programming but
seriously though how did this get
through like it's been going on for a
week has the quality control dropped off
that bad like this is bad and more than
worthy of a bad apple
but there's a good Apple coming from the
latest public beta releases as well the
introduction of Apple pay cash for both
iOS 11.2 and watch OS 4.2 now some beta
testers and developers are seen it
appear as an option in the messages app
apples been testing it internally with
their own employees recently but think
of Apple pay cash as Apple's attempt to
take down venmo
but just for Apple users and let's be
real integrating it into the blue
bubbled messages app that's got ahold of
you like blue crystal meth Apple pay
cash is gonna be just fine now we expect
a general release for both the bug fix
and Apple pay cash very soon all right
the iPhone 10 is only been out for about
a week but who knew that an emojis were
going to be such a big deal and I'll be
the first to admit I was the number one
hater I mean they're cute and all but to
tout them is one of the reasons to get a
new iPhone 10 no and it's not like I was
going to use them regularly until Oh
oh gee karaoke like how could you avoid
social media without seeing these things
they were everywhere and you know what
they're damn fun
like this one due to copyright issues we
were unable to use your favorite artists
like Bruno Mars or Taylor Swift instead
we have hand-picked this fine folk song
from our music library so we don't get
sued
so I take it all back an emojis are
amazing and emojis are for everyone but
they still aren't worth it for a $1,000
phone ok the iPhone 10 has been making
the rounds and DxO mark has given it its
highest mark for photo performance on a
phone with a score of 101 that's really
impressive
with an 89 for video and a 97 overall
that leaves the pixel to still as the
top rated smartphone camera with an
overall score of 98 a photo performance
score of 99 and a video score of 96 now
you can check out mkbhd s awesome
explainer of the DxO mark scoring system
which is a weighted mix of scores and
isn't based out of a scale of 100 so if
you're wondering how good is the iPhone
TENS camera it's the cream of the crop
in fact it's so good that people on
Twitter are complaining that the selfie
camera is a little too good like this
girl and this guy and this girl too and
okay yeah not gonna lie that's pretty
bad now display mate has also put the
iPhone 10 through their usual display
technology shootout and now calls the
iPhone 10 the most innovative and
high-performance smartphone display that
they have ever tested display mate also
congratulate samsung Display for
developing and manufacturing the
outstanding OLED display hardware now
the 10 matched or set new smartphone
display records for the highest a
ballute color accuracy highest full
screen brightness for oled smartphones
highest full screen contrast rating in
ambient light and highest contrast ratio
it also had the lowest screen
reflectance and small its brightness
variation with a viewing angle wow
that's a good Apple that's right now
Apple even took preventive measures
after all the negative press from the
pixel to excel screen to issue statement
that the iPhone 10 will also have shifts
in color and human looking at it at an
off angle and can't experience image
retention or burnin over time but
they've engineered their super Retina
display to reduce the effects of OLED
burnin and we still haven't seen any
burnin issues reported a week in after
the iPhone tends release so the iPhone
10 display is great and Samsung is just
as happy about that not only did they
help build it they also make about one
$10 for every iPhone 10 sold so what do
you do when your business partner drops
our latest phone that will add billions
of dollars to your bottom line you put
out a commercial called growing up that
mocks them for being late to the party
with features like being waterproof or
doing something dumb like taking away
the headphone jack
but then they went in for the jugular
with this guy in line for the iPhone 10
so I'll do this for the Apple fanboys
who are going to get mad if I don't
defend them come on son why you got to
be like that that's a bad apple you know
I don't even really care it's just a
funny ad all right you know I love the
iPad pro and a new report from Mark
durman and Bloomberg says Apple is
working on a new high-end iPad to be
ready as early as 2018 that will bring
slimmer edges and the iPhone 10's face
ID facial recognition system the
next-gen iPad is unlikely to include an
OLED display but at least one new iPad
model will have a screen size similar to
the 10.5 inch iPad pro and removing the
physical home button will allow more of
the screen to go to the edges like the
iPhone 10 an OLED screen would not only
drive up costs significantly if it was
implemented but Samsung would once again
be its only supplier with our other OLED
partners unlikely to have the ability to
produce larger tablet size OLED screens
for Apple next year according to the
report now Apple is also preparing a new
Apple pencil stylus and new software
features for using the pencil with this
iPad as well and another one from
gurmann and Bloomberg Apple's eyeglasses
might be here before you even know it
the big a is targeting to have the
technology ready for an augmented
reality headset in 2019 and could ship
it as early as 2020 now the report says
Apple plans for the headset to have its
own display running on a new chip and a
new operating system Apple has
aggressively built out its expertise in
augmented reality with numerous hirings
and they launched our AR KITT platform
which has already brought us some really
killer apps and will continue taking off
as developers start building apps for
the iPhone 10 now CEO Tim Cook even told
the independent recently anything you
would see on the market at anytime soon
would not be something any of us would
be satisfied with and chief design
officer
Johnny I've told a tech panel last month
that there are certain ideas that we
have and we are waiting for the
technology to catch up with the idea
that's according to the report now the
Apple byte even got a sneak peak of
their marketing material that Apple is
working on right here oh come on
Apple can you just get this fix out to
the public already sheesh all right
that's gonna do it for this week's show
you can email us at the Apple bite at
cnet.com or tweet me at Brian Tom thanks
so much for watching it will catch all
next time for another bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
