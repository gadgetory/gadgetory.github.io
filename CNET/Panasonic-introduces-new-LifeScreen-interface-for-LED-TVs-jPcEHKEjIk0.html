Churchill Downs will be truly amazing
but it is also exactly what you should
expect from Panasonic breaking new
ground with big TVs unrivaled picture
quality and cutting-edge features has
always been a part of Panasonic's DNA
especially when it comes to our consumer
high-definition televisions this year we
plan to take things to an even greater
height there are so many things you can
do with an HD TV these days from
watching TV shows movies and videos on
demand to online gaming to connecting
with family and friends via social media
and so much more technology has truly
has a seamlessly endless list of content
options so much so that is also getting
hard to find what to watch so we at
Panasonic decided it was time to
redefine what a 21st century TV should
be imagine a TV that delivers the
stunning picture quality you expect from
Panasonic but also knows what you and
your family love watching and has it
waiting for you when you switch the
television on imagine a TV that
recognizes you by your face and lets you
navigate to the content that means the
most to you by simply speaking to it and
imagine a TV in your living room that
knows when you walk by and respond by
displaying useful information from the
cloud imagine going beyond the Smart TV
well you don't have to imagine anymore
introducing the latest home innovation
from Panasonic the life plus screen
Panasonic's new Viera life plus screen
will take consumers beyond Smart TV to
be a whole new level of interaction and
customer experience but rather than have
you tell me about it let me show you
the life plus screen will be featured on
all of our 2014 4 k and 1080p tvs in
2013 Panasonic set a new standard for
picture quality this year we have set
ourselves a higher target to deliver
plasma level picture quality with LED
technology let me just repeat that we
will deliver plasma level picture
quality with LED technology our
engineers have spent the last 12 months
working tirelessly on this and thanks to
our new studio master drive technology
we have achieved it and we are
delivering it our new life plus screen 8
X 800 series 4k LED TV which you can see
here behind me will debut this year in
58 in 65 inch screen sizes this is the
65 inch we also plan to launch later
this year Panasonic's first-ever 85-inch
4k LED models</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
