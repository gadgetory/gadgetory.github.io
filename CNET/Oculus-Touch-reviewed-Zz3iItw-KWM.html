all of you when the oculus rift virtual
reality headset shipped earlier this
year you couldn't reach out and grab
things oculus touch controllers are the
missing piece of the puzzle
they've got buttons joysticks and
triggers but what's really amazing is
they let you reach out and grab things
naturally pull down a button on the ring
finger and you can grab whatever you see
in VR whether it's a gun objects on a
table they're accurate up you can juggle
things in a VR even bounce a ball on top
of a ping-pong paddle neat thing about
the touch controllers is that they have
integrated sensors inside so it can tell
when your fingers on the trigger and
it'll show your finger in the game of
wrapping around that trigger if you put
your thumb down here it can tell your
thumbs in the shape of a fist whereas
you put it up here you'll see a nice big
thumbs up in the air you put your finger
right here you got pointer fingers there
right now I've got finger guns going on
right now so unlike most oculus touch
setups you might have seen that this
room has three cameras in it so you have
360-degree coverage wherever I aim this
gun in this room I should be able to hit
it with pretty good accuracy dead and
buried pull out your pistols aim at the
targets of the oculus touch controllers
they go right where you're aiming need
to reload your guns all you got to do is
flip out those cylinders let those
bullets spin out load them flip them
back up again and you're ready to fire
this is Arctica I'm a hundred years in
the future a mercenary Anna in a
post-apocalyptic future where thing
world is frozen over
I've got buttons I can open up the
windows and see what it looks like
outside I can turn on and off the lights
just for the top of that index finger
feels a lot more natural than most games
are you pressing it out a little
joystick and buttons to get things done
this is King spray graffiti and my
oculus touch controller is a graffiti
spray Ken it's a spray paint and if I
hold it down I can really spray the heck
out of this wall cover it with my pink
stuff there we go
and if I want to get a different kind of
paint just flick the stick over I can
get some rusty metal brown or rusty
metal yeah
do some of that let's just do face the
heck out of this thing
for fun so this is a lone echo I am a
robot a futuristic AI now look at this
little robotic tendons move in my in my
hands that's something each atom grab
the glowing desk Oh interesting and it
shows me where my oculus touches around
my head a representation where the
actual controller is that I'm touching
that's kind of neat so in this game
since I'm in a Space Station in zero-g
I need to actually pull myself through
the environment with my hands grab one
of these surfaces reach out and push on
them to get myself through the space
station so you ever seen one of those
games of hockey where everybody starts
brawling and you want to be in the
middle of that fight well do that here
with these oculus touch controllers I'm
getting beat the heck up but maybe I can
do something about that come on one down
all right
taking you out next so this is Robo
recall a VR game from epic games where I
have to blast these robots out of the
sky using these pistols and I'm holding
in my real life hands even though I can
only see them a digital environment it's
exactly where would be if it was really
in my hand I can pull out a pair of
akimbo pistols blast away these enemy
robots grab bullets out of the air and
throw them back at enemies matrix-style
it's like my aim isn't terribly good
there we go jump right up to enemies rip
them apart grab that head right off
goodbye robot
ah is awesome basically the best light
gun shooting game I've ever played this
is what I think I'd buy an oculus touch
for I got a sack</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
