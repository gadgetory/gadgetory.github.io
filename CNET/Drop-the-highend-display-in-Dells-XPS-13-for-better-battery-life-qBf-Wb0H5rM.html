of 2015 so far and gave it much better
battery life I'm Dan Akron and this is
the Dell XPS 13 non-touch edition this
is a less expensive version of the Dell
XPS 13 that we first saw at CES back in
January of this year and reviewed in a
very high-end configuration one that had
a 3200 by 1800 touch screen a very nice
laptop performance was fine battery life
like Adam was fine we got about seven
hours out of it in our battery tests but
Dell said you know what we've got a
different configuration that's probably
gonna do a lot better let us send that
to you this is a less expensive not more
expensive a less expensive configuration
of the same XPS 13 a notable for its
very thin screen bezel you really get
screen almost to the edge of the whole
body right here this just has a 1920 by
1080 a standard HD screen and it's a non
touchscreen so this configuration comes
out to about $8.99 certainly a lot less
than the twelve or thirteen hundred
dollars you're gonna pay for the higher
res touch version of it now doing our
battery test we found that this thing
actually did a lot better it ran for 12
hours on a battery test which is MacBook
Air territory that's amazing either dell
has done something in this configuration
to to further optimize it for battery or
frankly powering that big 3200 by 1800
screen with the touch overlay was just
draining a lot of power so if you say to
yourself this system cost less and last
longer what's not to like about it I do
have a couple of things that are holding
me back one is I miss the touch screen
this is a non-touch display and frankly
the touch pads on these are not as great
as the ones you'll find let's say a
MacBook so you're gonna want to reach up
and touch the screen occasionally for
navigation dropping it I think is kind
of annoying you also don't get the edge
to edge glass over the display which
which means that the screen is insect
from from the bezel here and it's not
quite a slick looking although some
people will prefer you see the matte
finish right here as opposed to the
glossy finish on the touch version the
big problem of course is that you don't
have anything in
middle what I'd love to see is next to
his 13 with a standard 1920 by 1080
touchscreen and if you give me 9 or 10
hours of battery life out of that I
think that would be the best of both
worlds
I'm Dacron and that is the Dell XPS 13
non touch version</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
