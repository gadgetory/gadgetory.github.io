got a full line of Bluetooth speakers
including this flagship model the base
which is one of the better Bluetooth
values at a hundred and fifty dollars hi
I'm David Carr noise and I was
pleasantly surprised by both the build
quality and performance of this speaker
it comes in white or black and weighs
about six and a half pounds so it's on
the bigger end of the portable bluetooth
speaker spectrum it looks more like a
tabletop unit but it is portable and has
a built-in hidden handle that makes it
easier to move around your home or out
onto the patio its battery life is rated
at an ample 10 hours and it can charge
your phone via the USB charging port on
the back other extras include an
integrated mic for speaker phone calls
NFC tap to pair technology and an
auxilary input for non bluetooth devices
it uses Bluetooth 4.0 from a salad
standpoint the speaker lives up to its
name and indeed delivers good bass
performance and plays very loud what's
nice about it is that even with the bass
bent it sounds fairly clean and is
reasonably detailed without pushing the
treble too hard the key here is the
price you'll find some good sounding
Bluetooth speakers in this price range
such as the TDK life on record Trek max
834 and Sony's SRS x5 but the nine bass
arguably has a little more kick to it
and sounds a little bit bigger as I said
it's a good value at $150 and certainly
worth checking out if you're looking for
a bigger portable Bluetooth speaker with
a modern design I'm David Conroy that's
the nine bass thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
