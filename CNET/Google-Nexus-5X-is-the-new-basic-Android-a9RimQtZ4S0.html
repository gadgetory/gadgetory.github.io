is a nexus this is the brand new google
nexus 5x made by LG knock looks kind of
similar to the previous nexus 5 but
obviously there are a few design
differences we're looking at a 5.2 inch
screen here as well as the phone running
Android M 6.0 that's obviously latest
version of Android now around the back
we have a fingerprint sensor now google
says that this is only takes a couple of
seconds to register your fingerprint
initially and then every time thereafter
it takes around 600 milliseconds to
recognize your fingerprint which is
pretty quick also around the back is
Israeli twelve point three megapixel
camera now this has got a sony centre in
it weasel says that the pixel pitch is
1.55 microcapsules so that basically
means the pixel sides are pretty large
and can absorb a lot of life which is
why there is no optical image
stabilization on the new Nexus line now
so you can quickly launch the camera by
double tapping the power button go
straight into it like that which is
another cool feature of marshmallow the
Nexus 5x also uses USB see the fast
charging and of course this portrait can
go in whichever way you decide to plug
it in it's going to be available for
pre-order on the Google store as of
right now in the US UK Ireland and Japan
in more countries coming soon in the
next few weeks pricing starts at 379 for
the 16 gigabyte model it will also come
with a free 90 days of description to
the play music and a fifty-dollar play
credit for us users and it's also
unlocked and will work across major
networks in the US
internationally for more on the Nexus 5x
