here figuring out why your car is dead
in the morning and the most
fuel-efficient hi-tech VX it's time to
check the tap
II see cars differently we love them on
the road and under the hood but also
check the tech and are known for telling
it like it is ugly is included at no
extra cost the good the bad the bottom
line this is CNET on cars
welcome to CNET on cars the show all
about high-tech cars and modern driving
i'm brian coulis
well Volkswagens golf r is the king of
the golf line which is perhaps the most
durable brand of compact affordable
drivers cars and sort of understated yet
we've never driven one here on the show
so it's time to get to it let's get out
there on the road in the 2015 and check
the tech
this is a fun little box takes me back
to the first Golf GTI I drove way back
in the day this is what it felt like the
world is full of affordable cars with
kind of gray and white personality and
the golf has always been different
no variant more saturated than this guy
the Golf R now it's not a car for
everyone it's high in price and low in
production volume but it cast an
important halo over the entire
Volkswagen line with its road-going
prowl s spotting one is surprisingly
tricky you'll see some very small subtle
are badges around the side flanks in the
rear it's got some different functional
air scoops around the sides of the chin
a little different set of wheels and
body kit but overall it's not a car that
shouts look with my owner bought it
instead says rather confidently look
what I can do
right off the bat I've always liked
these VW cabins and I still do they're
clean they're kind of classic a quality
of materials in here remains really good
as for this head unit this is the best
argument for using a smartphone luckily
there's not much of it it is touch based
it's got some very crude pinch zoom and
swipe that is barely responsive they did
waste time on things like proximity
sensing so ribbons of buttons come and
go which doesn't really get me anywhere
they should have put that effort in that
investment into things like much faster
voice glynn please say a country or a
state first California sometimes it even
starts by asking me what country I want
to drive to you have note modern
infotainment applications or anything
like that
am/fm HD satellite you've got this
pigtailed device there MDI that they use
which is really horrible you've got to
buy specialized cables and don't lose
them the overall interface display
quality and clunkiness of the voice
command system on here is dreadful that
of course is not the point of buying a
Golf R so let's get on to our drive
controls here is your current one choice
only gear shift which is your DSG shift
lever you click through for drive modes
each one ups the aggression of the
shifting and the powertrain that
includes our adaptive suspension which
is optional on this car our electric
steering assist level our engine power
on rush
now in here is a big part of where
you're spending that extra 14 grand or
so over a GTI 2-liter turbocharged
direct-injected four-cylinder sitting
sidesaddle that may sound like a story
you've heard before but this one's more
uptight than the other ones we're
getting some real power here 292 horse
280 pound-feet of torque vehicle weighs
thirty three hundred pounds gets up to
60 in just under 5 seconds but still
delivering 2330 MPG though it wants
those MPG to be done on the backs of
premium gallons now behind that engine
is one drivetrain right now all-wheel
drive at a sporting fashion with a
Haldex center differential this is Audi
Quattro cousins stuff and interestingly
you cannot get a manual gearbox on the
15 you can only get a six-speed
dual-clutch or DSG as VW calls them in
2016 that will be joined by a six-speed
manual option they'll reduce the cost by
a grand or so as well as bringing you
some purity of purpose the first thing I
notice in our Golf R is that let's face
it a two litre inline-four with a turbo
is always gonna feel like a two litre
inline-four with a turbo you can get
buried under a lack of boost or two
taller gear pretty easily so it's a car
you got to stay involved in but that
doesn't bother me because that's why you
bought an r got a whole mess of power
coming on here right when I need it as
long as I keep the revs up and keep that
turbo spool now we have that DCC
adaptive suspension I haven't done an
a/b against the dead steel version but
this car does not suffer from any
understeer you point it and it kicks
right in that way I love the sound this
car makes but turns out what I'm hearing
isn't necessarily just the engine
there's something up in the towel at the
base of the windshield electronic device
called the sound actor which resonates a
synthetic growl up through the bottom of
the glass apparently a lot of folks get
in there and unplug it I gotta say it's
kind of unseemly for one of the last
great honest driving cars so
I'm sad they put it there but maybe the
engine doesn't sound very good now I
know many of you rue the fact we don't
yet have a manual gearbox in this
vehicle but I can tell you this is a
super snappy sharp and quick DSG it's
got pretty good around town manners with
the exception of getting caught
flat-footed sometimes an automatic mode
however I'd like to have that third
panel just to really get in touch with
the simple but brawny honesty of this
car just a little better and despite our
19th hour low-profile tires ride quality
is really good you will have no problem
in everyday driving with your arm since
the last Golf R we've picked up 36
horsepower and three mpg highway plus
some torque
let's price out our little R or D your
red friend now a Golf R starts a little
bit over 37,000 with destination and by
the time you add the adaptive suspension
and nav package that's one line item
like we have you're at about 40 grand
here's what I'm gonna do though I want
purity in this to really honor its golf
roots but also enjoy its special
hardware I'm gonna take out the adaptive
suspension and nav package I'm also
gonna wait till 2016 and buy the next
generation that has a six-speed manual
that takes eleven hundred dollars off
the price and now I'm just over 36 this
is not a golf for everyone in fact you
don't need my opinion to tell you to buy
one you've already made up your mind
what this car really does show is that
Volkswagen as much or more than any
other car maker knows how to extend the
line without blurring its
you find our full review on the 15 golf
are over at cars cnet.com well the
conventional wisdom would have you
thinking everybody is running around
texting and driving these days turns out
the truth is a little more nuanced than
that in both good and not-so-good way we
come back we'll find out what the
smarter and not so smart driver is doing
with handheld electronics behind the
wheel
dealing with mobile devices in the car
has been approached three major ways
first of all you've got the family of
Bluetooth hands-free either brought in
or built into the car and headset
technology secondly you've got an
ever-increasing voice recognition both
in the car and on the mobile device
itself to try and get your hands and
eyes off of it and thirdly you've got
laws and public awareness campaigns that
use both stick and carrot to try and get
you to do the right thing or at least do
it in a safer way 17 states currently
ban any handheld use of a mobile device
while driving
48 BAM texting specifically with only
Montana and Arizona holding out how's it
all working well the latest US
Department of Transportation research
indicates two things the numbers aren't
as high as you might think and those
numbers aren't changing much either
in 2013 the latest data available
researchers observed over 37,000 cars
stopped for at least 10 seconds in
traffic or at a light at almost 1400
locations around the country drivers
holding a phone to their ear has been
observed to decline modestly from 5.2
percent in 2012 to four point six
percent observed in 2013 that's still
about six hundred twenty thousand cars
at any given time during the day being
driven by someone who has half their
hands and at least half their mind on a
call the other interesting trend line is
visible manipulation of a handheld
device and that rolls up texting email
entering a GPS destination skimming
facebook what-have-you it's gone from
point four percent before the iPhone was
introduced to one point seven percent
today or about 230,000 cars on us roads
and any given time of day
it pays to double check your state's
laws on handheld calling texting while
driving and handheld use at all and
follow them there so many technologies
that make it easy to do now it's just
the right thing and remember that even a
small percent of drivers doing those
things adds up to the better part of a
million accidents waiting to happen
welcome back to see net on cars coming
to you from our home at the Mount Tam
Motor Club just north of the Golden Gate
Bridge well I can hardly think of
anything more frustrating than a battery
in your car that's dead every morning
and the frustrating part is what's
causing it this so-called parasitic loss
or phantom draw is frustrating to track
down because unless it's caused by
something visible like a light bulb how
do you spot it but I can show you some
simple tips to track it down very
quickly that you're likely going to need
at some point with today's heavily
electrical and electronic cars now the
first thing you want to do before you
start this process is to make sure
you've got a good battery state good
charge and since the car has been
crapping out I bet you've already
invested in a battery charger so hook it
up overnight let it charge up the
battery before we get started you should
see good numbers on the display next
make sure the car is not actually
drawing any power obviously it got to be
switched off the key is out doors are
closed and no lights are on if some of
those take a moment because of internal
timers now set up your meter for a test
like this I want you to put the black
cable that came with it into the port
called common and the red test lead goes
in the one that will typically say 10
amps 10 a or 10 a DC like this one
because that's the kind of test we're
gonna be doing then turn your meter on
and go to the 10 amp DC position on it's
dial now it's time to attach your meter
if you've got a charger connected to the
battery now you want to pull it off
now you want to put your positive
terminal back on make sure the car has
that on and tightened so positive is
back on negative stays off then your
meter is put in line between the cable
for negative and the terminal for
negative
now most clips are only big enough to go
around your cable getting around that
terminal on the batteries asking a lot
to just hold your connector there and
take a look at the reading on the meter
what you want to see is a number that is
in the milliamp so very low number 30 40
maybe 50 at most it's okay the battery
is not gonna die very soon with that
little bit of trickle but when I see
what I've got here nearly two and a half
amps
that's a dramatically bigger draw and
that's gonna kill my battery overnight
now that I verified I've got a draw I
need to go into the car to look for it
but still see the meter operating so get
some kind of a clamp like one of these
and make sure you've got both of your
leads from your meter connected to the
battery so you can be hands-free this is
important when you've got your meter
hooked up like this do not start the car
turn on the headlights or do anything
like that leave the car dead or you're
gonna fry that meter and who knows what
else put this meat up in the windshield
where you can see it and then let's go
around the driver's door okay now with
our meter set up where I can see it up
on the windshield I go down to the fuse
box by the way some cars have several
scattered around the vehicle check the
owners manual luckily here on the
Boxster we just have one to deal with
now it's just a very simple process just
start pulling each fuse one at a time
look at the meter see if it drops your
draw down where it should be and if not
put the fuse back in go on to the next
one it's tedious but it's easy I cost
you nothing
okay I've been pulling fuses for a few
minutes here getting no results and then
all of a sudden I found one that did
look at that nice low current reading
that's c3 on this car so I grabbed a
little fuse and app and see what it says
and it tells me that's basically
interior locking and lights so I've
discovered the system that is doing the
draw now from here it's going to be up
to you whether you want to have it fixed
or whether you think you can look around
and find out what the problem is if you
do want to try and go further and
diagnose it there are four major areas
to look at is there a motor that's
running when it shouldn't
is there a light staying on when it
shouldn't is there a switch that's
causing one of those to stay on when it
shouldn't or is there a wire going to
one of those things that I've discovered
that it's frayed or damaged that's
arcing out against some piece of metal
in the car now whether you're gonna fix
the problem you've identified or take it
to a shop and get it done you really
accomplished two things just now with
almost no effort and no cost you got
peace of mind about what the problem
really is and secondly you just found an
easy way to buy yourself some time if
you can live without the system but this
fuse used to power up you can leave it
out and now your car is not going to
discharge until you get the time and/or
money to get it fixed in a moment
exploding sunroofs and v8 engine cars
that won't embarrass you at the pump
CNET on cars returns
you
driver assists seem to be coming into a
world to take away from us the pleasure
of driving and for that we will never
forgive them but sometimes they can be a
little bit useful for example in slow
traffic up to about 37 miles an hour
this car can read the traffic signs it
can read the road markings and how fast
and how far the car in front of you is
up to 37 miles an hour and if you live
in London like I do that is the top
speed you achieve most of the time
effectively meaning that it could drive
me to and from work buy more from the ex
car team of CNET UK at cnet.com slash
welcome back to see net on cars i'm
brian coolie here's that part of the
show where I take one your emails and
this time it comes in from Alex M who
says I've been recently hearing from
friends about exploding Sun roofs and
panoramic glass roofs seems like no one
really knows the exact reason was
wondering if you guys have some idea I
have a sunroof in my car and I want to
know what I can do to minimize if not
eliminate having this problem yeah I bet
well Alex we checked into this a bit for
you and it seems to affect in fairly
small numbers some VW Audi Hyundai and
Kia's by my research and it's not common
in within those production runs now
what's happening here by the best
guesses in the auto glass biz is that
we've gone to very thin glass on those
overhead panels really all around the
car to save weight and also better and
better door seals to be honest so when
you're closing the door on one of these
cars it has thinner glass you're getting
a pressure wave inside the vehicle and
apparently under certain conditions that
are not fully understood it may cause
that roof to shatter or get weak enough
to shatter later now the good news about
auto glass in general is that it's
either tempered laminated or both your
windshield for example is both that
means it's laminated with a thin sheet
of plastic in between two sheets of
glass if it breaks it tends to hold
together as one piece and not even fall
down on you unless it's a massive
collision other glass around the sides
and over your head like you're concerned
about our temper and that means
do shatter they don't create these sharp
knife like shards you see in the movies
they make a bunch of little small
pebbles of glass that are much less
likely to injure you though it's going
to freak out if this thing goes bang
while you're driving down the road or
even when you get in the car and close
the door
if you want to find out if your car is
affected by this head over to the Nitsa
website where you can look up by VIN
number exactly what recalls apply to
your car not just your run of cars but
your exact model it's the best way to
get some peace of mind I wouldn't lose
too much sleep over it but it is
happening out there
well throughout the year we like to
bring you list of the most efficient for
cylinders hybrids plug-in hybrids and
most efficient electric vehicles for
that matter all going that green
direction but this time we're going to
cut the other direction into a direction
that technology has made possible top-5
fuel-efficient v8 now we looked at mpg
sheer horsepower and the car's
power-to-weight ratio the list we came
up with is all German by the way except
for one American at the top kicking all
their jus tonic acids number Five's of
2015 BMW 550i a 4.4 liter v8 that
delivers 20 mpg average it just pushed
out the excellent mercedes e 550 coupe
by the way to begin the list
this Beamer has 145 horsepower and a
power-to-weight ratio just below that
magic number of 10 pounds per horse very
good hit a great handling car that just
happens to be a very practical sedan
there's a lot to like here for about 65
grand second cheapest on our list number
for the 2015 audi s8 four liter v-8 20
mpg average the sporting version of the
big Audi has a v8 that you'll know when
you step on it it cranks out the most
horsepower on our list 520 now the
average mpg of 20 is at the bottom of
our list walnuts MSRP of 115 grand is at
the top of our list
hence number 4
number three the 2015 Audi a8 same basic
engine but now 22 mpg average what a
difference a single letter makes going
from s to a makes this the only car in
our list
to break 30 highway and still have that
22 average but we keep it at number
three because it is a big boy and this
smallish v8 means a power-to-weight
ratio that was our worst at 10.32 the
2015 Mercedes slk55 AMG a biggish five
and a half liter v8 but still 22 mpg
average who knew you bought an AMG to be
fuel-efficient this is the baby brother
of the big SL and it's got the
power-to-weight ratio to show for it
aleem 8.6 pounds per horse that makes it
okay for it to be the lowest powered car
on our list at 415 while time for the
best average mpg sticking clean is
everything number one you'll be glad to
hear is the 2015 chevy corvette 6.2
liter v8 but still 21 mpg average the
new c7 Vette is amazing having the
biggest engine on the list doing 455
horse and has the best power-to-weight
ratio as well mpg is 1729 close enough
to say and get about 30 largely thanks
to cylinder deactivation that make it a
3 point 1 liter for when you don't need
everything add to that the lowest price
on our list about 55 k if you've got a
sanctimonious prius driving cousin this
is the v8 to drive to Thanksgiving
thanks for watching hope you enjoyed
this episode
keep those emails coming it's on cars at
cnet.com we get a lot of show ideas from
them I read every one reply to as many
as I can and don't forget if you haven't
