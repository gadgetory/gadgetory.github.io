and right now we're taking a first look
at the new basis banned from basis
science this device falls somewhere
between a full-fledged SmartWatch and a
sophisticated personal fitness tracker
priced at $1.99 the basis isn't exactly
an impulse buy either at first glance
the basis looks like a standard even
basic digital watch it's not exactly
thin it's monochrome LCD screen is small
and there's only one obvious button
located on the right edge flip the watch
over and you'll begin to realize this is
no ordinary timepiece on the bottom of
the device are 6 stud shaped sensors
plus two green LED lights the basis uses
these to measure your heart rate by
estimating your blood flow through your
skin the basis band also features an
accelerometer which allows the watch to
function as a pedometer tracking the
steps you take additionally the basis is
designed to track the length and quality
of your sleep what sets the basis apart
from other wrist style fitness trackers
such as the jawbone up and Fitbit flex
is that it records your sleep
stats automatically all you have to do
is wear to bed in case in a
water-resistant coating the basis is
also splash proof so taking it out in
the rain or keeping it on in the shower
isn't a problem
featuring a Bluetooth radio the basis
now syncs with Android smartphones to
transfer captured data to a companion
app in the app you can set up what basis
science calls healthy habits for getting
more sleep taking morning and afternoon
laps and up in your daily activity
gamification is a factor too since the
app rewards you with points depending on
how long you stick to your pledges you
then use those points to unlock more
challenging habits plus raise your
overall level as with other fitness
cyber services like this you can also
dive into performance data in myriad
ways for greater insight I'm Brian
Bennett for cnet.com and this has been a
first look at the basis band be sure to
