yet one of the most sneered at cars on
the market
an efficiency masterpiece yet kind of
hard to justify in dollars and cents and
it's a category of one let's take a look
at the Toyota Prius family and check the
tech
okay look we've looked at tree I a
hundred times I've taken you through the
Prius see the little tiny one the prius
v the bigger one and a couple times
through the prius prius this one let's
not rehash what the car is and the
details of the cabin tech nothing
dramatically different there instead
let's talk about the reason you buy this
car and there's really one well there's
really about 50 and there they are this
car gets a real world combine on the
road 50 mpg or there abouts all the time
that number there and that's actually
kind of low for my experience with this
car over a period of 580 some odd miles
and that wasn't babying it not what i
was driving it and if you want further
proof check this out there's a four
month rolling history of this particular
prius in the hands of automotive
journalists and they don't baby anything
look at that guy it got down as low as
what 45 average one month this car is an
MPG rockstar and that's part of why it
out sells all the other hybrids by like
two-to-one but the elephant in the room
or on the dash remains that hybrid
penalty the concept that you pay more
for a hybrid with the electric motor and
all those batteries and have to earn
that back with MPG savings let's do the
numbers okay the sales weighted average
mpg of a new passenger car today the
government says is 33 mpg that sounds a
little lofty based on how they
calculated it but let's give it to them
the prius of course does 50 the average
new car today cost about twenty eight
thousand four hundred a prius that is
well equipped but not top-of-the-line
about thirty one five a difference of
around thirty one hundred dollars as of
today gasoline is about 385 a gallon in
the US more like five bucks here in
california and fifteen thousand miles a
year is the average driving so you'd be
saving at least six hundred bucks a year
in fuel and would earn back the hybrid
penalty on this car in about five point
two years but if you're in california
much sooner
if you drive a lot sooner still if you
high per mile even sooner the big
variable of course is the cost of what
other car you're considering and how
many miles you really drive and what you
pay for gas you can get a car that basic
does what this does in terms of function
for thousands less but you can't get
anything that will touch it in terms of
real-world gas efficiency so whether or
not it's right for you is not just a
matter of numbers it's got to be a
matter of commitment and whether this
car says something that you like</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
