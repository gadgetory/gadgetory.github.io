conference in San Francisco showed that
the wearables trend is quickly evolving
the vector from AI one biometrics is a
mouthguard that detects impacts it's
designed to be worn when playing
football lacrosse or ice hockey in this
front section we have a tri-axial
accelerometer and a tri-axial gyroscope
as well as a microprocessor so it's
detecting in six planes of movement
what's happening to the head when a
player is hit sensors in the mouthpiece
wirelessly transmit data to mobile
devices via an antenna on the field
real-time the coach is gonna get data
they can see where in the head that
injury occurred how hard it wasn't and
determine whether or not to take a look
at that athlete aren't just for adults
Moff is a souped-up slap bracelet that
tracks your movements using
accelerometers and gyroscopes with MA
you can perfect your ninja skills
imagine you're playing center court at
Wimbledon or perfect your drum solo Y
acts packs gesture recognition
technology into a ring called sense it
interprets hand motions allowing you to
fly a quadcopter
authenticate your identity with a
specific gesture or navigate virtual
worlds with oculus rift rocket skates
reinvent a 70s favorite with brushless
hub motors zip down the sidewalk with
these smart electric roller skates
intended to be a last mile solution you
can go 12 miles an hour and that's
limited by most sidewalk laws do you get
a ticket in theory I guess you could be
careful out there but officer I was only
going 12 miles per hour
adidas is my coach fit smart as a
fitness tracker and heart rate monitor
combo that true to its name also coaches
you through workouts we have a colored
light that reflects your workout
intensity zone so each zone has a color
that indicates the level and we use that
as sort of a language or a currency to
coach you we give you additional prompts
we've got an arrow to go up or down and
the device also vibrates to capture your
gesture logics leo offers coaching
advice but uses a different metric Leo
monitors the electrical signals produced
when muscles contract for example when
you're cycling if you're not pulling
with your hamstrings at all or perhaps
pulling with the hamstrings at the wrong
point in this pedal stroke Leo will tell
you that you're doing that incorrectly
so he interprets all that raw data for
you from personal trainer to plaything
the possibilities of wearables in San
Francisco I'm Sumida cnet.com for CBS
