a product spotlight on the 2013 version
of apple macbook air from the outside
this may seem very familiar just like
the macbook airs from last year of the
year before and it actually looks the
same from the outside however on the
inside there's enough new stuff going on
here I feel comfortable saying this is
one of the most universally useful
computers you can buy right now the big
difference this time around is this has
one of Intel's latest fourth-generation
core i series processors otherwise known
by the code name has well and that gives
you a performance boost to be sure but
more important than that it gives you a
really good battery boost and Apple is
already very well known for giving you
excellent battery life with their laptop
so when you add Haswell to that this
particular system on our video playback
test ran for 12 hours straight which is
astronomical now if you're going online
all the time or playing games or doing a
lot of other heavy lifting with it it's
like a less for 12 hours but you're
still going to be able to get through
pretty much a full day with the 13-inch
MacBook Air now that has well
architecture also gives you better
integrated graphics Mac gaming is still
not fantastic but if you do find some
games you can play you're going to get
better on board performance here without
having to have a discrete graphics card
which is not an option in a system like
this you also of course get a
Thunderbolt port that acts as a video
out and lets you access these superfast
thunderball peripherals and I think the
most interesting thing about the 2013
version of the macbook air is that it's
1099 now it used to be more expensive
they've cut the price by a hundred
dollars and when you add that to the
really high end battery life you get a
product that is just the gold standard
for what we think of as an ultrabook you
wouldn't use that term for a macbook
that's reserved for Windows PCs but
despite that this still was pretty much
what everyone thinks of when they think
of an ultrabook and that's because it's
still very thin very light even though
the design is a couple of years old and
the
the touchpad and keyboard are just
unmatched anywhere especially the
multi-touch gestures on the touchpad I'm
that ackman and that's the 13-inch
MacBook Air</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
