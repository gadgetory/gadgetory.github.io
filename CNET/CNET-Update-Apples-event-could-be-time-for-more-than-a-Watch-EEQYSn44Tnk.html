it's almost Apple watch time I'm Bridget
Carey and this is your cnet update so we
have net neutrality the Apple watch and
toejam and Earl whoo boy there is a lot
of news to talk about so let's jump
right in with Apple the company sent out
invites to press for an event in San
Francisco on March 9th and it teases us
with the phrase spring forward of course
that's a cheeky little time joke for
revealing more details about the Apple
watch but there could be more than just
a SmartWatch Apple could show off the
long fabled ipad pro a 13 inch ipad
tablet or maybe a new 12 inch macbook
air we shall see there's also buzz about
a new SmartWatch announced by LG the LG
urbane LTE it's the first ever
SmartWatch that runs on a 4G network so
you don't need a smartphone to use it
you can make calls right from the watch
but it doesn't eat its own data plan but
don't confuse this model with the one
you heard about a few days ago the LG
watch urbane runs on Android this is the
urbane LTE which looks the same but it
doesn't run Android it actually runs its
own special LG operating system and also
in the world of mobile google is
offering a sweet deal to store your
music library for free google play music
now lets you upload 50,000 music files
for free to stream on your android or
iphone through an app Apple and Amazon
have services to store music but they
cost twenty-five dollars a year and in
news that can impact the future of life
as we know it on the internet the
Federal Communications Commission has
voted in favor of net neutrality rules
that will prevent internet providers
from blocking or slowing down traffic on
wired and wireless networks and it also
stops those fast lanes you hear about as
to not allow an operator like Comcast or
Verizon charge your website like Netflix
a fee to reach customers faster than
others but things won't change overnight
once the official ruling is presented to
the public which could be days or weeks
then internet providers against the
extra regulations will take this to
court and a lawsuit could drag on for
years net neutrality won the FCC
vote but there's a round two to this
fight and that's not the only historic
news the classic cult video game toejam
and earl is making a comeback and the
original creators are asking for funding
support on kickstarter to create a
sequel in the way they always wanted it
to be done in the original game you play
as hip rapping aliens that crashed on
earth and you try to find spaceship
pieces while avoiding bogus Earthlings
the new design has a retro 90s vibe with
the same great funk music fans love
homies can get presents for donating but
if you give ten thousand dollars you can
become a character in the game there
goes my savings that's your tech news
update was always more at cnet com from
our studios in New York I'm Bridget
