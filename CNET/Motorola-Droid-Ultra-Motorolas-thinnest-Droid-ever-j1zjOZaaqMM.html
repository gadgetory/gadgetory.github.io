and right now we're taking a first look
at the motorola droid ultra the ultra
sits smack dab in the middle of
motorola's new droid smartphone lineup
on verizon available starting august
20th for 1 99 99 the ultra is the
thinnest droid smartphone ever less than
a third of an inch in fact yet manages
to pack a large 5-inch screen 4G LTE
data Android jelly bean plus a lot of
slick tricks made possible by Google
Motorola's new master highlights include
a massive 5-inch 720p OLED screen that
has bright colors and deep blacks it has
an attractive edge to edge design and is
framed by a 2 megapixel front camera
below the display are three capacitive
buttons for Android functions the only
physical buttons are a volume rocker and
power key on the phones right side a 3.5
millimeter headphone jack sits up top
while a micro USB port is placed on the
bottom edge on back is the main 10
megapixel camera with LED flash also
here is a large speaker that actually
gets really loud before you use this
phone though I suggest you clean your
hands that's because both the smooth
back surface and screen of the ultra
pick up fingerprints and grease smears
easily Motorola says the droid ultra is
built using a Kevlar unibody
construction for greater protection
against drops and spills that's a good
thing since the handset does feel pretty
slippery powering the droid ultra
android software is Motorola's new x8
mobile computing system the same setup
on the Moto X despite being based on a
dual-core CPU the ultra feels quick and
responsive it also has discrete
quad-core Adreno graphics plus a
processor for interpreting natural
language and one for contextual
computing all that hardware helps the
droid ultra do tricks like listen out
for your verbal commands and conduct
advanced Google searches and hands-free
navigation the camera app is easy to use
too featuring a simplified interface
while offering handy modes such as HDR
and panorama you can even twist the
phone twice in your wrist to wake the
ultra up and
directly to the camera the droid ultra
however does have a few pain points
first it only comes with 16 gigabytes of
on-board storage and lacks an SD card
slot to add more its battery is also
embedded and not user removable verizon
loads the device up to with its standard
selection of junky blue air I'm Brian

first look at the motorola droid ultra</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
