a very first look at Apple's brand-new
MacBook Pro with Retina display this is
kind of a new entry in the Apple laptop
line they've got the air they've got the
pro this is a variation on the pro
available only for now in the 15-inch
size and of course it's that Retina
display that makes it special it's got a
28 80 by 1800 resolution that is unheard
of in laptops and kind of like on the
latest iPhone and on the latest iPad it
makes text and images look very crisp on
the screen if you have an app like some
of Apple's native apps or like Photoshop
from Adobe or some other apps that Mac
people use a lot that's specially set up
to work with the higher resolution
display then things are gonna look
really great on there also it'll be a
while before every app is kind of
modified or updated in order to work
with the new screen now of course on a
Windows laptop you pretty much top out
at 1920 by 1080 the reason why this
display works is because it's got a
different dpi on the screen so things
actually look the correct size much like
they do on your iPad 3rd generation now
besides the big screen the other big
deal about this new system is that it is
much thinner and lighter than your
typical macbook pro it's got a lot of
the DNA of a macbook air in it and i
really thought it was almost 50/50 or
60/40 but now that i've got to see it up
close and handle it it definitely leans
much more towards the pro side it's got
these side speakers right here like you
have on a macbook pro it's squared off
and slab-like instead of tapered like a
macbook air it's actually just about to
stick overall as the air is on the
thickest part at the back of the air
maybe just a hair thicker it is however
a little bit heavier than you would
expect looking at it and looking at how
thin it is it's about four and a half
pounds I'd say this is a carry around
two to three times a week sort of laptop
but if you've ever had a lug around a
big 15-inch regular MacBook Pro you know
that that's a real armbreaker if you
have to do that more than once or twice
a week now a lot of things on here are
gonna seem familiar they got the same
Apple keyboard that everybody likes
backlit of course and a big glass
touchpad a lot of Windows systems are
coming close with the keyboards and
they're starting to come close with the
big click pan touch pants but they don't
quite have it down yet a lot of it is
the response
miss of the multi-touch gestures that
just nobody else can really seem to now
now under the hood there's some changes
to the MacBook Pro and Airlines that are
also reflected here these all have the
new generation of Intel ivory Bridge
CPUs that's the third generation Core I
series and that includes eight HD 4000
graphics from Intel that's the
integrated graphics actually work pretty
good you know they're not fantastic
fortunately you also have an NVIDIA
GeForce GT 650 GPU in here which is
great to see a discrete graphics card in
something this then and of course it's
solid-state memory only as you'd expect
that's pretty much everything except for
the 13 and 15s regular pros all the
other Apple laptops have moved to this
solid-state format which I think you
know it's just like faster yeah if you
were moving parts it does make it do a
little more maybe picking and choosing
about what you're gonna save or store
more stuff in the cloud but that's kind
of the point I think the thing I'm most
excited about besides the dual USB 3.0
ports and the dual thunderbolt ports is
something I never thought I'd see on an
Apple laptop that's HDMI I've been
asking for this for years it's finally
here it makes it so much easier to just
ate this and plug this into a big TV or
a projector or a monitor I know
Apple is stayed away from this for years
they finally obviously heard my my
plaintive cries and added HDMI for
everybody and now in order to get all
this you're gonna have to maybe save up
a few pennies and they'd be treating
your old MacBook because it starts that
starts that $21.99 that's pretty darn
expensive for just a 15-inch laptop with
only a 256 gig solid-state drives you
can trade up to a bigger one of course
that's gonna cost even more I'm Dan
Ackerman and that is the brand new Apple
MacBook Pro with Retina display
