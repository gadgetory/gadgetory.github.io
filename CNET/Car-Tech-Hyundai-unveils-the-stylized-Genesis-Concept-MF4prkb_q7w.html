with cnet.com again on the floor to 2013
Detroit Auto Show and we're taking a
look at the Hyundai H cd14 concept now I
don't know what those numbers mean let's
just call it the next Genesis sedan
it's basically a styling exercise to
kind of give us an idea of what the next
generation of Hyundai's top-tier sort of
premium sedans gonna look like and we're
seeing a lot of interesting things
happening here
for starters we've got a very sort of
aggressive out ei7 like roofline that
kind of sweeps over the front of the car
and punctuated with this very aggressive
front end it's like everything's big
here gigantic LED headlights and fog
lamps a big Chrysler s grill mean when
you've got this Genesis twing badge this
thing is more Chrysler Bentley than any
Chrysler Bentley concept we've seen in a
while underneath the hood is the 5.0
litre towel engine that we thought in
the Hyundai Genesis r-spec but that's
not really the big story here what we're
really interested in is the cabin now
behind those suicide style doors that
open wide and give you an unobstructed
view into the cabin we've got a
dashboard interface that doesn't have
any buttons now how do you interact with
it well with your eyes and with gestures
it's got eye tracking technology so as
you look around it a heads-up display it
actually selects icons for you you've
also got gesture control so you can do
things like flick through your radio
presets or grab an invisible knob to
adjust the volume of the radio or zoom
in and out of the map just by moving
your hand back and forth it's all
extremely conceptual but very cool in
the demonstration video Sundays shown us
now it will probably be a very long time
before we start seeing eye tracking and
gesture control in any car on the road
and the next Genesis may not even end up
looking anything like that but as a
standalone concept this HCD 14 is pretty
sweet-looking I'm Antoine Gooden with
