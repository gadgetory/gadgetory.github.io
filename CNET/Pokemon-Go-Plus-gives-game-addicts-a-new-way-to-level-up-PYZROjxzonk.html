smartphone screen to catch Pokemon in
the wild the new Pokemon go plus is a
$35 wearable Bluetooth accessory at
least you catch the critters without
having to take out your phone
the device has a clip to wear it on your
clothing or attach it to your bag and it
also comes with a basic adjustable
wristband so you can wear it as a
bracelet inside of the game settings
you're going to find the option to pair
it with your phone and once it's paired
you can play without looking at the
phone
the go+ device vibrates and lights up
when you're near something in the game
so a green light means you're an heir
pok√©mon that you have caught before if
you see a yellow light that means
there's a pokemon nearby that you have
not caught before click the button and
the computer will try and catch it for
you
multicolor flashing lights mean you
captured it but if it goes red that
means you failed and you only have
yourself to blame for being lazy and
trying to catch it with a button it
fails for me once when I try to catch a
pinzer that was an 800 level combat
power and then just ran away without
giving me the chance to try again if you
want to know what you caught and what
you missed you have to go into the
journal in the app the go+ device also
collects items at pokey stops when it
glows blue you know you're near pokey
stop so you press it and you'll collect
all your balls berries and potions on
the game's main screen you'll see an
icon for the plus device it appears to
let you know that it's paired you just
click the icon to unpair it the go+
accessory uses a watch battery so it's
not rechargeable it's kind of nice to
keep getting points and collecting
pokemon while just walking around I can
do it really fast with this then again
it's not as fun as actually trying to
catch it yourself on the screen but if
your Pokemon go Attucks it's pretty cool
to just keep playing really fast and
even discreetly at school or at work by
keep it in your pocket and oh there goes
buzzing again
look at me I'm a Pokemon go master</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
