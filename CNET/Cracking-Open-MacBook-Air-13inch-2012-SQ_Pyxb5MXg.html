identical to last year's model on the
outside but what about on the inside
let's crack the case on this year's air
and find out I'm Bill Detweiler and this
is cracking open although it's basic
wedge-shaped design has remained
constant the MacBook Air has undergone
some pretty significant changes over the
years in 2010 Apple dropped the
traditional hard drive in favor of
solid-state storage in 2011 they ditched
the Nvidia graphics chip for an
integrated Intel HD graphics processor
and there have been lots of other
changes from the cases designed to the
use of pentalobe screws on the bottom
cover and while Apple didn't make any
big design changes to the 2012 air they
did make a few very important hardware
improvements for starters Intel's third
generation Ivy Bridge processors now
power the air our test machine has a 1.8
gigahertz Core i5 processor but a 2
gigahertz core i7 is also available and
thanks to these new processors the 2012
airs also come with Intel's HD Graphics
4000 a step up from the older machines
HD graphics 3000 system in addition to
the more powerful processor and graphics
apple also beefed up the ram and
available storage the 2012 air can
support up to 8 gigs of RAM compared to
the 2011 s4 and the chips are also
faster 1600 megahertz compared to the
old models 1333 mega Hertz memory as for
storage the new air can be configured
with up to 512 gigs which is twice the
capacity of last year's air Apple also
claims that the new airs flash storage
is faster than previous models
rounding out the upgrades are a new 720p
FaceTime camera a pair of USB 3 ports
and Apple's new MagSafe 2 power
connector now despite all these Hardware
updates the 2011 and 2012 airs have
identical internal hardware layouts
there's a large battery two speakers on
either side a small IO board a single
cooling fan and of course a motherboard
Apple even used the exact same battery
on both airs which is impressive given
the newer machines better battery life
overall the 2012 MacBook Air is a solid
update to apples line of ultra-thin
laptops that said just remember you
can't upgrade this machine you'll want
to get all the RAM storage and
processing power you'll need when you
buy it now for more information on the
2012 air including battery life and
benchmark tests check out Scott Stein's
full CNET review and to see more
