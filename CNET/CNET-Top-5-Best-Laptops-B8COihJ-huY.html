the future this is the present and
laptops ain't going anywhere I'm Molly
wood in for Brian Cooley with a CNET
top-5 the best five laptops you can buy
right now
so why buy a laptop when tablets are the
future of media consumption well maybe
because laptops are still the future of
getting some damn work done already if
you still like typing you don't like
grease smudges on your touchscreen and
you could use a little more horsepower
than an oversized smartphone chip here
are the five laptops that are seen at
editors they are the best you can get
coming in at number five is the HP
Pavilion dm1 the main thing we love
about this guy great battery life and
the AMD fusion platform it combines that
power efficient performance with better
graphics than you would normally see in
a budget netbook because it also cost
less than five hundred bucks if it
weren't for that HP bloatware it would
be love at number four we're going the
opposite direction price-wise and size
wise but we're sticking with HP it's the
high-end HP Envy 17 the envy line is
HP's premium laptop brand in the envy 17
is a sleek aluminum macbook pro clone
with a beautiful display high-end audio
plenty of power and performance and even
USB 3.0 for around 1,500 bucks plus
trust me I actually own the HP Envy 14
and believe me when I tell you it's real
Purdy in at number three the 11 inch
MacBook Air the first MacBook Air came
off like an overpriced toy for annoying
wanna be CEO types the second MacBook
Air came off like I gotta have it
buy some reports air sales topped 1.1
million in the first three months after
launch the 11 inch model is the stunner
to unbelievably light and thin instant
on performance and very impressive
battery life although with a thousand
dollar price tag no SD card slot no
backlit keyboard and a pretty outdated
processor the MacBook Air is still a
little more flash than value but I dare
you to use one and not have to have it
in at number two you'll want to check
out that CNET editor's choice toshiba
portage AR 705 but maybe don't buy just
yet this laptop is described by our
editors as being as close to a perfect
balance of design price and performance
as you'll find in a Windows laptop so
what can make it better
Sandy Bridge the our 800 series is
coming hopefully very soon so
considering how much we love the our 705
the more powerful and efficient Sandy
Bridge processors will make the Newport
OJ's a total must-have and before we get
to number one I'd like to hear your
opinion on whether reports of the
laptops death are greatly exaggerated
Gartner research reported this week that
tablet sales will grow from 15 million
in 2010 to 54 million in 2011 and that
laptop sales will tank as a result but I
want to know what you think what are you
more likely to buy in 2011 a laptop or a
tablet
tell us in our poll at the CNET TV blog
over at blog scene at tv.com ok now it's
time for the number one best laptop as
rated by our CNET editors no surprise
here it's the MacBook Pro in any size
you want the 15-inch MacBook Pro is a
CNET editor's choice thanks to its new
high end processor options great
graphics and the new Thunderbolt i/o
port and the 13-inch model may not have
the graphics horsepower but the 2.7
gigahertz core i7 processor a serious
business and the battery life is amazing
I know some of you were hoping for a
redesign with the new models but come on
it's not like the MacBook Pro is ugly
and there you have it the five best
laptops available right now or coming
soon happy shopping everyone I'm Molly
wood and you can find all the seen at
top five videos at Cena at tv.com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
