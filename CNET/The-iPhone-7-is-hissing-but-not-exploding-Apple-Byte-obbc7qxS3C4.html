to the Apple buy for everything gonna
bad inside the world of Apple the iPhone
7 and 7 plus are finally in some of your
grubby little hands and there's been
reports of people who pre-ordered their
jet-black 7 Plus that we're told October
November but will now be getting them in
the next few days and you know what
that's a good Apple for them yeah unless
you're the guy who's still getting his
in November see that's a sad Apple
sorry bro but like almost every iPhone
launch you know what it's never smooth
sailing according to reports the iPhone
7 plus can make a hissing sound when
it's under heavy performance uh-oh did
someone say hiss gate we'll see check
this out here's the histone from 512
pixels you know what it's kind of there
I mean unbox therapy did their own test
between several phones and there is a
faint hissing but it's not like this
huge PC fan and it's pretty tough to say
this is absolutely an issue honestly
it's not that bad but yes it exists now
the consensus on line is that it's
caused by a phenomenon known as coil
noise which is the sound a high powered
processor or virtually any electronic
part can make it can happen when the
chip is under a heavy load
now Engadget tried to reproduce it on an
iPhone 7 and failed but it could point
to a manufacturing issue instead of an
actual design quirk up to this point
Apple has replaced iPhones that have
replicated the issue so if you think you
have a problem you're okay because
really there's no reason to get into a
hissy fit plus the beats having an
exploding phone but that's not all
there's another one
Apple is investigating another iPhone 7
and 7 plus issue that can result in the
loss of cellular service after turning
off airplane mode on the devices
according to Mac rumors now yasser el
hogan shot this poor quality video in
240p but it shows the result with an
iphone 7 and 6s next to each other
hashtag shot on a crappy phone now Apple
is instructing service providers to tell
customers to restart their phones but if
that doesn't work then they should
remove and
their SIM cards until they have resolved
the issue which is perfect timing for a
quick tip the hard restart on the phone
has actually changed because the new
home button so if you want to do a hard
restart hold the wake button and the
volume button down together and keep
holding them for a hard restart there
you go and now we've solved your first
world problem but wait for it another
one yeah another one Apple is working on
a fix for a software glitch with the new
lightning
earpods if you've left your new earpods
plugged in for a few minutes
audio continues to play but the remote
on the headphones stops working so you
can adjust the volume activate Siri or
even answer calls awesome
now the glitches intermittent and random
but it exists so if this has happened to
you you are not alone and the solution
isn't hey man just go wireless there's a
lot of little issues that pop up because
many of us are still using the standard
headphone jack for things like switching
between phone and laptop in the same
spot how about having multiple wired
headphones or using the auxilary
connection in your car if you don't have
Bluetooth what about all those
businesses using square now they're just
going to have to put a dongle on it just
so Apple could leave us with a fake
speaker grille that's actually a piece
of molded plastic where the headphone
jack used to be see you didn't know that
here look at the iPhone 6s with a
headphone component right here and then
the iPhone 7 with the molded plastic
piece yeah that's a bad apple and yes
I'm sure it made a little more space for
their taptic engine but all that space
they claimed they freed up a lot of it
was put into a piece of plastic but if
you still want a headphone port in your
iPhone 7 do not do this at home tech
racks decided to make a point and
drilled a hole right through the bottom
of the iPhone to bring back the
headphone jack an FYI
it doesn't actually work but the phone
still does and then some good news
display mate has rated the iPhone 7s
display the best LCD display it has ever
tested and a major upgrade over the
iPhone 6s this isn't the best display
ever on a smartphone like Apple claimed
this is the best LCD display achieving
the highest marks in color accuracy and
peak brightness with
reflectance of any smartphone also iOS
10 adoption is growing steadily even
with its initial issues after just one
week and is now installed on nearly 34%
of devices iOS 9 adoption is still the
highest on 62% of devices and in other
OS news yes Mac OS Sierra has finally
