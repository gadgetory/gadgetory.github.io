because it's got lots of specific and
numbers and commands that are easy to
remember if parallel parking spooks you
first of all is find your spot the magic
number here is five you need about five
feet more in the space than you link to
your car
compact car like this Mazda 3 is about
15 feet long thinking about 20 feet of
space pull up alongside the car ahead of
you
with about 2 to 3 feet of space in
between you now you want to back up and
here's the most critical area until the
back of that car is lined up with about
the bottom of your back seats this will
vary a bit on cars because they all have
different wheelbase overhang and seating
position this is the key thing you want
to learn about your car but it's about a
third of it overhanging that car now go
all the way full lock on your wheel
aiming into the space so you get 45
degrees in the streets look right out
and see it at this point as you're
rolling go all the way to full opposite
lock and the car should glide right in
you've got a backup camera that
certainly helps and then just do one
forward nibbles to bring in the nose and
Center up your space
and you're in it's a pretty reliable
method without having to do a lot of
fuzzy stuff the steps are real clear now
after all this parking is a skill you
may soon barely need automatic parking
Tech has been coming for a while
the first system I drove was in a 2007
Lexus LS this car will park itself Lexus
Park Assist
it took care of the hard part steering
while you handled the pedals
back then it was cumbersome tentative
and you could have made three attempts
in the time it took to make one flash
forward a few years to the Ford system
we showed you in a recent car tech 101
that still just handled the steering but
now did it really quickly and well the
2015 Ford Focus will also do this trick
for perpendicular spaces and will be
able to automatically exit a parking
spot which I didn't realize was
difficult and they have joined Volvo and
Audi among the companies that are moving
soon to the ultimate step cars that park
without you even being in them and
perhaps even able to drop you off and
then go Park on their own one day soon
even in spots too narrow for you to open
the doors once the car is there all
these technologies however must be built
into a new car so until you're in the
market use the steps we taught you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
