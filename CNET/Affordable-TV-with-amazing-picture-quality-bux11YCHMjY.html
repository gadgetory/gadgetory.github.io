cnet and this is Panasonic's TCP 55 st60
is a 55 inch plasma TV it's right in the
middle of Panasonic's 2013 lineup and I
think it's going to be one of the best
tvs of the year it's already got picture
quality pretty much equivalent to
Panasonic's best plasma last year the VT
50 that's superb picture quality's what
I'm gonna be talking about a little bit
but first let's take a look at the
exterior this television around the edge
is a little bit of metallic highlight
Panasonic called it it's glass and metal
design not too much though so it's not
very ostentatious very understated
television the thin bezel long the edge
here and the thin profile reminds me of
a little bit of an LED TV of course it's
a little bit thicker and a little bit
having intercourse it uses more power
than an LED TV but again you do get that
great picture quality of plasma below
the panel is this glossy black stand it
does have a nice low profile but doesn't
have a swivel around back the selection
of inputs pretty standard you got three
HDMI there's also a pair of USB inputs I
do like the SD card slot and rare
edition that allows you to display those
digital photos directly from your camera
panasonic changed its smart TV sweet
this year it's a little bit less simple
a little bit busier but you do get that
full customization I like that you can
go in and add any of the apps that you
want to you can even create new screens
on the downside the navigation is a
little bit slow and it is a little bit
busy unfortunately when you turn on the
TV at first you're going to be greeted
with one of these screens instead of the
actual TV picture you have to go dive
into the menu to change that the TV also
has banner ads that I'm really not a fan
of but again you go to the menu and
disable those too bad they're enabled by
default though selection of apps is very
good you get Amazon Instant along with
Netflix and YouTube there's also a few
extra apps that you're not really going
to care about including this calendar
app is also a note-taking app neither
those sync with common cloud apps like
Evernote or Google Calendar harvest so
they're a lot less useful if those which
you use to store your information on a
smartphone speaking of phones and
tablets this TV does have an app that
goes with it allows you to get some
rudimentary controls us in case you lose
remote control you can use your phone or
your tablet there's also ability to flip
photos from the tablet or phone regular
TV screen but it doesn't have more
advanced functionality like screen
mirroring found on some other TVs the TV
also supports the full HD 3d standard
which means if you want to buy extra
glasses you won't have to pay the 80
bucks for these panels
onyx we can actually get glasses from
third-party manufacturers as cheap as
twenty dollars from Samsung moving on to
the picture that's really the best thing
about the st60 there's plenty of
controls to adjust in fact this year
Panasonic added a color management
system as well as 10-point gamma and
grayscale I use those in the lab to
really hone this TVs picture to again
superb quality the real strength here is
black levels as TV can produce a really
deep inky shade of black this shadow
detail is also extremely good with those
controls color can be extremely accurate
and we also appreciate this TVs ability
reject ambient light it's got a nice
dark coating on the screen so in a
bright room it really does stand up
really well that's one of the main
differences between it and the step-down
s60 series on the downside the 3d wasn't
that great but who really cares about 3d
picture quality anyway all told the
Panasonic st60 is an affordable premium
performing television I think it's going
to be one of the best of 2013 I'm David
