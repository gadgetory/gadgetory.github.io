battery that'll outlive the competition
with a note seven out of the running
we're always mate nine is looking like a
worthy contender the design is sleek and
simple but it's not all that different
from the honor 5x it's older and more
affordable sibling all-metal soft curves
and a fingerprint scanner on the back
it's most glaring feature is that
massive 5.9 inch screen with
barely-there bezels on the sides and
though it does manage to fit a lot of
screen into a relatively compact body
one-handed operations proved nearly
impossible my other minor complaint was
its 1080p resolution which on a screen
this massive won't look quite as crisp
as other high-end phones the ample real
estate also means more space for the
battery and this one doesn't disappoint
it'll get you through the day with
charge to spare or just plug it into the
USB C port to get a full charge in less
than two hours
sadly no wireless charging above the
fingerprint scanner the dual lens lekha
branded camera that we first saw on the
p9 with a few more bells and whistles
one is a 12 megapixel color sensor and
the other is a 20 megapixel
black-and-white shooter
this means more information for the
phone to work with when processing each
image and more shooting options for you
so many in fact that it's hard to find
them all swipe right for modes left for
settings or swipe out from the arrow
icon for Pro Tools and then you have the
static icons opposite the shutter this
includes a blurred background effect
similar to the one found on the iPhone 7
plus on the front camera option with a
wider angle lens for selfies the specs
under the hood are just as impressive
always prioritize speed and performance
on this phone with an octa-core
processor 4 gigs of RAM and a smart
algorithm intended to optimize
performance over time based on usage
it's still running its emotion UI over
android nougat but this version seems
less obtrusive and more customizable it
comes with 64 gigs of on-board storage
and an SD card slot if you're looking
for a big screen Android phone the mate
9 is a solid pick but if you want
top-of-the-line eye candy you might be
better off waiting for the mate 9 Pro
with a higher resolution display and a
sleek curved screen reminiscent of the
late note 7 at a slightly higher price
