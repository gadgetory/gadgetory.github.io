little overheated they even get sweaty
ears now it doesn't have to be
personally but I've heard about it and
HP wants to do something about that with
their brand new omen mine frame advanced
gaming headset it claims to be a set of
headphones that will actually keep you
cool while you're gaming so we're gonna
take a peek we're gonna plug it in we're
gonna try it out I've got them right
here and this looks like a pretty
standard set of gaming headphones it's
got a little fold-out microphone it
connects via a USB and inside instead of
panning or fabric on the inside of the
ear cups there's actually metal and I
actually have my temperature gun right
here and if I do a little check on the
inside with a little laser pointer it's
about 78 degrees on the inside of the
ear cup keep that in mind we're gonna
come back to that number later we're
gonna take these we're gonna plug them
in via a USB to my little desktop right
here got it on the first try and that
means the headphones turn on and we
should see a little light here and a
little light there on the microphone and
right away you can tell the
thermoelectric plates are turning on
they're very similar to little plug in
USB accessories you would see for
computers where it's a little pad with a
circle on it and you plug it into your
USB port and you put a soda-can on it
and it makes the soda cold after a while
and I can already feel it getting a
little chilly I'm gonna slip these
headphones on right now play a little
Tomb Raider and let's see how hot things
get
I don't really get overheated while
gaming I don't have sweaty years I swear
I do not but if you do get a little hot
when you're playing something like
fortnight or another competitive game
which I'm no good at
I could see wanting to cool off a little
bit so right now I can feel just by
putting my fingers on the plate that is
actually very cold on the inside and
it's getting warmer on the outside as
the heat is transported from the inner
part of the panel to the outer part take
my handy temperature gun again and now
in the interior I'm down to about 67 65
in some places generally about 67 that's
a full 10 degrees cooler in just a
couple of minutes than what we were when
we started do you need self cooling
headphones probably not but these have
all the other features you're looking
for in a standard set of gaming
headphones it's got the flip down mic
it's got seven point one virtual
surround sound big cushy cups and an
adjustable head strap and of course you
plug them in they get cold
that's HP's new mind frame headset
available now for just two hundred
frosty dollars</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
