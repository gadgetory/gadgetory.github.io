your phone cramping your style paranoid
about phone Snatchers on your commute
does the possibility of dropping your
phone and cracking your screen makes you
anxious every day yes if you suffer from
these common nuisances you may be the
right candidate for an mp3 player really
care you remember those why would anyone
need an mp3 player well it's a useful
supplement to your fun downloading music
onto your phone takes up valuable space
that could be used for apps or dog
photos and streaming music services eat
up your data plan as a standalone
accessory you can leave your phone in
your bag and use it for uninterrupted
listening when you need it the most
exercising commuting or relaxing they
even make those anymore yeah they
actually do if you want something tape
to play music and podcast in your ears
there are a few options including the
iPod shuffle it's perfectly sized for
taking with you on a run and its
built-in clips securely keeps it in
place it's easy to press the buttons on
the front and since it doesn't have a
screen you can't quickly pick what you
want to listen to the iPod Nano on the
other hand does have a screen it also
has bluetooth so you can pair it with
your Bluetooth headphones for listening
wirelessly if you don't like using
iTunes or need something that can hold
more music
the sandisk clip jam is an affordable
alternative it has a no-frills low
resolution screen convenience built in
clip and a micro SD card expansion slot
to add more storage
it's plastic design doesn't feel as
solid as the aluminum clad iPods but is
cheaper than both of them it's important
to note that none of them have Wi-Fi
they don't work with popular streaming
services like Spotify Apple music or
Pandora and that's a deal-breaker for me
I use Spotify and rarely download music
anymore
so I'm better off using my phone instead
however if future models include Wi-Fi
and stay priced pretty cheap that could
very well change
hold on right after these people I think
that was good though I think we got that
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
