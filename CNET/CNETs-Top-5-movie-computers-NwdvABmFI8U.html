we meet we count down another hot cnet
list I'm Tom Merritt it's time to
redress a great wrong now there have
been many lists to top robots from
movies and many lists of top computer
movies but never a list of the top movie
computers at least that I could find
until now let's count down the top-5
movie computers at number 5 Colossus
from Colossus the Forbin project a
Defense Department supercomputer joins
forces with its Soviet counterpart and
becomes sentient this is the voice of
world oh baby and blade or disobey and
die now that's where the semantic web
stuff you hear about is headed also
funny note that's the movie studios
payroll computer coming in at number for
the enterprise computer the voice of May
Jill Barrett counted down countless
self-destructs responded to requests and
announced Dec numbers in the elevator
Scotty even adorably mistook a primitive
Mac for his beloved computer hello
computer up to number three master
control program from Tron technically
software I guess but the software on the
income mainframe mcp tried to eliminate
the Tron security program as well as the
digitized version of programmer Kevin
Flynn end of line
sliding into number two whopper wopr war
operation plan response computer
featured in the movie wargames would you
like to play a game have you ever run
into opera on the net you know what you
can do just trick it out of global
thermonuclear war by playing tic-tac-toe
before we get to number one let's take a
look at the movie computers that didn't
quite make the top five and thanks to my
colleagues and the folks on Twitter for
the suggestions good stuff all right
let's get to our number one the top dog
in the dog pound of movie computers it
became operational on January 12 1992 at
number one it's the Hal 9000 the
heuristic we programmed algorithmic
computer from 2001 a Space Odyssey at
glowing red eye that beautiful singing
voice that keen ability to know when you
need to take a stress pill and lie down
all excellent reasons to put how in the
top spot along with the fact that we
were kind of afraid of getting blown out
of the airlock if we didn't so many evil
computers on the list you don't see any
of them getting a job at Google willya
well that's it for this edition of Cena
top 5 thanks for watching I'm Tom
Merritt see you next time I feel much
better now I really do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
