I is setting some kind of sales records
like most new things from Apple tend to
do but that doesn't mean you necessarily
want to buy one
I'm Brian Cooley here with the top 5
reasons you may not want to buy the new
iPad number 5 is price the price hasn't
gone up but it hasn't gone down either
the iPad is already the most expensive
tablet per gigabyte of storage on CNET's
current list of the five best largely
because Apple tolerates no discounting
and you may also find the snap fit case
from your iPad 2 doesn't fit your new
iPad gotta buy another one there oh you
may also find you need a bigger iPad
than you had in mind because the new
Retina screen has begun this mass
conversion to fatter apps and hefty or
HD movies on iTunes
more on that in a moment number 4 it's
heavier and thicker ok that last one's
kind of petty it only went from point
three four two point three seven inches
in thickness but that's just enough for
some of the tight-fitting iPad 2 cases
to not transfer to the new iPad you have
to buy a new one then also the Wake
blind almost 2 ounces now both these
specs are going the wrong way on a
device that already got some knocks for
feeling kind of heavy in the hand number
three the Retina display
oh it's twice the resolution but not
necessarily twice the quality certainly
not for video you see just like doubling
a camera's megapixels does it make your
photos twice as good
our TV guy David Katz Meyer found the
new double screen resolution on this new
iPad doesn't make video look that much
better in fact he said the improvement
ranges from subtle to non-existent icons
and text look a lot better but for video
this is not gonna be like that night and
day thing when you got your first HDTV
number two it still got one main port
doing a lot of things and one of those
things is making you spend money on
adapters USB HDMI SD card VGA those all
require an adapter or two or three more
to buy mortal
and by again been there before I take
you to the number one reason why you
might not want to buy a new iPad the two
features that are the least trumpeted
about it first the Verizon 4G model is
the first iPad that is also a Wi-Fi
hotspot but you didn't hear that yet
powered by that fast 4G connection that
means you can really tear a few devices
off it and have enough bandwidth to go
around and secondly this is the first
tablet ever with Bluetooth 4.0 which is
fast enough to stream video can use
extremely low power and work with a host
of new devices the Bluetooth folks tell
us will not have a problem pairing okay
the number one reason why this iPad may
not be for you is you have an iPad 2
this didn't stop Apple from selling 3
million of the new ones in the first
three days but one survey indicated a
lot of those folks didn't already have
an iPad they were new to the category if
you already have a 2 it's lighter its
thinner it's just as fast on Wi-Fi has a
display I never heard anyone complain
about until a few days ago and is no
more port challenge than the new one oh
and it's got a case you already paid for
and still fits
for all our iPad coverage little own
details and great big how-to guides
