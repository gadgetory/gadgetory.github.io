program
it's leasing not owning with benefits
and you can get a new phone every year
instead of paying the carrier's a
monthly fee to subsidize the cost of
your phone you pay Apple this is on top
of the cost of your data and voice
service with apples program you sign up
with one of the four major US carriers
the phone is unlocked and you get
AppleCare this covers you for hardware
repairs software support and two
accidental damage incidents but is it
right for you
here are three different scenarios for
three very different users to keep
things simple we're comparing prices for
a 16 gigabyte iPhone 6s and not
including the price of a wireless
service remember when you upgrade before
you've paid off the entire lease period
you have to trade in the phone because
you never owned it scenario one early
adopter Erica you're the type of user
who upgrades every year and always
buyers Apple care your minimum cost is
three hundred and eighty eight dollars
and ninety two cents after the first
year apple's program makes sense because
after twelve months you can trade in
your iphone 6s and the leasing cycle
starts again scenario two frugal Frank
you're looking for the cheapest way to
get an upgrade right now that's
t-mobile's
jump on demand plan pay five dollars per
month when you trade in your existing
phone otherwise it's $20 a month if you
don't trade in the minimum cost is $60
for the first year scenario three one
carrier wander for regional coverage or
other reasons you stick with one carrier
but still want a yearly upgrade Sprint's
iPhone forever plan will cost you $15
per month when you trade in your old
phone otherwise its $22 a month the
minimum cost is one hundred and eighty
dollars after your first year Verizon
and AT&amp;amp;T don't technically have leasing
programs but if you sign on to a monthly
installment plan you own the handset
once all payments are made AT&amp;amp;T s next
twelve plan has a minimum cost of three
hundred and ninety dollars after a year
plus an upgrade fee to get a new phone
but
if you want to be on Verizon and upgrade
every year you have two options
sign up with Apple's program or pay off
the phone after one year sell it and use
that cash to buy a new handset remember
it's a competitive market out there so
prices and deals are always subject to
change those are some of your iPhone
upgrade choices in a nutshell it is
complicated but hey there's always
Android for more check out our full
