buzz report the show about the tech news
that everyone is talking about this week
it's Twitter's business plan you're
embarrassing status updates preserved
for all time and a Molly rant in video
form but first it's the gadget of the
week the gadget of the week is the new
microsoft kin line the company announced
two new feature phones this week as a
result of its pink project and that time
it bought danger you know the ones who
make the sidekick yeah now there's a lot
to distract you from the phones
themselves there's the weird name the
kind of hilarious hipster website videos
and then the fact that they have a
social media sharing feature that they
call the Kin spot which is just kind of
bizarre but actually these are pretty
cool little phones for the social media
set it's super easy to share pictures
and comments and messages with your
friends and everything you do like text
messages or say pictures you take with
the kintu's 8 megapixel camera is all
backed up in the cloud at the Kin studio
website I mean they're neat in fact I
might even want one if I spent more time
at the beach or in clubs alas I am a
grown-up and must settle for the Droid
and now for the news twitter has a
business plan it's spam I mean Promoted
Tweets see their tweets that advertise
something but at first they'll only show
up as like sponsored results when you
search for something or you might see
them if you follow a specific company
like Starbucks although I guess
starbucks is whole twitter feed is kind
of a sponsored tweet anyway twitter says
it's thinking about maybe allowing these
promotional tweets to show up in your
regular twitter stream you know down the
road but right now they just really want
the ads to be contextual and organic and
non-intrusive really it's just sort of
the most half-hearted business plan you
ever did here and it seems like if
anything it's just to get pinched or
capital guys to stop freaking out and
keep giving Twitter money ya know
Twitter you're a free service on the
Internet it's time to face facts ad
supported or bust literally in other
twitter news everything you've ever
twittered will soon be indexed and
searchable on google so yeah
thought that future employers searching
for you on facebook was bad no you're
drunk tweets and breakfast updates are
now part of web history forever oh and
Twitter just donated its entire archive
of tweets to the Library of Congress
because we need to have a historical
record of that one time in history when
everyone communicated their arbitrarily
abbreviated but now thoughts to each
other all day every day so that like our
grandkids can use it to make fun of us
this is gonna be so embarrassing in
other news this week Apple has delayed
shipment of the iPad overseas saying it
has much higher US demand than
anticipated like I said eBay right right
and in other Apple news new rumors that
the date of the next iphone announcement
is jun 22nd and some screenshots surface
this week that seemed to show traffic
going to an iPhone app from a verizon
iphone didn't I tell you not to sign a
new contract with ATT didn't I and
finally announcing a new segment on the
buzz report Molly rants Ludacris
hopefully you know about my new blog at
news.com slash Molly hyphen rants the
hyphen is its own rant fodder well some
of you have been asking for it in video
form so here goes this week a government
watchdog agency reported that most
estimates about the impact of piracy and
counterfeiting on the economy are either
totally made up or are simply wild
assumptions with no basis in fact for
example the FBI said in 2002 that US
businesses lose 250 billion dollars a
year to counterfeiting when the General
Accounting Office asked the FBI where
they got the number the FBI basically
said we pulled it out of our but the
business software Alliance said it lost
nine billion dollars to piracy in 2008
the GAO said um that number also came
out of their book the report also
mentions the mpaa which has already been
busted for totally lying about the
number of illegal downloads happening on
college campuses but keeps on making
piracy look worse
it is with numbers that you guessed it
totally came out of there but now all of
this fantasy based information is the
kind that leads to really bad overly
broad laws like the DMCA and it lets the
RI double-a sue people into bankruptcy
or just extort settlement payouts from
them based on totally fictional claims
of lost revenue or even better it lets
our own administration continue to
negotiate this crazy global
anti-counterfeiting trade agreement in
secret even though it's probably going
to break the internet and who knows what
else that is appalling some number
producing but should seriously get
spanked for that and that's the buzz
report for this week everyone I'm
Hollywood and thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
