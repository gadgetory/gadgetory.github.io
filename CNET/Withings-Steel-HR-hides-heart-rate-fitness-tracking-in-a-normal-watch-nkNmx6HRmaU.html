looking watches now Withings is at a
watch that's done that for years but the
steel HR adds a few extras optical heart
rate tracking for one and an LED display
embedded into an analog watch face the
steel HR can be an everyday type watch
horrorshow digital readouts for fitbit
type stats even if you don't use the
second screen the steel HR tells the
time shows your Fitness progress on a
second analog dial and automatically
tracks activity and sleep the added
display shows step count heart rate and
distance it also has a silent alarm to
vibrate and wake you in the morning
the whiffing steel HR is also swim proof
and you can track swimming with it
Biden swim with it I did use it to track
activities and mild workouts and the
heart rate tracking while a nice ad
isn't as easy to monitor as on a Fitbit
or Apple watch and didn't seem quite as
accurate the screen doesn't turn on
unless you press a side button and at
workout mode the readout is hard to see
when moving fast the steel HR is smaller
watch design may not be perfect for
everyone but I loved it and it's
rechargeable battery in last three weeks
which is great for an additional two
without heartrate Withings health app is
more bare bones than Fitbit but it's a
solid pick for people who want to focus
on weight loss and blood pressure
tracking Withings has other accessories
that track both the whiffing steel HR
isn't a Fitbit theater but it does show
how close a regular looking watch can
get</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
