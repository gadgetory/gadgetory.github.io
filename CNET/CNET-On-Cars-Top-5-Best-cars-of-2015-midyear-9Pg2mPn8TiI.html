to take a look at the cars CNET has
reviewed that scores the very best so
far in 2015
I'm Brian Cooley let's go number five
the 2015 audi s5 with a score of 8.3
the v8 engine is gone but we love the
2015's supercharged v6 and of course the
essential Quattro all-wheel drive on the
downside this car's infotainment rig was
a step or two behind other outies no 4G
no touchpad no really big LCD track
purists won't care otherwise you should
number for the 2015 BMW 740il DX Drive
in be number one on a list of most
vowels it gets a score of 8.3 BMW has
proved best that modern turbo Diesel's
can be tuned for sporty performance and
even this big car proves it that diesel
torque feels like it shaves about 1/3
off the cars perceived heft while the
cabin delights with I Drive 4.2 that has
connected nav and about the best HUD in
the business number three the 2015 Audi
a3 Cabriolet 8.4 score also an editor's
choice that's right the lonely a3 ranks
a couple notches above that s5 it's a
great driver that doesn't just rely on
its convertible top to make friends and
the a3 was the first US Audi to bring us
integrated 4G which utterly transforms
Google Earth and Street View at live
search oddly enough no voice command you
would have figured a company this smart
would have found some other place to
mount the sealing microphone when the
ceiling went away
number two the 2014 BMW i3 gets a lofty
8.9 this one's gonna be a little
controversial especially since there
isn't an eighth after the letter I it
has carbon fibre underpinnings though
and a dwell magazine like interior
combining with I Drive and those
interesting coach doors that make the i3
feel a lot bigger than their it's a lot
more money than a Nissan Leaf for about
the same range but we got the range
extender option which Nissan doesn't
do along with several other aspects of
this car before I get you to number one
let's take a look at dead last
our lowest rated car reviewed so far
this year it's the 2015 Chevy Trax mini
crossover a 6.3 not so much that it
failed at its mission its that its
mission is rather Spartan its LCD head
unit doesn't even offer factory
navigation there are almost no driver's
safety assist mpg wasn't even quite that
good and that ugly black body cladding
all around screams this is all I could
afford but if that is the case you'll
move a surprising amount of people and
stuff for a little over 20 grand the
number one car we've checked out so far
this year is the 2015 tesla model s p85d
an amazing 9.3 score and an editor's
choice adding a second motor to this car
gave the big battery model s insane
acceleration it says so right on the
dash more importantly it gave it all
wheel drive this is also the Tesla that
pushers in their big move toward
autonomy mostly by a over-the-air
software updates
it's a near-perfect car if you buy into
evey religion at all the downsides
include a $120,000 price none up seen
that style and the fact that owning a
Model S today is becoming kind of like
owning a BMW in the 80s if you know what
I mean
