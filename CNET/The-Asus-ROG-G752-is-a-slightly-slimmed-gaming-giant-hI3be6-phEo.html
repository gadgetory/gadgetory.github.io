that
among the biggest is the assist line of
the ROG or Republic of gamers laptops
they're they're gigantic
this big gaming laptop slab right here
is actually the new slimmed down version
it's Mujeeb 7-5 to sequel of course of
the g7 5-1 you'd really have to see them
side by side to realize it this is
actually a little bit slimmer and
lighter although it's still it's still a
real backbreaker
they've also lightened up the design a
little bit now you've got instead of
just matte black you've got kind of
these brushed metal and copper accents
all over it obviously cool backlit keys
they've got macro keys here I never use
them but if you want to pre program
things like hit the multiple button
presses at once or launch a specific
program well you've got some keys for
that I also like how they have a
separate app for checking out your CPU
or GPU temperature and clock speed and
doing a lot of little adjustments like
that you can have multiple profiles if
you're one of those obsessive types and
wants to switch you know between game
playing and media viewing and have
different profiles that set up for that
as well now this is not an inexpensive
gaming laptop this configuration is
$17.99 and for that you don't actually
get the top top top of line gaming part
you get a new current gen core i7 CPU
but it knocks the graphics card down to
an nvidia geforce 970 m for this kind of
money I'd like to get a 980 at maybe
even that's a little bit more about
$2,000 you can get that from somebody
else you can of course buy a more
expensive configuration of this as well
although for regular everyday gaming
even new games like fallout 4 we were
able to crank it up to high detail
levels played at full 1920 by 1080 of
course being a high-end gaming laptop
you're gonna get good performance good
parts but you don't get more modern
things like a touchscreen or like a
higher res or 4k screen usually see
those more multimedia laptops rather
than a gaming ones that is the isuzu ROG
