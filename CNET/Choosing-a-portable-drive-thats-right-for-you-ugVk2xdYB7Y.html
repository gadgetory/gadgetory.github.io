of extra data with you on the go is on a
portable drive I've seen as so many
question here a few simple thing to keep
in mind first the connection basically
it would not drive it can plug into the
computer there's two main types now
thunderball and the USB tether ball is
very fast and straight forward just make
sure your computer has it too now ESP is
a bit more complicated because even
though is everywhere you want to drive
the support USB 3.0 or 3.1 because in
speed 2.0 and earlier are very slow also
this new connector now on us bc which
will be the only USB connector in the
future so if you want your drive to work
now and few years from now get Wonder
has a USB see in fact if you have a new
macbook which I do USBC is the only
option next is the performance if you
want a faster I for heavy task such as
HD movie editing off you need to quickly
transfer a large map data from one place
to another gather drive that houses
inside a solid-state drive or SSD on the
other hand if you just want to do daily
backup jobs or if you have an old
computer a hard drive base portable
drive will do finally the capacity
obviously the more the better but also
mean more expensive especially if you
are for an SSD Drive and that's it of
course that's only one way to be
absolutely sure that you get the best
ride on the market do what I do and get
all of them every single model and then
maybe you can't even take over my job
not my name though because there's only
one down oh and he's looking at you good
look back
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
