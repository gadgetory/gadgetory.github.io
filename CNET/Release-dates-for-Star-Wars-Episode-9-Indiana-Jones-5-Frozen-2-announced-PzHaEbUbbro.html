a boatload of upcoming movie release
dates on us
and guess what we're only gonna have to
wait a year and a half between Star Wars
Episode eight and Star Wars Episode nine
instead of two years so yay episode nine
will be coming to theaters six months
earlier than we anticipated picking up a
May 24th 2019 release date wreck-it
Ralph - also got a nudge forward and
will premiere on November 21st 2018
instead of March 9th 2019 in slightly
less awesome news
Indiana Jones 5 got pushed back a year
and will now hit theaters on July 10th
2020 but that's to make way for the
live-action remake of The Lion King
which is taking in these original
premiere date of July 19th 2019
Harrison Ford isn't getting any younger
though let's hope he can still punch and
chase hordes of Nazis without needing
rehab on his hip other big tentpole
Disney flicks got an official release
dates to avid - bearnaise wrinkle in
time adaptation will drop on March 9th
2018 and since you probably need a
warning for all the catchy music the
kids won't stop singing for 5 extra
years frozen 2 will arrive on November
27th 2019 so let's recap this in
chronological order a wrinkle in time
March 2018 wreck-it Ralph - November
2018 star wars episode 9 may 20 19
live-action Lion King July 20 19 then
frozen to November 2019 and Indy five
July 2020 now I hope you wrote all that
down because there will be a quiz later
and also that's not counting all of the
other tentpole movies Disney has planned
in between all those releases I don't
know like all those Marvel and Pixar
movies you might want to see for more
