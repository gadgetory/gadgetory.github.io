Britax been nine eight seven six five
four three two
our ecology now
and you saw a falcon 9 liftoff in a
beautifully clear shot there at 4:14
p.m. Eastern at t plus ten seconds the
thrust vector control system tilted
Falcon 2 beginning hitch kick maneuver
to get it going sideways you just heard
that we're going supersonic and we're
about to go through max Q when the
Rockets pushing hardest against the
atmosphere because experience effect
that an expression
cutoff happening just a few seconds from
now
Piku
and there you saw those events occur
you can even see some of the flicker
from Merlin vacuum engine clean as it
clicker in the cameras
with the top of the interstage there for
a moment for those of you just joining
us we had three events from rapid
succession we had a main engine cutoff
from that first stage we had a stage
separation event and then we had a
second stage light
I fall quickly then by a fairing
separation everything is going great
right now Falcon 9 is looking pretty
good right now let's go over what we can
see on your screen on the left hand side
that's a camera mounted on the top of
the first stage of the rocket looking
down towards the nine Merlin engines at
the bottom in that view you can see
those titanium grid fins they slowly
deployed at just after stage separation
and those grid fins will allow the
Falcon 9 first stage to guide itself
back down towards the drone ship of
course I still love you you can see
brief flashes of those cold gas
thrusters as they guide Purdue provide
additional control authority for that
first stage on the right hand side of
your screen is a camera mounted at the
very bottom of the second stage looking
down towards the Merlin vacuum nozzle of
course at the very other end of that
stage is the Bangabandhu satellite one
right now that Merlin vacuum engine is
glowing red-hot with those exhaust gases
as it repels Bangabandhu satellite one
into its final geostationary transfer
orbit so it looks like we're don't have
a great video signal with that first
cage right now but we do have
confirmation the landing burn has
started those landing legs should be
deploying very
and
after a brief interruption in the video
signal we are looking at the 25th
recovered first aid of a falcon 9
vehicle welcome back for those of you
just joining us we are only about 30
seconds away from the deployment of
Bangabandhu satellite one on the right
hand side of your screen you can see a
camera view of the satellite itself from
the very bottom it's currently attached
to the top of that second stage by way
of a payload adapter fitting in about 10
seconds we should be able to see that
payload adapter fitting release and
vongavel new satellite one will be on
its way let's watch that
