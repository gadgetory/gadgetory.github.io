for cnet.com and I'm here with the JBL
micro wireless speaker this is a
Bluetooth speaker obviously very small
something you can just throw in your bag
what's cool about it is that you can
both go into wireless mode pair it with
a smartphone tablet there's also a
built-in cord that allows you to hook it
up to a device that doesn't have
bluetooth apart from that there's this
little loop on the top I think you can
clip it on to a backpack or something
else it didn't come with any sort of
clip-on device but you could also
probably hang this from a Christmas tree
if you wanted to as well but this is a
small lightweight device as far as other
little interesting design traits the
volume control on this is not a digital
volume control you simply turn a knob to
raise and lower the volume
it's very old-school in terms of that if
you're wondering how this sounds I can
tell you that it doesn't sound great but
does sound probably better than you
think it would and it does sound a lot
bigger this is a mono speaker this is
not a stereo speaker system and it does
play pretty loud for what it is I can't
say it's incredibly clear or detailed
and there is not a ton of base but for
most people the sound should impress for
what it is and its size this has a
built-in lithium ion battery that gives
you about 5 hours of play it charges via
USB as for the price this one lists for
$59
that's about what you'd expect to pay
for one of these smaller bluetooth
speakers with a built-in rechargeable
battery hopefully you'll see for a
little less on line I'd like to see it
in the 40 to 50 dollar range well I
wouldn't call it a bargain I wouldn't
call it an overpriced product either is
an attractive small speaker that you can
take with you even fits in your pocket
I'm David Carr noise and that's the JBL
micro wireless bluetooth speaker thanks
for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
