announcements give your occasional Nexus
7 or galaxy s3 but a lot of companies
are saving their big products for the
holiday buying season but what can you
expect from them and is it worth waiting
for miss top 5 we're counting down the
most anticipated products for the second
half of 2012 and we're starting it off
with the Nintendo Wii U this thing has
been shown off at e3 for two years in a
row now and if they don't ship this in
2012 it's not looking so good for
Nintendo they really need to deliver
this and show us some compelling reasons
to buy it because in 2013 it's going to
be all about the next generation of Xbox
and Playstation at number four new
tablets from amazon and barnes and noble
last year these guys basically created
the two-hundred-dollar tablet category
but with google nexus 7 out now they're
gonna have to step things up we're
taking a new Kindle Fire possibly one
with the tenant screen and a nip tablet
they may tie into xbox and windows now
that Microsoft has a stake in it these
could give the nexus 7 a run for its
money unless number three has anything
to say about it the ipad mini rumors
about a smaller cheaper 7 inch ipad have
been floating around since 2010 but
they're becoming a lot harder to ignore
with all the action around the 7-inch
tablet space you just know that alpha
would love to dominate that category too
typically Apple shows off iPods in the
fall but with sales of those on the
decline maybe it's time to create a new
product if for no other reason than to
spoil the party for number two windows 8
the rollout for Windows 8 is going to be
like nothing else we've seen from
microsoft it touches on laptops desktops
tablets and phones we're going to hear
about this thing from every angle and
Microsoft is going to spend no small
amount of money to prevent this thing
from going over like Windows Vista
before we get to number 1 let's take a
look back at seen its most anticipated
products of 2011 that number one looks
familiar oh that's right because it's
back here for another turn Apple threw
us a curveball last year and we got an
iphone 4s that looked a whole lot like
an iPhone 4 but they can't play that
trick again Apple will have to show us a
new design and some unique new features
worth getting excited over
whatever they do if the reaction to the
last five iphones is any indication then
people are going to lose their minds for
this thing and that's why we put it at
number one now if you can't wait for
fall to get your fix you can find all
the latest technology reviews over at
