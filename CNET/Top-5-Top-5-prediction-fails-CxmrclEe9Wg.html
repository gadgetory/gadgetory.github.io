prediction fails I've been doing this
show for something like 25 years now we
get excited about a lot of upcoming tech
we dug back into the archive to find the
top five times what we thought was can't
miss tech completely missed the mark
no no here 10 20 windows phone this
phone should push Microsoft's mobile
operating system into solid number three
footing competing with Android and iOS
one of the most important parts of a
phone at this point is the camera and
the Nokia 10 20 packs in a 41 megapixel
camera on a phone and it doesn't look
like anything out there today it'll
definitely stand out in the crowd the
motorola rokr this is a big deal the
motorola rokr works with itunes so you
don't need to carry a phone and an iPod
shuffle anymore Steve Jobs called it the
iTunes phone because it has itunes
built-in 100 songs on a phone there's
even a dedicated iTunes button on the
phone it's like a phone and a half the
handspring visor by now everyone knows
about the Palm Pilots the handspring
visor it's not some of the same people
who built the pilots the visor brings
expandability on the back as a port kind
of like a game board so if you've ever
wanted to use your PDA as a phone you'll
be able to do that with advisor Sega's
newest home console is all that and a
bag of chips it's got a built-in modem
so you can play with other people over
the Internet just make sure no one picks
up the phone when you're gaming though
then there's the controller with a mini
video game console right inside it can't
fail web TV web TV is a great idea a box
brings the World Wide Web to television
instead of having to be stuck at your
desktop you can sit back on the couch
with a wireless keyboard and a huge
screen it's genius
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
