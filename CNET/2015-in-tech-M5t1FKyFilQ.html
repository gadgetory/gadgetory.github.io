products at last hacking scandals that
rocked the internet and a milestone near
to every geeks heart the tech world this
year has been dynamic divisive even
dangerous here are the 2015 tech moments
that blew our minds starting with a
transitional phase for gadgets this year
is the smartphone boom continued to cool
even high-profile handsets like the
iphone success moto x force samsung's
capacious galaxy s6 edge and the invite
only one plus to all played second
fiddle to headline-grabbing wearables
like the Apple watch which received a
positive if not ecstatic reception when
it arrived in April other emerging
technologies edged closer to commercial
reality this year with 4k landing on
more TVs and even a smartphone while HTC
chose the spring to announce its v vr
headset 2015 will be remembered as the
year that Apple gave us some more varied
tech to play with this year we rocked
out with Apple music a streaming service
to take on Spotify fiddled with a brand
new Apple TV with a gaming capable
touchpad remote and cowered in the
shadow of the twelve point nine inch
iPad pro which appeared to take some
design cues from Microsoft Surface pro
series of hybrids which in October added
a fourth iteration that topped off a
strong year for Satya Nadella and chums
we were impressed with Microsoft's first
laptop and Windows 10 which in the
summer corrected the missteps of Windows
8 but not all of 2015's tech was so
cheery in fact this year saw technology
becoming more fiercely politicized as
new questions arose surrounding the
future of the internet and our online
security 2015 began with concerns that
Samsung TVs could be sending our private
conversations to third parties then got
progressively more unsettling as a
series of major hacks challenged our
view on how private our online
activities really are joining the ranks
of Patrian t-mobile and kids technology
firm vtec extramarital dating sites
Ashley Madison was perhaps the years
highest-profile security breach with the
data plunderers dumping private user
data online a month after the initial
hack
lesson here is that nothing you do or
say online is ever private march in the
US or the FCC approved net neutrality
rules while hungry tech giants continue
to consume each other in May US network
verizon snapped up AOL for 4.4 billion
dollars then in November the maker of
candy crush got gobbled up by Activision
Blizzard 46 billion um and indeed nom
2015 also saw the tech world take a
much-needed look at gender
discrimination both within the industry
and online sparked in part by Ellen Pao
who stepped down as CEO of Reddit in
July having lost a high-profile gender
discrimination lawsuit a few months
earlier in the gaming world Microsoft's
Xbox one and Sony's ps4 continued their
deadly deal while third place in
Nintendo had a rough a year fan favorite
company president Satoru Iwata sadly
died in July and the company dropped off
a prestigious list of cool brands in
October confirmation in March the
Nintendo would start making games for
smartphones gives us hope for a brighter
future and speaking of the future 2015
was marked by a particularly significant
date one that's been in the calendars of
geeks worldwide since the late 80s the
21st of October 2015 the date that Marty
McFly traveled forward to in sci-fi
classic back to the future part two
celebrities and brands alike lepton this
geek culture milestone while the
Internet's imploded with one point
twenty-one gigawatts of fan further
mingled with a general dismay that the
real 2015 is lacking in hoverboards well
unless you count those self-balancing
scooters that suddenly seem to be
everywhere this year and if bad to the
future day wasn't enough to satisfy your
brains nerd Center 2015 had plenty more
geeky thrills on offer the Aaron Sorkin
scripted Steve Jobs film finally got an
airing while geeks reveled in a
Hollywood release schedule that featured
ant-man the Avengers a Jurassic Park
sequel and the Martian oh and did we
forget to mention a new star wars film
Chewie
we're all space of venturing back in the
real world went pretty well to this year
we found flowing water on Mars Amazon
founder Jeff Bezos spaceflight company
Blue Origin made history with a rocket
that went to space than landed safely
back on earth and NASA made our July
with our closest ever look at Pluto as
the new horizons probe sped just shy of
8,000 miles above the dwarf planet's
surface how's that for a bit of
perspective eh but we want your
perspectives to what did you think of
2015's tech and what do you want to see
