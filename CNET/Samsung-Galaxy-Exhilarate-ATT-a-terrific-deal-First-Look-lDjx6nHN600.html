the Samsung Galaxy exhilarate for AT&amp;amp;T
now this phone may not look like the
flashiest thing you've ever seen but let
me tell you it is a fabulous deal it's
got 4g LTE speeds on here android 2.3
gingerbread it also has a 1.2 gigahertz
dual-core processor a pretty good five
megapixel camera on the back a 1.3
megapixel front-facing camera and 720p
HD video capture all of this costs you
2999 after a new two-year service
agreement now this used to cost 4999 and
i thought it was a good deal then AT&amp;amp;T
has just lowered the price in between
the time the phone was released and this
video so now it's about thirty dollars
for LTE and all of the other fixins so
it's definitely a mid-range device it's
not a very beautiful device stead enough
but it's got this very plain matte black
backing the screen is very nice though
it is a 4 inch Super AMOLED display
colors are nice and bright I've got it
on maximum brightness right here on top
of all of that AT&amp;amp;T is advertising this
as an eco-friendly phone so if this is
your phone then you'll be able to get
some extra credit points for also
helping out the environment and reducing
your waist a little bit that's about it
for this budget phone I'm Jessica doll
court for seen it this is the Samsung
Galaxy exhilarate and you can read the
