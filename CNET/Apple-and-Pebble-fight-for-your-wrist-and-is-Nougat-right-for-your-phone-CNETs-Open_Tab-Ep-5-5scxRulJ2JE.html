seen as a weekly recap show where we
throw a few back in good company and
talk about all the tech that will work
for you this holiday weekend pay
attention big holiday weekend a lot of
tech to pay attention to I'm Jeff
Bakalar joined by our wearables expert
mr. Scott Stein hello don't worries be
here joe scott signed does more than
just wearables i promise you that I'm
just a wearables expert that's all I'm
ever good and just drinks beer on
couches we have my library we got Mike
and Brian in the control room they're
steering the ship hopefully through
peaceful waters and we're going to be
taking your questions as we are so very
looking forward to all of your riveting
Facebook and YouTube commentary because
as we all know those are two platforms
where brilliant discourse takes place
all right we know that all right let's
get into the specting elevated thought
the bars pretty freakin hi kids let's
jump into her 40 Joey's here hey Jo was
I'm sorry that was a brown bear i'm
snuggled next and Joseph Kaminsky
huddled behind a laptop is here to
scotts right I don't quiet you forgot I
was here he's the nuts and bolts of this
show he's the damn glue on the go I'm
the nougaty feeling filling ah we'll get
to New get a little later this Russian
you get in this episode so it's a DVD
delicious all right let's talk about
wearables because like I said that's all
you do here because that's it and then
you can eliminate me that's it I'm done
well cut the brake hourglass is running
out so to tell me about like what is
popular with wearables in your life like
what are you doing that has you like
turning to wearables and saying oh this
is the thing I need yeah well they're
definitely not popular in my family like
if I stopped using them I would do be
welcomed sure you know buddy this is
gone yeah that's one more thing I'm
coddling you know in my life so you're
saying you like that exactly so
fantastic I did this definitely time to
wait
getting anything unless you want to
spend like a hundred dollars but like
what i use them for it I kept saying for
some use a pebble it's basically like a
pager on your wrist okay and I don't
think it's changed much since then the
best thing a wearable does is buzz you
and give you a reminder which sometimes
can be really helpful if you think you
might miss a call or there's something
you know you don't want to pick up your
phone right there's also obviously the
fitness tracking part which you know if
you stick to a routine the problem is
it's a carrot on a stick that it's got
to go with like a regular gym regimen
right Trisha and I'm glad you brought up
the fitness thing because I think we
this a lot of stuff I don't want to say
what I want to say but what I'm going to
say is like hey maybe all this fitness
crave stuff is not something anyone
should really like completely you know
rely on forgetting healthy yes because
well no doctor thinks of these as an
answer right so not medically approved
it looks at the charts like look Larry
the reason you're a hundred pounds
overweight yes you don't have a Fitbit
gotta get yourself a 50 right it comes
down to like when I've been able to lose
weight or that gain weight again and
I've used to tummies things first we got
to stick to ones if I'm switching from
one to the other that's not going to
work yeah uh and yeah it's just a
weighted so it's a motivator it's like
if that works if you've got some other
system that works but these all cap out
generally at the step tracking and they
do some things like like you know
running or some heart rate stuff but the
deeper you get the more more active you
try to get the more fitness trackers
tend to fail you sure so if you're just
trying to see you oh was i alive and
walking if it makes me sound oh so
dismissive but it's true that's great um
really like if you're going to go to the
gym three or four times a week you know
that and you know what you're doing
watch is going to do is the tracker is
just like extra motivation so use it for
that use it for those i use it for
things like checking the weather which
actually things like I mean dark sky is
actually a great app lets you know like
when the weather when it's gonna rain
within like five minutes you seem like
Doc Brown and oh cool yeah so that that
I love that app yeah I'm saying micro
weather reports and I want everyone
watching on YouTube Facebook wherever
you're coming from comment on what
you're seeing right here we're going to
answer as many questions as you can or
take your
comments or do what we need to do to
help you out to ensure that you have a
successful July 4th weekend and if
you're not in the country and you're
celebrating something else you can have
a good weekend also so make sure you
interact with us and we'll get to some
of those as they come in but Scott I
want to pivot to specifically the Apple
watch the pebble the the SmartWatch is
shirk is right now a time to own a
SmartWatch new okay moving along we're
done uh you know and basically if you
can spend as little as possible right
now the reason I say that is because
we're expecting all these things to get
updates in the fall like pretty much I
mean you think Apple watch should Andrew
where's gonna have a bevel coming out
and new pebbles coming out we already
know about that you expect all the other
watchmakers probably gonna follow suit
so you want to kick yourself for
spending several hundred dollars and
something it's going to get updated now
summer is a good time to wear one
because you're probably out and about
but just not great time to buy one
unless again pebble actually makes a
couple of very affordable ones that's
probably a pretty good way to go for
something we're not spending a lot of
money or signs on sale like a hundred
dollars where we feel comfortable think
it's buying a pair of shoes right and
you're okay with getting a new pair of
shoes later but just it's like I don't
want to tell you you know don't come to
me later tell me that oh there's a new
version out that's the problem I think
they all need improvement so there's no
perfect SmartWatch right now definitely
what are you gonna say Jeff I think I'm
one that he's mentioned that i'm looking
forward to is the Microsoft band three
uh I just learned that there is
something all the Microsoft band three
tell me about it they're the two is
current right now right that's what
you're wearing but I would like may not
be aware of the Microsoft BAM one into
it right why me in the smartpen
smartband sense I like a regular watch
on my left hand of court and I like
something that doesn't look like a watch
on my right hand okay now you're well
because I don't want to like I'm wearing
two watches but you do look like you do
know cuz it's good honestly if this
wasn't so glossy look like it would look
like some time trial you look at the lib
sure look like a LIVESTRONG Armstrong
now you're like one of my testing
gadgets Mercedes you're not pulling any
way I love this because it is GPS and I
ride a bicycle and a lot of them don't
have GP
except for like some of the the garmin
ones garmin wines and then increasingly
some of the food source was because i
started out with the nike fuelband loved
it was great for steps it was great
because in community it was great for
step because it was great for steps in
the community because it had a little
motivational flags and give you yay you
know fortnight right cetera right it was
horrible if I rode my bicycle because I
would ride my bicycle maybe 10 miles and
something to run 2 miles and it kicked
my button the so-called Nike Fuel
measurement system I like this because
it actually logs my distance because it
has gps ok I like it it all says UV i
can smile movie do you use the UV future
i will this weekend really baby yeah
this is something that appeals to mind
that it has UV sesame sensor oh where I
mean let's be honest it's got it under
your wrist I mean you can watch ghost
you know where the other way around the
back and hold on let me see if it's
sunny you are why are men so the
Microsoft band I think you're kind of
meant to wear it flipped around with the
band with the screen oh you're wearing
wrong you know no because I'd rather
scratch this because i'm typing all the
time you know anything you can read very
wise you're like that plus ending your
arm another reason or another another
benefit to having it underneath those
you can have your text alerts and tack
when scott ready to speak them on the
top and everybody like my son is always
like I got shot you can like put your
note you can use your nose to but I
would like to see in terms of ventures
it's great i would like to see a better
battery life yeah and maybe a little
more refined design but i'm content with
all the features it has all right you're
welcome back as long as you're never had
about the venue kron four's my god
because no because it's it because they
just take one tiny but they also added
sure they also added sports community as
a sleep tracker so now like like nikki
lee is my only other friend with it
bigasoft to van so i can see how well
Nick did and then with a day job and now
in the in the community you guys you
guys hold another meeting well no
because I just another another note you
could get competitive yeah good price
how are never so mix not doing more
steps in Australia than I can do a new
year olds gravity thing yeah social is
if you're gonna give those finnish band
stuff the one of the main points is he
do it to compete with people they had a
game of fire yeah game a fight and like
I mean finally Apple watch is getting on
board with that but Fitbit that's the
main appeal Fitbit I think is that you
say
oh you have a friend that does it so it
was like I mean if you have like ten
friends at all are like using jaw bones
right you're like the job exactly said
to get the club then join that club yeah
cuz you you know you got your jawbone
club but hopefully it's a platform that
a lot of other people are using that's
feel stupid when you say that job on
come on join that jaw bone club what's
like people used to spend all sorts of
money and other like diet plans and
things everybody by a gadget just to do
those things back in that what 70s or
whatever that period of time was I'd
have you no more advanced pedometers but
that what I'm just saying is all right
well listen what's happened let's hear
what theater that has to say about this
fine stuff I believe we have a couple
questions from the internet yes guys so
Elliot on youtube I just had a comment
he says that he likes the Moto 360 for
its faces Dominic on facebook loves his
pebble for its long battery charge RJ
said he's tried several of the smart
watches out there but he likes just an
old-fashioned watch for the basics and
Jorge had a question he wants to know if
if gps if you think you GPS could come
to a future version of an apple watch or
if there's any speculation you guys have
heard about an Apple watch to in the
future Scott what do you think about the
GPS on an Apple watch biggest problem
with GPS is the iphone yeah yeah just
wrap that around your wrist these
problem of GPS is the battery life hey
cuz you're going to get like what six
hours maximum of GPS used before the
most of these devices died and so the
battery life is already pretty low on
the Apple watch ur like a day and a half
and you know do you want to cut that
down further that's the only problem and
then you also make a little bit bigger
probably because a lot of these things
have to find a way to get that mechanism
that i can write like man they just need
to make the apple watch automatic huh
that's what i think is just focused on
making it more automatic and more and
more seamless so when I say automatic I
mean like powered by the motion of your
wrist oh I see you're saying yeah
exactly like I get it that's an insane
amount of of energy you're producing but
like yeah watch isn't kind of need to
have that that's why I like the
automatic watches of the world are
amazing right and just kind of like
laugh in the face of a vote Lee smart
one it's charging is the most annoying
thing and it's amazing to me how many
people seem okay with charging their to
buy
the problem is this if we had some sort
of universal charging there is there's
Chi I mean like a universal charging mat
or stand right but what happens is that
all of these wearables don't use it or
they use in some way you have to use a
special little oats or two attachment
you can't just you can't just chuck them
on the table you're crossing the 90 we
promise the mat yeah where you just like
them in your charging table if you just
take off all your stuff and your shoes
your your hat you're smart glasses
you're smart pants where you put those
on the charge table suree that's great
but I'm not gonna hunt around for these
dongles and carry them and it gets
frustrating pebble I do like is the
battery life yeah like that's a thing
look full out we all disclosure full
transparency i pre-ordered a pebble time
to ya on Kickstarter I backed it I
always wanted a pebble but I convinced
myself to wait and I feel like I'm
finally going to be rewarded for my
patients this pebble time to I think
looks like you know I like the size of
that screen they really doubled up on
that it did ah yeah and I think that
they they've been making a lot of these
Watchers of making gains if you do care
about fitness tracking right the basic
fitness tracking has all been getting
better on those watches okay android
where's been getting better over time
pebble has been doing automatic step and
sleep tracking so it kind of almost does
the same thing that you get out of a
Fitbit minus again the community uh-huh
but some basic features are already in
there so you might find yourself pretty
happy with a lot of what it offers just
don't expect again like the idea of apps
on a watch if you even want that that
stuff's not there some of the things
like you know payments were trying to
show up but again like how often do I
use this for payments I've always got my
wallet and it's not showing up on every
terminal so yeah what do you think the
next big step smartwatches have to
achieve for them to hit this sort of
like critical mass pike had dinner in
San Francisco when I was at their last
time it was like sitting next to this
couple and it's like the classic average
you know personal they were they were in
text was different right but I thought
that their comment was going to be
something about like battery life and
basically they just said yeah you tap
all by one of those when does it cost
seven hundred dollars as price and you
price and like I can use it away from my
phone yeah what you have to sever that
connection yeah so I actually think
those two things that actually hits on
saying its price and you know people the
more people realize how much you need
your phone around these things do a
little bit without your phone but not
enough and that really breaks the like
magic super watch thought sure what what
am I using this for yeah I think you
could do it more with that now 3g
connection some of these watches already
have cellular samsung gear s2 3g again
your times and other radio it's another
powers so cuts on all these things cut
down when I wear them times the last
 hours battery um LG has one that
is 3g android wear but you know you have
to pay for the extra data your it
they're bigger they don't really make
much sense a lot a lot of the apps don't
really feel hooked into it right so it's
kind of interesting idea but it's not
really an interesting idea but at some
point you do want it to work just just
like work and i know that sounds
dominoes but no that's it is that you
don't want to spend a lot of time under
watch everybody's on to that we're just
not there yet no we're just not there
and watch faces i think finally somebody
said that's a great point but watch the
362 you just make all these things
should be your cool white laces and any
do it on the computer like letting give
me the great set of tools pebble motor
whatever is even Apple do it out yeah
let me build it let me build it and do
what I want and add as many if I want
that scream application filled yeah with
like 20 all the state capital it's I
don't know I where I just like a look at
with a microscope like a jeweler's loupe
so what I want that X I agree all right
we're all right well there's a question
from YouTube or smart watch batteries
getting bigger like physically or they
weren't specific I guess they have to
get bigger if they're going to get take
up more real estate you mean they may
have to or I think you're going to have
a hard time making even more efficient
process you're up against a bit of a
wall right ah they might have to get a
little bit bigger yeah come up with us I
mean I actually think a way to go would
be maybe so sort of battery wristband
yeah maybe more I that makes sense I
like I don't want to see that Apple's
put batteries in everything put it in
the wristband well pebble did that whole
smart band thing which I've never really
turned into anything and so why don't
you have like smart strap accessories
right
ah alright good thoughts we're going to
talk to Mike in the control room for
just a sec before we move on thank you
very much everybody for joining us what
you want to do a couple of quick call
outs thank you to Stephen Jeff dave at
rj Dave Kendrick Paul Brad and Edwin for
being in our facebook chat and over on
youtube thanks to a saucy senere
Clifford for talking with us today Jeff
joe scott back to you guys we keep going
sausage hot sauces on who's saucing
what's up so I see how you doing welcome
to the show okay now Scott and I got to
do something really awesome this week we
won't go who are you going to call who
are you going to call is what Janine
says in the first Ghostbusters film yeah
we got to do this amazing be our ghost
busters experience other things God does
what VR yeah it was a joke Joe like we
know he does need a mic I totally forgot
yeah okay um every one of the wrong then
you can retire interrupting me geez
anyway uh madam two shows you know
Madame Tussauds is if you don't know it
is it's this wax museum place there's a
couple of them around the world there's
one in Times Square and ghostbusters the
new film out later this month teamed up
with this VR company called the void and
the void puts together this these very
elaborate interactive over-the-top VR
experiences and you and I got to sample
it out a few days before it goes public
i believe it starts today not today guys
um so this was amazing because to me
this was the best VR I'd ever done and I
was telling you that and you kind of
like I was like real yeah because I'm
never optimistic about anything now it's
true uh and and and Sarah a photographer
trying it out and she's like really
cynical about things like VR and she
said that was pretty cool she's like
it's cool which is like the highest
praise you could give um I liked it a
lot and I'm like I'm really i found
myself getting a little bit like six
super no super critical okay here
because i just use a line you have a
refined vr palette yeah and I because
the the bloom is worn off as far as like
the novelty of it but it is really cool
as far as how you feel like you're in
another
space walk around it's it's a bit i mean
anywhere regardless of that the vr they
had of me interviewing ivan reitman it
was amazing and it felt like i was
actually sitting next to him he was so
real so realistic he even said hey Jeff
good to meet you I couldn't believe it
anyway rendering so check it out this is
what we did they put you in this amazing
apparatus dude the vest we had was force
feedback and it was it was locationally
aware so while you're walking through
this open space this set that they build
for the VR experience you felt feedback
like if a ghost threw a book at your
left shoulder guess what your left
shoulder vibrated it's a crazy VR laser
tag yeah it was a wandering with this
gear can't say enough amazing stuff
about this thing I think when you like
really break it down it was super
impressive so again like imagine they
build an entire sort of fun house for
you to walk through yeah the the floor
shakes they and they emulated of
elevator the floor shakes you could feel
the walls in the VR and in real life
like me would you we don't even know
what it looked like right messing we had
no idea like horrible it probably just
looked like a bunch of set pieces
because no one's actually going to see
that because they basically overlay the
VR over the physical world that they've
created inside so like there's a part
where you think you're on a scaffolding
there's a railing you put your arm out
to grab the rail and you grab a rail
like you actually feel it of course they
shake the crap out of it you think like
you're gonna fall off a 40-story
building but then it lines up really
what they lined up real well you open
doors and you're even able to do that
and you feel that one-to-one connection
you go in with three people total so you
see the other people in that experience
which is something I've never done in VR
before now you talk to each other and
you you know you served a little bit of
communication about your plan i I just I
thought it was so damn cool so I go back
I would do it again I mean it's only
like seven minutes you're not yeah it's
probably along along the Madisonian and
the extra price like it's not cheap but
it's like again as a one-time experience
versus buying this VR gear right in
putting in your home it's part of like
the right level for people and
is doing stuff you can't do at home
which is wander through this huge maze
of rooms and and with a backpack
computer yeah totally wired Wireless
like let's not forget about that what's
the age rain like what's the age range
of the requirement age 48 inches oh yeah
I asked them about this oh yeah that's
smart so 48 inches uh no age range but
it's because of the weight of the
backpack right so it's and and probably
for safety too just to make sure you're
not going to fall over or anything but I
think it's actually they do you kind of
let you feel free to just do whatever
you want technically you could like fall
over yeah I guess like if you wanted to
you could climb over that scaffolding I
bet that they just fall into like where
someone is probably they're like dude
get back right get back into the thing I
don't GERD if you removed your helmet
I'm so mad I didn't do that I you today
I figured it would have been like eyes
wide shut they're just like a circle of
people watching you yeah maybe all
silent watch like they're probably
already there probably a lot of
assistance ready to help because of
safety concerns if you know I would
imagine it's just very bright because
all of those like little ping-pong balls
have to be a point resume breakfast oh
yeah we're gonna we're Marcus in the
chatty 10 is it immersive VR and not
augmented no it's completely immersive
you are putting on a headset looking
through lenses right now you can't see
any of the real world but what they do
is they built a set in reality that has
the same spatial dimensions of what
you're seeing in VR so like there was
one part where like there was a graded
sort of gate I put my hand on it and it
felt like a gate felt like a fence they
really did a great job there's one scene
where Slimer passes through you like the
ghost and they they like missed you
right Nick you got like a little lamb
yeah oh well sometimes look a bit of
1440 faders like those 4d cinema
experiences and exactly they call it
hyper reality or mystery at all
marketing marketing it is VR and if if
you know about the HTC vive basically
yet it's kind of like what HTC vive does
with boundaries of a room yeah well you
say it's much more advanced in the sense
that they map I mean they're building
this to a specific set right so they
build out all the physical details that
they want so you can feel like you're
touching more plus they've like you said
all the other sensory stuff
but then it is full it's full VR bright
its full VR and that's the thing and
that's right looking outside right and
that's what I think like VR kind of
works great right now like yes you this
like build these things at theme parks
wherever they are build it make it this
this because you know the VR the
experience relies just as much on the
physical space as it does the VR like if
there wasn't a vibrating floor if there
wasn't wind to make you think you're on
top of the building it would fall flat
there and this adds something that you
just aren't going to get it home right
like them they realize the more senses
you can throw at you to create that
illusion it's not about the graphics
even the graphics I feel like in a way
or step down yeah they weren't the best
right they weren't like if you've tried
HTC vive you might have actually seen
sign with a little bit better graphics
but it's really they're still good but
it's not like yeah you feel like you're
more in a game but it's everything else
are to create that sense of reality
where you go oh wow I'm going to take it
off and I can't have like all the sins
to touch smell feel yeah i feel like the
smell was probably unintentional but
that worked it was a marshmallow smell
band it wasn't really i wrote wasn't
joking when I said it smell like toasted
marshmallow you did that on purpose yes
you out I didn't ask them but I so maybe
you should ohh but you want to smell and
yeah I might have just is you're hungry
so you're very spin on things yeah all
right a few when i was fighting the Stay
Puft Marshmallow Man had to give it away
but um you know that don't weird we're
and like wasn't it great how like you
shot him in the head and his hand got
burnt like it wasn't like all canned
stuff we're like no he's just loading
cuz its supposed to like in the first
senior in this little room in an
apartment and you just tear the whole
place to crap like you just use your
protest in forever and like all the
stuffs on the floor and I'm like oh that
was supposed to just do that and then i
shot the stuff on the floor and it
popped again I was like okay this is a
game this is like the Phoenix of the
video game yeah it's a real like a
little mini game yeah and oh man the
elevator just scared me that was it
wasn't too scared without one moment the
elevator this like girl passed girl
ghost she comes in what'd she say I'm
cool they're shaving like this like I
was just I literally went to cover my
eyes even though there were no it's like
you know I just like I close my eyes
like it's gonna be bad there's no
thing that happens with girl ghost
getting on elevator it's never good
never is going to scare you it reminded
me of tower of terror for sure had a
little bit of a tariff gonna buy when I
went off on that balcony might sound
like yeah I felt scared and I turned
around and saw that my other
Ghostbusters buddies stayed behind they
were all like back and I am I going in
the room of the hotel watching me to see
what would happen is if I would like die
it's diately they did a great job so you
know you got to get props to the void
they did a really good job I may have
sounded like a little bit critical when
I rotich because i felt like i was
expecting i heard so much about the void
and I thought is is redefining what I
think about VR not entirely but it is
really well done yeah for sure all right
let's move things along it's got a
little bit of your question they want to
know from Scott which of you already
think is better I believe this is the
vibrance the ocular oh it's a good
question okay so this right now I think
the vibe is the best hardware going
right now for a number of reasons i
think that the visual quality and the
headset looks a little bit better the
the controller's the room element and
there are more games right now that you
can get on steam i think oculus touch is
going to catch up to that quite a bit I
like oculus is a compact feeling though
in the design of just the package i
think is a little more consumer friendly
I still feel like though for the average
person you're probably better off just
getting something super cheap like a
gear VR totally and waiting you know
PlayStation VR is pretty cool I want to
see more about that I feel like that's a
good price for the system it's
definitely the most accessible yes
especially if you have a ps4 that's kind
of the one I'd want to like your dive
hardware so you have to worry about
buying a new system yeah that's right
exactly is I'm not like a pc gamer and
so like it mean investing yet to invest
in the pc and um you know the stuff is
going to get better in like a year
totally and and the games are gonna keep
any better so this won't suck as much
wearing that's the thing is that yes
only like how many times you're gonna
buy a new heads yeah we're not there yet
but we're on the road prepare glasses
and earphones that's it right I like the
best vibe so I'm talking to 22 people
who use iphones right you guys have
iphones
you've had android you've you've dipped
in the android pond you go already yeah
I get it to you and Ryan going in their
phones oh I'm sorry I phone so yeah
Android Google came out and said hey
Android n you know at the end stands for
its not New get it's what it's not
Nutella it should have been although I
guess the Nutella people were like pay
us but anyway I guess no one knows the
copyright the nougat babies get all
snooty sneakers probably has like a nice
chunk and you get but anyway that's the
new OS is called source new get you get
in is creative commons right off the bat
i want to talk to google right now i got
a bone to pick with you google and I get
it I get it you let me load nougat on to
my Nexus 6p and I thank you for the
opportunity to test drive your beta
software but we've got some problems
number one so overall it is a good
experience you know if nougat I mean
it's delicious nothing wrong with new
year no one's ever been like oh this
cake has nougat in it can we just
specify to that nougat can be purchased
two blocks away this is not a plug so I
so we did a great like world food mark
you're in the pocket of big new gig
exactly big new gets asking says but I
thought about buying a bunch of nougat
to bring on cuz there's make some
delicious types of nougat around the
world with nuts and fruit and what have
you i'm gonna eat my hand right now gar
encourages 30 40 was the last dessert we
had in here for 90 s okay cat we do do
we have good cuts in here oh you mean
actual what do you say as ryan bennett
brought froyo for everyone when he was
with HTC for the launch okay for people
know what you're talking a long time ago
well that's when i was android but i
would say i would say if this raises a
little bit more awareness about the
deliciousness of certain types of nougat
yeah to the new game veil has been
lifted yeah so wait back to my yelling
at Google so like I said it really is it
they sped up marshmallow god you can't
sound cool at all talking about android
OS um really something basket I sound
like a maniac uh so anyway marshmallow I
really enjoyed okay ah newgate so far so
good I have a big problem with the fact
that this it does it like
I have Wi-Fi on and I leave a Wi-Fi area
the 4g radio the LTE radio like doesn't
turn on and i have to like cycle
airplane mode for it to pick up LTE
again which is just like away come on
bizarre baby maybe it's like why is this
still a thing don't why is that so thing
it could just be me I haven't googled it
or anything I just noticed it could also
be another half you have installed any
of you can flick out know if that is not
the answer it is nuclear actually have
no other half on your phone Nozuka south
aware where you can ask you at that
directly and it could start to you mean
coalescing answer let's do it let's try
it out you get ok Google what why are
you doing this thing with good right now
it's just searching what I just said a
theory is it called nougat because maybe
all the chunks of nuts and fruit or like
the little things they're integrating
into this into the I'm overthinking
anyway didn't have to pay for the rights
that enjoys the rest of his acid trip
yeah delicious you have anything else to
say about android nougat you guys you
you got to play with us I know like uh
so if you're worried about features the
doze mode you know dozes this is just
like remarkable sleep battery
conservation technology they put in or
software rather they put in a
marshmallow it worked amazing you would
leave the phone sitting still overnight
in 10 hours you would get like maybe
three to four percent battery drainage
which is like unheard of apparently now
it's new and improved I haven't noticed
much more of a saving but I mean if you
go over night and only lose about five
percent battery like that's kind of
remaining the other stay in the house
it's good they let allow you to reply in
notifications which is just basic sup it
really isn't a cosmetic design redesign
it's just more of like a zip your
performance under the hood sort of
stealth at work on like what virgin hard
wars will go back to my conf arm back I
don't know I don't know that answer ISM
is assistant working on that now like
have you tried any chat bot assistant
stuff in messages well I just use the
regular Google person whoever she is
she's she's lovely she's around she's
around she will she responds to ok
Google there's a dad like instant
instant apps ever show up in any
meaningful way that was like I kept
talking about but I think that's a
that's a developer thing about but they
have to get on that if they want that to
be a thick answer questions like how do
you that's the biggest question means
like when you have these like hi how
best to appreciate we're gonna have this
question with iOS 10 yeah how best to
appreciate like all the new features
yeah I don't know what we'll have to see
how it shakes out Carlos seems to be
fond of the name nougat and he's happy
with the brand name right Carlos from
the chat oh that's got okay actually
it's it's less um it is kind of less
cutesy it's just more weird and gross
nougat nougat okay we're just back to
her tormentor Magister my name we didn't
do some Nutella would have worked better
for me there's really no other candies
or desserts to be an SS nasty but they
they're big they're bigger fish
