Las Vegas at Microsoft's mix conference
i'm here with Joe Belfiore who works
with Windows Mobile heavily and scott
guthrie who works in microsoft's
developer division also very involved
with silverlight obviously you guys
talked about a range of things today but
one of the things that people are most
interested on is the windows phone 7
series operating system and kind of
everything about it when or the device
is going to be available and what can I
expect on it from that perspective you
know most of the attention today was on
developers and the fact as we've said
before that they're going to use
silverline XNA one of the cool demos was
Netflix playing on the phone and I'm
curious that seemed to be a good example
of what can Windows Phone do that other
devices in the market can't do and I'm
curious if there are other things that
you would say what we've unveiled will
allow you to do X that you haven't been
able to do before on the phone sure I
know I'll cover some user doors ah so
sort of from a user experience
perspective one of the main ideas that
we have in Windows Phone 7 series is to
try to do a smart design that
anticipates what people want and brings
together tasks that are similar in to
integrate experiences we call hub so for
example the netflix app you gave as an
example integrates right into our music
and video hub and that's something that
we don't see other smartphones doing
today you have one place to go you go to
music and video and whether you're a
zune user who sings some music and video
a netflix user that's gotta watch
instantly queue available a Pandora user
a last.fm use or all these applications
can integrate right into music and video
so you have one stop shopping for
whatever service it is you like best
another example along those lines that
we showed was the colorizer application
which lets you modify the pictures that
you've taken with a camera on the phone
third-party applications can integrate
right in and become an extension of the
photos hub that's built into windows
phone seven spheres so one of the things
that we've seen a lot of is this idea
that we really want applications not to
sort of exists generically in one big
applications bucket but kind of what are
they doing and where does it make sense
on the phone
one of the things that users seem to
want is their cake and eating it too in
terms of being able to have simple
experiences you know what do I want to
do right now and being able to do a lot
of the things can you talk about we're
multitasking the ability to do more than
one thing at once what's Microsoft
approach been to that yeah sure we're
we're trying to make the system really
smart about doing multitasking for the
things that you want to have multi task
but also not do it when it shouldn't to
keep your battery life as long as
possible so for example at the heart of
the windows phone seven series devices
is a modern version of the c/e operating
system kernel that does full
multitasking we take advantage of that
to do things like loading your browser
web pages in the background if you start
the browse or start a web page loading
and flip back you can wait a little
while and go back and your page will be
right there we play music in the
background we download your email in the
background all these sorts of things and
we're working with our third-party
developer partners to enable ways for
third-party applications to also get
things done although we also plan to
suspend third-party applications if
you're not using them to conserve your
battery so one of the things that seems
like Microsoft is doing is saying just
because we can do something doesn't mean
we're going to do it all the time which
sounds like a bit of a break I mean
typically at Microsoft things you know
tended to get can we do it well if we
can we're going to do it and I think
that kind of built the reputation that
you know I don't think people ever said
X is underpowered they just said it
doesn't do anything I want well you know
when we're talking about earlier
versions of Windows Mobile it seems like
that's an experience that you guys are
trying to get rid of I think one of
things that people got really today it's
just sort of just how new windows phone
7 is from a user experience perspective
and and how much attention of detail
around the user experience and both of
the built-in shell and the built-in apps
but also what developers are gonna be
able to do in terms of building
experiences
apps on top of that and you know there's
just such a great attention to detail
the use of motion fluidity you I you
know all hardware accelerated you know I
think that's that's probably the biggest
thing that people are going to notice
when they use the experiences and you
know I think we're making a good set of
decisions around you know how do we
balance making sure that that consumer
experience is just it's just rock solid
and you know really really appealing
were actually another example I dad
we've constrained the hardware spec so
that there's a predictable bunch of
hardware capabilities will be part of
every phone so you know it's going to
have location you know going to have a
positive touchscreen how do you passive
touch there's predictable screen sizes
there's a GPS and Scott's team has done
an amazing job in with this constraint
to go make sure the development platform
is deep rich and really easy for people
to use and that's why I think we saw so
many of the apps that his team worked
with third parties today to take full
advantage of all these capabilities in
the phone because it was predictable and
well-known up front so I think probably
the last question that's on a lot of
people's mind is one am I going to be
able to get my hands on obviously today
you guys release both developer tools
and an emulator the phones themselves
will be on the market by the holiday
season is there something before then
that where developers will be able to
get their hands on actual devices well
what developers have today is everything
they need to build apps for the phone I
mean they literally are getting a
windows phone 7 series device that runs
in and the emulations on their PC so you
know tons of tons of people can download
that today it's free over time you know
we'll look for opportunities to connect
more with those developers and find
other ways to make them productive but
today what we're excited about is is the
work that Scott's team has done to
empower and light up all the developers
out there creative on all the apps that
we show today we showed Netflix
foursquare Shazam a major league soccer
p newsreader a whole bunch more up
seesmic bunch more applications is thing
I'm most excited about was you know our
partners were able to take early
versions of the tools we ship today and
start about three weeks ago in these
apps and you know the feedback from
everyone here is just being like oh
they're so stunning and I want to lick
them they're so good and you know that
everyone on the web today can download
the tools that we use to build those
apps and the emulators
hardware-accelerated supports
multi-touch so the cool thing is
everyone can build every one of those
apps that we showed on stage today and
we're pretty excited to see what comes
out of it thanks guys thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
