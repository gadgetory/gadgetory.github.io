in 4k TVs I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your cnet update the show floor is
officially open at the International
Consumer Electronic Show and if it's
anything like last year there will be
more than 160,000 people for more than
140 countries swarming the floor all
here to learn about new gadgets coming
out this year and beyond before the show
floor opened there were a ton of major
news announcements televisions were big
part of the spotlight on press day as LG
sharp panasonic samsung and sony debuted
new models in 4k Ultra HD resolution
that's four times as many pixels as
1080p there are some 4k TVs that curve
some that are crazy thin and some now
with better colors thanks to quantum
technology that uses nanocrystals LG
steps things up by using OLED instead of
an LCD panel on these color boosted for
kay's OLED is amazing but expensive for
reference the current curved 65 inch
model costs 10 grand in the US but other
LCD for case we'll have more practical
prices this could be the year you
consider buying a 4k sharp showed off a
TV that says it's beyond 4k TV
describing it as an image that begins to
approach AK resolution but before we get
carried away with AK the real question
is where you can get 4k video to watch
on these TVs well several TV
manufacturers announced partnerships
with video providers like Netflix Disney
and Fox to set standards for ultra HD
content Sony talked heavily about making
more shows and movies available in 4k
and speaking of content the satellite
provider dish announced a new type of
internet TV package called sling TV for
twenty dollars a month you can watch
live TV from a handful of channels
including CNN ESPN T&amp;amp;T and Disney you
can watch it on a roku Amazon fire TV or
your computer or tablet but there is
much more beyond TVs LG brings a curved
screen to its new G flex 2 smartphone
and since it does have some flexibility
it could be the ideal smartphone for
people who sit on their smartphones
there are even some phones from
companies you'd never imagine making
phones energizer is making
big batteries that can last twice as
long as an iphone 6 kodak has a phone it
wants to sell to baby boomers it's a
very simple android phone called the
codec i am 5 with a focus on photos
lamborghini even has its own phone it'll
cost you six thousand dollars for that
price you get special shatter and
scratch proof glass the same that's used
in Lamborghinis own cars there's much
more to talk about this week including
smart home appliances car tech and all
sorts of quirky accessories you can find
more at CES cnet com from the Las Vegas
