cnet.com today we got iOS for now that
is the newest operating system for the
iPhone and most iPod touch devices this
operating system will not work on the
original iPhone and the first iPod touch
and only certain features will work on
the iPhone 3G the biggest thing we see
from iOS 4 is multitasking to start with
the multitasking go down to the home
menu you double tap it and you'll see
that this menu pops up down at the
bottom everything that you're using
currently is displayed here if when you
want to select an app let's go over here
to doodle jumped you click that and
you'll go right into the game if you
want to get out click the home button
again and once you're back in if you
want to close something you'll hold that
down and you'll see that the button stop
the icon start jiggling and you just
press that so that's the way to close
something once it's open so you do need
to go in and end things if you really
want to be persistent about doing that
so it's just an important thing to note
also you need to note that because that
home pressing that home button twice now
takes you to that multi-tasking menu you
no longer have the option in the
settings menu where the DoubleTap takes
you probably the second biggest edition
with iOS 4s home screen folder finally
we do have it works pretty well all you
need to do is press and hold down on the
home screen so again your apps are gonna
jiggle
we'll take let's say the Amazon app
we'll slide it over and we'll drop it on
top of the eBay app when you do that
both absolutely highlighted and then
you'll see you have a new folder the
folder does get a default name that's
determined by sort of what era what
category the apps are in because I put
in eBay and Amazon I got lifestyle
you're free to change that default name
once you created a folder and you want
to remove an app from it open that
folder again take the icon and drag it
back to the homescreen so pretty much
works quite well
under the email app we all we now have a
unified inbox when you open that you'll
see all the messages summary multiple
accounts organized by the data they've
received so the newest will be on top
you can go through and you get organized
and that threads you can delete them you
can move them to folders
you just can't access folders the
individual folders inside the other
accounts from that Universal inbox but
it is really nice to see that another
new options and you can delete emails
directly from search results
also you get threaded emails you'll see
a little number next to the Ignite to
the message and then you can delete and
manage them there as well so pretty nice
iOS 4 does bring you home screen
wallpapers so this will be ability to
change that black background behind the
behind all the icons you just go to the
settings menu you click on the wallpaper
option you click on it and then it will
say set lockscreen set home screen or
set both once you remove that black
background so that's standard black
background that you've seen once you
remove that there's really no way to get
it back you can take a picture of I
don't know the night sky a black wall or
a dark room but it's really not gonna be
the same thing finally note that Iowa's
4 does give you some new wallpapers and
it does take some away that you've
always had so you'll just need to
remember that other option iOS 4 include
the ability to search text messages
you've always been able to do this in
emails but now you go directly into the
search text message folder and search
from there and the photo gallery if
you're using iPhoto or aperture II you
can actually get face recognition for
photos you can also now geotag photos
kind of interesting also get a camera
zoom for the still camera it's a 5x and
the 3GS we did see tap to focus for the
still camera we never really thought it
made that much difference but now the
video camera has it you do have a
spellcheck while you're typing so when
you're typing you spell on something
incorrectly you do get a little red line
down below there are few options that we
haven't tested quite yet but our coming
gets a lot of new enterprise features
you get their support for iBooks
you also get Game Center Game Center is
not available yet who available later in
the year we'll have to investigate that
when we get there but right now all we
know is that's coming later in the year
so on the whole I'd say iOS 4 is just as
exciting as the iPhone 4 which of course
comes out later this week brings these
really important features multitasking
is the biggest one we also have the
Universal inbox and the homescreen
folders these are things that we've
really been asking Apple for for a long
time so it's great to kind of check them
out for a list I'm Ken Sherman and this
is the first look at i/o s4
