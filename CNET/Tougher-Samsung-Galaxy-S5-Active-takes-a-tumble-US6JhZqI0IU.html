Samsung has expanded its Galaxy S line
with an active phone the galaxy s5
active to be exact with only a slightly
different design and specs that mirror
the original s5 the active here raises
two questions what does it offer that's
different and is it really suited to the
rough-and-tumble lifestyle
I'm Jessica Belcourt for CNN and here we
go with the unit from 18t for the record
samsung never claims that the s5 active
is a rugged device and that's a good
thing because it would hardly pass
muster true a thicker plastic coating on
the top bottom and corners will keep it
from getting busted up like my s5 did
after a tumble and it's got these
perfectly raised buttons on the front
and on the sides that make it a lot
easier to navigate with wet fingers or
gloves but without any grippy edges like
we did have in the s4 active it is a
little slippery and since it's also a
little bit wider than the s5 it also
makes it a little bit harder to hold at
least for me and those screw looking
nubs on the back yet those are just pure
decoration the s5 active does have seals
and gaskets to protect the interior from
water and dust but then again so does
the s5 which like this one is also rated
ip67 ok so here's what is different the
s5 active has this really neat
convenience key above the volume rocker
you press it once and you'll pull up a
new samsung app called activity zone
this shows you a barometer or compass a
flashlight and a stopwatch the
flashlight has several modes in fact and
even translates your text into Morse
codes a menu in the applet to add other
shortcuts to which does give you quicker
access to opening say a separate app for
running and if you long press the key
you can launch the camera as well this
is the first time in a long time that
we've seen Samsung do this and you can
adjust the settings so that pressing
this button triggers the shutter
remember that you can also take photos
by pressing a volume button and that you
can use either of these techniques to
take pictures underwater this unit I've
got here is a rather militant camo green
but you can also get the s5 active in
red or gray now I said that internally
the active here is just as capable as
the s5 with the same 5.1 inch 1080p HD
display the same excellent 16 megapixel
camera
and the same 2.5 gigahertz quad-core
Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 processor so it
is really fast it also runs Android 4.4
KitKat and has Samsung's TouchWiz
interface on top that means that you get
everything from Google now and my
magazine to ultra power saving mode the
toolbox private mode and multi window
plus a lot more besides
and yes the s5 active does have a heart
rate monitor on the back what it doesn't
have though is the fingerprint scanner
and you'll notice that the charging port
is the standard affair rather than the
quicker charging that the galaxy s5 has
with its double barrel combination so
how does the Galaxy s5 active stack up
well it's certainly in the top of its
class when it comes to features and
specs but there are sure to your phones
out there still if you think of it as a
more robust tactile and outdoorsy
version of the s5 then it won't let you
down I'm Jessica Delacorte for CNN be
sure to catch my full s5 active review
