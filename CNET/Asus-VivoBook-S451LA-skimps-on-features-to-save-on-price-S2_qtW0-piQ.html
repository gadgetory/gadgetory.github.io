checking out the asus vivobook s 451 la
which is kind of a mouthful so this
seven hundred dollar 14-inch laptop is
about an inch thick so it's pretty thin
but it weighs five pounds so it's not
exactly an ultra portable machine but
you know what it looks it looks pretty
uh it's got a brushed metal lid and a
metal body and a plastic base so at a
blush at first blush it looks like a
really you know like a premium machine
but then you open it up now it's a seven
hundred dollar machine so we aren't too
surprised by the 1366 x 768 resolution
still that's kind of disappointing that
said it is a touchscreen and it's a nice
responsive touch screens do which is you
know that that's pretty good especially
on windows 8 if you like touching
Windows 8 you know you won't be too
disappointed by this touch screen let's
talk about the keyboard and trackpad
though um now because it's again because
it's a 14 inch machine you've got a lot
of space the keyboard and the trackpad
they're both nice and wide and spacious
that's good unfortunately the trackpad
isn't super accurate there are a lot of
gestures baked in to sort of you know
get you a little more familiar with
windows 8 things like swiping in from
the left to switch between apps and
things like that but it isn't too
accurate you know as I as I try to track
around it doesn't always catch my
gestures and that can be kind of
annoying the keyboard isn't backlight
again for a seven hundred dollar machine
we don't necessarily expect a backlit
keyboard but that's still pretty
disappointing now inside we've got a
fourth-generation core i5 processor six
gigs of ram and a 500 gig hard drive
let's decent but it's a 500 gig spinning
platter hard drive now if it were an SSD
that'd be phenomenal I would have
settled for a hybrid drive at this point
but but that slower drive is going to
affect your performance a bit the rest
of the specs though you know again
they're not bad at seven hundred dollars
it's not a bad price and it's not a
terrible machine but you can do better
if you spend a little bit more you could
get machines that are either slightly
bigger offer a better resolution or
maybe even a discrete graphics card
this machine offers intel integrated
graphics which has gotten better
admittedly but it's not gonna be good if
you want to get very much gaming done or
anything like that or even photo editing
now I personally believe that windows 8
on a notebook is greatly helped by a
touchscreen but if you don't agree then
700 bucks is actually kind of a steep
price for what you're getting here I'm
