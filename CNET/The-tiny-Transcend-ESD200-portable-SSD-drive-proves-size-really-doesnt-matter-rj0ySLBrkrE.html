talk about sex now I like but now that I
have your attention let's steer that to
something else that's less interesting
but win for sure last you must longer
than five minutes the all-new EST 200
per boson state right from trans am here
now this drive is a portable external
drive external because it connect to a
computer using a cable right here this
is a standard you speed cable this cable
come with 2 n a and V both are male now
first you use this B male and here of
the cable and insert it into this micro
female you speed to hang a slot right
here on the drive just like that ok and
the other end which is the a male and
you insert that into guess what the
female a port on a computer and then the
to become one the dry becomes the
storage of the computer now I know on a
side computer or on the back there's a
lot of holes and slot and ports but
don't worry USB is a standard and that's
mean you cannot insert this into a wrong
slot no matter how hard you try they
just we not feed it's foolproof really
as long as you know how to ally it in
the right direction the Dryad support
USB 3.0 very fast but it's also work
with USB 2.0 the two standards share the
same port side the drive is also a bus
power meaning this cable here can
transfer data and also draw Jews from
the host computer to power the drive
that was the fact that it's really
compact make it a truly portable storage
solution
now the reason is so compact because on
the inside it is a new 1.8 inch drive
that is much smaller than this regular
2.5 inch drive right here and the fact
that the drive on the inside is a solid
state drive means the transcend here is
very fast in my testing in offer up 245
megabyte per second for writing and up
to 213 megabyte per second for reading
now to put that in perspective you can
transfer a CD
worth of data unless them for a second
really fast indeed so what the catch
well the drive here is rather limited
internal storage space and is pricey a
little bit costing some one hundred
secure dollars for 128 gigabyte or
almost $300 for two and 56 gigabyte but
it still worth it in my opinion though
especially when considering it come with
this pouch right here for you to use it
on the go for more on the drive make
sure you check out the phone with Viacom
and if you feelin sexy right now and
will tell me that I have a good body
feel free to go ahead and do that via
through your Facebook or Google+ I will
not hold that against you and that's
because I'm dumb low and this has been
the first look at the ESD 200 per go so
state drive from transcend</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
