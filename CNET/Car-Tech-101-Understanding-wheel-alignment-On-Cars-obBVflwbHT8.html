for a front-end alignment and weren't
entirely sure what was going on the car
came out probably driving straighter and
you were told it was gonna wear the
tires less but in the middle there was
kind of a black box so let's sort that
out by introducing you to the big three
of alignment camber caster and toe to
help us I've enlisted the guy whose shop
has done dozens of alignments on my
car's ron Vasconcelos of dependable tire
and brake in San Rafael California all
right Ron first of all tell us what is
toe that's the people mostly think of
when their tires are out of alignment
tow in tow out pigeon-toed duck toes yep
okay okay toe Ian is going to wear the
tires on the outside edge yeah
toe out just gonna wear the tires on the
inside edge so when your tires are kind
of towed in pigeon-toed the outsides
wear out more crack because we're kind
of scrubbing as you draw exactly but why
do you tow wheels in or out at all well
you're pretty much toe in because you
have friction as the car rolls down the
road friction is pulling them apart okay
as all the bushings move and all that
kind of stuff if it's towed in you tow
it in just a little bit and it toes out
to about zero obviously everything gets
pulled back by all the motion everything
gets pulled back by them somewhat by the
motion obviously some suspension systems
are tighter than others
old front-wheel drive cars used to tow
them out because the wheels would pull
them in Oh from the tour from the torque
pulling it in so if your towed out or if
you're not totally you're gonna have
less forward stability you're gonna have
you have tow out the car wants to turn
on siddhart one dart right so if you're
going down the freeway the car wanders
just wandering a bit yeah it might have
some toe out okay so let's now go to
camber this is one people often
misunderstand what is negative and what
is positive camber
negative camber the tire is leaning in
at the top so it's squatting a little
typically if you look at an old
Volkswagen the rear wheels have negative
camber a lot of it right
Porsches these days have a lot of
negative camber so when you have a lot
of negative camber you're getting what
benefit you're getting cornering
benefits gonna handle better I dive into
that corner that thing is kind of higher
plant instead of leaning over positive
it's gonna want to roll the other way so
you're kind of pre setting it for the
dig that's gonna get into the road and
also if you're not driving the car hard
you're just driving it back and forth
down the freeway while the tires already
sitting that way
it's gonna wear an inside edge okay so
it's a waste of performance if you
really have an extreme negative camber
correct okay so then the one that's
trickiest of the of the big three is
caster I still struggle with this one a
little bit how do you describe caster to
someone casters the angle between the
upper ball joint and the lower ball
joint with the lower ball joint leading
that would be positive caster this is
front of the car yeah the blower ball
joint or the lower pivot of the steering
of the steering okay forward is positive
caster so that's like a bicycle fork
correct and that is for what purpose why
isn't that straight up and down
stability a straight up and down caster
angle would make for a wheel that
nervously tracks left or right at almost
any whim or input a little positive
caster or leaned back in the angle the
wheel pivots along calms this down a car
will pull towards low caster say you
have four degrees on the right side and
three degrees on the left side the car
is going to want to drift to the left
because think about it the ball joint is
going backwards it wants to go that way
and all this stuff interacts car pulls
towards negative caster pulls towards
positive camber so you can have one one
way and one the other in the car will
drive straight
where they're both over there go faster
at now of these three why do they go
wrong these are all big metal parts in
here and people look at it so how could
that every but well a lot of parts these
days are made of aluminum yeah aluminum
soft they do like aluminum because it's
lighter weight aluminum is stronger per
pound than steel but but easier to bend
couple that with low-profile tires to
transmit more Road impact to those
aluminum parts and the fact that the
joints and mounts that hold your
suspension in place where and then allow
things to drift and that's why you need
an occasional realignment so when
someone hits a pothole should they be
concerned and if so why number of
different things you can bend a wheel
you can
and suspension parts you can break the
bead and attire you see a lot of people
with bulge on the side of it what's
happened is they've hit something so
hard that it's broken the belts in there
if I've hit something and I'm not sure
if it did any damage or there any
telltale things like can look or feel
for um Sharon was straight before when I
was going straight now the sharon wheels
off while you're going straight while
you're going straight it's something got
bent give away shake now i hit that
pothole now my car shakes is i'm doing
60 miles an hour down the freeway
possibly been a wheel something like
that many of us only get our cars
aligned when we get new tires but notice
things like pole or vibration is you
drive a sign that things aren't aligned
anymore and potentially costing you some
tire life handling quality maybe even a
little fuel economy more car tech
