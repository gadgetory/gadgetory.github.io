all be driving around in cars that are
clean and quiet and completely free of
nasty pollution the Porsche is showing
that those cars don't need to be free of
emotion with this the mission II concept
it's an all-electric four-door 4 seater
sports car that has not one but two
electric motors each one making over 300
horsepower with 600 horsepower for the
pair things should be pretty quick and
all that power is going to go through
the ground through all four wheels
it's powered by a massive battery pack
situated low in the chassis much like
that in the Tesla Model S Porsche is
promising a range of 500 kilometers
about 310 miles which simply plenty to
get you to working back probably all
week long now they're been plenty of
critics of Porsches other four-door
sports car the Panamera people not
liking the looks of that thing but I
haven't met anybody who isn't in love
with a look at the mission II a long low
sculpted bodywork looks beautiful and
the way those headlights fade into the
massive scoops and the fender flares is
absolutely fantastic it's a gorgeous car
now this is just a concept so don't go
running down to your Porsche dealers you
haven't expect to place an order but if
you're wondering what the
next-generation Panamera might look like
here's your answer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
