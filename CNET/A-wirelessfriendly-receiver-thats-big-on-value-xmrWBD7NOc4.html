and we're gonna take a look at the onkyo
TX NR 626 this is a mid-range 7.2 AV
receiver that's selling for five hundred
dollars and unlike most receivers it
packs both built-in Bluetooth and Wi-Fi
as you can see this is a full-size AV
receiver so it's big boxy and it takes
up a lot of space the front panel has
sharp edges and corners and it's
cluttered with buttons so it's not quite
the nicest looking AV receiver out there
the included remote is good as far as
receiver remotes go there are white
input buttons that are easier to see in
the dim home-theater and the directional
pad and volume rocker are at least
centrally located the big features like
I mentioned are built-in Wi-Fi and
bluetooth bluetooth makes it easy to
wirelessly stream audio from nearly
every smartphone or tablet and Wi-Fi let
you take advantage of the ACOs
networking features without needing an
Ethernet connection in your living room
the networking features are pretty
extensive including smart phone control
DLNA compatibility in several integrated
streaming services including Spotify
Pandora Rhapsody slacker and internet
radio the big missing feature that some
competitors offer is airplay although
that only matters if you own other Apple
devices on the back you'll see there are
six HDMI inputs including an MHL
compatible hdmi input there are also
quite a few legacy connections as well
including a dedicated turntable input
which is a cool extra that you don't
really see very often these days sound
quality on the onkyo is solid overall we
had resident audio files steve
guttenberg give it a listen and he found
it had a really powerful sound on movies
music was also detailed and it was able
to create a really nice soundstage even
on stereo CDs when we compared it
head-to-head with the sony STR DN 1040
the Sony did win out overall sounding a
little more transparent although it was
pretty close we did also run into a
little trouble with on Kiyo's automatic
speaker calibration which never really
set the level of the subwoofer right
so you'll need to be comfortable making
some manual tweaks to get the receiver
sounding its best
so overall the onkyo TX NR 626 is an
excellent value with a great feature set
that tops most AV receivers out this
year but it's just a step behind Sony's
STR DN 840 which offers most of the same
features plus airplay for $50 less I'm
Matthew Muscovy ak and this is the onkyo
TX and are six to six</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
