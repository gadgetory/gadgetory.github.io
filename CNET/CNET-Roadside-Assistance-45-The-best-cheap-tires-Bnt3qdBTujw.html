your Prius probably need that and we're
gonna find out what's going on with the
upgrades for a suzuki kizashi because so
many of you drive one of those it's
roadside assistance welcome everybody
Brian Cooley with wayne cunningham
antuan goodwin and we've got Steven
Beach them at the controls today filling
in for Mitchell here's we've got in your
emails this week and don't forget to get
in the show it's easy just send us a
question a comment or just a vile screed
about what we do here at car tech at
cnet com Reuben sandwich his real name
writes in and says I'm in the market for
tires for my Kia it turns out it came
with super cheap tires they always do
nexon is the brand never heard of those
so he says my Kia is strong and fun but
brakes tires an engine of the most
important parts of a car so for key to
cheap out the on the tires is like
driving on butter that means to work at
a bicycle importer years ago we used to
get these really inexpensive tires and
tubes from what was then very exotic
from China and the name was die young
Dae why UNG but still die young I just
very prophetic anyway his question is
what kind of tires should he get for his
kid that's like wide open he also says
PS my mazda which i guess he had before
this was hooker red then he found out it
was volcanic red and says the salesman
pulled pulled one on me you were
disappointed that weren't you you
thought you had a car that was hooker
rate he told all your friends in fact
you were cool for a minute I'm kind of
wondering what he's doing with his Kia
that he needs new tires i right he
doesn't tell us what kind of key he's
driving and there aren't that many fast
ones like okay maybe you're out there
shredding your what turbo what what's
the Kia that matches the Sonata kia oh
the optima optimum the trouble Optimus
Valley sporty what about the 40 the 40
coupe oh yeah could be little 42 a high
performance version of that one yes
soria is performance and driving you
know but Lisa's has got crappy tires I
bet it's a soul because those seem to
come with little skinny tires when I see
him unless they have a little wheel
package on them let's just shot by
vehicle that's against Nixon I never
heard of that
no never it's like Nick's I've heard of
them letting them and why we have to see
adds a nice to read a lot of import like
tuner car magazines is it a cheap tire I
don't know I've never bought I never
bought him I just recognized the brand
name let's assume he's got a 2010 forte
koup sound reasonable yep sure SX is the
high trim yes when it'll go through the
tire rack here because they are two
tires what Crutchfield is to car tech
yeah tirerack.com is definitely the
place you start looking cuz they got a
configurator you can choose your car
will tell you what the wheels are and
Lily lease the original wheels yeah
their data guide their data is the best
and they also lets you try different
wheels on a car which is cool as the
other going to look so let's just rank
them here buy cheap and just find you a
cheap tire that we think is good you
don't want super cheap you wanted
something better than that but we don't
want to do spend two hundred and thirty
bucks a corner like these you're not
gonna put potenza re 70s on a cot that
makes no sense it's perfect friend's
house it'll be a thousand dollars a tire
change it'll be the best upgrade you man
any car hey of course it will oh and
they're z-rated so you might get eight
thousand miles out of them that's always
fun yeah the reason the manufacturers
the way they pick their tires is of
course there's cost yep but then they
also have to they buy them for where
life for fuel efficiency they pick them
sometimes a lot of times they make deals
with certain tire companies to supply
tires for all of their vehicles yeah in
certain cases like with a Toyota Prius
like you know they actually work with
the manufacturer of the tire to design a
tire for that vehicle but in most cases
kind of an off-the-shelf you know
sometimes it's a rebranding of a tire
that's already maybe it's already a
bridge tone something or other yeah kind
of rebrand it for that particular
manufacturer kinda like so the TV's you
see it best buy it's an existing model
remodel numbered for Best Buy only yeah
you know it's hard for you to cross shop
them yeah makes it very tricky so here's
an example of some tires are in the low
hundred dollar range this to me makes
sense for most Kia's again not knowing a
model you've got not spending more than
the car engineers spent on the
suspension hint hint hankook and kumho
and you're going to get a lot of these
brands that are not traditional tire
brands that we know there's also some
Continentals in here general still makes
tires that's good to know i'm not sure
that
realize something's very key about this
there's like seven or eight tires here
under a hundred twenty bucks it's key to
know one thing the brown on the tire is
usually nonsense now most of the major
tire companies long gone out of business
and sold their brand to another company
that's using their brand it's like a
magnavox TV there is no magnavox company
anymore but they sell magnavox and
Zenith televisions because some company
bought the brand so don't get too caught
up in getting good years because a lot
of good years aren't made by Goodyear a
lot of good rich aren't made by Goodrich
so this is one of the great BS
businesses in the world is tires they
will tell you or it's a good you want a
good year that's a great time you want a
Michelin well who makes it if it says
Michelin it says Made in China it's
probably subcontracted just a hunch just
to who and it could be a great time but
you're not buying some legendary
heritage michelin tire that has made it
some you know handcrafted in some
factory in France you know it's not it
doesn't work that way right so don't get
BS buy tires that's that happens all too
often also a lot of it is it really
depends on as far as like picking a tire
what you're going for what's the weather
like around your place yeah if you live
in a place that is pretty dry most of
the year I mean maybe you want to look
at some summer tires for four if you're
looking for performance or something but
if you live in a place where the weather
is pretty erratic and unpredictable then
maybe you want a nice all season tire or
in you know yeah never underestimate a
good snow tire in a place that gets a
lot of snow and slippery conditions
additionally you want to look at things
like where life if you go through if
you're going through a set of tires
every year you probably want to look at
the way you're driving but be you want
to make sure that you're buying tires
that have the where life that you're
looking for and you can oftentimes find
even within the same brand of tire the
same like a sub brand of tire different
where life's you know basically what
happens is the stickiness of the tire
that sort of grip rating and the the
where life of the tire often inversely
proportional so you can yes find a nice
balance and grip ride quality inn where
life there's a lot of different things
you want to look at and you Brian
actually didn't you do a video yeah the
how to read the solder ain't the
sidewall there's about 12 12 points of
data on the sidewall of the tire ho most
folks don't know what most of the me
they know about tread wear
temperature and there's one other
Treadwell Ted where there's the three
letters a B it'll say temp treadwear and
forget what the third one is everyone
knows about that that says right on
there what it is action attraction yeah
but there's a bunch of other specs on
there that are really cryptic and you
also want to know what the yellow and
the red dots me and I won't even tell
you so go over to cnet TV and just
search tires I can't imagine we have
more than one video on tires and if we
do tell me what it is and i'll put a
link to the video in the show notes and
it will take you through decoding your
side walls let's see better Prius tech
Dave and Delaware he's gonna know seven
Prius he let's see he has a good mount
for his iphone four he's got that or
he's going to get him out for his iphone
four make that a nice little sort of
mini pocket head unit in his car great
he uses motionx for nav motionx yep
popular it's a good navigation for the
iphone yeah okay you had to pay for it
okay monthly so he's using that for his
name yeah doesn't have nav in the dash
on an 07 ninety-eight percent of the
time though he says I don't need nap
most of us don't we know we're going so
what should he run in the foreground
when he's not using nav is kind of like
a wide open question what should I do
when I Drive not like what music app or
what traffic app according to Ray LaHood
he should stare at the road it's a
little wheel the simple answer is you
should be driving you just for driving
your car if you don't need to look at
somewhere else don't look somewhere else
although he may want a music app youtube
facebook Joe get naked chicks calm these
are all great when you're driving
serious commemorate if I if for me if I
were doing it i would probably put up a
some sort of performance meter I mean
it's a Prius it's a little silly what
little i would use it for the opposite
reason by G forces on yet to measure how
smoothly i'm driving y and to keep the G
forces within a certain amount I mean of
course the priests already has like fuel
economy meters and stuff built into that
but if it's just you just want something
moving around on the dashboard yeah he
doesn't hurt you don't need that when
you wanted to go traffic yeah what I
definitely go traffic because even
though he says he doesn't use his nab
ninety percent of eight ninety percent
of the time and that's true i mean most
of us know where we're going yeah but if
you're driving in any urban area there's
likely to be traffic and you want to
know about that before you hidden the
problem of course with most nav apps
that you know it'll tell you about the
traffic that you're in right good thank
you which is actually a good reason to
have a nav system that has traffic with
it and even if you you're going on a
normal route you always drive plug in
that destination anyway you're not going
to care about the turn-by-turn but
you're going to carry out if it says oh
there's you know a 10 mile backup up
ahead or at the very least just run the
map if you have a live map i'll do this
on the android phone and just look at
what the traffic just do the traffic
over light and just see where traffic is
and i can look at my route really quick
and see if there's a red line where the
normally isn't i'll do that sometimes
yeah there's a good traffic app inrix
traffic there a big traffic provider the
in works happen is really good too has
really good up to date information huh I
you know I mean not all this stuff is
you know you might get into something
that hasn't been reported yet which
always sucks yeah and I mean there's
also like you can leave ways open just
so that you can be necking goodies yeah
or you drive around points that's really
why that sometimes I just run wave just
for the point what was the virtual are
the augmented reality app that we talk
about my own Road I on road I don't
remember I think there's an iphone
version of that but that's like a
collision detection app that's right in
the road ahead of you to make sure you
don't run into something I don't know if
the I iOS version of vlingo does this
but the Android version has this thing
called what safe reader the reader text
message is allowed to you oh so if you
if you better Nashville and there's also
an in-car interface that basically lets
you just talk to it so you can say like
hey vlingo and it ago what up dog and
you can go send a text message to brian
saying i'm going to be late and it'll do
that no one has to touch the dice on iOS
of course I think Siri would do this yes
siree should do similar things yeah so
basically matter what do you do in the
car we can't you know tell you what you
should do in the car because that's the
first question before you decide what
should I be running on the phone to help
me do that and if you don't do anything
that needs a nap then don't run an app
there's no reason to be distracted this
is becoming a big deal see car tech live
from the same day there if there if you
can find a nap I should probably look
this up if you can find one of those
driver quarter apps that maybe uses the
front face camera to do some sort of
recording in case you get an accident if
you're nice okay paranoid yeah just you
know
like I think the napping fifth that does
that or face that backwards and do your
own version of that cab game show cash
cab we use a question pick up pick up
hitchhikers try to pick up hitchhikers
pull over and say hey you want a ride
somewhere and everything's like no I
wait for a real cab or better yet they
don't even looking for a ride they're
just walking down the sidewalk get
pulled over hey do you want a ride no
the app is a drive me Trek and it
basically uses the drive may Trek WRC
like for record oh okay I was like is
you're gonna wreck your roc for record
basically it records video while you're
driving and if you get in a fender
bender you tap a button it'll like grab
that kind of cool and yeah I thought
video this morning we're on the internet
workload um guy backed into another guy
in traffic and then got out and tried to
say you you you ran into me and the guys
like no no I got a camera on my dad look
my car was dating and I wasn't moving
and they could save you a couple of
hundred bucks that's my if something
happened that's kind of cool actually
there's anything that you could run that
you would want to just have running all
the time because that's the thing you
have to use something that religiously
because you don't know when you're going
to have needed any so let's go if you
didn't you just get in the habit of
running all the time seems a little odd
but if you want that's cool hey maybe
your rod that's all right we're going on
it Dave we're good without its ok let's
see Rodney's got a kizashi our
condolences now Kenny 2010 kizashi well
yeah 2010 our condolences rockford
fosgate system i wanna replace it with a
JVC 50 h dt which is a surround head
unit would it be worth the upgrade only
thing i see is the nav where i can place
a garment on the windshield for that
because my car has bluetooth streaming
is my sauron phone thanks and guys enjoy
the show we're going to send you a
family sized box of punctuation then
look at your question what would you do
with Rodney the the 50 hdt that what is
the KW NT 50 hdt unit he's asking about
it's a pretty good stereo it's got HD
radio it's got navigation into it it is
a good replacement if you don't have the
well I guess the kizashi you can't even
get nav on that he does mention that
yeah you pretty much you are stuck with
that uh well if you want nav will stick
a garment on your dashboard and wire it
into the system so yeah I would say it's
worth upgrading the only thing that I
would look at is you have the Rockford
Fosgate system so there's
aunt somewhere yeah but you're going to
have to tap into so that's a robust
system yeah and but I mean the thing is
that you know it's just an amp it's not
like a you know anything that's really
tricky but you want to look at the
detailed instructions on on on how to
how to plug into that and get an
interface kit the ordered him yet go
somewhere and have it installed which
you know he may actually be doing he
didn't state whether he was going to do
it or not in the off but if you go
someone have installed they'll be able
to figure that out for you but yeah that
garmin system is good but it's not
really well integrated and yeah the jvc
system that he's talking about it's got
a big 6.1 inch screen big ish i think
we're looking at it here is this it yep
that's the one sisters on ebay for 760
not cheap I mean as far as nav head
units go 760 is kinda cheap yeah for the
melee float around 1,200 bucks yeah but
that class of product he's looking at is
it that's a full-bore head unit right
and jb SI unit for pricing goes there
they're a bit on the on the low end of
the price anyway okay for a 6.1 inch
pioneer that does the same thing is if
you're you're looking at about a
thousand bucks maybe a little maybe a
little less maybe a little street yeah
we will now one thing I'm thinking he
lose here is on the rockford fosgate
head unit it has those special DSPs
settings for different sound fields they
call them yeah right where you can make
it sound like a concert hall put a bunch
of echo on it and all that kind of stuff
but do this what you want a ride around
in a Cathedral a little super bass
setting to or you can just like I have
the subwoofer like bang out everything I
love no way to invoke those profiles
even if they're built into the amp and
still exist what control would invoke
them well I think that sort of thing
happens in the receiver anyway that dfp
so yeah so I think it it just all of
that sort of DST the signal processing
and adding echo and and volume is a
little going away all that happens in
the receiver and then it just says every
signal is going to send to the amp to be
amplified I'm pretty sure that's how
that works well whatever it is is gonna
he's going to have some sacrifice on
that and we're just trying to say that
it might be a challenge which may not be
much of a sacrifice as well I mean when
you install this this jvc system it's
gonna have its own eq anyway so if you
want to be up the bass up you'll still
be able to do that
that you just won't be using a stupid
loudness algorithm that makes me music
sound worse anyway but if you love this
out of that rockford fosgate whether
it's rational or not some folks like a
certain kind of really inaccurate audio
because it's just the sound they like
fact most of us have some kind of a bias
towards some really inaccurate kind of
sound it's just the way it is you may
not get that same particular sound back
but I think there'd be a way to
reproduce it well then if you just take
time yeah we're gonna filling alright so
that's why that's what you can do with
that and yes it's a nice upgrades a big
upgrade ER Dube that's that's like night
and day from a text ribbon read out to a
full LCD nav live traffic as well
everything's in there 005 subi legacy GT
hung in Virginia talks about this one
let's say he's got an in-dash CD that's
about it then he went and got an
aftermarket parrot I 9200 which is a
hands-free Bluetooth system has a cool
little dashboard you kind of velcro
under your dash little knob and a couple
of buttons and all this and so he's got
all this going on he's got let's see he
even gave away his garmin nav does its
google android phone as he says better
maps better traffic etc etc his question
after all this Odyssey is do we even
need factory car tech anymore you were
talking with this last week right this
question came out last week and and I
kind of babbled on for about 45 minutes
about it what did you babble to the
conclusion well I came to the conclusion
that different strokes for different
folks so it's you know they're mean
there are people who who just want to
buy a car you know like they they go to
the BMW dealership they just want to buy
BMW that does all this awesome stuff
yeah and that's just the kind of person
they are they don't want to fiddle
around adding things onto it they don't
want to fiddle around I mean these are
the same people that's most people yeah
exactly the kind of people who were just
like you know I can't run this game
owned by a new computer instead of like
afraid my videos right I mean we all
know that person and they are most
people yeah yeah on all those cases so
there's that the twenty percent will
upgrade their gear the eighty percent
will just go buy something new right for
reasons of both maybe lack of technical
prowess and lack of time so if we're
talking about the average person here
who just wants a you know an everyday
car that has everything running you get
it and it's going then yeah you're gonna
pay you you'll pay for the convenience
the factory is going to NICU thousands
to have all that stuff done
versus you using your phone which brings
a lot of it for free yeah of course with
the phone you have to have a mounting
spot and this is where we're talking
about hooking this stuff up I know if
you just want to keep your phone in your
pocket you know gonna wear the earbuds
get in the car and start driving you
know yeah you don't want to your dab on
your phone because you don't want to
pull out of your pocket want to have it
like visible on the dash and of course
when you get into things like one thing
i was looking at recently was a head-up
unit a car which is very convenient you
know project the program return by turn
on the screen yeah you're not going to
get that with the phone right I mean
that you think I'd you're talking I'm
thinking why not you might do that why
can't it they do a wireless ipod out and
then and that would spawn an industry of
little tiny dash top projectors that I
bet might sell like hot cakes especially
if the d-o-t starts to scare people or
they might outlaw that too then there's
that isn't there like a film that you
can like stick to your windshield and
then fit your phone underneath it upside
down digs and it'll look like a some
seem to recall seeing they'll be
backwards it like it wouldn't work in
the daytime but at night and be
background be able to see it anyway be
small wouldn't be magnified at all still
be the same real one-to-one but yeah but
do head-up displays are small anyway
what happens when you take a hard left
though in your lexicon slides across
right across the data hit up you let
that Audi we saw at CES to do this and
move the screen back to the driver have
to make another hard turn place I don't
want to be following that car uh yeah
you know I you I mean come on Tony
you're taking it you preaching to the
choir here I drove an 88 for there's no
tech my phone gets clipped on the
dashboard and I got everything done I
think it works great I could upgrade my
head you know I could put a modern
stereo in that single din unit but I
don't carry well the automaker's the
phone are going to add I've seen this a
bit is they're getting better and
developing these interfaces from the
phone to the car I there's I've seen
this with equipment makers I saw this at
CES actually they had a good iphone
interface where that you know most of
the stuff is powered on the iphone but
showed up on a lot of screen in the car
same thing with android that can do that
too so they're working at this you know
the the problem is right now the pro
calls aren't really set in stone yet
there's a lot of development going on in
that space so and and what's the Android
think it's connected car consortium as
well car connectivity mirrorlink Marilyn
yeah so those are the two things yeah
ipod out in mirror link are the two
major platform ways to export the video
on your screen more or less to an
external display typically in a car but
the issue here is and if you missed car
tech live this week most of you
subscribe to both so i encourage you to
go check the show or if you don't
subscribe to a car tech live as well
over at car tech cnet com we had our
lead story this week about how the feds
are starting to rattle the cages of car
makers pretty seriously about what they
let you do in cars in terms of factory
tech i can imagine the first thing that
the factories cut is stuff like support
for ipod out or the android connectivity
because that makes them part and parcel
of a wild west i'm in car distraction
they're saying we're just going to
enable you to do whatever you want
factory sponsored because we're gonna
let you bring your display in but then
we're just going to say old be safe or
we're not going to regulate it much that
sounds like a red like this it's not
really a wild west though I mean there's
a there's a certification process for
getting your app approved for both of
these things yeah for ipod out and for
well not for ipod out but definitely for
the mirror link car connectivity can
sort something they have a process where
you have to submit your app for approval
to use the protocol just so that you
don't end up with you know first person
shooter that's what is that one of the
filters or they start drinking for
technical call they're filtering it for
to make sure that you you conform to the
technical aspect but then also there's a
there is a you know sort of a well this
isn't really an appropriate for car sort
of thing so they're envisioning
mirrorlink is strictly a car thing yeah
it's definitely for this if it's
sponsored by the car connectivity
consortium so it's a diff okay that's
okay it's all car all right but that's
so then they are having some say over
the road to how you know would forward
with which sync applink yeah Ford Apple
Inc is it think Apple II just what are
they cutting rattling I think it's seek
a plague I thought it for a blog is
under neither they're naming convention
is horrible but the same thing there
were you know they only have like four
or five apps but that's just because
it's not open
you have to come to them and say like
hey we'd like to to use a to develop a
heart rate monitor for the car and then
they have to go like we also do it
safely right by gosh okay so that's that
some takes on you know how to use your
phone yeah it's it's yes your question
is almost leading the phone does it all
and more for way less money and is far
more malleable and updatable than any
car will ever be it's almost like
there's no reason not to accept people
love the very large display they like
the built in nature nothing's falling
and sliding and hanging off the glass
let's face when you clip a phony where
it looks nasty it's some nasty $29
suction cup no one makes a good car
mount for a smartphone they may call
junkie ones when where is the Apple
quality windshield mount they're only
the only a plat for a paleta that's the
thing there are a lot of good iphone
windshield mount feder sturdy really is
really nice ones and they don't do that
yeah then and I think was last week
didn't we talk about like the the tomtom
car mount no yeah that was life but you
guys weren't here we like the tomtom car
kit is rock solid and it has a GPS
receiver in it and it has a speaker in
it no nice it's a good receiver and
there are other ones that you know the
thing about the iphone is it's it's
shaped like an iphone when once you
start you know getting into like android
tablets everything that every android
phones everything gather size so you
into a universal things that have the
clamps and then there on the end of like
a six inch neck that jiggles around i've
got one now that i use for for my
thunderbolt and the funny thing is when
i hit a bump it jiggles about half an
inch in every direction so if you try to
get a play whoa whoa there we go yeah i
guess i got this piece of crap right
here this is the one that I syst your
standard sort of articulated suction cup
it's just nasty the ring behind the
phone that you use to tighten it in
position is so cheaply made it always
snaps I refuse to buy another mount cuz
you can't buy parts for it so I've got
it all fixed up with electrical tape
it's just a mess so ghetto wait that's
the the OEM droid one right yeah that's
a good wrote no not mine I think the
thing is you keep you keep taking it out
of cars are probably putting in another
car yeah it's in and out all the time
most people would snap that on the
dashboards leave but that I would never
leave in like our that hideous
I mean that first of all where are where
are the nice sort of top of dash mounts
that's what I want their kind of like a
a molded sort of an OEM style little a
little hump that is you know each one
molded for the major styles of phones
and with this interchange will set a
tray the thing is those use D either
have to use adhesive of some sort yeah
or they just they're just going to slide
over the desk visualize a car maker
saying we're going to do a universal
metal plate underneath the dash under
the upholstery you can't see it but
there's a zone there and we're going to
sell a line or at least licensed
manufacturers to make a line of these
sort of lumps that will be the same
upholstery color magnetically clamp on
there the magnets in the car mount the
plates just inside the dash that's a
great standard that should be out there
and give me something looks kind of like
the design of the car not this nasty
plastic thing if I go buy a
fifty-thousand-dollar BMW that's a cheap
one and I don't decide to get I Drive I
want to use my droid I'm not going to
stick this thing in there I'm a belated
what's happening is though you're saying
that I want something that's Universal
on both ends and that just it's doable
it well I mean it just gets even
clunkier as far as like the introduces
with cell phones years ago they had
these the lot of the car makers either
sponsored or they all sold these into
dealerships where it was it was
upholstered in automaker materials they
would you know tell him here's here's
where we source our material and the
after make it after martin company would
go buy a bunch of it and they would make
their products out of it and it would
clip on the side of your console it be
stitched the same way and would have a
place for your phone to go it was like
what how much it was a time about 120
bucks this was years ago so be a pricey
piece a suction cup mount $10 yeah but
if you buy a nice car you don't want
that I Drive a buyer of a non nice car
I'd hope this damn thing sittin there
all the time it's like gas plus it's got
that well I guess they both would it
says I have something valuable in the
car so there's they both have that
problem well if it's a phone I'd sorry
it's probably win with you right but for
some reason people keep breaking into
cars when they see the suction kiss on
the way the scene that veil was broken
into for the tomtom gps mal for a tomtom
do it was it was just a mounting them
out but it had the Pat was one of the
ones where the power cable connects to
the mountain yeah yeah and then you just
snap the Tom time into it and I got out
of the car and left it suction cup to
the dashboard plugged into the cigarette
lighter and I come back in the window
smash
the cradle is gone stereo still in the
dashboard mind you and it's just barely
in their full installation is jumping
around the could just pull it out
earlier I've just pull stereo but they
just they stall the car kit and it was
more of a opportunity it's like oh I
could smash and grab that and they got
away with with what's probably $25 they
got they got a car kit for a tomtom but
not the time at the time time just stole
the mountains my backpack and the 12
volt plug yep that's it yep unbelievable
window and right yeah we had to pay to
get the window repair for a $25 I guess
they thought you left the tomtom under
the cedar in the glove box they probably
rifled for it but no no everything like
a live box with closed anything with
rifle this was somebody somebody wanted
him out right now there's like I lost my
time timeout I really write amazon
