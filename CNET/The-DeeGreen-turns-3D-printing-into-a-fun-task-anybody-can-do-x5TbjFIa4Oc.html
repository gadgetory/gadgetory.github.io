deep green 3d printer form B 3d so
what's the 3d printer well take a look
at all of these right here and you
guessed it I made all of these using
this machine
so basically 3d printing is that when
you melt plastic string like this here
call filament and form that into a 3d
object basically you run the string of
plastic from right here through this
tube into the printhead that will melt
and extrude that on the platform
underneath now on the printer here the
platform is actually removable in case
you need to clean its surface or if you
want to put some glue on top of it to
keep the object from being move away
during a print and that's operation
needed for this printer to work because
it will do the rest by itself including
calibration and that's a big improvement
with other printer because in my
experience other 3d printer will require
you to do the calibration and that can
take hours with a degree in you have to
do is get a 3d model file you can find a
lot of them in thingiverse.com or make
one yourself load it into the software
and either send that to the printer
directly or save it on an SD card and
print through the card itself
note that either way you need an SD card
to print because even if you choose to
print directly from a computer the
preacher would still use the card as a
buffer for its printing process the
printer comes included with one a 4
gigabyte card now the big win comes with
this touchscreen right here that works
very well you can use this to initiate a
print or change the filaments as well as
few other functions now in my testing
the big winner worked very well and was
very easy to you in fact it was easier
to use than most regular printer which
is a huge improvement in 3d printing now
I shouldn't take a long time to finish a
3d printer pending on the size of the
print itself you know between 20 minutes
two hours but that it is a nature of 3d
printing now overall this one here is a
great 3d printer which bring up the most
important question
it cost unfortunately it's not cheap
costing some $2,000 in US and some 1,500
euros in Europe but considering how well
it works and how easy to use it is it
totally worth the investment
now for more this one here check out my
full review at cnet.com keep in mind
that even there was a great 3d printer
it cannot bring everything 3d such as
itself for that you need a spare another
$2,000 but this door right here you can
and it might just walk to wonder as
suspects you would spend all night
opening and reopening it leaving me
resting my beauty in peace and that's
because I'm dango and this has been the
first look at the D green 3d printer
from be 3d</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
