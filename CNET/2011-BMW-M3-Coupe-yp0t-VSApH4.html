standing still especially when they're
red and wear an EM badge let's drive the
2011 bmw m3 coupe and check the tech and
let's do that somewhere else
this 2011 coupe in Melbourne red is the
fourth generation of the m3 it's also
available as a four-door sedan not too
unlike one of Cinderella's sisters and
as a convertible both of which just seem
a little greedy on the part of BMW
I'll tell you as soon as this little red
rocket arrived we said to ourselves ah
this is how an m3 should be configured
Spartan no LCD screen no navigation no I
Drive controller down here those things
seem foreign on a car that BMW
advertises as not all race cars should
be restricted to the track or something
like that - simple gauges in a 3-series
and you see these are pretty familiar
except as a set of lights above the
tachometer those are your shift lights
speaking of shifting we have the
optional 7-speed dual-clutch automated
manual the DCT we get that on the road I
think you're going to be stunned by how
somebody finally got it right and if you
want to bump up the basic sound on this
guy you can keep this proper head unit
and go to premium sound which will give
you 825 watts the brawny esteem W says
they've ever put into a car through 16
speakers driven by nine channel
amplification we do have an iPod USB aux
combo back here that can be had another
part of a package or ala carte with the
basic head unit now check out these
buttons alongside the shifter here power
EDC traction control off and this
unlabeled rocker power is the engine
response standard or aggressive on or
off real simple EDC's your damper
control off means comfort one light
means normal two lights means sport we
have continuously variable dampers or
shocks all around this car that's
optional here's our traction control
turn that off for some real outrageous
behavior this rocker is Drive logic it
tells the DCT how to shift you have five
shift patterns you see them in bars on
the dash and if you disengage traction
control you can get to the sixth that's
the total wild combo and all those
settings can be memorized inside the M
drive mode button right here so once I
get everything down in the way I want it
I can snapshot that as my M mode just
hold that M button down for two seconds
and it memorizes everything now I've got
one button access to go from whatever
mode I'm in to wild one other sort of
related Drive thing but it's not
performance oriented is this little guy
right here that defeats auto start/stop
this vehicle will do the green thing
when you come to a stop and a lighter in
traffic
we'll shut down the engine until you
start to move again and then kick it
back up you can defeat that here the
auto start-stop technology is well crude
it needs four to five cranks to get the
engine back up once you lift off the
brake and on a car that already gets hit
with a gas guzzler tax what's the point
I'll check this out this is a unique
thing on the m3 coupe carbon fiber roof
panel saves you a few pounds over steel
but mounted up this high a few pounds
can have quite an impact on your center
of gravity now this is a coupe thing not
on the sedan obviously not on the
convertible obviously but you can
replace this with a sunroof and then you
get a whole metal roof up here which
kind of misses okay okay let's get to
the engine that's really it while you're
watching this video right it lives here
under a special hood special in two ways
first of all you can always spot an m3
because it's got this big proboscis
sticking up right here that makes room
for a big motor underneath physically
big as well as numerically big oh by the
way this hood very light it's aluminum
which is also an m3 thing now here's the
four litre v8
no turbos no amplification if you will
it's a naturally aspirated wonder of an
engine it's got their double vanos
totally variable stepless timing stuff
going on underneath here are eight
individual throttles it's an actual work
of art seriously power on this guy is
414 horsepower interesting drop down on
the torque number two just 295
foot-pounds big differential there we'll
see how that performs on the road I can
tell you now it's 0 to 60 in about 4.7
seconds with mileage that's going to
make you swallow hard 1420 is the
estimate I bet you'll do 12 on average
the way you want to drive this car on a
side note for you kids have only known
cars that are high-tech and beautifully
engineered this is how you tell when
you're driving a real car the sound it
makes when you start it up cold
clattering metallic kind of clanking big
ol lumpy square cam kind of idle not
till it gets to full operating
temperature does this car sound like
it's not coming unscrewed that's what a
high-performance car is supposed to do
this dual flush automated manual two
spindles seven cogs across them has been
a long time coming in this form for BMW
the first one they did was an absolute
disaster
they shouldn't have charged anybody they
should have paid you to drive a car with
that gearbox but that was like three
four years ago
now this car is outstanding these shifts
are so tight and so beautifully executed
you can tell by the sound just listen to
this car run through the gears
my love for this gear box is in every
mode in Drive or sequential any
combination of the aggression settings
it's always an outstanding precise quick
shift which brings me to the suspension
next this car has these three modes
comfort normal and sport I want a choppy
piece of road here it's California we
have no money to fix anything so of
course every road is crap and to be in
sport or normal with these low profile
like they're 45 series tires
forget it I'm here born I'm flying I'm
not driving so I've got this guy in
normal it's a very compliant ride but
extremely capable even on a road where
you're pushing it and the last thing I
want to point out is how all this works
together to be a really good livable
powertrain this thing when you're in the
drive mode will creep like an automatic
give it a little bit of a blip and
they'll start to creep along at walking
speed like a true automatic transmission
which does wonders for stop-and-go
drivability or if you leave it in the
softest gentlest settings and the d mode
it drives like an automatic there's
really almost no hint that there's a
bunch of clutches in there doing their
thing with a manual gearbox ok pricing
on a 2011 m3 coupe bases 58 9 now all
I'm gonna put on this car to be a purist
is the dual clutch transmission $2,100
someone finally got it right and I might
spend $1,000 on that dynamic suspension
now of course you can add Sirius
Satellite Radio BMW Bluetooth with BMW
Assist Park distance sensors a 1900
bucks for the premium sound I'd probably
skip all those you know what else I
might skip this car and instead pick up
a 335 is look at the numbers you see as
much as I like the m3 if it's my money
we're playing with here I'd skip it and
it's gas guzzler tax of 1300 bucks and
look hard at a 335 is here's how they
stack up on MSRP the m3 is 15% pricier
that buys you a 23% bump in horsepower
but quite a bit less torque it's a
little park here at 133 pounds heavier
even with that carbon hat
and after all that is only 0.4 seconds
or 8% quicker to 60 get the is and your
fuel economy goes from dismal to pretty
good but you'll have to say goodbye to
that sweet dynamic suspension and dual
clutch transmission look if you really
get on the track and don't just talk
about doing it the m3 is your car just
make sure you for it streets</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
