look at the Acer Aspire r7 an
experimental laptop if I've ever seen
one this is the flagship of a sirs new
lineup of systems and it does a lot of
things that most laptops frankly don't
do the first thing you're gonna see is
that the touchpad is above the keyboard
instead of below the keyboard that's
kind of a big break from tradition you
know there might be reasons for it
frankly never quite got used to it I
think a lot of people will actually be
turned off by that maybe if you use the
keyboard a lot on the touch screen and
you don't use a touchpad that much I
suppose it might be easier but I found
myself just reaching over and constantly
you know tiring my arm out trying to
reach the touchpad but that's the
probably the least weird thing about the
r7 the laptop screen is actually on kind
of a floating hinge so you can tilt it
up like this and then bring it forward
so it can sit right here behind the
keyboard like this it can face straight
up if you like you can really reach a
bunch of different angles kind of like a
mini desktop all-in-one and then you can
actually take the screen and if we flip
the entire thing around you can flip it
around backwards like this and show
somebody who's behind you what you're
working on and that's actually one of
the more useful things about this system
I always like laptops and there are a
handful of them that can take the screen
and project it out backwards so I think
that's pretty cool
now Acer also says you can fold the
entire thing down and use it like a
tablet and here it is a 15 inch tablet
not something that you see that often
but I like bigger tablets but here's the
other weird thing the tablet mode
doesn't actually lie down completely
flat because the curved hinge you can
see right here it's actually got a
little bit of a gap here and that holds
the screen up at an angle now when
you're sitting with us on your lap that
angle is actually pretty handy for
typing makes it a little bit more
ergonomic but you can't really carry it
around like a tablet because it's it's
more of a triangle shape it's just kind
of sticking out like that and frankly it
just looks like a design mistake if you
combine this with the touch pad being
above the keyboard those are two weird
things that just frankly look like they
were ideas that Rou maybe not as well
thought out as they should have been now
the the
part here is this is a very experimental
system it's actually got decent
components and a full 1920 by 1080
display and eight only once 999 for that
and for a 15-inch nice touchscreen
laptop maybe one with a flexi screen
like this 999 that actually seems very
reasonable now that being said I think a
lot of these experiments sort of missed
more than they hit so this may not be a
practical system for too many people but
I have to definitely applaud they are
taking some risks and playing around
with the traditional laptop shape I'm
Dan Ackerman and that is the Acer Aspire
r7</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
