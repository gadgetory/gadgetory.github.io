CES 2015 joining me here are three
distinguished guests from the world of
3d printing all of which are taking new
approaches to the process of 3d printing
they are Daniel Apple stone CEO of other
machine company Connor McCormack's CEO
of em core technologies and Colin Randy
who is the managing managing director of
formlabs thank you much so much for
being here joining me from my panel my
CES panel so let's start with what this
is all about let's get some context to
the whole thing in a short time I feel
after all that all the CSS I've been a
part of I've seen 3d printing go from
maybe like a couple random outposts here
on the show floor and blossoming into
just dozens and dozens of different
options the whole 3d printer thing has
exploded and but for the most part all
these machines are doing the same thing
they're they're squirting out hot
plastic into layers and building and
using same prof sometimes they're larger
or smaller machines sometimes they're
handling slightly more refined materials
but they're all essentially this basic
idea of the 3d printer we've come to
understand but as we've gone to gotten
to know these 3d printers we've also
come to millen like their shortcomings
the frustrations with 3d printers and
working with plastic it shifts it
shrinks it sticks is slow to work with
and sometimes the end product no matter
how expensive the machine is feels a
little cheap like a like a Lego that
you're holding in this panel we're
speaking with three representatives of
companies that are taking a different
approach to 3d printing new directions
opening up new material possibilities
working with wood working with paper
metal circuit boards rubber resins if 3d
printing is to be the revolution we're
all thinking it's going to be it's going
to take more than plastic and these are
three companies that are really trying
to charge forward and make that happen
so let's get to some question
actually let's describe the different
companies actually I feel like that's
that's a big part of this starting with
Danielle and with other mil your product
described to me you can probably
describe to me the best best possible
way what what other metal does sure yeah
it is just high precision cutting of 3d
objects out of whatever material you put
in there so you can put a block of wood
you can put a slab of metal you can put
a little piece of linoleum and you carve
away the shape that you want instead of
adding layers you're cutting away layers
so it's a traditional manufacturing
technique but we just make it small and
portable so you can have one at home
yeah so I've seen you know larger CNC
Mills that take up an entire room and
this is this is a desktop mill for
people who are interested in making
smaller things I feel like maybe one of
the communities that you've tapped into
very quickly was that people who want to
make their own custom circuit board
smaller things that really need the
precision and need to do that
subtractive kind of process for the 3d
printing yeah absolutely i'm circuit
boards is so huge because most people
they don't have a big fab lab in their
backyard you know they can't easily
access china so instead you have a piece
of manufacturing that comes to you and
so you can use it to cut whatever you
want that includes high-precision
circuit boards so if you're thinking
about making a connect at home or you
have an idea for a wearable now you can
make your own circuit boards and iterate
really quickly we should also mention
you're wearing some some products that
you created on ya know i love the
application for jewelry so all these
crafts entrepreneurs that you know they
send a way to get pieces made and then
they sell you can just make them at home
so out of brass or silver or making you
know custom cast plastic parts um it's
really it's really going to open up the
world for material possibilities for you
know the average person and then Connor
talk to me about emcore you got to is it
two different products that work with
paper yeah right so firstly thank you
for the opportunity to speak here today
I think it's great that you're actually
talking about
just learned in plastic because a lot of
times we hear it on in the industry they
think it's only like an FTM type of
technology so effectively we looked at
this industry very differently we felt
from everybody else it's almost ten
years ago almost sometimes embarrassed
to say how long but 10 years from when
we first had the idea of completely
taking the industry and turning it
upside down and coming up on the
material that was extremely accessible
very low cost and durable I'm you said
paper right everybody can can get their
hands on a couple of range of paper why
don't we try and make it 3d printer that
runs on regular office paper to consider
your photocopier into your printer in
the office so interior you can set up
robbing a few sheets of paper to go into
another printer you put it into a 3d
printer and what we do is we print that
full-color a very high color resolution
treaty objects at extremely low cost you
know maybe 10 to 20 times cheaper than
plastic very very green so you can take
this part at rodan to recycle bin at the
end but the color because we use ink and
paper we get very high color correlation
between the two so we have two products
and one does fold hi res bitmap image in
color and Dylan doesn't do the full
color so it depends on what way you want
to go yeah I think that's one of the
things when people invest in a
conventional 3d printer they realized
very quickly which is the amount of just
wasted plastic that gets tossed all over
the place because you're you're going to
probably mess up one out of every couple
prints or two out of every three prints
you do something's going to happen then
you've just got a glob of plastics if
you need to do something absolutely and
the way I look at 3d printing it's like
it's like a tool in the toolbox you know
every machine has its own strengths and
weaknesses yeah and different people
need metals and different people need
plastics and different people need for
color and and it really is that the an
industry that has a need for lots of
different types of technologies so it
but the general trend across all of them
is that they can be very expensive to
run and we try to really change that and
really upset the apple tart and then
Colin talk to me about formlabs so
formlabs makes sorry it makes a stereo
lithography machine and those machines
have existed they were one of the first
3d printing machines but what formlabs
wanted to do was much like other mill
put put a printer on every person's desk
so it's it's called a prosumer printer
so it's not it's not one that you may
have in your home but it's one that
you'll see engineers and designers using
to make things it uses a resin which is
centered by a laser and that sort of
chemical reaction creates a lot of
possibilities what happens is this is a
piece this is um it's still an additive
process so much like the fdm machines
you'll be able to get a large amount of
complexity you'll even be able to build
complexity into the objects but you get
a really high resolution and you don't
get some of the ridges that you'll see
in the fdm objects but the interesting
thing is also the chemical reaction
because you can Center plastic you can
make flexible plastics you can make
things that you can cast jewelry with
you can change the power of the laser so
things can be very very have a very fine
resolution or they can move very fast so
today we even release a software update
where you can actually print parts
faster than the end at fdm machine so
it's a really interesting time for us as
we kind of figure this figure our way to
this space and so the resin in your
machine it's liquid at first right
you've got like a pool of resin but then
that gets fed through the machine and
then just cauterize door or made made
hard with the yeah so the reason if you
see the printer it has an orange top
it's because it's blocking a UV light
it's a blu ray laser so you it's a very
very fine point so you get really really
fine details so you see people building
we see people building big things but
you also see them building small
figurines and very high high fidelity
objects it's really cool all right cool
all right now talking still about the
the problems of 3d printing or the
frustrations of 3d printing tell me
about how each of you I me future
products solve a problem how did you
come across the this the idea for the
product in relation to what was the the
problem that you were trying to solve
for you know like Danielle like in the
world of 3d printing instead of just
coming out of another 3d printer Howard
how was the other milf solving a problem
or taking a different approach well we
actually feel like one of the big
barriers is not knowing how to design in
3d and so with a milling machine you
have you know even if you have a square
of
metal you can just draw in Illustrator
or some drawing program and just cut
that and so giving people the capability
of like just teaching them that a
digital design can be physical is a huge
thing to do and so instead of requiring
people learn 3d design you can just take
a drawing that you have you know write
your name and engrave it in the back of
something and so we wanted to just start
there and hopefully you know as as the
collective consciousness about 3d
printing 3d design grows then people
will say oh I can actually make I could
make a you know a chess piece out of
wood in addition to you know with 3d
printing but we wanted to give people
like the simplest possible starting
point so that everybody can really get
involved with computer control
manufacturing essentially Connery I
think you've already answered this
question but the getting to Danielle
same point but how much does software
play into the usefulness of the product
or any roadblocks to people adopting the
product is software a critical
ingredient routable piece of you know
that can be real bottleneck if you can't
generate the data and you know if you
and garbage in you'll get garbage out so
it's one thing get the right data but
then it can be very hurt just to get
data at all and we've we found this with
our own technology before we went to the
full color we were dealing with a file
format which is called stl which is
deals with usually a white file it
doesn't have any color but its energy
but a bitmap image on there we were just
dropped into the sea of a new technology
a new area that we knew really nothing
about initially so we have to really you
know swim really fast so trying to
generate color data it can be problem
but it's getting easier and easier
Daniel mentioned you know you can sketch
at things people are making apps know
for your tablets that you can actually
design with easier to have kids to
actually design a book color and all
those various things but that can be a
bit of the challenge on a better but if
the hype maybe I feel part of the
problem at the industry is better the
hype and it's not so much aware the
technology is going to go because I
believe that that's going to get there
but where the technology is right now
you know people might take imprinted on
mobile
or people canít ink that from the
fringe and it's the only one to realize
that each machine you know has its own
limitations but I do believe that in
time 5 10 years time we will look back
at this time and said this was a start
something major talking about currently
and maybe you can answer this question
Colin the customers I think a lot of
people they look at 3d printers they see
them on the show floor and I think these
are great but like maybe it's not right
for me how does how how is 3d printing
going to connect with like that just a
general consumer or is it is that is
that connection may be forced to much so
that's the for me that's the dirty
secret of 3d printing that we're kind of
working through right now in from the
80s up till now these machines were huge
they cost 300 thousand dollars and it
you had one or two people that ran the
machine you would come and you would
give them your file they would fix it
they would print it for you and they
would give it to you but what you're
seeing with these machines is your
having to have an experience where
people interact with it directly which
means that you have to change your
change price point in the way they get
to it but you also have to change the
full experience so what you're hearing
Daniel talk about about being able to
sit down and understand how the machine
works the paradigm shift is that
actually changes your design process it
changes how you think about things it's
like when you learn how a computer
worked as you learn how this technology
works you actually think about making
things differently and so the big deal
is have any experience that allows you
to learn and understand an easy road
maps that they get you there but as is
the the customers that you're finding
for your products is it still more like
an institutional customer educational
market or is there really this kind of
mythical wellspring of like home
tinker's who are rushing to adopt the 3d
printers the foot of the other the other
interesting thing is it's it's sort of a
massive market of niches so you see like
there's this technology is running in
some of the highest in institutions that
I know of but then it's also giving
birth to tons of Kickstarter's of people
who just want to figure things out so
it's one of the challenges I would I
would argue for our our businesses are
trying to find these niches and help
them in the right ways when you can't
serve them as a mass market
there is a market there for the
tinkerers or the maker community you
know we're always kind of selling into
that area but part of the challenges how
are we going to jump from hundreds of
thousands of people buying machines to
millions of people buying machines and
that's where there is a little bit of a
job both software hardware we all need
to kind of work in this to make it
happen but if there is the desire there
it will happen and people there are
examples where people are printing out
stuff for their home use so once once
there's a clear use case for it it'll
just happen in South people will pull
the technology in but still there is
some challenges I think from like I know
from the 2d printing I call the opposite
of what we do 2d printing in your office
that mean HP or one of the big players
there might make one and a half million
printers a month and the whole industry
know combined is doing tens of thousands
so how do we go from tens of thousands
to millions a month and that is still a
bit away but i think it is it's coming
it's it's it's there and now we're also
living at a time where there's a lot of
options for people who are looking for a
3d printer I did the latest issue of
make magazine just like reviewed 26 in
the magazine that are all essentially
doing the same thing I feel like that 26
is a low number compared to the amount
of 3d printers we're seeing on the show
floor here at CES is that a sustainable
amount of competitors all trying to do
the same thing or are we gonna see no
we're gonna see a whittling down or a
buying up or how is that going to
consolidate from your point of view I
think there will be people who are good
at each different piece you know there
will be the one that is like really
killer raw materials really
high-resolution the one that is you know
the inexpensive but they'll also be the
ones that have great support essentially
like the people who really understand
how to build a community and how to
reach beyond a hundred thousand people
to the hundred thousands of a month and
that's really who's going to be there to
teach people the skills that they need
and so there will be 3d printing
companies that do that really well and
so will see a combining and I'm I'm
seeing you know it's probably big enough
to support maybe 10 really big players
but it'll be you know it'll consolidate
to who's good at what yeah cause you as
you mentioned you know the lot of
there's hundreds I reckon it could be
two or three hundred variants of the the
fdm type of technology is so it does put
you guys in a pretty good position to
not be directly competing with the same
the same process I mean you guys all we
have unique different kind of outside of
the 3d printing perspectives on it I
mean you you you have two challenges you
have to kind of grow the market and
create you know on ramps for people to
learn how to use it but the the market
is still finite so if someone using an
FTM prints are well enough they they may
not spend time with your technology so
while we are why our technology is
different we still have some of the same
people that we we address and we serve
we're lucky in some cases that many of
these people have made multiple machines
and they they definitely want a mill if
they have an FTM printer and they would
love to play around with paper or resin
so that that plays in our favor but
right now until like you get mass
adoption like you have computers and
front and paper printers TD 2d paper
printer so yeah and then what are the
next challenges for your product I mean
we work for I know I've been hearing a
lot about materials materials materials
is that is it is it about Biggers and
about cheaper is it about finding the
next material that people want to play
with Daniella sure I think for us it's
about learning the needs of a more
general population like we want to go
after people who are making crafts on
Etsy or people who are making crafts at
home that want to turn it into a
business how do we help them take what
they're already doing and do it with our
machine basically it takes someone who's
doing something by hand and give them a
way of automating part of the process so
that's our challenge is accessing this
large group of people who's never done
anything with a computer-controlled
machine before but now they can I'm for
us I mean like any company we're all I
assumed we're all working on new
technology we do see us as an R&amp;amp;D
company and so even though we sell them
it's really printer we see us as a decor
as
in our day companies so we're constantly
innovating filing patents I'm just like
you mentioned you know looking at
different materials looking at smaller
machines faster machines but you know
there's always a challenge I think
people think that you know you might as
well close the patent office because
there's no more innovation or nod and
treat your printing but the challenge is
that everybody is working on something
you and anybody can have a good idea
like anybody watching this a kid at home
among looking after the kids it just
needs an idea I'm with these
technologies you can actually innovate
you I do really quickly have a proof of
concept and go to market so I'm
surprised Connor 44 m core that there
isn't I'm for a product like paper it
seems like would be like a really safe
planet to have like a more like low end
consumer like yeah device to for kids to
play around with or not maybe kids but
for people to play around with yeah well
I could tell you what I'd have to kill
you looking no but we we realize that
too I mean there is a we get a lot of
requests by making a smaller kind of a
home use printer and then we also get on
the other side for making very large
printers for printing like not just
letter size but like office that sighs
yeah so we can kind of go either
direction and so it's exciting direction
for us but you know what where we're
going to go next and so you know just
watch the space and 44 formlabs so with
us I think if you you listen you hear
like make it cheaper make it bigger make
it faster but if you if you listen more
it's about an experience it's about the
support that Daniel mentioned the
fidelity of the print the possibility of
the different types of residents so we
try and hold all those things as a
symphony and and deliver like this
experience that feels like no one can
get anywhere else and that's sort of why
if you kind of look you'll see a you'll
see a machine upgrade happened or you'll
see a materials upgrade happen or you'll
see a software upgrade happen so for us
right now we're playing with all these
parts of the ecosystem to create the
best experience you can possibly get
into space our whole yeah guys I think I
think that's going to be our time thank
you for joining me thanks so much for
joining us today for this panel lots of
more cool stuff and people and gadgets
and guests coming our way at the cns
stage up next we have a gps pet tag that
does much more than fine lost pets
