someone's in the kitchen with Sharon and
her favorite cooking apps HTC gets a
status update with its new Facebook
phone how to transfer photos from
Facebook to Google+ and get ready to
rack up some high scores with this iPad
arcade cabinet it's all coming up right
now
hi everyone I'm Molly wood and welcome
to the CNET tech review where we collect
our hottest videos of the week and tell
you what's good and what's bad in the
world of tech plus offer some unique
tech wisdom in the form of the bottom
line let's start with the good first up
today we've got something for all the
foodies out there there is no shortage
of great recipes and cooking tips
available on the Internet and there are
plenty of great apps for the iPad that
helped bring that knowledge into the
kitchen here's Sharon Vaknin with a few
of her favorites hey everyone welcome to
tap that up I'm Sharon Vaknin and today
I'm hanging out in the chow Test Kitchen
to talk about three apps that all you
home chefs seasoned or aspiring will
love they're all available on the iPad
which is a perfect kitchen companion
with its large screen and gorgeous apps
like the photo cookbook launch it and
you'll know exactly what I'm talking
about this five-dollar app gives you
step-by-step photo instructions of about
80 gourmet but basic recipes it's a
great way to get comfortable in the
kitchen since not only are the
instructions easy to follow but you also
learn about ingredients in the process
tapping on an ingredient in a recipe
will give you its description ways to
prepare it and other related items if
you decide that you want to email
yourself the ingredients photo cookbook
lets you do that with just a few taps
when you're ready to expand your
culinary knowledge you can by up to 180
more Asian Italian and baking recipes in
the app now if that's too fancy for you
check out the all recipes app all
recipes is actually an online community
where people like you and me submit
their own recipes and let me tell you
from experience there are some amazing
ideas on there so with this app you can
access the entire collection on your
iPad in a pretty interface do a search
for a dish you want to make browse by
filters like course or ingredient or
check out the handpick featured recipes
each recipe is accompanied by reviews
nutritional information and the option
to change the serving size to make more
or less of the
dish Allrecipes is probably my favorite
place to find original recipes besides
chow of course but even with all these
recipes at hand you'll need to build
your culinary knowledge it will replace
culinary school but smart chef suite
will help you out with conversions
substitutions and definitions while
you're cooking for instance if a recipe
calls for breadcrumbs but I have none of
that in my kitchen the nice little owl
will tell me that I can use cracker
crumbs matzo meal or ground oats instead
you can also convert things like pints
to cups and get vocabulary lessons from
the definition section like what the
heck is ajinomoto all right well good
thing we checked because it's Japanese
for msg so pick your recipes master your
kitchen skills and satisfy your hunger
with these three apps for more episodes
of top that off check out Sina TV and
tell us what your favorite apps are on
our Facebook page I'm Sharon Vaknin
happy cooking I suppose if you do plan
to use the iPad while you're cooking it
might be worth investing in a case
hopefully one that can go in the
dishwasher and when dinner time is over
and the dishes are all done might I
suggest you retire to the arcade for
some casual retro gaming you can do just
that with this new iPad accessory from
ion audio I'm Dan Ackerman and we are
here taking a look at the ion audio eye
cave the iCade actually started life as
an April Fool's gag from ThinkGeek
the big online gadget another weird
stuff store they just did a mock up and
said hey wouldn't be cool if you can get
a little arcade cabinet for your iPad
people liked the idea so much think he
actually went out and found a company
ion to make it for him so now you can
actually buy the iCade for 99 bucks what
you get for your 99 bucks is basically a
particle board mini arcade cabinet you
have to screw it together yourself
connected to a Bluetooth joystick and
button set so you put a couple of
double-a batteries in here seek and find
a bluetooth to your iPad then you take
your iPad and you just flip open the top
and you drop the iPad right in here it
doesn't actually connect to the cradle
or anything it just
sits in it so you don't want to move
this around otherwise you'll jostle
everything and then you launch the Atari
Greatest Hits iOS game that is the only
game that currently works with the eye
cave however it does give you a hundred
different classic Atari arcade and
console games for about 15 bucks that's
a pretty good deal especially if you're
interested in that kind of classic
gaming one should do that you pick the
game you want to play a lot of these
classic games were actually meant to
work with track balls or other kinds of
controls not joysticks some of its a
little bit awkward but a lot of them
work really well you can have to go
through the hundred games and find the
ones that work best for you for a
hundred bucks the iCade is basically an
expensive novelty it's a desktop toy but
it's a very cool-looking one especially
into vintage gaming the company that
makes this has released an SDK or a
software development kit that will allow
people who make other ios games to make
an eye cade compatible version of that
game we have not seen that yet but if
people started doing that the iCade is
going to be a lot more useful I'm gonna
quit and that is the ion audio iCade the
best part you don't even need any
quarters unless you want to put one up
to claim the next game given how
ubiquitous Facebook has become it was
only a matter of time before we saw a
dedicated Facebook phone and that time
has come courtesy of HTC let's see how
much Bonnie cha likes it
hey everyone I'm Bonnie toss senior
editor at cnet.com and we are here in
New York at a special event with ATT
showing off the HCG status this is the
Facebook optimized phone when it has
here is a dedicated Facebook button so
you can press it to post a status update
share news story as well as any music
you're listening to you can also share
photos by pressing this button here
short press will take you to the screen
where you can post status update if you
do a long press it will allow you to
check in to location so you can share
with everyone else on your Facebook wall
otherwise it's running Android 2.3
Gingerbread has a two point six inch
screen it's HP d8 quality a little small
but you know for the intended audience I
think it's OK on back you've got a five
megapixel camera and on front there's
also a VGA camera so you can do video
call another Facebook feature it has a
chat client so you can instant message
with your friends also got a full QWERTY
keyboard buttons are good size and
they're raised above the surface so
they're easy to press it'll be available
starting July 17 for a very affordable
49.99 with a two year contract so I
think it's gonna do really well with the
younger crowd who loves to social
network especially Facebook so looking
forward to trying it out and I'm Ronnie
Tom this has been your first look at the
HTC that is for a TV
of course if you're already over
Facebook and you've made the commitment
to Google+ that's not gonna be the phone
for you but before you forget about
Facebook completely sharon's here again
to help you gather up your things and
leave unless you've been using a service
like Picasa or Flickr to store your
photos I bet that most of your pictures
are on Facebook it makes sense since you
want to put photos where your friends
can see them but if you're switching to
Google+ or using both networks you
should share your pictures on there too
I'm Sharon Vaknin for cnet.com here to
show you how to move your photos from
Facebook to Google+ basically what we
need to do is download your Facebook
album so that you can easily re-upload
them to Google Plus lots of free online
tools let you do this but I have a
couple favorites as always your best bet
is to use Facebook's built-in data
downloader because it's a guaranteed
safe and proprietary tool the only
annoying part about getting your photos
this way is that it takes a few hours to
a day for Facebook to email you the
download link go to your account
settings then hit download your
information once the download is ready
you'll get a zip folder of your facebook
info like messages and wall posts and
all your photos organized into folders
by album but if you're more of a one at
now kind of person checkout pick and zip
it's a free web app that lets you
download albums plus any photos that
you've been tagged in just go to pick
and zip com log in with Facebook head to
download and select download all photos
if you have a ton of pictures this might
take a while I had about 3500 and it
took five minutes the download will come
as a zipped folder which you should
decompress usually by double clicking it
on a Mac or selecting extract all files
and windows you'll see in albums folder
with all your albums and a tagged folder
with all the photos you've been tagged
in once you have your Facebook photos on
your computer it's time to head to
Google+ go to view profile then photos
and upload new photos here you can
create one album at a time you can't
upload all your album
at once click select photos from
computer find an album you want to
upload select the photos in that folder
and hit open once the photos are
uploaded give the album a name and hit
create album here you can add a comment
about the album which will show up in
your stream and decide which circles you
want to share it with if you want it to
be private just enter your own name or
email address share it and the album
will show up in the streams of the
people you shared it with and in the
photos tab on your profile you can
always change the album privacy options
by going to photos then view all your
albums
click the album you want to edit and
change the visible to option and here's
an extra tip unlike Facebook Google+ has
a built-in photo editor click on a photo
and select actions you can rotate the
photo or click Edit photo for coloring
effects like cross processing or black
and white in this view you can also tag
people in your photos by selecting add
tag and entering the person's name or
email address if they're not on Google+
yet so go ahead and move your photo
memories to Google+ especially if you
think you'll be spending more time there
than Facebook and feel free to leave
behind any baggage you're ready to
retire for more how-to visit how to
cnet.com and feel free to ask me any
questions on my Facebook page for CNET
I'm Sharon Vaknin and I'll see you on
the interwebs
consider this your opportunity to do
some spring cleaning as well I know
everyone has some snapshots that have
been posted to Facebook that have no
business being there myself included
thanks for putting up the old high
school pic buddies haha in fact let's
take a break so I can go delete those
photos right now but don't go too far
we've still got a lot more tech review
right after this
welcome back to the CNET tech review our
weekly video digest of all things good
and bad we've seen here at CNET TV
continuing on in the good many of us
have come to depend on GPS navigation to
get us where we're going which is great
as long as it doesn't steer you directly
into a traffic jam
that's where live traffic monitoring
comes in and where the latest version of
the TomTom GO really shines even if
you're headed to a familiar place in a
very familiar city a GPS device with
traffic data can still be useful for
dodging traffic jams TomTom has a new
trick up its sleeve that aims to deliver
more accurate traffic straight to your
dashboard I'm Antoine Goodwood cnet.com
let's take a first look at the TomTom GO
25-35 M live the go 25 35 M live text
many of the same features that we saw
earlier this year and tom-toms go
24:05 including a glass capacitive
touchscreen this time it's a five inch
unit as opposed to a 4.3 inch one and an
asymmetric lead design metallic chassis
that snaps into its cradle with the
power of magnetism interestingly the Go
2535 power cable features a detachable
12-volt to USB adapter so you won't get
a separate USB sync cable in the Box
this time on the bright side to go 2535
live gains the ability to use its
traffic and live services without the
power cable being connected because tom
toms moved the data receiver into the
unit's main body as opposed to housing
it in the cord like on previous models
you'll be able to get the latest weather
conditions and forecasts find the lowest
fuel prices nearby search for points of
interest with Google local search avoid
speed and safety cameras if you're a
little paranoid and get live traffic
updates now that last bits worth
dwelling on because this isn't just
regular RDS traffic but it's TomTom the
latest generation of HD traffic TomTom
claims this HD traffic service updates
more frequently more accurately and on
more roads than standard municipal
traffic services Tom's Tom's live
connected services are free for the
first year of ownership the Go 2535 live
also features tom toms new interface
which was updated or
in 2011 which takes advantage of the
capacitive touchscreen for things like
pinch and zoom on the map and swipe the
scroll of the menu there also fewer menu
levels than previous TomTom generations
with the main functions of navigate to
view map and plan route sitting at top
level on the main screen oh and by the
way the M Ingo 2535 M live means this
baby will get free map updates for as
long as you own it I'm gonna go chase
down some traffic jams to see how
accurate the Go 2535 live HD traffic
service actually is and how much time it
can save me
I've been Antoine Goodwin to find out
what I think look for the full review of
the TomTom GO
25:35 M live on cnet.com I can
definitely use one of those to help get
around town whatever there's a Giants
game going on down the street also I
wonder how TomTom would handle
Carmageddon in LA this weekend be strong
people let's see what's up this week in
the bag now if you're going to take the
time to wire your living room or your
home theater for surround sound I'd hope
you would also take the time to choose a
speaker system that not only sounds good
but at least looks halfway decent too in
which case I would hope you skip this
new set from Cluj hey I'm Matthew
Muscovy a cat cnet.com and this is the
Klipsch HD theater 500 this is a 5.1
speaker system and it can be found
online for less than $500 the system is
made up of four small satellite speakers
a center channel and a 100 watt
subwoofer the speaker cabinets are
plastic and the grilles on the front are
removable revealing a point seven five
inch tweeter and a 2.5 inch woofer wall
mounts are included for the satellites
and they offer the ability to angle the
speakers at up to a 20 degree angle
either left or right the subwoofer is
average size for a system like this and
there's an 8 inch driver on the bottom
while the clip system looks pretty
stylish we were disappointed by the
cheap speaker connectors on the back
they have a spring clip design that only
accepts bear speaker wire and they don't
make as much of a secure connection as
we
like and while this is a budget speaker
system many competitors have better
connectors on the back the most
important aspect of any speaker system
is its sound quality and while the clip
sounds a whole lot better than many of
the sound bars and home theater in a box
systems we test it didn't sound quite as
good stacked up against other budget
speaker systems when we played action
movies like Black Hawk Down at high
volumes the small satellite started to
sound strain and not quite as powerful
as the competing energy take classic 5.1
system music wasn't much better either
and again it didn't fare well when we
tried to get loud however if you tend to
listen at relatively low volumes or you
watch less sonically demanding movies
the clips can't sound quite good as long
as you don't push it too hard altogether
while the Klipsch HD theater 500 is a
competent budget surround sound system
we prefer a lot of its competitors at
this price range the energy take class
system offers better sound quality at
around the same size and if you can put
up at larger speakers the Piner SP PK 21
BS delivers unbeatable sound for the
money if you find the Klipsch HD theater
at a heavy discount it's not a bad
system but we generally prefer the
alternatives I'm Matthew moscovia and
this is the Klipsch HD theater 500 $500
is not a lot to pay for a 5.1 surround
sound system but if it looks like it was
made for $50 I'm not sure it's really
such a good bargain I promise you'll get
more bang for your buck in this week's
bottom line from Android to webOS and of
course iOS we're up to our necks with
tablets around here these days which is
all the more reason to revisit our top
tablet picks in this week's top 5
countdown
hello gang last time I brought you a
list of top five tablets a lot of it was
well GUI that's because many of the
contenders for the iPads crown were
still yet to go on the market and
undergo the withering tests our lab and
your opinion well that's all changed now
and the henchmen are lined up I'm Bryan
Cooley with the top five tablets iPad
and otherwise let's go shopping
number five is the t-mobile G slate we
like that it has 4G support and Android
Honeycomb all rammed into one device and
pre-installed streaming TV apps that
work quite nicely but then there's this
built-in 3d camcorder thing which uses
those cheapy red and blue glasses
seriously
now the 3d on this thing is just a
gimmick don't get mislead beyond that
this is also kind of a pricey device 800
bucks
unless you do a two-year hitch with a
carrier who's likely going to be gobbled
up by another carrier halfway through
that hitch it's just kind of messy
number four is the BlackBerry PlayBook a
lot of folks are out there in the
audience right now playing the funeral
dirge as I mentioned this one but the
PlayBook is actually kind of hot it's
fast powerful flash enabled HDMI
equipped a multitasking wonder but the
seven inch sized crams all that power on
too small a stage and it's to time to
the BlackBerry platform at a time when
many folks are going a different
direction number three is the improbably
named a sous a Pad Transformer it
actually does transform is it a
honeycomb tablet or in that book yes you
see you can dock it into a keyboard
docking station that answer is one of
the biggest frustrations we all have
with tablets that there's no way they're
really tight they're always hunting and
pecking on that touchscreen now it's
pretty hefty kind of wide kind of fit
kind of heavy yeah and that's without
the dock but the price is pretty good
$400 list for a 16 gigabyte model and
the keyboard dock is a reasonable 150
more number two is one of the very first
serious iPad 2 challengers the Samsung
Galaxy Tab 10.1 this is the big boy in
their line super thin
runs the hot honeycomb OS front and rear
cameras and alarmingly powerful speakers
now while we love its meth addict thin
lines we didn't like how Samsung got
there the back feels cheap and plasticky
and likely to break if you drop it even
once not exactly Apple build quality but
if you're looking for something that
isn't Apple this is our go-to choice
right now okay before I bring you to our
number one tablet let me remind you of
what may be the best value in a tablet
it's the Barnes and Noble Nook Color
that's right it's ostensibly an e-reader
with a little bit of technical acumen
you can do what's called routing of this
device and fully expose the Android
operating system that lies within that's
not a lot of sweat to break to get
yourself a real good Android tablet for
250 or less we've got a link to the
step-by-step directions to route one of
these devices in our show notes at top-5
dot cnet.com think about it okay if
you're really bad at things like process
of elimination games I will tell you the
number one tablet it's the Apple iPad 2
it's thin it's got dual cameras now
dual-core processor that FaceTime video
chat and two carrier choices for your 3G
models that slick cover still looks like
a day a magic trick and it has a huge
and well vetted store of apps that said
it's screen resolution and ratio is
still stuck back in iPad one territory
the photo quality is inexplicably lousy
and there's no support for flash but
you'll have days of battery life to
ponder those few shortcomings and to be
part of the vast majority who think a
tablet is an iPad okay before you go buy
any tablet these five or some other
makes you check out our reviews our
latest reviews at cnet.com because the
tablet category is hot and new models
are coming out fast and furious right
now for more top fives like this go to
top 5 dot cnet.com i'm brian coulis

one coming from a mile away but good on
a Seuss for making it on the list
