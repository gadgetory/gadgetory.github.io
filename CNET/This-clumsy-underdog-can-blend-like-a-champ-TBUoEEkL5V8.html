here today with the Oster versa blender
for 150 dollars you get this 64 ounce
BPA free plastic jar the lid that seals
a feeder cap the bottom blade detaches
you also get a food processor attachment
with its own lid you get two 20 ounce
to-go cups with blades forum and a
separate lid you get another blade for
the food processor a shredder for the
food processor whatever the heck this is
a tiny top hat and maybe an attachment
thingy everything you need to blend as
much as you want and possibly fill up
all of the counter space in your entire
kitchen once you figure out how to put
all these pieces together and actually
get to blending the performance is
pretty good it's a hundred and fifty
dollar machine and it was able to do
stress tests basic tests all of that on
the level with $400 $500 Vitamix
machines Blendtec machines ninja
machines the performance actually makes
it look like a pretty smart budget
blender it nailed smoothies it was able
to crush ice with this food processor
attachment we were able to get some of
the prettiest sliced cheese of all of
our cheese tests even when we dropped an
entire eight ounce block of cheese in
the here it took care of it this thing
even turned whole almonds into almond
butter some of the more high-powered
machines were able to do that in 8 9 10
minutes this thing only took 13 that
said it really is a pain to use and the
pieces don't always fit together well
even with the main jar which is arguably
the easiest sometimes the spindle on the
base won't sit properly on the bottom
and it'll end up with this loud
screeching sound while it tries to make
a fit while you're trying to play for
the price the Osler versa can keep up
with the high-end brands but you're
sacrificing a little bit of build
quality this thing is nice and flimsy
you're sacrificing usability as it's
very very tricky to put all the pieces
together so make sure you have
that instruction manual on hand when
you're trying out a new attachment but
overall you're gonna have to decide if
that's worth it to you if you're willing
to put up with a couple of headaches to
save a couple of hundred dollars one
hundred and fifty dollar OSA versa might
just be for you
christina with the conglomeration of
pieces that is the Osler versa
