cars keeping your eyes on the road is
proving harder to do a new device aims
to help the Garmin head-up display or
HUD projects navigation information onto
car windshields in the drivers
line-of-sight it is a technology that
you may have seen in like fighter planes
and movies and on certain sports cars
and basically what it is is in remote
display for a GPS application that runs
on your phone that's worth repeating the
hundred and fifty dollar device is
strictly a display so users must buy a
separate GPS app from Garmin that'll add
at least fifty dollars to your total tab
a few car makers including BMW and GM
offer optional head-up displays for
dashboard data ranging from speed to
cruise control information but for now
Garmin is the only aftermarket model
available to set up the device there are
two options you can either clip a
plastic shield on to view the head-up
display or you can install the the film
on the vehicle's windshield that's the
tricky part is getting that film lined
up because it's semi permanent Garmin
doesn't sell extra films yet
so make your first shot count the
display offers directional arrows
distance to your next turn your speed
and even lane guidance but unlike many
GPS devices there's no detailed map the
good news is the information is easy on
the eyes
it's got a light sensor on the back of
it so it's automatically monitoring the
ambient light around you so during the
daytime it really brightens up so that
you can see it in direct sunlight and at
nighttime it dims so that it's not
dazzling you while you drive and you
keep a little bit of your night vision
that way it's a novel way to navigate
around but it may not appeal to everyone
every three months it seems we get a new
form of GPS a new device supposedly
risk-free every driver needs to take
that decision and make a personal choice
because different devices are going to
be easier for different people you need
to choose the device that's going to
pose less distraction for you another
tip no matter what kind of map you use
be sure to plan your route before you
start your car
in other words safety first in San
