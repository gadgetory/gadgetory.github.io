Dreyfuss and welcome to rumor has it the
show where we round up the week's
biggest tech rumor and then we vote on
what sounds legit and what seems like it
will never ever happen and remember that
you can vote on all the rumors too so
keep your eyes out for the pull in the
interactive player if you're watching on
cnet first up the Chinese newspaper
commercial Times is reporting that a
bigger iPhone is coming a four point
eight inch iphone possibly codenamed
iPhone math and that's where the rumor
breaks down yet in fact this is such a
sketchy rumor that digit times retracted
its article on it when something is too
unreliable four digit times that's when
you know it's bad but it was fun while
it lasted and the idea that Apple will
make a bigger iPhone to compete with the
galaxy s3 and the note and the upcoming
Galaxy s4 and all the huge phones that
people have gotten used to make sense
absolutely it really does and it doesn't
seem unreasonable that they do it
considering Apple did come out with the
ipad mini so it has proven its
willingness to adjust size to meet
demand but our producer Sarah has some
demands of her own like she wants a
smaller iPhone to fit in her pocket next
up rumors are heating up that YouTube
wants a stake in music video site vivo
YouTube was supposedly courting VEVO
last May and is now reportedly ready to
make an investment according to all
things d citing people familiar with the
deal if that happens it'll be the second
time in a year that Google has invested
directly in a video company that relies
on youtube for a distribution I only
have one question about this rumor will
it affect my ability to watch beyonc√©
lip synching the national anthem no now
let's check in on the rumors that Dell
is hoping to become a private company
again the latest report is that
Microsoft may invest up to 3 billion
dollars in a dell buyout according to
CNBC reporter david faber who says he
has sources familiar with the matter
there have been reports that Steve
Ballmer and Michael Dell the dell CEO
have become bffs lately yes and it makes
sense for a software company to want to
have a stake in a manufacturing company
that is integral to getting its software
out into the world if true it seems like
a desperate move by Microsoft to save
dell in order to keep the PC alive just
a little longer and 3 billion dollars is
kind of a
drop in the bucket for Microsoft so keep
your eye on this rumor folks the stock
market sure is and now for my favorite
kind of rumor of all the PlayStation
form might be announced in a few months
since Sony's vice president of home
entertainment hero she Sakamoto in an
interview with the Chilean website
Sakamoto said that's still a big secret
but our friends are preparing a Sony
Playstation I can only say that we're
focused on the e3 gaming event scheduled
for June an announcement may be made in
that minute or even earlier in May
Patrick sebold senior director of
corporate communications for Sony
Computer Entertainment told CNET last
year that Sony's products have double
the lifespan of most consoles about 10
years as long as they remain
commercially viable and the ps3 is
definitely still commercially viable but
maybe Sony is feeling some of the heat
from recent Xbox 720 rumors also it's
worth noting that even if the ps4 is
announced in the spring it might not be
released until 2014 the ps3 was
announced at e3 in 2005 but it wasn't
released until 2006 hearing all this
makes me think it's coming out in 2014 I
agree I've actually always thought the
ps4 was coming out in 2014 and this
wouldn't preclude that from happening
what do you guys think think it'll come
out this year next year even further in
the future vote in our poll while we
check in on the cnet council the cnet
council is composed of five editors who
cast their votes anonymously their
opinions are not an endorsement by cnet
or CBS Interactive obviously because
these are rumors folks and the cnet
councils verdict is a nearly unanimous
yes they do believe that the ps4 will be
announced at e3 in 2013 except for one
pesky pessimist who said no an anonymous
editor suggests a more nuanced take
saying that it will be announced but
with very few details whereas the xbox
will be announced with a firm release
date and pricing it's hard to argue with
that that's our show everybody please
share your rumors at rumor has it at
cnet com or call us at 1 800 750 cnet
and tweet us and tune in next week for
more tech rumors
oh say does that star-spangled banner
yet wave
wave or the land of the free
hands that huh haha
wave
