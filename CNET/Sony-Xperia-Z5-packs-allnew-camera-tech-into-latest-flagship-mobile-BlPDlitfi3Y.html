a bit but is there still room for
improvement sony says yes we're checking
out this is the Xperia z5 is the
company's brand new flagship phone so
let's talk a little bit about that
camera technology sony says there's an
all new sensor in this thing one with a
23 megapixel resolution is saying that
it's got the fastest autofocus ever seen
in a smartphone now why is faster
autofocus good well it means that the
phone is quicker to lock on to a subject
and get it nice and crisp and all in
focus and that means you spend less time
looking at blurry photos and more time
capturing the moment Sony's also touting
better low-light performance and it says
that this phone is going to be pretty
good at zooming in thats thanks to its
clear image zoom technology now they're
still not going to be as good as the
proper optical zoom that you would get
on a full-size camera but sony says that
with the big sensor in this camera and
with an awful lot of image processing
going on in the background you might be
able to get better zoomed in photos
let's briefly talk about the design so
as you can see sony hasn't really made
many changes from its previous flagship
phones it still has that squarish
industrial look one minor change though
is that it's got this nice frosted glass
effect on the back another welcome
addition is this fingerprint sensor here
on the lock button now this is a very
very small button type of fingerprint
sensor so we'll be interested to see in
the long-term how reliable this turns
out to be one final thing worth
mentioning is that this 5.2 inch full HD
smartphone is waterproof now I
personally think that that's one of the
coolest things about Sony's recent
mobiles so it's really good to see that
they're still sticking with that so
there's some very intriguing technology
on show here but we have seen finds in
the past that make big claims about
cameras but don't really deliver so
we'll be looking forward to really
testing it out in the full review let us
know what you think and stay tuned to
see Netcom</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
