ultimate in game controller
customization if you pay $100
what about 150 that's how much the Xbox
elite controller costs a hundred and
fifty dollars and yeah that's a lot but
the elite controller offers more
customization over anything I've ever
seen
first off this thing is dead sexy it's
got a real nice weight to it more so
than the existing Xbox one controller
it feels great in my hands not to
mention it's got a smooth rubberized
coating throughout and it's just a
really slick and smooth looking
controller okay so the customization
that's the focal point on the controller
the elite ships with three sets of
stainless-steel
analog sticks each bearing in height and
tip design you can even mix and match
each to your heart's content there's
also two types of deep heads as well one
traditional plus shape and another
octagon looking thing that should help
hitting those directional diagonals best
of all everything's magnetic the deep
heads and sticks easily swap out with
one another even the triggers can be
modified each has a switch that lets you
alternate between full and hair-trigger
mode the latter of which stops you from
having to pull the trigger all the way
down then there's the interchangeable
backpedals
these are small little levers that allow
you to enter a command using just your
middle finger around back now you need
to program these with a free app for
Xbox one which lets you assign any
controller input to those back pedals
you can even remap the entire controller
to Microsoft says that developer design
control schemes will be available for
the elite all accessible through that
Xbox one app there's a switch on the
controller as well and that'll let you
go back and forth between two loaded
profiles I'm not a huge fan of those
back pedals I mostly played with them
removed but some players love them
because you can bind them to car
controls like the brake and gas or use
them as a quicker way to access
something like a grenade toss or melee I
just found myself hitting them a lot by
accident so I didn't use them
finally the elite controller will also
work
with Windows 10 and it'll even work
wirelessly if you buy a $25 adapter but
the question you've got to be asking is
is this worth $150 well that depends
right the elite cost more than twice the
amount of a regular controller and you
could argue it has more than twice the
amount of features but is it twice as
better probably not I'm not really sure
competitive players will likely love
this because of the endless amount of
customization and those twitch controls
we talked about now if that stuff
doesn't mean much to you then the elite
shouldn't be your go-to controller
bullet for $150 you are getting a
top-of-the-line fully customizable and
gorgeous controller that can work on PC
and Xbox one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
