fixture that's a security camera that's
basically built into an existing light
picture well this is the Cunha toucan a
standalone camera that retrofits to your
existing light fixtures
it has 720p HD resolution has a 116
degrees diagonal field of view it has
motion alerts and it has a 100 decibel
siren
built into the thing so instead of just
being a security camera it's actually a
security product like a whole security
system packed into one device and it was
especially easy to install that's
because it also comes with a smart light
socket that screws in and connects via
USB so you attach this USB cable to the
light socket and then you attach that to
the camera down below and hide it behind
the panel and it really takes no time at
all it's extremely easy and extremely
DIY
so something I really love about the
Kuna app is that you have dual control
you can pull up a live feed of whatever
your camera is seeing so this is my
toucan in my backyard and it's showing
me my backyard but I also have control
over the light fixture above it so if
I'm still at work and I realize I want
to flip on the light because it's
getting dark out I can just hit that
button turn light on and it'll do that
for me
it'll also record little mini clips in
the app so you can see what happened at
any given time so I can see my backyard
camera for 2 minutes and 30 seconds
there was motion probably when we were
outside just a little while ago at 3:12
p.m. so you can see exactly what
happened and when it happened and if you
click on it specifically you can then
watch that footage back so you're
actually getting to view what was going
on in the past so if you weren't home
and you weren't checking in on demand
you could actually see what's going on
in the live feed in the past the cool
thing about this too is that Kuna gives
you two hours of free footage so you can
look back for two hours for free without
paying anything if you want to have a
longer history to look back on the clips
you have to pay a fee it starts at five
bucks a month but I think the 2-hour
window is pretty solid and it does give
you enough time to see what happened in
the recent past
so because it's a discrete outdoor
security device because it's so easy to
install because it's USB powered instead
of dealing with batteries or a power
adapter I think the Kuna toucan is an
excellent outdoor security solution
