game not from $3,000 courtside seats but
from inside a virtual reality headset of
the Pacific next VR has partnered with
the NBA to broadcast select games and
virtual reality the goal is to make it
feel like you're actually at the game
it's not there yet but it's getting
closer the ball itself
Yatta we got a sneak peek of what it
takes to put on a live VR broadcast and
what's coming next to make the VR
experience feel more realistic those
cameras when they're turned on build a
map of the world around them so right
now these camera positions get you
really close to the action so if it's
happening in either you know at the end
of either court in the end zones where
you're there with those those stanchion
cameras and you can see you know layups
come up and sort of happen driving
towards you as a viewer next VR is
already testing out its next generation
camera which is smaller and has better
resolution allowing for more cameras in
more places we feel like we can optimize
the position on the stanchion because
the cameras can actually be embedded in
the padding right now you have three
degrees of freedom when you watch our
content that's y'all pitch roll so
you're sort of you can
around that will in the very near future
open up to allow you some amount of
physical movement for instance if a
referee is standing in front of that
center court camera you can look around
them just like you could if you're
sitting there
unlike other VR creators next VR does
not stitch the images together from an
array of cameras the technical term for
it is stereo orthogonal reproduction so
what happens is the cameras build a map
basically a mesh of the world around
them and that is transmitted all the way
down to the end users when you're
watching our content you're actually
inside a virtual world
that's a mesh copy of the actual arena
and then we projection map the video to
the walls of that mesh to complete the
illusion of it being real in a
production truck that's just outside the
arena a team is making sure everything
is synced they're switching the live
camera views adding 3d graphics and
stats and turning around highlights and
replays our game is produced from inside
virtual reality so if you're in our
truck you'll see in producers who
actually have headsets on or watching
the game in in VR and talking to our
talent our own commentators who are
calling the game in virtual reality
which by the way is a different
discipline than calling it for
television almost entirely different
because you actually tell people where
to look hey look down you know
and then give them spatial direction
about sort of the experience next Villar
claims the technology can sometimes fool
your brain into believing you were
really at the game we've had reporters
suggest that at some point in their
season this season they will have a hard
time remembering which games they
actually attended in person and which
games they they attended and VR which
means we're laying down memories in
people's minds is if they were there the
technology here is really impressive
it's still not as good as being there
live you're still missing that social
aspect of being at the game with others
and that will evolve in time but what we
have here right now is a peek into the
future it's really good and virtual
reality experiences are only going to
get better
