remember slingbox it's like the little
box that you can take with you anywhere
and stream your own TV to wherever you
are it's an awesome gift for college
kids who want to share their parents
cable subscriptions and it's also a big
hit with sports fans because if you're
on the road you can still watch the home
team play all right let's check it out
plus in a sea of set-top boxes that
bring you like a whole bunch of content
this one just brings you your TV at your
house from your DVR from your DVD player
it's pretty slick watch your TV anywhere
good old-fashioned bubble wrap not the
greenest packaging let's open our bubble
tape okay slingbox 500 now the big
change between the old slingbox and this
one is that this one streams in 1080p so
high def streaming which is pretty slick
oh look at this aren't you a funny
little shape it's like a pity or the way
see I'm not actually a fan of this I
understand that you want components to
maybe stand out a little bit or you're
tired of building black boxes but this
is a home theater component your it's
going to go on a shelf with a bunch of
other black boxes so why don't you make
it stackable
let's get to the specs the slingbox 500
has built in Wi-Fi the 1080p high def
streaming I mentioned earlier it can
connect to your DVR your cable set-top
box or your satellite receiver on the
back you'll find a USB port a network
port HDMI in and out component inputs
and composite inputs it's also
compatible with your DVD or blu-ray
player and mrs. handy video security
cameras it does not have a monthly fee
and like Apple TV you can use it to send
photos and music on your mobile device
to your television although you cannot
stream video it costs 299 dollars one
bummer even if your DVR has multiple
tuner slingbox still can deliver only
one output so if someone else's home and
watching the view you're going to have
to fight for viewing rights the mobile
apps cost $15 also kind of a bummer
they're available for iOS and Android I
got so distracted by the unusual shape
that I forgot to look what else is in
the box so because I know what comes
with a lot of cables I want to dig in
here we have our Quick Start Guide see
what we have in terms of cables
power that's an easy one do you come
with hdmi you do that's actually pretty
nice but it comes with an HDMI cable
you've got component and composite
cables also pretty nice so you pretty
much have everything you need plus your
remote control which even comes with
batteries nice touch over here some more
audio and optical cable re it looks like
this appears to be possibly an aux cable
maybe I'm wrong and then your network
cable soap this is a pretty impressive
little package you definitely have
everything in this box that you would
need to get up and running once you
download your $15 apps i will say that 2
99's a little expensive for slingbox
considering all the set-top boxes out
there that deliver content and all the
ways to get content on the go via apps
that said like I mentioned earlier any
college kid on your Christmas list gonna
love this guy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
