flagship home router foam Lynx is a wrt
in 1900
I see now judging from the side here is
more like an US aircraft carrier of a
home rarer is huge is a most powerful on
the market now if you notice that the
design here is kind of retro you're
right because with this new era here
Lynx is going to print back the old
glorious some ten years ago when is wrt
series router was one of the best on the
market the new bar here share the same
stackable desire of the OWR t series and
just to demonstrate that I have a second
image right here
and you can see that it's stay on top of
the first one perfectly let's say
they're gonna make switches like this so
it's very fast for you to extend your
network sport without having to worry
about space or heat problem now note
that they are not three but four
antennas right here that doesn't mean
this bar right here is the four by four
or four stream router is still a three
stream router but you know four antennas
are always better than through on the
inside the wrt 1980 come with a
dual-core 1.2 gigahertz processor 256
megabytes of ddr3 system memory 128
gigabyte of flash storage that are the
most powerful components you can find a
home router for now if the true dual
band router so we work on both the
fogging hood bands and 2.4 gigahertz
band at the same time on the first band
it can offer up to 1.3 gigabit per
second Wi-Fi of speed and on the second
band up to 600 megabits per second now
you need comparable client to have the
top speed but this router here support
all existing Wi-Fi clients on a market
regardless of their standards that mean
is good for now and it's also good for
the future on the back here there are
four Gigabit LAN port and one gigabit
one or Internet port but also one used
to be 3.0 port
here and this part over here is very
special you can work as either a USB 2.0
or and he set a port you can use these
port to host store devices and when you
do this rather he can also work as a
network attached storage server or in a
server and in my testing this router
here offered by far the fastest Nass
performance have' seen in a router up to
75 megabyte per second for writing and
more than 100 megabyte per second for
reading now actually faster than many
high-end dedicated Nasr pretty amazing
on the phone it come with an usual but
fancy array of liners show the status of
the router I love this light but if you
don't you can always turn them off using
the routers web interface and the web
interface is very similar to that of
Linksys recent routers it comes with a
very cool customer ID positive control
feature there's a fancy network map and
a handy suite test of the Internet and a
few other cool features oh now you can
even name the guest networks to your
liking which wasn't possible with the
previous model then of course other
common features such as dynamic DNS
pressure control port forwarding the
support for ipv6 and so on and finally
you also have the option to use a link
see smart Wi-Fi account so that you can
easily manage your home network when
you're away even on a mobile device now
in my testing the new links is he had
kicked some serious butt it has the
longest reigns ever seen a foot
excellent Wi-Fi speed and also very
stable and despite all the powerful
component on the inside it ran cool too
in fact it never became hard enough to
trigger this small cooling fan right
here now you know this is almost perfect
rather for any home and the main reason
why is not perfect it's because of the
price is somewhere between two and fifty
dollars and three hundred dollars if you
can afford that
well these other shortcomings a very
minor now from on this one here check
out my phone with Viacom basically is a
great router and told me what
with it's so great that if you can
afford to how two of them at the same
time like I do right now
for a moment there you feel like you
specimen which I feel all the time every
day constantly air like that very much
and that's because I'm don't know and it
has been the first look at the wrt in
1980 our public's yeah
I'm special all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
