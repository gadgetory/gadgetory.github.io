iPhone to get this new feature and the
other three products we're expecting
from Apple that after this week are
pretty much a sure thing we're back at
it again with another rumor roundup on
the apple core alright let's get the bad
news out of the way so we can focus on
the good stuff now rumor has it Apple
will add wireless fast charging powers
to its phones but only one of the three
new iPhones we're expecting could get
the super power
a recent China Times report picked up by
Forbes shows an x-ray of the phone in
question with a new type of coil that
would make this feature possible now the
report speculates that it's the larger
more expensive 10 plus with that 6.5
inch screen that would be getting this
feature and price aside it also mentions
that the larger body of the plus would
be better at handling that extra heat
generated by this wireless fast charging
coil but before we go down this road I'm
kind of tempted to call on this rumor
for starters when Apple added fast
charging to the iPhones last year all
three models got it the iPhone 8 8 plus
and 10 can all reach a full charge in
about an hour now sure they didn't
include the fast charger in the box
which was kinda messed up but I don't
think that they're gonna create that
kind of differentiation this time around
if anything my money is on the rumor
about Apple including the fast charger
in the box this year but we'll have to
wait and see I'm kind of an optimist and
we won't have to wait long last week I
asked you guys when you thought the next
Apple event would be and it seems like
September 12th was the consensus I did
like Logan m's theory about launching an
iPhone 9 and an iPhone 11 on the 11th of
September but most of you went with the
later date that means we have less than
three weeks to go before we meet these
phones and it's not just iPhones we're
expecting at this event all science
points to an Apple watch series 4 in the
pipeline and this week we got even more
proof of that Apple recently registered
six new product numbers with the
Eurasian Economic Commission as reported
by French
take on samac now according to the
Google Translate of this filings text
the model numbers refer to wearable
electronic devices that run watch OS 5
now this type of filing is what clued us
in to the MacBooks a few months back so
I suspect this one's pretty reliable but
the six numbers don't necessarily
translate into six different watches but
maybe different configurations of the
same one so the different size options
an LTE and non LTE version may be or
different materials aluminum ceramic or
stainless steel my wish list for the
series for in order of least likely to
most likely would be round watchface
which probably not going to get always
on display and better battery life which
kind of doesn't make sense if they
haven't always on display but they
definitely have to deliver on that
better battery life and what's most
likely is that the Apple watch will get
an iPhone 10 like makeover with slimmer
bezels on the screen to allow for more
screen real estate solid-state buttons
and sleep tracking and now for the good
stuff the MacBook Air and the Mac Mini
are coming back from the dead now don't
get me wrong the new iPhones and Apple
watches are exciting but we've been
waiting a lot longer for a refresh - one
of my favorite Apple products as you can
see right here the MacBook Air which is
why I'm not even sure I believe it yet a
Bloomberg report citing people familiar
with the plans this Apple will release a
new low-cost laptop and an upgrade to
the Mac Mini Desktop focused on pro
users later this year which probably
means they'll announce them not at the
September event but more like an update
like what they did with the MacBook Pros
or maybe in an October event alongside
new iPad pros the report says the
13-inch air will have slimmer bezels
with a Retina display which is what
everybody wanted and a similar price
point of $1000 now the Mac Mini would
get new storage options and better
processor but the report does say that
these upgrades could raise the $500
price tag on the device
alright guys so there you have it that's
a pretty good lineup to expect from
Apple this year if the rumors happen to
be true but I want to know what you're
most excited about iPhone Apple watch
