engineer and youtuber and I'm gonna fly
a jet pack
the jetpack from The Rocketeer to Boba
Fett zooming around and a backpack sized
device is a dream many of us geeks share
you might recognise jetpack Aviation's
jb9 it's the jetpack company CEO David
Mehmed was wearing when he flew around
the Statue of Liberty back in 2015 now
the company thinks it's time for a
civilian to take flight we're here today
because Misha Pollack known vloger won a
contest as part of our start engine
crowdfunding campaign that we're
conducting to try to raise money to
build and finalize our parachute safety
systems we should won the contest and he
will be the first civilian pilot to
strap on our JB 10 jetpack and go for
his initial flight today the JB 10 has
actual turbines on each side of the
pilot making it a thrilling powerful and
potentially hot experience for a new
user why number one strategy is to
breathe I'd like to get in like the c+
rain you know the if I'm in the bees
I've knocked it out of the park my goal
is to not just be dangling there that's
kind of my goal I've been told it's very
hot and that you have to keep your feet
together but that's something you learn
over numerous flights obviously I might
not do that after some demonstration
flights by jetpack Aviation employees
with many hours of flight training
it was Misha stern to suit up I hope of
course always for safe operations and
that his feet don't get too hot and it
that he meant he possibly manages to
just stay in one position maybe three or
four feet off the ground and come up on
the power
Misha's flight was exactly what you
might expect from a person using a jet
pack for the first time a little bit
loose a little unsure and not too far
off the ground but the second time he
made some adjustments and completed an
admirable pair of initial tests place it
was great it was really wonderful I'm
happy I did it I'm the only negative
thing is now I really want to do it
again yeah I'm gonna give myself a
b-minus even though his feet got hot
enough that he had to dunk them in a
bucket of water oh that's nice
that exhaust for a hot you won't get any
heat on your your feet at all if you're
off the ground
exhaust gas disco smoke past you you
spent a lot of time on the ground then
of course exhaust gas hits the ground go
sideways into your boo so that's why he
dumped into the water overall jet packs
still have a long way to go before mass
adoption by the general public but more
immediate uses include military and
rescue applications the crowdfund
jetpack Aviation is currently running
hopes to raise money for an intelligent
parachute safety system and it's roadmap
also includes a future electric model I
don't know of anything more miraculous
than a jetpack and it's amazing it's
happening it's also amazing it's taken
us this long to get here it's still
really exciting to watch the jetpack
evolve and if I ever get the chance I'll
definitely take to the skies just like
all those heroes and villains we
remember from our childhoods I was about
eight years old I was in the backseat of
my dad's Packard and on the radio was
Buck Rogers and and and this radio
program he and his girlfriend came out
of their spaceship and flew down to this
planet in their jet packs and I thought
I really got to have one of those for
