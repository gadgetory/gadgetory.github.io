bear dynamic t51 I which cost $300 and
is one of the best on ear headphones
we've tested the big difference between
this model and the now-discontinued t51p
which we reviewed earlier is the
inclusion of a three button inline
remote and microphone that's designed to
work with Apple smartphones and tablets
and may not fully function with Android
or Windows devices the headphone doesn't
fold up but it does fold flat for easy
storage and included carrying case which
is nicely designed the ear cups are
padded with memory foam and they sit on
your ears snugly without applying too
much pressure and overall I thought the
headphones were quite comfortable
particularly for it on ear model some
people may find the metal design a
little cold but the headphones do seem
well-constructed
and come with a two-year warranty
impedance is rated at a highest 60 ohms
that the t51 I sounded great plugged
into both mobile devices and a headphone
amp at home the sound balance is
slightly warmer than neutral but detail
and resolution are excellent we thought
it sounded good with all genres of music
and for such a compact headphone its
bass is surprisingly robust it's not
overdone or thick but if you crave a
rich low-end the t-50 one I won't
disappoint you put it up against Bowers
&amp;amp; Wilkins similarly price P 5 series to
another comfortable and highly rated on
ear model and the t51p came out slightly
ahead both offer good clarity but the
t-50 awana is slightly more present and
immediate sounding in the end I came
away really liking the t51 I and so did
Steve Guttenberg contributed his
thoughts in our full text review of the
product it's pretty pricey at $300 but
if you're looking for a great sounding
on your headphone that's well-built and
comfortable I highly recommend it I'm
