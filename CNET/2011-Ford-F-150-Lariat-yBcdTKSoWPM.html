along with that comes a big target on
your back
Dodge and Chevy trucks are not slouches
let's drive the 2011 f150 lariat and
check the tap
Ford has doubled down on tech in recent
years but is that really a big deal in a
full-size truck or kind of forcing the
issue well they set us a lariat which is
mid to high trim with four-wheel drive
and an extended cab but also sync the
old-school version that we kind of miss
first thing you notice about getting the
f-150 since we don't review many trucks
is this is nice and roomy I mean I
cannot reach the door by you there is no
way without climbing up here into the
console or something you don't get
vehicles this big unless you're in a
full-size body on frame truck now we're
at a Highline vehicle here this is a
lariat edition it's about midway up the
f-150 line which is a really big family
nice elaborate really Lincoln looking
gauges I'd expect those more on a
higher-end vehicle than even a Ford lots
of ersatz wood trim all over here notice
the navigation head unit which is
optional but it's the old-school sync
right before they went to the my Ford
touch era of sync and things got real
complicated and weird the map quality
isn't the best and it's kind of crunchy
but you know what it sure is easy to use
this thing the buttons that pop up are
all real clear a combination of software
buttons here Hardware buttons for major
features of course this truck has sync
at this trim level that would mean
you've got the USB jack here the aux
right next to it of course you can plug
in a Zune if you still have one of those
antiquities or more importantly you can
plug in a thumb drive or your white ipod
or iphone cable but if I just upgraded
the audio system and didn't go for the
nav you can do a Sony system that gives
you 700 watts there's the amp sitting
down there under the rear seat 10
speakers around the cabin and you get a
six disc instead of a single slot and
we've got a backup camera as part of an
optional package on this vehicle as you
can see it doesn't show trajectory it
shows distance and you do have a digital
zoom here that kind of basically crops
into the image it's not really zooming
anything with a physical lens so it's a
limited use I think and the camera
quality is a little soft on this one I
only point that out because if you ever
need a backup camera it's in a vehicle
like this where you've got a bed and a
high tailgate in these f-150s
so there's a lot of stuff back there
that's going to be hiding like you know
a family of five is possible one choice
on the gearbox in the
guy you've got a 6-speed automatic with
his big manly shifter right here he got
a little shifting rocker on the side no
paddles in a vehicle like this and
notice all these off-road instruments
here I have again something unique to a
pickup truck we'll see how these work
when we're on the road but they show the
angle of the truck this way as well as
this way and give you some indication of
what your drivetrain is doing because we
have four-wheel drive here's the knob
for that it's electrically selectable
from two high to four high which you can
do on the fly and then for low of course
you got to be in neutral for that
now the interesting part of our f150 is
the way the engine bays equipped like
get up here and see it there it is
three and a half liter EcoBoost v6 that
means it's a turbo direct injection v6
real high-tech one they also have a low
tech v6 not too exciting and this gives
you the power of a v8 they claim with
the economy of a six well let's sort it
out 365 horsepower 420 foot-pounds of
torque while delivering 15 21 mpg
in this 4x4 big boy add one MPG on city
and highway to go 4x2 comparing that to
the v8 the five liter you'd normally
expect in an f-150 it looks like this
the EcoBoost motor has five more horses
and a crucial 40 more foot-pounds of
torque
while delivering a modest economy bump
of one to two mpg now notice I didn't
mention anything silly like zero to
sixty times and such that doesn't matter
much in a pickup compared to what does
payload and towing capacity looks like
this the v8 truck has a lower and
narrower range of towing weights than
the EcoBoost v6 truck while the max
payload on the two is identical you're
just not giving up anything with the
smaller engine except tradition
now one thing we don't get much chance
to talk about here in scenic car videos
or things like bed length and cab size
but in this case we do five and a half
six and a half or eight-foot boxes
available on the f-150 and then you can
couple that variably with three
different cabs the standard cab with
just the front row see it's pretty rare
these days unless you're driving a
service truck then you've got the
extended cab and the super crew we have
the one in the middle the extended cab
and by the way all of those are
available with this kind of slick power
back window it's a little small but it
serves the purpose gives you some nice
ventilation oh that's your buddies use
it as a trash receptacle for your TBR or
Marlboro empties underway the first
thing you notice especially since you're
aware of this thing as a v6 is how it is
the power come on and you just simply to
my feel anyway wouldn't notice that it's
without a v8
now I'm not towing anything I don't have
it loaded up so maybe it behaves
differently under those conditions but
as a driver with normal passengers and
maybe a few lightweight things in the
back it's a good feeling engine the ride
in these high trim f-series is really
compliant even though we're still
dealing with a old solid axle rear leaf
suspension I'm looking here at these
road gauges I'm going up a windy
hillside Road here and it's giving me
you know within a degree it's read on my
attitude and my angle here in terms of
in another impression I can leave you
with is if you're not a truck driver you
find out real fast these things are a
pain in the ass when you're driving in
you know in a town or in a city unless
you're out in Walmart land these are a
drag depart there are pain to get around
garages I know a lot of folks drive
these in urban settings they must have
the patience of a saint because I kind
of got over it pretty quick and of
course as always whenever we have a
truck in which isn't that often I'm a
little uh a little sad I didn't have
anything I needed a haul this week it's
always nice to have a truck and not have
to go pay eighty bucks a day
okay let's price our big boy at f150
lariat is thirty five five it's mid to
mid high in the trim range so you're
getting a lot of niceties as you saw
this is no cable installers truck now
some things you're going to add to that
tech wise 2500 for that navigation head
unit I would pass at that price and just
get a damn clamp for my Android phone
but that's your call
for 35 for the Sony audio that's a
worthy one a bear in mind you don't need
to add anything to get sync in this
vehicle it will come with it but with a
more basic sort of a blue dot matrix
display and of course no navigation or
hard drive now the big hardware the
stuff we don't normally talk about in
cars because they're kind of truck ish
include things like drivetrain an engine
you're going to pay more for less in
this car what I'm talking about is the
v6 the EcoBoost v6 is 750 more above the
base five liter v8
thirty to seventy to go 4x4 on this guy
and as I noted with the EcoBoost motor
you only give up one MPG city and
highway and a couple of truck only
configuration options to consider six
and a half or eight foot bed those are a
pick at the same price which is to say
they're included if you want the shorty
the five and a half bed that's actually
like 2500 more and you'll pay about that
much as well if you want to go for the
big cab if you want to go for the small
cab or this extended cab that's also a
pick at the same price</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
