you've probably wished you had eyes in
the back of your head the skull ep-1
aims to grant that wish it's a helmet
with a built-in head-up display for the
first time in human history are actually
able to look at a heads-up display
virtual image and see through it as well
as 180 degrees behind you into the sides
all in one quick glance of the eye
placed in the drivers field of vision on
the lower right the display offers a
rear view thanks to an embedded camera
it also provides GPS navigation think of
it as Google glass in a helmet to
minimize distraction the p1 will
incorporate voice recognition play music
and a remote control on the motorcycles
handlebar this rear fin is sort of the
core of our vertically integrated design
in that this rear fin not only does it
reduce wind buffeting which helps the
voice control work better but it also
houses the electronics as well as the
180 degree viewing angle rear view
camera the display has to work in all
sorts of conditions whether it's bright
sunlight like this or in the middle of
the night when it's pitch-black to
adjust for that
scully incorporated an ambient light
sensor the display could be a nuisance
to some but most users are likely to
grow accustomed to the new view quickly
CNET writer Seth Rosenblatt was the
first non scully employee to test drive
the tech but when you ride you were
often looking down to your left and your
right to see your side mirrors and see
what's behind you with the with the
heads-up display as I look down to my
right I could see what was behind me but
I didn't have to look at the mirror and
wonder what's on either side of what the
mirror was showing me because the helmet
was showing me directly what was behind
my head
scully helmets is on an aggressive
schedule it hopes for a 2014 launch
though the p1 is still a prototype among
the challenges Scully
must meet its goal of a nine hour
battery life you can't ask a
motorcyclist to interrupt their weekend
ride to plug in
and then there's the question of cost
are people gonna pay for a $3,000
motorcycle I mean I don't think so
so they clearly have to figure out where
what's cost-effective and but on the
other hand huge interest they can
probably they probably have a little bit
more leeway with price than they were
thinking after all it's hard to put a
price on safety in San Francisco I'm
