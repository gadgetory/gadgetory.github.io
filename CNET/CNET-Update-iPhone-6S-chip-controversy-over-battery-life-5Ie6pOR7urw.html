equal I'm Bridget Carey this is your
CNET update there's a bit of controversy
swirling around the new iPhone success
it's not a big problem but of course you
can't have an iPhone launch without a
little controversy Apple used two
different companies to make the a9
processor chip inside of the iPhone
success some have a processor made by
Samsung and others have one by TSMC
multiple reports online are saying that
TSMC chips give the iPhone better
battery life performance compared to
Samsung's chips Apple released a
statement that says it found the battery
life to vary just two to three percent
between models you can see which model
you have with an app called Lehrer
device info light and the hardware model
on the bottom gives you a number that
you can search online to see if it's
Samsung or tsmc we're testing both
models out and we're still in the middle
of a battery test but so far we're not
seeing any significant processing speed
differences but that's not the end of
the Apple drama if you think apps in
Apple's App Store are always safe think
again last month more than 20 malware
infected apps made their way into the
store but at that time you may not have
worried because most of the infected
apps were only popular with Chinese
users now Apple is pulling a different
batch of apps over privacy worries the
problem deals with some ad blocking apps
some are promising to block
advertisements shown inside of other
apps like ads on Facebook to do that
those apps were installing root
certificates and that allows an outside
party to spy on your private info and
monitor your activity Apple released a
statement that it removed these apps and
it's working with the developers to
release their apps without the security
risk Apple didn't say which apps were
pulled but we know of one popular ad
blocker called bin choice it said on
Twitter that it was pulled and it's
changing its app and even if you don't
care about iPhones don't worry I have
irritating news for everyone Netflix is
raising its standard streaming price to
$10 a month for subscribers in the US
Canada and Latin America it's just a
dollar more but it's the second price
hike in two years existing members will
not see the bill go up for another year
the new price kicks in on November 18th
for any new subscribers and speaking of
price hikes Verizon customers still
holding on to those unlimited data plans
are gonna see their bills go up by
twenty dollars after November 15th the
company stopped offering unlimited data
plans to new customers back in 2011 and
Verizon says less than one percent of
customers have been renewing their old
unlimited plans anyone on a contract
will not see the price change until
their contract expires a few days ago
Sprint also raised its unlimited rate by
$10 a month that's it for this tech news
update there's more at cnet.com from our
studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
