and smaller over the years and now they
finally whittled it down all the way to
the Roku streaming stick this is
actually the second streaming stick that
Roku's made but the new model is a huge
leap forward now that it works with any
TV that has an HDMI port and it's half
the price at just 50 dollars
hey I'm Matthew Muscovy ak4 CNET and if
you've been waiting for real cooz answer
to google's $35 chromecast this is it it
has the same compact form factor with
essentially all the hardware of a
full-size Roku box packed into a device
that's not much bigger than a USB flash
drive the plastic casing sports Roku
signature purple color which won't be on
display since it's designed to live
behind your TV in a spare HDMI port the
back of the TV placement would leave the
stick almost entirely concealed except
it needs power which it can get from a
USB port on your TV or by connecting the
included power adapter there's not much
else to the device safe for a microUSB
port a tiny indicator light and a small
button that you can use to reset the
stick if it freezes up in terms of
internal hardware it has dual band Wi-Fi
support as well as full 1080p output
now while the chromecast relies on your
smartphone or tablet for all its
navigation the streaming stick includes
an actual remote it's essentially the
same remote you'd get with Roku's other
budget streaming boxes although it works
for your Wi-Fi direct so it can
communicate with the stick when it's
hidden behind your TV Roku also lets you
control the stick using its mobile app
and the streaming stick supports some
casting functionality similar to the
chromecast for Netflix and YouTube so
with the streaming stick you get to
choose which kind of control scheme you
prefer the streaming stick is also
packed with apps there are over 1200
apps on Roku's platform and while many
of those are filler there's a lot of
great content including Netflix Amazon
Instant HBO Go Hulu Plus Pandora MLB TV
Amazon Cloud Player
buddhu and Showtime anytime even better
the streaming stick has cross-platform
search
so you can search for a movie or TV show
and it will show you all the services
that offer that content and how much it
costs
now everything sounds pretty great about
the streaming stick so far but it does
have a bit of an Achilles heel
and that's speed well it's fast enough
when you're navigating menus some apps
like Netflix and YouTube take forever to
load over 30 seconds of just looking at
the loading screen every other roku box
i've seen loads netflix in 12 seconds or
less so it really feels like a step
backwards when you're using the
streaming stick now once you load up the
app the speed is fine and it's worth
pointing out that the sluggishness
doesn't affect every app on the
streaming stick but Netflix and YouTube
are two of the most important apps so
the speed issues are more than just a
nuisance
so that's the major drawback with the
Roku streaming stick its huge library of
apps the included remote and
cross-platform search all make the
streaming stick worth the 15 dollars
over the chromecast and it's still an
impressive streamer at just 50 dollars
but the speed issues on Netflix and
YouTube mean the $100 Roku 3 is still
our favorite streaming device even at
twice the price I'm Matthew moscovia
from see net and this is the Roku
streaming stick</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
