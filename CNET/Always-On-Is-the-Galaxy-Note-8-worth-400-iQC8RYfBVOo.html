time to start our road test of the
Samsung Galaxy Note 8 we're in a luxury
RV what better place to enjoy some media
with a nice compact full tablet device
from a little jobby 8-inch tablet we
have the stylus i loaded mine up with
some movies like a movie and some TV my
kindle app just to kinda and as usual
with these road tests we're gonna try to
evaluate the design features and
usability what's your first impression
so it's not a one-handed tablet it's too
hard all look like this and it's just a
tiny bit too big to comfortably type
with two hands the plastic to me is a
real benefit I'm able to hold on to it
it really has a great first impression
when you pick it up and hold it I don't
understand the raised camera it seems
odd when you want to set it down I feel
like I'm always setting it on the most
sensitive part of the back I'm worried
about scratching the lens and hurting
the camera the stylus integration is
really slick and when you pull it out
you get both a tactile feedback and an
audio feedback that you've removed the
stylist I think that the pen although
it's nicely designed doesn't see that
you
I feel like the stylus is kind of
unnecessary there's nowhere to rest your
hand cuz if you rest your hand right
here you started doing welcome to the
world of being left-handed Molly some of
us have had to deal with that our entire
lives thank you Galaxy Note hagan
bridging the gap good apron
there's steps like TVs all over this
coach and this has that watch on now so
in theory I should be able to fire this
up and it music you can share video
between the tablet and the television
and the phone and that is super nice
I would like to watch that for remote
control setup is required which I
already tried I can't go watch on app to
work I can't get into control that TV
and it might be because so many other
things are trying to control the TV I'm
not saying this wouldn't be magic if it
worked this is annoying that it doesn't
is supposed to be bad and it requires a
Samsung Account and then once you set
that up I was supposed to get a
verification email that would let me
enter the code to keep using the watch
on app and I never got the email one of
my favorite things about the Galaxy Note
8 is that right out of the box it comes
loaded with some really cool apps I
really like the fact that Dropbox is
integrated you've got Flipboard which is
really nice another one of my favorite
features especially as an old-school pc
guy and somebody who's had to deal with
not having it on the ipad is that i can
use this just like a hard drive it's got
a nice little button that lets me go to
my files and then i'm looking at file
folders that i can just drag and drop
files in when i plug it into my computer
if i drop something into the video
folder the video player knows to look
there everything is quick easy and
painless I like that a lot this ought to
be a full-featured device because it's
running Android jelly bean although with
Samsung's TouchWiz interface on top it
is plenty fast I mean you're definitely
gonna get as much performance as you
need for surfing it does everything that
a full-fledged android phone would do
and then some stuff than tablet those
too so it's not lacking features
department at all
in terms of usability I mean the Galaxy
Note 8 is an Android device so anyone
who's been using Android should know how
to use it I wish that it were stock
Android the TouchWiz interface is very
good the problem is if you get used to
vanilla Android there are differences
about it that will annoy you and I makes
me kind of wish i had just plain
jellybean if that's what you're used to
I love playing video on this machine
especially since I can just pop the
video that I'm playing for into a
smaller window and keep browsing the
internet or checking my email with all
the video plays in a small window it
moves quick it's snappy it feels great
video quality is ok it's 1280 x 800
resolution which even though that's
better than the ipad mini it's still not
great whoo the calendar app is i love
the calendar app you can just swipe to
the left from the home screen and your
calendar is right there and it's so easy
to read and then if you want to edit it
you can either use the stylus or the
touch pad I love the like circling the
date that it actually is the trend that
color coding all shows up it makes me
look like really organized what the hell
so I actually had rented a movie that i
downloaded and I've been sitting here
trying to start them trying to watch him
so this one says expires in 30 days and
I got it like eight hours ago and but
when i try to play it it says the rental
period has expired this is totally a
waste of my time i paid for that oh my
god i hate that i don't know that i can
necessarily blame the tablet but google
services are not working oh you know we
should do what's that you should see
where we are so it's got obviously got
google maps on here but it also has its
own navigation app oh let's compare i'm
on the navigation a half okay i'm gonna
type maps oh i found we're on the
Barstow freeway I haven't put in las
vegas yet so let me do that vegas nevada
navigate getting driving directions oh
look at this very nice so I've got like
I love this is a screen size benefit
like I have the directions on one side
of an actual map on the other great
that's not bad let's see how far away we
are now only 65 miles away under an hour
left to get to Vegas Vegas baby Vegas
and then if I go show the map it goes
and now we're in to sort of turn by turn
navigation okay look
you're simply kind of better sound
effects provided by me making me jealous
I want my to do that so the no date we
had a pretty good time with it on the
road trip yeah it's a fun device I just
wish it wasn't so expensive I know
that's the problem because then if
something goes wrong like Google Play I
can't excuse it because it's four
hundred dollars even more than an ipad
mini that's just that the price is the
killer yeah at like to 69 or even 299 I
would say this would be a by no
questions asked cuz it's a lot of fun
there's a lot of fun little features but
it's 399 so for me it's a do not buy
yeah if money isn't an issue for you you
can find a lot of fun here but if it is
I have to agree yeah sorry</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
