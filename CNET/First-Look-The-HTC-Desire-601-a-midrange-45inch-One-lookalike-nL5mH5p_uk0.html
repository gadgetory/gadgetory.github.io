with the HTC 601 it's a mid-range
Android phone packin a 4.5 inch screen
LTE and stylings from some of its more
expensive siblings so looking at the
front of the phone is easy to see the
family resemblance we've got the dual
boom sound speakers at the top and the
bottom and woke up a touch-sensitive
navigation buttons just below the screen
now turn it round and it's a bit more
similar to all the HTC phones like the
One X it's got this matte rubberized
effect and this slightly raised camera
unit it has a 4.5 inch display with a
960 by 540 pixel resolution now it's not
going to keep a hardcore tech fans happy
particularly those of you who are
looking for full HD displays on phones
like the galaxy s4 or the HTC One but
it's got plenty of pixels for the
essentials and it seems quite bright and
bold turning on Android 4.2.2 which
isn't the latest version of Android but
it's got HTC Sense 5 so you probably
wouldn't notice now since five really
overhauls the interface giving these
large quite minimalist tiles and the
blinkfeed scrolling news aggregator on
the left of the home screens it has a 5
megapixel camera on the back now that's
a normal megapixel camera rather than
the ultra pixel camera you'll see on the
HTC One
we haven't be able to see results yet so
don't really know how it compares it
does however have the Zoe software that
allows you to capture multiple images at
once and combine them into a gif or into
an action sequence photo it's running on
a dual-core 1.4 gigahertz processor and
it's powered by a 2100 milliamp an hour
battery which should be plenty big
enough to keep it going for a few hours
so there's no word from HTC yet on
exactly how much this is going to cost
or when we're going to see it but it is
expected to be in stores before
Christmas make sure to keep it CNET for
all the latest news
I'm Andrew Hoyle and this is the HTC 601
