t-mobile goes 4g with the new mytouch
our editors connect over their love of
dance we hit the highway in the 2011
chevy corvette and don't let your iphone
out of your sight it's all coming up
right now
I ever when I'm Mollywood and welcome to
the cnet tech review where we collect
our hottest videos of the week and tell
you what's good and what's bad in the
world of tech and offer some unique tech
wisdom in the form of the bottom line
let's get started with the good t-mobile
has been enjoying great success with
their line of Android phones but these
days it's all about 4G even though the
wireless companies are fighting about
what exactly 4G means for you just think
faster here's Bonnie cha to explain how
that all works on the mytouch 4G hey
everyone I'm Bonnie toss senior editor
at cnet com and I'm here with your first
look of the t-mobile mytouch 4G this is
the latest model and the carrier's
mytouch series of Android phones and
it's definitely the most advanced one
yet it's also probably the sturdiest one
the overall shape of the phone is very
similar to the other models but the
difference is it's got a much more
premium feel to it instead of an all
plastic back like the rest the mytouch
4G has a stainless steel battery door
and frame around the screen it makes a
phone a little heavier but I'd rather
have it be heavier and more solid
feeling than life and real plasticky
plus it's still very thin so you're not
dealing with an overly bulky phone here
on front you've got a 3.8 inch WVGA
touchscreen that's clear bright and
responsive but not as rich as a samsung
vibrant screen the my touch 4g uses a
combination of t-mobile's own interface
and HTC sense widgets I prefer the stock
Android UI of the t-mobile g2 but I also
think this is very user-friendly for
consumers and first-time Android users
below the display here you've got
standard Android shortcuts to home menu
and back but instead of a search button
you get t-mobile's genius button which
brings up the voice command function
where you can conduct searches make
calls launch applications and morale
with the sound of your voice so let's
talk about some of the features first of
all the mytouch 4G supports t-mobile's
hspa+ network which promises 4g like
speeds and I've definitely got some
great download and upload speeds here
New York the phone also supports the
ability and make calls over a Wi-Fi
network and
yo calls over Wi-Fi or the cellular
network for video calls there's a
front-facing vga camera here and you can
use either quick or yahoo messenger to
connect with friends i gave it a quick
test with Jessica dual-core in San
Francisco before coming in here and I
got the video feed just fine but
couldn't hear her although she clear--
me also I tried it with another blogger
and got audio this time but no video so
it seems like there are some kinks to be
worked out there are a bunch of other
apps that come bundled with a mytouch 4G
including t mobile TV rock band and
asphalt five and it is running android
2.2 so you're getting the most current
version of the OS out there right now
also has a second generation 1 gigahertz
Snapdragon processor and the phone has
been very responsive so far state ranks
up there with t-mobile's other top
android phones like the g2 and the
samsung vibrant it might not have as
rich of a screen as the vibrant but you
do to get hspa+ support and Wi-Fi
calling the t-mobile mytouch 4G will be
available starting November third for 1
99 99 with a two-year contract I'm
Bonnie town this has been your first
look at the t-mobile mytouch 4G well it
sounds like that phone has plenty going
on for you to enjoy while they work out
those video calling kinks like
downloading apps and what better place
to find out about the best apps
available then our own show tap that up
this week Jessica dole Court is here
with a multi-purpose search program
that's giving Yelp a run for its money
hey everybody welcome to tap that app
I'm Jessica doll cord and this is the
show where we covered the hottest apps
in the mobile space let me ask you a
question where do you go when you want
to find information about restaurants
nearby gas stations and movie theaters
Google Places pages Yelp and Bing are
all popular but have you heard of point
this ruby has been kicking around for a
while but it's good enough and it
overlooks enough that we thought it
deserved a little love right away you
can see that points a looker with an
intuitive carousel you can navigate Prue
to search for people businesses
restaurants gas stations and movies oh
yeah and you may have noticed the
weather widget on the Start screen too
when you dig into the app you'll see all
of the search categories laid out for
you in tabs with a sub list of options
below if you're into the silver screen
for example you can search theaters and
movies nearby watch a preview or pick
your flick by looking through other
criteria click the Buy button to
virtually pocket a few tickets ahead of
the show similar search techniques go
for dining establishments and gas
stations as well there are even yellow
pages and white page modules for finding
people and other businesses we were
impressed by the reverse lookup
functionality though keep in mind that
the service will only work for
registered people and phone numbers
point uses superpages citysearch
opentable and other content aggregators
to accomplish this and other tasks for
each category you'll see multiple
selections for what to do next call a
person or place search for other places
nearby and get directions in your
favorite app lucky Android users can
take advantage of turn-by-turn voice
navigation if they select google maps to
provide guidance overall point makes a
great alternative to your other apps for
reviews and it does a bang-up job taking
existing information from multiple
online services and wrapping it up and
in clean colorful and easy-to-use
package the great news for you is that
point is available free for android
iphone and blackberry smartphones so
there's our suggestion for the week we
hope that you like it and if you have
any more suggestions email us it's half
that up at cnet com I'm jessica's all
court and keep
happen it's so nice when we find an app
that runs on Android iOS and blackberry
sorry webOS our next first look video
features a product called the jawbone
jambox so there's really nothing else to
say jawbone jambox just say it as many
times as you can and take a look at
those product hey I'm Donnell bell today
we're taking a first look at the jam box
from jawbone this is a portable
rechargeable Bluetooth speaker with a
cool look and suggested price of one
hundred ninety nine dollars the speaker
comes in four colors black red blue and
grey the top and bottom have a non-slip
rubber coating and the middle features
this wraparound metal grille there's a
diamond pattern in Boston to the metal
on this black version but different
colors use slightly different shapes at
the very top you've got three oversized
buttons to work for volume control and
one's a multi-purpose button that gives
you the battery status can answer calls
it can also be programmed there's an
auto dial button when you pair this with
your phone on the side there's a
three-position power button that
triggers the pairing mode when you hold
it up jambox it in pairing mode waiting
for device to connect beneath that
you've got a mini jack aux input and a
micro USB port for recharging or
connecting to a computer jawbone doesn't
cheap out either you've got a nice flat
wire aux cable in the box along with USB
cables a power adapter and a case to
keep this thing pretty now at one
hundred ninety nine dollars this thing
isn't cheap for portable speaker for
half the price you can get a logitech z
5 15 that pulls the same trick and also
gives you a USB dongle for connecting to
your computer the Z 15 also has a 10
hour battery life which is a little
better than the eight hours you're going
to get out of the jam box on the other
hand it's not nearly as cool looking or
a small also as you'd expect from
jawbone the jam box includes a quality
integrated microphone so you can use
this as a speaker phone to another
detail that really adds to the long-term
value is the micro USB port which allows
you to update the firmware on this to
help maintain compatibility
you can also sideload Jawbone's own apps
change the language of the system voice
and do other custom tweaks sonically the
jam box is a mixed bag uses two small
drivers and a passive radiator on the
back to deliver a relatively beefy sound
that's impressive for the size when you
turn it on even gives a little sub
frequency kick just to show off that
said compared to sub $200 speaker docks
like the Logitech s 715 I the sound from
this thing is still a little weak if
you're really just looking for something
to play music on around the house we're
really shy and surprisingly is with the
iPad giving it a way to improve the
sound quality of games and videos
without having to plug in your
headphones or put this thing in some
kind of doc so that's the jam box from
jawbone extremely stylish and extremely
tiny portable bluetooth speaker for
cnet.com i'm donald l
I so want one of those for my iPad and
not just because of Angry Birds I
promise it's just so cute all right it
seems like the car tech garage has been
all about muscle cars lately so why stop
now Brian Cooley took the 2011 chevy
corvette out on the road and here are
some of the highlights I'll be the first
to admit it I've got a little bit of a
prejudice against Corvettes I'm not the
only one oh nice you the door of one
open I expect to first see some white
patent leather loafers come out followed
by a big ol beer belly some out-of-date
foster grants and a bad comb-over shoot
me when that's me in the meantime I will
give a very fair shake to this bad boy
the 2011 Corvette zo6 while we check the
tech
corvette cabins are tightened it to me
that way holds in place while you're hit
the corners hard directly in front of
you one of the best instrument panels in
production today great crisp clear
gauges no obnoxious stylizing to make
them look dated a few years from now
that is a great-looking drivers
instrument panel right above that is a
head-up display that is exactly the
opposite that's like something I'd get
at the maker faire or I'd go down to
radio shack and buy a bunch of diodes
and just make it myself yeah the
informations cool but wow that display
is clunky but i must say that head-up
display is standard gear on a 06 even
while things like the navigation head
unit remain optional speaking of the
navigation head unit i'm so glad to see
General Motors has worked out a
partnership with fisher-price they
clearly have engineered this nav system
and it looks like living hell that is
about the worst resolution I've seen in
six years of doing cars at seen it and
we've only been doing them for five
years it sucks when you're zoomed way
out like this it looks either like a map
of roads or one of those stylized neural
synapses you got in sixth grade science
class take it in a little bit and you
can make out that yes indeed that is an
image of roads in the world but I have
no idea what world because I can't read
the streets because the resolution is
awful we've also got the three LZ
package on this car which is basically a
seating package you get what apparently
is better leather perforated stuff going
on here this whole carbon fiber center
stack cover is the real deal and that's
in the option package Owen that's
attractive nice big stitched Corvette on
the front I can live without that to our
sound settings reflect the fact that we
have optional Bose audio on this car
which is a good thing because anything
less than that would not overcome the
booming Thunder out of the rear end of
this vehicle speaking of which let's go
listen to that
herein lies the throbbing heart of the
beast this is a seven liter all-aluminum
dry sump v8 dry sump means the oil
doesn't live in a crankcase pan down
sloshing around during hard cornering
and extended performance driving it's
pumping under pressure pretty high-end
stuff it also allows the engine to sit
lower in the bay cuz there's not a big
old belly pan hanging there you gotta
make clearance for well by the way seven
liters is more than just big as all hell
it's all so that's an historical
reference in the Chevrolet world that's
a 427 all I gotta say right this one by
the way handmade they all are you can
help do it that dude right there on that
label could have had the owner alongside
him for fifty eight hundred bucks
helping to build this engine they call
that the Corvette experience and then
you take delivery of your actual car at
the Corvette Museum now whether you help
build it or just write the check and let
them do all the dirty work that results
the same zero to 60 in 38 while
delivering pretty good 15 24 mpg
our bet has the pricey performance
package on top of its zo6 pneus that
means a bigger cooling system 19's on
the front 20s in the back ceramic brake
rotors to haul it down from its hundred
and ninety eight mile per hour top speed
and magnetic ride control which offers
touring or sport modes now unless you're
pressing this car pretty hard there's no
real difference between the two and the
touring mode is firmer than just about
anything else you'll drive in your life
don't even try sport a Corvettes kind of
a one car category two I don't consider
this a sports car it's honestly overly
muscled for that sports cars a car you
drive at its limits on reasonable roads
this is more of a race car brought to
the street
okay let's put a price on Miss America
2011 06 is gonna base around 75 grand
now we've got a 3 l'z here which is the
top trim level that added about 7,200
much better seat Bose audio Bluetooth
hands-free some other niceties zo6
performance package tacked on almost
10,000 more that's ceramic rotors all
around the 19 and the 20s in the rear
and that magnetic selective ride control
the option i'm gonna walk away from is
the least expensive that eighteen
hundred dollar disaster in the dash
navarrete just bring a paper map how
cool would that be to build your own
engine and get your name on it too you
know if any of you want me to build your
corvette engine you just let me know and
while i go grab my coveralls let's take
a quick break we'll be back with more
cnet tech review right after this
and welcome back to the cnet tech review
our weekly video digest of all things
good and bad we've seen here at cnet TV
continuing on in the good lately there's
been a lot of talk about tablet
computers and netbooks but the fact is
that most of us still do the bulk of our
mobile computing on a good old laptop so
here's Brian Cooley again to count down
our top five faves
hello gang bc here with another t5 this
time top five laptops as of this mid
october twenty ten you know laptops
aren't the other computer anymore for
most folks they are the computer so
don't buy a crappy one here are five
that are the opposite of that number
five is the delightfully named sony vaio
VPC z 128 GX yeah it gets an eight point
0 seen that rating though and big buzz
from cnet users now sit down this one
starts at two grand and our test unit
3,400 bucks but the design is slick and
the hard drive is an exotic 512
gigabytes solid-state drive and it's
just about the most desirable thing this
side of something with an apple on it we
did find the battery life to be just
fine but it does have switching graphics
that's the hot new technology that moves
between a high power dedicated graphics
card or a less power-hungry integrated
graphics chip depending on your task
it's one machine that actually lets you
sit down next to somebody with a MacBook
Pro and not feel like a tool number four
is the new macbook air with an 8.2 cnet
rating so slim you'll worry it'll cut
you the new air uses solid state disks
only no mechanical ones so it boots like
an iPad and has major battery life we
tested the 11 inch and got like four and
a half hours on a charge if you get the
larger 13-inch model battery life gets
up near seven hours now it starts at a
grand so kind of pricey especially
considering it uses an older intel core
2 duo cpu and only the 13-inch model
even offers an SD card reader but you
don't buy the new macbook air to win a
brag war over specs with your geek
buddies besides they'll be too busy
booting their laptops and dabbing the
sweat from carrying them number 3
another slick looker it's the HP Envy 17
c narrating 8.2 gorgeous design blu-ray
playback 17 inch 1080p display hdmi and
display out ports as well
is USB 3.0 but the battery life is a
little short and that ati mobility
radeon HD 5850 is your only graphics
choice but at ass Nick under 1,300 bucks
we're still on board with this guy for
affordable luxury number two the toshiba
portege r700 5p 25 it also gets an 8.2
cnet rating but it's got an editor's
choice attached to it and got big c net
traffic lately another sophisticated
laptop but not as pretty as the HP or
the Sony we just saw so why the buzz
value is the story here at around nine
hundred bucks and down as low as 800
Street it juggles beautifully the
balance of performance design and cost
now no one thing stands out but it does
have a great keyboard and touchpad
you'll use those quite a bit and Intel's
wireless display technology for that
second monitor and our favorite laptop
number one on the list is the macbook
pro with an 8.3 cnet rating let's face
it these guys invented loess table
design and the latest macbook pro looks
no different but inside is now available
a core i7 cpu and nvidia geforce GT 330m
graphics that switch flawlessly with the
integrated intel graphics chip for the
common tasks the multi-touch trackpad is
the best in the business it has really
powerful one two three or four finger
gestures including the one you might
just give every other laptop in this
list after you play with this little
ingot of aluminum for a few minutes now
it really should offer HDMI out blu-ray
3g but Apple is instead double down on
what their machine already did well
expect to pay 2200 bucks or so for the
best 15-inch factory config that's what
we tested so there you go your ipad is
now officially a toy again and you can
give your netbook to the kids 5 really
great laptops and the latest list you
can check out from dan ackerman and
scott stein it's over on cnet com or
just bounce over to top five cnet com
i'm brian cooley thanks for watching
with two entries on the list Apple might
seem like the big winner this week but
not so fast let's take a look at the bad
to find out what else is going on in
Apple's world on last week's apple byte
brian Tong brought a pretty serious
iphone security flaw to our attention of
course being brian he couldn't just tell
us about it you had to act it out may I
present the Apple bites players what's
up I'm Bryant on your tech nology get it
you know technology all right well
welcome to apple pie for all the good
and bad inside the world of Apple let's
get to the stories now we all love our
phone and so much of our personal
information and contacts are stored on
them for some people it's the best
friend but we here at the apple byte
think of you as our friends so we want
to educate you about a security issue
with iOS 4.1 on your iphone 3g 3gs and
for have you ever wanted to know
everything about that special someone
well you can with the iphone running iOS
4.1 on someone's lockscreen just go to
the emergency call mode then dial a
number and immediately press the hold
switch and look you'll have access to
their entire call history their
voicemails and their address book want
to hear the latest music on their phone
you can do that share a contact with
your friends hey you don't even need
facebook debt access to someone's photo
library you can do that too and to that
stalkers creepy guys and jealous
boyfriends say thanks Apple Wow and to
that we're thrown out a really really
bad apple now we hope by the time you
watch this it'll be fixed they fixed the
facetime bug but this issue is bigger
than that it's a huge deal and it
requires a software update for everyone
so Apple you guys need to get on this so
anybody still running iOS 4.1 on your
phone you should be careful until you
can upgrade to 4.2 that should fix the
problem but more importantly who let
gene simmons into her office and Brian
why do you have so many wigs actually
nevermind i think i know the answer to
that let's just move along to the bottom
line
Microsoft's much-anticipated connect
system went on sale on Thursday now with
only six Kinect games available at
launch there may not be a lot to choose
from but odds are there's something that
might pique your interest check out our
survey of the Kinect launch titles i'm
dan ackerman microsoft kinect peripheral
for the xbox 360 is an impressive piece
of hardware but it's not a compelling
user experience unless you've got the
right software to go with it so Scott
sign and I have decided to play test the
entire launch day connect line up the
front which games are worth getting
well that was exhausting there you have
it the entire launch day lineup of
Kinect games Scott was your favorite I
taste a toss-up between Dance Central
and joy ride i gotta agree with it this
is probably the best ones of course all
these really feel a little more like
tech demos then full-fledged games
hopefully the next generation of Kinect
games will be even better i'm dan
ackerman and i'm scott stein and don't
forget to invite us to your next dance
party the bottom line this week let's
see that again
ah yes there is now video footage of Dan
and Scott dancing to Funkytown on the
internet better them than me all right
folks it's time for me to go join us
next week for a brand-new cnet tech
review just for you until then there are
tons of great videos available every day
at cnet TV com see you next time and
