12th it's episode 298 of the 359 podcast
you know me on BVG and in the house
today we've got Alfred and Ben Fox
Reuben good coal Michael Brown hey I'm
Ben Fox Reuben everybody how's it going
is that that that's easily the best Ben
Fox Reuben impression I've ever seen in
my entire life you know wait well were
you read me I mean who is this imposter
this is me and my identical twin over
here show so today as noted by the
headline we're gonna be talking all
about smart speakers there's not like
some big announcement that happened
recently just a handful of different
things that really show how much the
smart speaker market is heating up with
Amazon echo and Google home really going
tit-for-tat against each other for
different features partnerships and
we'll probably expect a lot more of that
going into the holiday season I guess
that's it as far as the intro so maybe
we'll get started with the show very
candid today Thursday intro begin
podcast podcast begin in three two
welcome to the 359 I'm Ben Fox Riven I'm
Alfred Inge so there's a bunch of recent
news coming out about smart speaker it's
showing that the Google home in the
Amazon echo fight is heating up first
off the bad news Google turned off the
touch functions on the new Google how
many after reports that some of those
devices were recording audio at random
times and sending the files to Google
servers so Alfred there are a lot of
people that are already pretty skeptical
about smart speakers that can't be this
is really bad for them I mean so the
reason why I was like recording and why
they had to turn off the TUC touch
function was that it was getting like
phantom touches just from like I guess
like dust or like kind of air going over
where they thought that people were
pressing it to you know say to activate
it yeah and then it started like just
sending a bunch of recordings
no reason that's like that's like the
primary reason why a lot of people
complain and are concerned about having
sparked speakers in their house is that
they're really worried about you know
Google or Amazon or some other tech
company just listening in it's a big
game it's a serious hit for them right
and this is a brand new device - this
was really supposed to be their head
against the echo dot which is Amazon's
best-selling smarts yeah and and if you
noticed I believe on the dot I mean I
only have a dot there's no like touch to
like activate bond on the top right I
just like their eyes it's like to record
um yeah you can you can ping it I don't
usually do it that way yeah there is
there is like the mute button and then I
think there's another but I thought
there was the mute button the action
button and the volume control yeah yeah
the action button that's like to get
Alexa I've only pret never pressed that
to like set up my Wi-Fi on it hmm
interesting
but either way what was the point about
that um I was gonna say like if it were
true that there's no record button on
that then you know essentially that
makes a lot of sense why they wouldn't
have something like that yeah for it to
be accidentally activated so also this
is some some like less horrible news
about smart speakers Amazon's Alexa can
now recognize different voices in the
home allowing more personalized
experiences this feature was available
for a while on Google home and Google
really promoted this for a long time
saying like hey we can do this on Amazon
echo can't so you know this is this is a
way for Amazon to catch up to Google in
this specific area yeah I think when
Google had it as you know to set her up
with oh if you want me to play this
we'll play like your playlist on YouTube
like specifically tailored to your voice
I'm not sure if the Lexus able to do
that yet with like different Spotify
accounts are different like yeah it'll
chomping like I said this was just
announced yesterday I would imagine that
if you can't do that today they're gonna
keep trying to find ways to keep
catching up to Google to do that the
other thing that Google mentioned was
that like a view if you say call mom and
I don't know you're like significant
other said call mom it'll call like that
those specific people's yeah others so
still the wrong line so it seems like
those are all like Amazon services right
now where they
of different voices mm-hmm so there's
the one for you know shopping lists and
things like that like it'll it'll charge
my card as opposed to my significant
others card or anything like that but I
don't know if they have that yet for
like third-party services like if I say
callin uber like what I use my account
or someone else's account it's an
interesting point last and this was just
announced earlier this morning you can
now shop for Target stuff using Google
home that comes after Walmart brought
its inventory to Google home earlier
this month do you think that these team
ups that Google is doing with these
major big-box companies is actually
gonna help them catch up to Amazon I
don't get it why doesn't why don't I
just shop on amazon from google home
yeah you might be able to I think you
can actually still shop for Whole Foods
on Google home which is kind of funny
and also through yeah Google it
definitely helps Google because they
actually need a Marketplace on that and
you know if they can't get Amazon the
biggest retailer online you know why not
go after these old stores that don't
have that infrastructure set up right
exactly and also those guys wouldn't
work together anyway because you know
they're they're quickly becoming bigger
and bigger rivals either way if you want
to read more about these stories check
us out on CNET I'm Ben Fox Ruben I'm
Alfred Hank thanks for listening I feel
I could be in Google homes interests the
air touch air touch since that's the
concern now mm-hmm
that they should spin that and make a
sneaker line what do you think Alfred it
could be like a forced touch kind of
thing like they could do a promotional
partnership with like Star Wars yeah
like now you can turn on with a bottle
now to be fair to Google it was
mentioned that they said that they did
an update like a software update to fix
the problem but because they already had
egg on their face they decided to just
completely turn off that functionality
to make people less concerned about
privacy issues so technically at least
according to Google they did fix this
problem but honestly in that alert
people are so concerned about
functionality should not be on a smart
speaker anyway
like way to be able to activate like
your voice assistant so hopefully what's
the point it's a voice assistant I think
with things like mute and volume makeup
well that makes sense but to activate it
to listen to you I'm not no okay I like
the volume controls and I think the
problem for me is that it makes the
Google home any a less desirable product
that you don't have volume controls like
actual physical volume control I used
the volume control and I use the mute on
my my ink dot but like I would never
press it to activate that's silly mm-hmm
it kind of defeats the purpose
yeah yeah that's why the Amazon tap
doesn't really sell well so like big
picture here though with Walmart Target
and Google all teaming up ahead of the
holiday season to go up against Amazon I
mean like Amazon in many ways has been
running away with things in the
e-commerce world mobile commerce voice
commerce every commerce you could think
of do you converse all-stars commerce
commerce um do you think that they could
like the this team up like this like
ragtag group no actually it's like it's
gonna if it does happen it could take a
really long time that and like you like
can you compare prices like if would I
rather buy from Walmart or Target though
is the thing and it's like what if one's
cheaper than the other at least with
like Amazon I like everything is there
and I can ask fit to buy like the
cheapest one out there mmm I think that
price comparisons on a Google home might
actually eventually be better because
they have a diversity yeah retailers I
guess I'm saying for now though it's a
it's a big ol not for me no you know a
lot of people if they have smart
speakers in their home they have an
Amazon product so this is this is Google
is gonna keep trying to catch up and it
makes sense for the big-box retailers
that you don't have smart speakers to
team up with Google yeah which doesn't
have big warehouses full of stuff but at
the same time I agree that it's it's
still gonna be really hard for it's
basically like what is Walmart and you
know Target offering that
I can't get from Amazon already I also
is there like a weird beaver about my
mic yeah I'm working on that it makes
you sound kind of cool in like a robot
so it's working on my specific vodka I'm
trapped in another dimension alright
ready for take some questions yeah
alright the - in the chat what's up - is
Siri getting left behind in a battle
absolutely absolutely so there's there's
nothing called her cuz there's a thing
called Sirikit which nobody talks so
there's this thing called Siri that
nobody talks about right
I mean Siri can provides a very limited
set of api's alright Ben just straight
Oliver with it and there's like an
actress named sirikit right that's how
important Sirikit but it's Siri like
Apple being Apple really limits the
amount that you could actually use Siri
for third party functions
so while Amazon and Google are now
really trying to like run away with
creating different commands and
functions and partnerships and now you
can talk to Alexa in your car
Siri is like way behind on this the home
pod still isn't even out yet and when it
does come out it's gonna be mostly like
music related like it's supposed to be
like home theater kind of stuff yeah I
mean those have its appeal there are
certain to be fair though I don't even
think it's gonna have shopping on it
yeah I'm wrong about to be fair I don't
think Apple's trying to sell like
services through Syria I think they're
like literally created sir just to make
things easier for you to like control
your home listen to music pull up a map
or anything not like hey there's
something you can buy also like I I mean
I think there's a reason why they're not
harvesting user data with Siri yeah I
mean in a a certain extent that does
help them differentiate in the
marketplace that like they're not
getting legged oh it's an assistant not
a salesperson well I mean Amazon was a
store first
yes that's gonna be part of their mo
yeah I think they're handing a big chunk
of the market to both Amazon and Google
and maybe eventually they're gonna
figure it out that the this is this is
like a much bigger market than they're
giving it credit for I mean like and
they were early with Siri Siri came out
well before Alexa or Google
and they just kind of like let it die on
the vine so another comment from - he's
farming out to the chat to see if people
are actually buying things with their
voice is it something major like an
audio version of the - buttons I mean do
you guys use no I actually turned off
that feature because you know they want
to do by accident I mean I don't think I
would do backs and I think my friends
are jerks and would come over and do it
on purpose would they buy free just by
like house yeah yes yeah let's let's
take a back seat here
yeah what could be far worse it was you
know they like the story about the
little girl that like apparently Bo yeah
yeah which actually proved to like
Snopes prove that it was actually like
not true it was like a made-up story
it's plausible and kinda mean is it is
plausible and it's kind of cute and
whatever but yeah I almost never used
voice shopping I did during prime day
this past year because they had specific
voice shopping like like deals and some
of them were like yeah it's interesting
like no brainers Amazon Amazon like put
out there you know oh we've got like all
these like deals and here's like how
many people have done voice purchases
like in the last year since it's become
available it was like well within like
the five figures right or I don't
remember off the top of my head you know
but like I I don't typically trust like
Amazon stats that they send out because
sometimes it's like grand total since
launch which like tends to inflate the
numbers they don't do like
year-over-year or different things like
that so yeah I I just remember reading
their those numbers though being
surprised at how many people are
actually shopping over their voices yeah
I haven't done it I think it's I I'm
like cuz cuz I I can't I can't compare
prices when I do that and I can't read
reviews like right and that's exactly
that's exactly what - is saying it's
like I'm still stuck in the past and
want to see product information and
reviews there's a smart consumer right
but I mean there's things it's like
reorder tide you know you neither do you
really need to go into details on that
one those like the - buttons are kind of
Handy but I wonder if they'd start to
incorporate that into like the echo show
where you could use your voice to
investigate a product and they would
bring up like
a video review or something like that
yeah the partnership with Cena oh yeah I
don't know
you know like show me salaryman cellar
command would be just fine with me yeah
I'm okay but yeah I I agree with
everything you just said and also
anytime I do try to do voice shopping I
usually get frustrated and tell Alexa to
stop after like I get to the third
option like if the first two or three
options like aren't what I actually
wanted wait is that how it works
it just keeps offering you like a chore
yeah and I'm kind of like well it stops
after a while but it's still like not
the most efficient way to do stuff
reordering is usually a lot easier than
to like actually be like I need to buy a
new pair of jeans then you're the Amazon
expert do you think they're gonna go
that route where you can get product
information from a speaker and/or screen
speaker things vary I think on a screen
like an echo show is probably a lot
easier the problem with voice shopping
is is that it's very new consumers don't
really know what they want or need out
of it
Amazon and Google obviously are still
trying to figure it out sure and we
don't really know how big this market is
gonna be so like like product
information or product reviews or star
ratings some of that stuff would be
pretty easy to integrate in it's just
the question of like what do you grab
off of the webpage that's as ever has
that ever like misinterpreted to you
when you try to voice ordering like if
you wanted to buy like a pianist like
photo book mm-hmm like what it give you
like something else by accident or no I
don't think I mean like look Alexa
misunderstands me like a good chunk of
the time but I don't think that just
like your wife honey I hope you're not
watching but I don't I don't think that
specifically happened for voice shopping
it's more that like I'm like get more
glad bags and it gives me like a bunch
of options and I'm like how much did it
cost last time but I mean it wasn't that
always kind of the intent of the voice
shopping not to actually go into detail
like you're not buying a frigging car on
the thing now you're restocking
household goods for the most part yeah
yeah bye bye bye and buy me a shirt I'm
not going to do that I mean
you know I need a new TV it's like from
Amazon's perspective like voice shopping
may just be like a bridge to like
ambient shopping sure basically you just
buy stuff when things run out you don't
like the - buttons and the -
replenishment system service is like
it's already there where your printer
yeah I own cars I'm still like easing
into that because now I have to buy like
cat litter and food but before like if I
ran out of like toilet paper or whatever
I just go to the corner store and buy it
yeah but like maybe in the future Amazon
will like build a toilet and we'll know
and when it's time to order right
yeah the echo Bowl record and then it'll
talk to you while you're there you know
be nice to have some company I want to
talk a little bit about this voice
recognition thing you say that's good
news but I find it kind of creepy
that's where I'd rather remain a number
and unidentifiable to these robots in my
home where it's just recognizing simple
speech patterns I don't want it to know
me the problem a complicated person sure
sure
I think the problem is is that all a lot
of experts that I talk to say that to
really unlock a lot of the value of
voice assistants and smart speakers
comes when it actually recognizes the
person talking to it and that's where
you got a lot more personalization and
customization without that it's it's not
as it's not as significant so yeah a lot
of people are still kind of like
hesitant and uncomfortable with the idea
of smart speakers in general and they're
probably not good customers to buy smart
speakers and put them in their homes for
folks that already have smart speakers
are interested in smart speakers having
something like personalization where it
actually makes for a better experience
is probably a good thing for them yeah I
don't know I feel like my experience is
exactly the same even without
personalization that's why we'd like the
whole CRE kit stuff like I'd be
perfectly fine with that because
literally it just plain music set a
timer set an alarm
yeah I play all those people names
people use their smart speakers and if I
get like a smart light bulb or any kind
of smart home stuff then I'll do that
I'd like I I don't really need it to be
personalized for that hmm
yeah I I kind of looking at this a
couple years down the road I think the
concepts of personalization really
expand the potential for these things
and Amazon I don't even like I just I
recently wrote about this Amazon is
already developing chat BOTS or social
BOTS depending on what you want to call
them that like Tay
yeah I mean like but not racist you know
like but that you're like but could it
be if you wanted to I'm not gonna go
there everything's possible when you get
here so like if you're I don't know like
want to just socialize with something
and don't have any friends around or
you're cooking in the kitchen you could
just kind of talk to your echo and it'll
have a conversation with you I mean like
there are a lot of people that I I think
if you guys think that's weird
I think you're you're discounting the
fact that a lot of people would probably
want that true hey so we we joke a lot
about the silliness of the home assists
it and how valuable it truly is but
there's some really great conversation
going on in the chat right now about
certain things to consider about how it
can be applied for example Brooks major
says do you think voice shopping would
be helpful for people with disabilities
definitely most definitely if somebody
is relatively immobile for whatever
circumstance a reason that could be a
huge huge help on their lifestyle
I like recently talked to like an Alexa
skills developer mentioned that he
developed like a game on Alexa and one
of the people that was like super
involved in the game was blind and was
like thrilled to have this experience
because in that world for voice doesn't
matter if you're blind or not there
doesn't have to be a workaround for
people with disabilities exactly going
going to something like voice shopping
or gaming it does really open up certain
worlds to people with disabilities that
maybe it was much more limiting for them
so we saw some of that and I I saw some
of that in New York Comic Con I think
Roger and I brushed on it the other day
but there was a an escape room game app
thing built into the echo set up they
had there and it was all voice
I thought it was kind of awesome like
there was a lion out the door you could
not get in but I better get out right
there couldn't get out but I mean yeah
things like that could vastly change
somebody's entire outlook on life but
yeah going back to what we were talking
about with voice shopping it's hard to
say really what the market is going to
look like so is it going to be more you
know like senior citizens or more people
with disabilities or is it going to be
just generally the mainstream where you
just say like Alexa buy more paper
towels sorry if I accidentally just like
drive everybody's that go buy a bicycle
from Walmart not Target like or some I
don't know like with with like them
partnering up with all these shops like
these so after Walmart after Target
woody things like next word for Google
like I guess what would be like a good
partnership that would actually knock
off like Amazon from from like buying
online Walmart Walmart and Target are
two of the biggest big-box stores you
would expect maybe Best Buy to show yeah
at some point they've already got Costco
in there but maybe they can continue to
expand yet I would yeah I was basically
thinking like what's something that you
know Amazon doesn't have / can't get
right because that's like a lot of bulk
order I'm not saying you can't do that
with Amazon but that's not really there
yeah not as thoroughly not suppose like
pretty like Caqueta I'm Joe Best Buy is
also probably like because a lot of
people go on Amazon for electronics the
problem is is that like I'm not buying a
laptop with voice shop like that's just
not gonna happen like a pharmaceutical
thing for Google home like if I could
order like more aspirin or like allergy
medicine you might get as your
prescriptions refilled yeah on the spot
if it already knows you and recognizes
you anyways if I could have that as a
record reserved kind of secure type
transaction I wonder if that would be
easy like if you were really in a pinch
get it sent delivery I don't know that
that seems like there's probably a lot
of legal hoops to jump through to
actually settle in the first place since
it really doesn't pre-exists to this the
the other potential partner would
probably be Barnes &amp;amp; Noble I mean when
we're when you're looking at like the
broad retail ecosystem right now all the
traditional retailers are really scared
about what Amazon is doing in that area
and so jumping
to the Google Express platform is a way
for them to hopefully get a lot of these
benefits of being online and having
voice shopping and hopefully survive in
the new Amazon world boy there's some
really great comments and discussion
going on in the chat today and we're
gonna try to get to as much as we can
but we are running low on time or in
fact almost over as it is so let's let's
just blast through a couple thoughts
here and see if we can kind of rapidly
yeah speed round
Bob bridges what are your thoughts on
the rumored release of a Microsoft
Cortana smart speaker ah that's my
review I'd be surprised if there wasn't
already one being developed like I feel
like Harmon or somebody or you know what
I already got to that Microsoft speakers
slash Cortana now work with Alexa so
right it's by the Cortana speaker in
Cortana please tell Alexa to do like
actual things so yes that that's one
thing and the other issue is like
Cortana was also new to the voice market
and just like Siri it's kind of left
behind at this point I will say I also
tested it out on my laptop like when it
was first released maybe it's gotten
much better since then but like it did
not work that well for me yeah Microsoft
is not really focusing that much in
court time but just partly why they
teamed up with it less yeah first I will
say if you if you're like locked in on
Microsoft's like ecosystem though where
like you use outlook and use their
calendar and things like that and it's
probably very useful all right lightning
round continues lost legacy do you see
Google opening a physical store good
question I think like after like two
three more years sure like because
they're they're building up their
hardware but would it be legit or
gimmicky I mean they do pop up shops
they do pop ups which granted are gonna
mean would you just be more that look I
mean Microsoft built some stores Apple
obviously like that's a huge part of
their business I I wouldn't I
I would not discount that possibility
that Google would yeah has anything
needed to amass like more of its
Hardware first which they're doing a
good job of already mm-hmm I think they
they could also potentially just like
sell their stuff through Best Buy and
some other yeah which is what they're
now yeah from Michael Brown like a brown
would you shop food electronics etc via
Target Walmart BestBuy etc by way of
Google home or Google Express if the
shipping was as fast as Amazon I think
in many ways the shipping is yeah it's a
competition is competition right
I mean honestly like I live like to
train stuff when we target I still don't
go there which is like there's nothing
in their service that like makes me want
to shop from Target it's and and that's
fair I think if people are used to
shopping on Amazon then what is really
gonna get them to transition over I
think Google Express is doing a much
better job of getting its name out there
what happened well to be fair we both
pay for Amazon Prime though is is the
Google Express is that's not extra it's
free yeah yeah like with certain like
shipping limitation I feel like I'd
rather do that then like if I if you
don't have to pay for Prime I feel like
that is actually a better deal could be
I think I just sold him on Google
Express damn it Danny Green let's all
run down to the gateway store and see
what they have now out out okay a couple
more in the lightning round
what about authentication and security
touch ID and face ID is one thing but
voice ID voice biometrics is actually a
thing that people have been testing out
it's hasn't been used yet for phones or
anything like that or any kind of smart
speaker I presume because of the same
issue with what's it called the thing
that we were just talking about this
morning with the the the mini stuff
where is like just activating on its own
like if I'm if my phone is like
activated off of like biometrics and
like voice like voice ID right which
isn't a thing yet but like if it's if
it's just activated off that what's the
to stop it from like me just going
around like talking regularly and then
you know it activates it like on its own
like how many times does your Alexa like
just been triggered just by you like
talking around sometimes it gets
triggered when it's completely silent
exactly guys so that that's like a big
reason why I like like voice idea isn't
really like to have that much of a push
as whereas with like face ID or or like
with your thumbprint you know that's
like that's purposeful you can't like
accidentally turn on
your phone by like oh oops I fell on my
thumb fella you know we also talked
about this too is like how easy is it to
like spoof spoof right like with
recordings or like a picture of
someone's face so yeah yeah
I think you know with all the impression
artists out there who voiced the puppet
and not the puppet the parrot in Aladdin
Gilbert Godfried yeah that dude yeah
that dude would never have voice you
know lightning round all right one more
to end out the day on Michael Brown do
you think we'll see voice assistance
inside stores elevators or other ambient
locations they aren't having in hotel
rooms yeah yeah that's not ambient
though you see in public space Oh
granted that word that's not dissimilar
but I think he's talking more I'd be
more interesting to think like are you
gonna stop by on the street corner and
you know activate crosswalk I don't know
in an elevator I feel like that'd be
terrible like just everybody a shouting
match between children that's why I
think that in the movie her which I know
Michael Brown is a big fan of you know
having like Alexa in your ear that you
would be able to ping either by like
clicking a button or through your
smartphone is much more likely that's
how you would have your smart assistant
with you everywhere but not have the
public be able to access it directly
unless I come in and shout in your ear
bright that is that's always surpassed
by a dollhouse
alright actually I lied we got one more
quick question Carlos in the chat asks
hey I'm blind I have a question does
Alexa or Cortana work without connection
of internet for the voice commands I
don't think so no they all exists in the
cloud any time I've tried it just kind
of blanks out if my internet status even
if they don't exist in the cloud like
Siri doesn't work without the internet
connection either mmm true yeah so but
I'm Carlos I know we're running out of
time but I am curious to hear why you
would be interested in that particular
feature so if you can tell us a little
bit more information on how you use
voice assistant or what you would be
interested in certainly be curious to
hear what sorry just trying to keep
everything under the hood like he just
wants to run his
speakers or the lights in the home and
doesn't necessarily need to do any
shopping what's the in box that we have
