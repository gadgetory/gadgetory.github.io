scott stein it's time for another
terribly informative episode of ask the
editors that's right it's iPad over time
this time around Scott sign got to
review the ipad air 2 so we're going to
talk about d0 ducks post-mortem if you
will okay about these iPad first things
first what are your knee-jerk thoughts
about the ipad air 2 and and the iPad
Mini 3 we're going to find out if people
should buy these if you think it's worth
their time and money to buy them what do
you think of here's the thing nobody was
really excited about he's still not
there's a reason because this looks like
last year's iPad this looks like last
year's iPad they both have touch ID we
saw that in last year's iPhones and this
is pretty much the same as last year
just touch ID then this one you've got a
faster processor it is a little thinner
right it's it's it's got crew cameras
who uses the camera on their iPads it's
nice to have but I mean you're talking
we can really care about her screen
battery life and size size is almost the
same screen and battery life or about
equivalent right so average person
probably doesn't need upgrade to this
and it's not doing anything that's
really significantly different that
being said the speed is a lot faster if
you're a hardcore iPad user it's a good
time to upgrade but this is not
reinventing anything here sure so if
someone comes up to you an escort okay
I'm in the market for a new iPad you
tell them you say hey go right for the
ipad air 2 or do you say maybe the mini
3 is for you how do you sort of you know
assign what someone should buy yeah so
it's a tough call because if you are up
for the newest technology you want
something that we're going to run apps
the best you get this one this is the
only one they got a processor upgrade
and it's a faster processor than it or
in the iphones significantly for some
tasks now this one uses the a7 that's
the same thing that's basically on the
iphone of last year okay and but you
know it does fine for reading for video
playing for basic stuff and now the
price drop on last year's model is down
to get it for 349 with 32 gigs okay that
middle one that's a great price to get
what's basically a
fledged iPad in in the minute the one
without touch ID called the ipad mini 2
now but then if I weren't doing that and
I wanted something that was newer than
that I get the ipad ipad air 2 i pay up
for the extra storage because now it's
16 goes to 64 128 right for the extra
hundred dollars bumping up to 64 that's
a sort of thing an upgrade if someone
has an ipad air yeah are they even
thinking about upgrading no don't think
the better do not think about it and
ipad air is fine in fact you might even
say some people might prefer that you
save a hundred dollars sure getting the
ipad air i would say though if you're
going for the larger size i would still
think about going for the air too
because it's down the road ipads last a
long time for a couple years down the
road three years from now which is going
to run the next version of iOS better
it's going to be the air too because the
processor is a lot faster so you're
going to save yourself the anxiety at
that point in the future of having to
upgrade no it's that's worth it so I
mean do you think people who are maybe
on the fence do you think it's worth
waiting for an air three is there is
that ever an option and assign let's
cross my mind it seems very tempting
because you have interesting opinions on
where this is all going and I I'd love
using the iPad from the beginning right
I thought it really did a lot of things
for me as time goes on I probably use it
less phones do more and I still think
the ipad is the best tablets out there
the apps available for it are great and
it performs great but it's not doing
anything different so if you want
something that's going to feel more like
a laptop there's a reasons why we use
our laptops or desktops this doesn't do
it they're gonna have a 12 inch ipad or
they gonna have something that you know
does split screen and becomes more like
a surface or a macbook ipad hybrid
that's like it's got to happen sometimes
or make sense maybe will it happen next
year probably not but i would hold out
if i already own an ipad air if it's
been a couple of years this is a pretty
safe one to dive into just don't expect
and it's going to do anything other than
run super fast own touch ID is useful
yeah it's just not maybe it's super
useful as you think because the Apple
pay that's built in here allows you to
make payments on compatible apps not
websites okay you can't just go to
Safari
I make a payment on something and then
use that and I don't know what kind of
such it does make sense i don't know
what kind of situation you find yourself
in where you would take this to a
retailers that evening you never do that
it's not a tap to pace you're right you
thankfully woman yeah tapping this
that's a shirt ping at a starbucks right
doing oh that's a nice breeze excuse me
sir yeah i know they smartly didn't even
think about that good this is instead
what Apple pay means is they store your
credit card information centrally right
and then compatible apps again has to be
an app which is annoying right now
because a lot of people shop on on
browser photo you do that you tap and
you pay and you don't even have to like
with uber things like that you may not
have to even great and account right you
could just use this and bypass that and
become but how many apps are going to
use it it's going to take time and I
still feel like you want this to work in
Safari definite is I feel like ninety
percent of the purchasing I do on an
iPad you're usually doing your web
browser absolutely that's hard i could
avoid the old like lean to the side with
the you know that shape that shame lean
you know where you just like I get the
wallet out across the room get my wallet
make it so that's that's nice um knowing
where the touch ID is on an iPad
sometimes been as i used it i'm like was
it on the bottom right side which finger
am i use ish because the iphone is
always like in one spot there's a small
note but um it's nice to have it's just
not i don't think it's a must-have right
okay yeah now the switch into the mini
three real quick right a lot of people
are saying the word incremental is
generous extremely yeah so so explain
that real this is well these are goal by
the way that's like a light bronzing
that's that's what the gold color looks
like yeah I think we all go lightly
bronzed over the soil champagne
champagne love on the back I would not
get the gold color yeah but I you yeah
you take an ipad air from last year ipad
mini from last year yes slap touch ID on
it and you have a gold option okay tada
so you paying a hundred dollars really
for touch ID which is insanely not worth
you don't do that uh know if you want a
super high storage ipad mini you want 64
or 128 Apple has now forced you
in having to get this one right um and
they shaved a hundred dollars off those
configurations you could justify it and
say that it's kind of costing what a
would have last year but right you know
so you're stuck the last year's version
now is up to 32 gigs okay that's where
they get you but 32 is fine for most
people especially if you're not using
this for a lot of hardcore things that
they that you can stream videos you can
cloud you know store a lot of stuff now
so I still like the size of this one a
lot all right very good okay so I think
that about wraps it up the takeaways not
worth an upgrade if you have an heir
what's like the minimum ipad version
that you have that you would recommend
that's a good question i would say
anything before the 4th gen ipad so if
you've got to wonder year full of all
right the year they came out with to
screw over everyone was based on service
Lord months writer and you know why did
this happen i bought the i want the one
from the spring oh so you're gonna need
the one in the fall and i were hurt yeah
so the 3rd gen ipad is pretty long in
the tooth now yeah and was discontinued
a while ago i would say this is a really
good time to upgrade from that got a 4th
gen ipad which was an a 6x processor you
know you can still hold on it has
lightning right um i know i think that
if someone you notice this was thinner
sure but you you want to hold on to your
iPad's i think as long as possible right
until you feel like they're really slow
unless you're playing a lot of games or
your if you are a person who's doing
video editing here nine apps open at one
leading edge ipad graphics work there
are people who do that I then you could
see clear advantages but most people are
using this for web browsing videos books
email you'll be fine all right so I'd
say that and for the mini it's I think
it's all about last year's version
there's no significant differences here
nice of the price dropped on last year's
but there are a lot of tablet options
now sure found a bigger market I still
think overall for the apps that it runs
it's a really nice deal I just wish
they'd bump the processor just a little
bit throw us a bone it's not a little
bit all right well there you have it
whether or not you should buy any of the
new iPads Scott Stein thank you so much
to be you yeah you bet this is always a
pleasure tune in next time for the next
ask the editors I'm Jeff
olhar will see you now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
