iconic architecture and unforgettable
food and yes sometimes rain sometimes
lots of rain still we're here to test
samsung's new Galaxy S 9 from its
cutting-edge dual aperture camera and
design upgrades to 3d avatars you can
create of yourself today well visit some
of the city's most famous sites with a s
9 is our constant companion
hey Andy you want to come meet me in the
lobby in five minutes see you soon from
the front the galaxy s 9 and larger s 9
plus look virtually unchanged from last
year's phones but from the back the
fingerprint reader moves beneath the
camera module and the S line plus picks
up a second lens Samsung has managed to
shave down the bezels even more leaving
us with a gorgeous high-resolution
display that subtly curves along both
sides the s nines 5.8 inch screen and
the s 9 pluses 6.2 inch screen are full
and bright and take up almost the entire
phone face the s 9 phones have that
customizable edge menu that you can
access from any screen it works like a
speed dial for your contacts and apps
the button on the left
opens up nixb voice Samsung's very own
voice app unfortunately you can't
reprogram it to open any other app that
you can keep the Bixby home screen from
opening when you press the button well
at least they're still Google Assistant
our day starts at the book Attiyah
market a glorious wonderland of
Catalonian gastronomical delight
I think we need to go and find some
house yeah it's raining outside but the
s9 phones can take a dip in up to three
feet of water for as long as 30 minutes
so I'm not worried the Boqueria is a
feast for the senses and also the
sensors the galaxy s 9 and s 9 plus are
the first phones with dual aperture
lenses the 12 megapixel camera senses
your lighting conditions and swaps
apertures to make low-light shots
brighter with less digital noise you can
also switch into Pro Mode and toggle
apertures manually the galaxy s 9 plus
we have here includes a 12 megapixel
telephoto lens on the back in addition
to the main camera that means you can
take depth of field portrait photos that
blur the background and make your scenes
pop you can adjust the flirt level and
keep both those wide-angle and portrait
pics the galaxy s 9 s 8 megapixel
front-facing camera picks up a new trick
- selfie focus brings some of that
background blurring magic to your
self-portraits this tool uses software
and not a second lens so your photos
aren't quite as good and you may wind up
learning parts of yourself that
shouldn't be blown we're only just
starting to take photos every day but so
far pictures are looking pretty bright
and crisp
when Andy wanders off I get a chance to
test out the s nines improved speaker
setup which amplifies audio using the
speakers on the top a microphone on the
bottom and Dolby sound technology it's
loud in the book at a yep but I can hear
him above the din hey I meant the
central bar but I lost you are you okay
do you want to give me here I'll get you
a beer okay
after walking around in the cold for a
while we've worked up an appetite for
late lunch so we had to El Nacional a
beautiful building showcasing
restaurants that specialize in Iberian
cuisine unfortunately it's closed but
we're hungry so we settle on a sidewalk
cafe to watch the world go by oh look
more rain throughout the day I've been
unlocking my phone with my fingerprint
and my iris which are both secured
biometric methods for getting into the
phone I love not having to reach across
the camera anymore to hit that
fingerprint reader but I feel other
phones still do this better by dishing
out the fingerprint target and making it
easier to find without a case what I
don't like is intelligent scan which
Samsung added is a convenient way to
open the device without error it
combines face and lock which is not
secure and iris scanning which is that
means nothing about this feature is
secure so why even included in the first
place while we're deciding what to order
we open up a translation tool powered by
Google it's pretty useful when it works
the same goes for a dietary detection
and calorie scanning app which didn't
consistently identify our food poached
egg okay it's a fried egg and
Hertz controls very creative lunch was
delicious and our bellies full we hop on
the metro to checkout it up from part of
town
Andy breaks out a game and I tune into a
video you'll notice when we go back to
the home menu that the app icons are in
landscape mode so you'll no longer have
to turn the phone upright to browse this
is an option you can now find in the
settings the s9 phones run on Qualcomm's
lead a Snapdragon 845 chip which boasts
performance improvements for silky task
processing and slightly longer battery
life some s9s will get Samsung's own
Exynos chip instead hey what's that are
those wires sticking out of our ears yes
it's true there is a headset jack many
top phone stitch there as long ago but
Samsung actually throws in a pair of AKG
earbuds into the box they retail for
about $100 u.s. and the audio quality is
quite good
in need of a pick-me-up we duck out of
the rain for a break at one of Barcelona
specialty coffee shops
well Andy watches the bags I break out
samsung pay which works at any terminal
that accepts credit cards not just the
ones that take Google pay and that's a
good thing because we're running low on
euros la Sagrada fam√≠lia gaudi's
ambitious masterpiece of the Catholic
Church that was first started in 1882
and is still unfinished the gorgeous
stained windows inside create an
irresistible kaleidoscope of color this
is the perfect place to see the galaxy s
nine can capture the magical moments in
photo and video we've really been
impressed with the s nines image quality
overall and there are tons of settings
to choose from even if you never stray
from automatic photos and video modes
this is one of the top performing
cameras we've seen we just wish it
wasn't so easy to accidentally flip from
one mode to the next not every camera
tool is absolutely perfect the new super
slow-mo video we took at this popular
skater spot records at a lower 720p
resolution and works better outdoors
than inside you'll want to use manual
controls for the best results it's
really fun sharing these videos with
your friends but for higher resolution
video go for the regular slo-mo option
back at the hotel we cool our heels and
hold cocktail hour by playing with
Samsung's new 3d avatars called AR emoji
you don't have to be familiar with
Apple's an emoji to see that these are
not good in fact almost offensively bad
we asked a bunch of CNN editors to build
our own and here's what they thought I
don't know why the AR mode you gave me a
man bun oh lord have mercy
yeah that's unsettling that looks like
have ya had some real sort of nerve
problems it's it's kind of it's
horrifying but I can't take my eyes away
from it I'm basically like blocked on to
this kind of plasticky image that is
meant to be me that I don't identify
with at all in any way shape or form but
even if crossing into the uncanny valley
to create your own digital humanoid
clone
for you there are tons of other effects
and stickers you can apply to lighten up
your messaging game me I like a
practical tool so I'm partial to the new
notifications window that lets you swipe
down a text message to reply directly
the idea is that the widget won't
entirely pull you out of what you're
doing you can just exit out and keep
watching your video or puttering around
on your browser the galaxy s 9 and s 9
plus are pumped full of top-shelf specs
like android 8.0 or EO quite a lot of
storage and that ambitious low-light
camera and I love that they don't just
sell around the world and gray in black
in fact I like the purple and blue
shades best the s9 plusses battery
lasted a full day of sightseeing but we
did want to give it a top up before
going out for a late dinner and drinks
you can charge the phones wirelessly or
through the fast charging cable that
comes in the box
our the galaxy s 9 and s 9 plus worth
the sky-high price well if you've
already got in s 8 there to
fundamentally close to rush out for an
upgrade but if you're overdue for a new
phone anyway
they fulfill almost every requirement
for day to day use really nice design
battery life that takes you through the
day pleasing photos with lots of
tweaking options as long as those core
features stay the course and by and
large they do I can look past Samsung's
bungled gimmicks and see the Galaxy S 9
phones for the sum of their parts these
are two strong devices that earn a place
in your pocket</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
