smartphone you don't just have to choose
between black and white we're looking at
some Mobile's that are very colorful
indeed it's the alcatel one touch pop
star and pop up so let's start with the
pop star so this is the slightly lower
end of the tooth what's interesting here
is that you get these interchangeable
backs they're all very colorful and
inside each casing there's a QR codes
when you scan that with the phone's
camera you'll be able to download themes
that match the case it comes in 3G and
4G virgins and around the back that's an
8 megapixel camera on the front there's
a 5-megapixel camera next let's take a
look at the pop-up now the design of
this phone is a bit different feels a
bit more slender there are still lots of
colorful cases available but i think the
look and the feel is just may be
slightly more mature the screen is the
same it's a 5-inch display with a 720p
pixel resolution it's got an octa-core
chip so it's a bit more powerful and the
cameras are slightly more high-tech as
well that's a 13 megapixel camera on the
back and a 5 megapixel camera on the
front both these phones are going to be
available at the end of the year but
unfortunately there's no word yet on
pricing in the meantime let us know what
you think of the design and stay tuned
to cnet com / Aoife for much more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
