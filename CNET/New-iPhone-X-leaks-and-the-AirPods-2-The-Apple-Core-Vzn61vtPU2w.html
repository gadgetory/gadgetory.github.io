beta is public we have a lot of catching
up to do today on the Apple course so
let's get started come September there
may not be a lot of surprises left for
apple to spoil thanks to all the iPhone
leaks going around already
the latest one published in BGR from
casemaker go stick shows the cheaper
iPhone 10 enclosed in one of their cases
now it basically confirms what we had
already talked about last week that
single camera on the back edge to edge
display and true depth camera array for
face ID plus a few more details we were
stuck kind of unclear about according to
this leak the screen is 6.1 inches not
six inches with slightly wider bezels if
you look really really closely than the
current iPhone 10 and no 3d touch but
best of all the report says it will ship
with a fast charger in the box and it's
about time all right let's take a break
from all the iPhone talk to focus on one
of Apple's smaller devices the air pots
now I gotta say I wasn't a fan when they
first launched mainly because they kind
of look ridiculous guys but they've
grown on me and apparently they've grown
on everyone else's ears for that matter
so it shouldn't come as a shock that
Apple already has a sequel in the works
well multiple ones a report from
Lumbergh suggests Apple has three new
audio products coming in 2019 next 10
air pods
Apple branded over ear headphones and
another home pod style speaker now the
report focuses mainly on the air pods
which could get a light refresh before
the end of this year with hands-free
Siri activation and a new Wi-Fi chip but
the more dramatic refresh would come
next year according to Bloomberg could
include noise canceling longer range and
water resistance not enough to take them
for a swim but good enough for a sweaty
gym sash or a rainy commute Apple may
even be looking to add biometric sensors
like heartrate to future air pots
features that would bump up the already
hefty 160 dollar price tag on these bad
boys
what's not clear is which iteration of
these devices would bring the wireless
charging case that would allow this to
be possible with the air power charger
and speaking of air power you would
think that after the air pod delay Apple
would have learned not to announce
products before they're ready but we're
coming up on a year and still no air
power insight according to another
Bloomberg report we can expect to see
them in or before the September event
but at this rate I'm not so sure they
were originally targeted for June
Apple's air power mat will be able to
charge up to three devices at once
without a mess of cables assuring in a
new wireless era for Apple which may
eventually lead to getting rid of the
lightning port on the iPhones but
charging three devices that once has
proven to be more difficult than even
Apple expected unlike your traditional
qi chargers which require surgeon level
precision this one has to be able to
charge three different devices
regardless of where they're placed on
the mat and it comes with its own custom
charging tech what you can get today are
the public betas of iOS Mac OS and TV OS
which Apple released this week for
enrolled users to get a sneak peek of
the updates before they go live in the
fall now if you're brave enough to
install the iOS 12 public beta on your
phone you'll be able to get a sneak
preview of emojis screen time controls
and the measure app we also tested out
the beta on an iPhone 5s just to see if
it was any faster than with iOS 11 and
it's definitely delivered now I don't
want to spoil it so go check out that
video when you're done here to download
just go to beta Apple comm and enroll
your device just be warned that this
isn't the final version so you may have
some bugs to deal with Apple recommends
installing it on a secondary device or
at least make sure you have a backup if
you're bold enough to go with your main
one let's be honest Apple is not in the
habit of admitting defeat but they kind
of had to when it comes to their
butterfly switch keyboards on the Mac
books
users with newer MacBooks and MacBook
Pros complained about unresponsive and
sticky keys and letters or characters
that would repeat unexpectedly a repair
that could cost up to $700 if the device
was not under warranty Apple has now
agreed to cover the cost of the repair
or replacement so users with affected
devices can set up an appointment at the
Apple Store or mail in their device and
those who already paid for repairs can
contact an apple for a refund I air
