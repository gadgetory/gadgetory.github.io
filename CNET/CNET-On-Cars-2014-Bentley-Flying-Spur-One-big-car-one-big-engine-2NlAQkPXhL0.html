than the one you and I live in a world
where people buy a 50 thousand dollar
watches that don't tell time as well as
a $200 I phone and we're a town house on
wheels like this can be called a sports
sedan with a straight face but if you
want to arrive more refreshed than when
you started your drive there are about 2
or 3 cars in the world to consider and
this is one of them let's try the 2014
Bentley Flying Spur and check the tech
now the 2014 Flying Spur is this big
curvy bastard that has got mostly an
aluminum body shell which helps keep its
courtliness manageable beyond that spot
one buy it's very different new
taillights also a different mass front
and rear compared to the Mulsanne we
drove recently it's got a much more
reduced schnoz and a flatter cut off run
now inside a Bentley it's nicer than
your house that's kind of the idea
genuine materials everywhere leather and
real wood of course real metal in places
I've seen these before these are what
they call their organs stop vent knobs
and in fact all they are is electric
switches but they are dampened to feel
like mechanical plungers if I recall
correctly in the center of those gauges
you've got a fairly familiar outie ask
sort of a helper screen in there and of
course over here is the main head unit
which I appreciate because it has nice
big touch zones in other words the
buttons not a fiddly little detailed
thing that's a nuance lost on many
automakers now down here in the drive
control centre we basically are faced
with our shifter and some suspension
settings there's not a whole lot of
other drive mode controls even though
this car has a massive high-tech
powerplant in terms of our shifter it's
a one choice only gearbox on this guy an
8-speed automatic with your Drive
position Sport position and traditional
gate to the side nothing unusual there
look at these chunky shifters up here of
these paddles on the steering column my
great about those is they don't extend
down only up so you got to heat your
hands up here to get to the shifters
it's interesting how cars that cost a
ton of money tend to insult you the most
for example on this Bentley as far as I
understand it that rear camera is
optional
you're kidding right and over here on
the headlight control I don't see an
automatic setting that apparently is
optional - or not available I don't
believe that once you do pony up for
that rear camera you do have a ton of
settings on it though from angle of view
to color and contrast you'll see that
very often and of course your sonar can
be in or out the map quality is is good
it's not cutting edge or not doing
anything here I've not ever seen before
you notice though it's got a good
response I'm dragging around the map in
this case for example and it's really
responsive so there's some good
processing or optimization in here now
in terms of the output we have the basic
sound system here probably one of the
best you've ever heard
it does sound really good to my ears
there is an optional name audio nai M
that is over the top using 1100 watts
through 13 digital channels into what
are called balanced mode radiators
they're round flat panel speakers that
have much better imaging because they
don't aim treble frequencies like a
rifle shot they disperse them more
broadly so goes the science one other
thing I find this beautiful sunglass
holder quite a work of art and
engineering it's really quite nice I'd
have liked to have seen as much time
spent on some kind of new universal
smartphone holder instead you just throw
it in the console up here like you do on
any Toyota
even on our low option Flying Spur the
rear compartment is just a beautiful
place to spend time down here this fixed
or a detachable touchscreen remote is
impressive you can run the front head
unit from it or echo the speedometer or
other driver readouts and have all sorts
of fun with climate seat comfort and the
rear power sunshade you can also equip
the boudoir back here with the usual
dopey DVD entertainment system or a sort
of inexplicable 64 gigabyte in-car
storage drive for who knows what good
purpose do you see what's happening
there in the video being shot right now
that's the view fun you're looking at
right now of our main camera see how
it's doing this stuff I've never seen
that happen before in the eight years
have been shooting these videos there's
something radiating out of this car I
think I'm getting out
now up here underneath the prow we have
an engine more akin to locomotive
technology than automotive this is a six
liter twin turbo w12 it nests cylinders
so that you can have 12 of them in a
much smaller longitudinal distance it's
kind of like nesting 2v sixes though
that's not exactly right the bottom line
here is remarkable performance for a big
boy this is a fat man who can dance zero
to 60 and 4.3 seconds that's almost 5500
pounds of car before you even get in it
and the mpg is sort of kind of not bad
13 city and 28 highway 19 average but
you do get hit with a $3,000 gas-guzzler
tax now driving this big boy you're not
sure if you should be wearing black tie
a chauffeurs cap or train conductors
overalls I mean it's a extremely formal
environment in here at the same time you
feel like you're really wasting that
back seat if no one is sitting in it and
at the same time you're also dealing
with pro digis powers so it's an
interesting mix of experiences now the
first thing that bothers me about this
car and again it's pre-production they
may iron this out is the throttle
response is really annoying initial tip
in is basically numb then you get a ton
of power it's very tedious to drive this
car in everyday traffic get into sport
mode or manually shift it and you really
get some amazingly nice effortless power
as you might expect now about these
suspension modes I'm in let's see full
comfort right now it's very comfortable
in terms of the actual vehicle body
dynamics but underneath that I'm getting
a harsh undertone of a lot of Road
chatter I don't find it as luxurious as
it should be again that may be tuned up
by the time this car is in full
production trim I suspect it will
otherwise I think I get a better ride
out of a garden-variety lexus l asked to
be honest
okay let's price our 2014 Flying Spur
just for sport starts off at 206 or so
because the base car has a $2,800
delivery charge and as I mentioned a
$3,000 gas-guzzler tax then you begin to
add some packages and some options to
get it seen that style here's what I
would do rear camera and insulting 1200
bucks
wired phone handset I love that idea
thousand dollars rear multimedia system
I'd pass all day long but it's 7300 if
you happen to have kids a panoramic
glass roof with a solar passive cooling
technology that's a grand I would do
that all day long
7,500 bucks for the name audio system
yeah this one sounds pretty good just
like it is so all in year easily into
the two 20s and you can go to a quarter
million without really breathing hard
bottom line it buys you a four-door
sedan Bentley that's got more of the DNA
of the hotter Continental GT models more
horsepower more torque more gears more
wheels driven fewer seconds to 60
