like a big soft West Sun as we wait to
bask in its warming glow adventures in
tech looks back at iOS is most
interesting moments
the iPhone wasn't the first smartphone
but iOS did define what a mobile
operating system should be a wonderful
slice of internet on the move that
wouldn't work without a jaw-dropping
browser app revealed in 2007 with the
very first iPhone Safari embodies
everything that first blew our mind
about iOS which at the time was called
iPhone OS the touch interface meant our
view wasn't blocked by physical buttons
and Apple's pinch-to-zoom made
navigating websites bearable for the
first time
early iOS was some of Apple's finest
work the problem was it was only apples
work a year later though we got an
invites to the coolest kind of party a
third party putting apps on a phone was
not a new idea that the App Store which
arrived in 2008 with iPhone OS 2 changed
it from something we could do to
something we loved doing suddenly we
could Kindle books in fact just about
anything our celebrated part of iOS but
what makes Apple software easy to use is
attention to much smaller details for
instance copy and paste is the best of
iOS in a nutshell not a new idea but a
smart approach to an existing problem it
didn't arrive until iPhone OS 3 also
proving that Apple's not afraid to keep
us waiting years for features that might
feel like basic essentials over the
years Apple used this patient approach
to build iOS into a lean and very usable
platform but in the autumn of 2012
something
to Rye Apple had always used Google's
data for its Maps software but decided
to build its own app for iOS 6 enlisting
the help of GPS company TomTom and
promising beautiful vector maps and
glitzy 3d flyovers to release however
proved to be the lowest point in iOS
history as it transpired that Apple Maps
was jam-packed with cartographical
calamities when the mines predicted the
world would end in 2012 I wonder if
they'd been looking at Apple maps
the wake of the maps crisis saw an
official apology from CEO Tim Cook and
design guru Johnny I've put in charge of
revamping iOS with its reputation as a
software maker damaged Apple was ready
for a change
iOS 7 stamped out apples long favored
pseudo-3d icons pouring neon paint over
a new leaf flattened interface and
having a frosted glass control center
for quick access to settings
it was a visual reboot but didn't alter
the fundamentals and if you look back
over the history of this platform that's
not too surprising as its core iOS
remains the same software we first
glimpsed back in 2007 we can dream of
seeing apples take on androids beloved
widgets or a phone centric file system
but the reality is that Apple has done
very little to change the basic look and
feel of iOS maybe Apple's afraid of
radical change or perhaps it just has a
good sense of what works
whatever the reason you can bet that iOS
8 won't stray too far from what's gone
before which are your favorite iOS
moments and what do you want to see in
iOS 8 let me know and check back next
time for another adventure in tech</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
