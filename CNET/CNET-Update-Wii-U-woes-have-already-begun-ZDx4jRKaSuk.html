jeff bakalar filling in for Bridget
Carey and this is your cnet update bad
news for day one we you buyers the
company has announced that the TV
service which was promised to be
available at launch will now not be live
until sometime in December in addition
streaming services like Netflix Hulu
Plus youtube and Amazon Instant Video
will not be going live for another few
weeks this is certainly a blow for
Nintendo which can't seem to get things
ready for any launch you'll recall the
3ds launched without access to the
virtual a shop store either this is not
a good start Nintendo in other news
twitter is finally adding the ability to
email tweets directly from the twitter
stream something third party apps have
been allowing for plenty of time the
idea is to get more non Twitter people
aware of the service and encourage
participation movie-theater chain
cinemark is taking on an ambitious new
initiative to combat disturbing cell
phone use in its theaters the company
has introduced sinha mode an app that
will remind moviegoers to silence their
phones before a film begins better yet
the app will be tied to a reward system
the customers can use towards discounted
tickets and concessions it might sound a
bit crazy dangling a box of goobers in
front of a rowdy audience but anything
to get them to shut up is okay with me
not a fan of vacuuming well who is so
you've probably heard of rumba the
robotic vacuuming disk that can be set
on autopilot to clean a room well now it
can leave a fresh smelling scent
wherever it goes as well
robot addons has introduced room aroma
which is an attachment for Roomba that
will dispense a pleasant smelling
fragrance anywhere your Roomba travels
the accessory starts at $25 and refills
are twenty dollars and finally gmail has
quietly updated the service with a neat
little sorting trick that should make
navigating through emails a bit easier
starting now gmail users will have the
ability to sort their inbox by size it
may not seem like a big deal but those
who get a ton of email attachments and
need to conserve cloud space will
certainly find the feature helpful
that's your tech news update you can
find links to all of these stories on
the blog cnet com / update please follow
me on Twitter and check out the 404 show
everyday at cnet com / the 404 from our
Studios here in New York City I'm Jeff
