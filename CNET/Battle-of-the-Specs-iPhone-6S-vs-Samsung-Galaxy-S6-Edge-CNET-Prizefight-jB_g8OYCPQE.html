and we haven't been able to put the new
iPhone 6s through its paces but it
doesn't mean we can't throw it into the
prize fight ring it's a prize fight
battle of the specs between Samsung's
Galaxy s6 edge and Apple's iPhone 6s but
what I like to call the Battle of the
specs is so let's start off with the
tale of the tape it's their weight and
dimensions galaxy s6 edge design brings
its unique curved off edges with Gorilla
Glass 4 front and back with a metal
frame its dimensions in millimeters
measure in at 142 point one a width of
70 point one and it's barely thinner
between the two phones at 7 millimeters
with a weight of 132 grams the iPhone 6s
brings a stronger 7000 series aluminium
body and the new reinforced glass but a
smaller one with a height of one hundred
and thirty eight point three millimeters
a width of 67 point one and it's thicker
at 7.1 millimeters with a weight of 143
grams let's get to the screens galaxy s6
edge brings a 5.1 inch Super AMOLED
display with a higher resolution at 2560
by 1440 that absolutely destroys Apple
with its top-notch 577 pixels per inch
the iPhone 6s brings its 4.7 inch Retina
display at a lower 1334 by 750
resolution with a meager 326 pixels per
inch density the difference here apples
3d touch pressure-sensitive screen it's
a potential game-changer
once developers get their hands on it
but that remains to be seen on to the
features
the s6 edge brings a 64-bit Samsung
Exynos octa-core processor with three
gigs of RAM while apple brings their
improved 64-bit a nine chip with 2 gigs
of ram inside but the Geekbench
benchmarks tell the story where the
iPhone 6s beats out the s6 edge in the
single core score 18 11 to 1492
but then the s6 edge powers through with
its multi-core score performance at a
ridiculous 57 t-72 the iPhone successes
45 77 currently making the edge arguably
the fastest smartphone on planet earth
both phones feature fingerprint sensors
Apple has improved its touch ID sensor
to be twice as fast with its Apple pay
payment system continuing to gain
momentum Samsung's fingerprint sensor is
improved but still not as snappy as
touch ID and Samsung pay will start
officially rolling out in September with
support for older magnetic card readers
now the iPhone 6s also features
Bluetooth 4.2 while the s6 edge has
Bluetooth 4.1 now let's top Kim the
iPhone 6s brings an improved 12
megapixel rear camera and still take
some of the best pictures with its
autofocus with focus pixels tech and F
2.2 aperture while playing catch-up and
finally getting 4k video shooting for
the first time the galaxy s6 isn't
playing around with a 16 megapixel rear
camera with optical image stabilization
it shoots 4k video and has an even
better F 1.9 aperture that's still one
of the best on any mainstream phones
both phones are impressive but we'll
have to eventually compare them
head-to-head
now Samsung's front-facing camera brings
a 5 megapixel shooter and a wide-angle
for selfies while Apple steps up its
FaceTime camera to 5 megapixels and uses
it screen for a flash let's wrap things
up with battery lights
both phones feature built-in batteries
with the Galaxy s6 edge bringing in an
estimated 18 hours of talktime with its
2600 milliamp per hour battery that also
supports wireless charging compared to
the 14 hours with the iPhone 6s is 1700
milliampere battery that still has to
use a physical cable to charge Samsung
embraces built-in storage with 32 64 and
128 gig options for the edge while the
6s comes in 16 64 and 128 gig flavors
pricing will always vary based on your
region carrier and phone plan so there
you go we've stacked up the major stats
for you to consider and yes a phone is
always more than just the specs it's
about the OS its performance and the
ecosystem you prefer but other than
Apple's 3d touch differentiator and its
ecosystem benefits the s6 edge still
brings a faster processor and longer
estimated battery life thanks for
watching and we'll catch you all next
time for another prizefight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
