affordable aerial photography and with
its latest creation The Phantom for that
honor isn't likely to go anywhere The
Phantom 4 looks physically similar to
previous models but the eagle-eyed among
you will notice it has a slimmer design
that's helped lower the overall weight
which is very much appreciated on long
hikes slowing beneath is the same
stabilized camera from the last
generation which is capable of shooting
seriously good-looking 4k footage it's
behind the lens though that DJI has made
the big tweaks this time around there
are whole host of intelligent features
to help even the novices among you
capture great shots using the app you
can select a moving object for the
camera to lock on to allowing the drone
to keep your subjects in the frame while
you focus on flying alternatively a
follow-me mode tells the drone to fly
along and track you the pilots great
news if you want to film yourself on
those lovely hikes in the country
sensors on the front can detect when the
drone gets too close to an object
stopping it in its tracks before it
crashes try as I might I couldn't
convince for drone to smash into this
tree or indeed my video producer it's
every bit as easy to fly as previous
models but the additional safety
measures do help reduce your worry when
you're flying if you're into pure
performance though switch it to sport
mode and enjoy its impressive 45 mile
per hour top speed it's not all good
news though as some familiar problems
are present on the Phantom 4 you can
only expect a maximum flight time of
around 20 to 25 minutes on a full charge
the batteries from previous models
aren't compatible with the new model and
spare batteries are extremely expensive
and you'll certainly want a few spares
ready to go if you're on a long shoot
battery issues aside though the Phantom
4 is a fantastic piece of kit the
intelligent mode will help you get great
shots whether you're a first-time flyer
or a seasoned aerial veteran it might
not be cheap but it's certainly a
cost-effective way of getting gorgeous
video from the sky
