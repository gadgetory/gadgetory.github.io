Alford Aang Amazon signed a deal with
Apple this month to allow the online
retailer to directly sell many more
Apple products and just in time for the
holidays the agreement should benefit
most Amazon customers but some
third-party sellers are being left out
in the cold with only authorized Apple
resellers allowed to sell through Amazon
so I had a chance to talk to one of
these sellers and he's pretty pissed
he's done happy about it he got to build
up his business on Amazon over the past
five years and he feels pretty jilted
about the situation and feels like
Amazon really isn't helping him out toll
is obviously not helping him out in this
situation either I mean I feel like I'd
be pissed too if I you know we're
building a business selling all these
phones and then out of the blue you know
Amazon just says hey you can't tell us
any more this is all Apple's domain now
yeah the other so he didn't actually
sell phones as far as I could tell what
he did was sell a lot of discontinued
products which were harder to find it
was actually really interesting to find
out that he sold like hundreds of
discontinued Apple keyboards that the
company was no longer making it was no
longer supporting but if you are a fan
of this particular keyboard or this
discontinued iMac desktop you would be
able to buy it through him yeah Apple
has always been problematic with that
with buying just essentially reused
products or anything like that it's more
so just hey just come through us and buy
the really expensive version instead of
getting a used version of this right
which is probably why Apple probably
doesn't mind so much about losing these
types of listings and neither would
Amazon because there really isn't nearly
as much money as selling the new iPhone
so yeah also
alfred you wouldn't talk about super
smash brothers so let's just do that
right now all right so we got to play
for four hours at an event from Nintendo
about two weeks ago I played spent most
of my time playing against nairo he's
one of the best Super Smash Brothers
players in the world and as good as I
think that I am at the game he basically
beat me up for about an hour and a half
I mean he's like one of the best players
in the world
but I my first impressions of it is that
it's much more competitive than Super
Smash Brothers for the Wii U was or
Super Smash Brothers Brawl was and I
think it has a lot more potential to be
as competitive as melee on the Gamecube
was there's just a lot of factors to it
it's more punishing there's more options
for countering the characters feel a lot
more balanced I can go on and on about
this yeah yeah no definitely um do you
think it being more competitive will
actually benefit the game or turn off
novices and you know I mean I think yeah
because I think Nintendo's is finally
starting to see the competitive scene
for Super Smash Brothers they've been
going to tournaments they were at Evo
which is the largest fighting game
tournament in the world they were there
to basically promote the game they had a
bunch of demo stations there they have
been inviting these like high-level
players to these events like nairo was
the only non press person there and he
was just kind of and it wasn't like a
big announcement or anything that he was
there it was just kind of like playing
and I like recognized him so I went to
go play with him was it fun to get like
completely cleared most people would not
think that that's fun
most people like actually want to be
good at a game that they're playing but
I I would liken it to like going to a
basketball like showcase or something
and then just playing against like Kobe
Bryant like one on one the whole time
like he'll destroy you but like I had a
lot of fun in that because I felt like I
was actually learning from it and
getting better at the game so yeah last
Facebook is back in hot water big
surprise there this time because of a
New York Times investigation from last
week that found that the company
repeatedly botched its handling of a
Russia meddling operation on its social
site there was also news that it hired a
DC consulting firm that was reportedly
trying to discredit its critics will see
what Facebook ends up doing in this
latest situation where are your thoughts
yeah
Mark Zuckerberg hosted a press call last
week on this I believe it was on
Thursday where he basically kind of
deflected all the blame saying that he
had no idea that they hired
this company and he doesn't know who was
responsible for it which a lot of people
are very suspicious about considering
he's the CEO of Facebook and wasn't
aware of that yeah and he he continues
to say that you know after being made
aware of it from the New York Times
article that that's when he decided to
end that relationship with definers but
you know again a lot of people very
skeptical of this but he also mentioned
on the call to reporters you know this
Facebook is a pretty big company he's
not gonna be aware of everything that
goes on with it I mean okay that is true
but still anyway if you want to read
more about these stories check them out
on CNET I'm Ben Fox Ruben I'm Afra ding
thanks for listening
and thus concludes the recording of the
audio podcast go ahead and send in your
questions and comments about today's
stories specifically about smash bros
hey Alfred you want to try out that
present I gotcha
oh this one oh you got that for me I
didn't know that yeah I got a few for
smash oh I mean it's an okay game I
guess I figured if anybody needed a hype
button on the week of smash it would be
you well it's not the week of it it's
coming out in December seventh that's
not weeks from now yeah we're gonna talk
about it for three more weeks at least
and then we're gonna talk about it when
the game comes out it was really fun
though they also had booths set up for
the single-player mode
I didn't write about it at all that's
the adventure mode yeah so if you watch
the most recent trailer they had this
whole world of light thing where this
like energy force like blasts all the
characters except for Kirby and then you
have to go around the world and like
save all of them from being trapped you
have to be Kirby yeah adventures start
you start with Carly and then you rescue
Mario and then you can play if Mario
necks and then you rescue all these
other characters so I played through
that a little bit I also play through
the classic mode where it's just
matchups but it's like based on
different themes so if you're playing
with a like a fighter kind of character
like Captain Falcon or let's just go
Mario just cuz it's simpler like you
you'll fight only people that like fight
with their fists instead of like swords
and stuff like it'd be play of a
character with like a like a laser gun
you'll fight like space characters
instead throughout it so it's like
themed now and then the final boss like
it used to just be like this Master Hand
like this big hand that comes in like oh
yeah so now it's like based on your
character if you're Mario you fight
Bowser at the end for example oh that
makes a lot the weird hand yeah I only
played by the way the the Super Smash
that I played was the n64 yeah so a lot
of yes I'm aware I'm super old yeah so
yeah what was I gonna ask you anyway
we'll go to questions while I try to
remember what I was going to ask Alfred
sure so first up from Timothy he's
asking will Amazon eventually accept
other PayPal payments that's a good
question I always kind of wish that they
would incorporate some more options as
far as payments and while we're at it do
you think Amazon's ever is going to take
Bitcoin
Alford's face says it all the the
Bitcoin one is probably much more
unlikely but PayPal that situation has
been in rumor for years it seems
unlikely that would actually happen in
the United States because a lot of
people that are Amazon customers Amazon
already has your credit card information
so what's the point of adding in your
PayPal account from what I've heard
about it it's more likely to happen in
places like Europe where maybe that
PayPal integration might make it a
little bit easier to shop on Amazon but
so far if it's if customers were
complaining and we're trying to get
PayPal on Amazon then Amazon may have
actually tried to do this a while ago
but it doesn't really seem like
customers are clamoring for it and
that's why it hasn't happened I would
say that PayPal amylum would be much
easier to use if you could just use
PayPal and not have an account but I
would also argue that like the majority
of people on Amazon have an account
there like mostly for Amazon Prime
exactly yeah and tens of millions of
customers also have Amazon Prime which
means that you know they have all your
information already and they make it so
easy to buy on Amazon that you know
you've got like one-click shopping and
also you know subscription services
where it's immediate reordering it'd
just be nice that if you didn't want to
use Amazon Prime like you know that you
you don't order enough stuff off their
website to warrant like having that kind
of subscription for what is it like a
hundred dollars a year now order it just
got increased to $119 okay yeah so like
if you know that you don't buy that much
from Amazon to warrant that like to be
able to just pay with a PayPal account
would be nice but I can understand why
Amazon would not do that just so to get
you to sign up for their website so yeah
makes sense yes good question though
that's definitely like something that's
been like in in my world for for quite a
while so let's talk about solving the
issue of the small business on the
internet e-commerce why wouldn't this
guy just use eBay a great question he
does sell on eBay
only 10% of his businesses on eBay and
you know I have eBay sources that I
talked to but this is this is what this
guy said so and it's fairly unvarnished
he was just basically like Amazon's like
going to the mall whereas eBay is like
going to a flea market so you just the
the ability to sell is much better on
Amazon according to him it's just people
tend to go to Amazon more Amazon's
obviously a much bigger ecommerce
platform so he does plan on liquidating
a lot of his stuff that unfortunately
being able to sell on Amazon he's gonna
liquidate it through eBay but from what
he said he's hoping to maybe switch to
different brands and maybe diversified
to a variety of brands as opposed to
like really you know focusing on just
Apple going forward but doing it through
Amazon because eBay just hasn't been as
successful for him all right next up
let's take one from the - do you really
think Bezos and musk want to work
together you know unless it's to rule
the world what is this about I'm not
really sure what the mask thing
I just thought it was a tasty tidbit to
think about those - there might be some
Bezos musk news that I hadn't caught on
- that's your job and yeah you know what
I do miss something sometimes
unfortunately okay well moving on then
from Aaron Amazon should sell Google's
products it would generally help both of
them out because they could benefit from
adding Amazon services on Google devices
and easily weren't that well we've
already been down this road before I
myself get very frustrated with trying
to watch YouTube on my fire stick is
there any word on any kind of calming of
that quarrel that feud between Amazon
and Google anytime soon no not really
because they have so many more areas for
which to argue about Amazon's getting
deeper into advertising Google's getting
deeper into smart home so they're both
kind of poking each other in the eye
Google is also doing a lot more in
e-commerce not like there with with
Google shopping or what is it called
Google Express they have a lot more
partners where it's like whether it's
Walmart or Costco or Target so there's
just a lot more points of friction than
maybe there were before so and it does
kind of suck for customers obviously
because they're the ones that end up
losing out in a lot of ways but I don't
really see a situation where Amazon
would start selling Google smart home
progress it's like yeah it's like how
you know Apple with this deal with Apple
and Amazon you know they're selling more
accessories and devices but you know
somehow the home pot is missing from
there I wonder why right so even with
like a partnership even with them going
buddy-buddy with Apple they still left
out the home it's obvious reason it
basically sounds like you know Amazon is
saying you can eat at our table but you
don't eat off of my plate and Google
like directly feeds off of Amazon's play
with like the smart home department yeah
I mean there are probably Google
products that are on the Amazon
Marketplace you could probably find them
pretty easily
it's probably the pixel 3 I'm guessing
through the marketplace I'm gonna try to
find it right now but they do have like
a hard ban on a lot of the smart home
product so you're not gonna find a
Google home Google home max Google home
Mini they're just not gonna be available
maybe some of their accessories are
gonna be available like a dock or
whatever but yeah Amazon clearly knows
that if you're coming to their website
we want you to buy Ecco products not
Google products next one coming in from
our old friend syringe oi weren't
discontinued Apple products already
available on eBay from high rated
sellers both new and used sellings this
online seller already had stiff
competition before Amazon came in I
think I think it was more just like
people there's much less people on eBay
than there are on Amazon and people are
much more willing to buy on Amazon I
think that market has always been there
on eBay but you know I don't know what
it is about eBay people just like
shopping on Amazon more absolutely yeah
it's an unfortunate reality for eBay
Amazon just just to get an idea for
people about how much bigger Amazon is
in the United States than eBay Amazon
takes about 50 cents of every dollar in
u.s. ecommerce that's 50 percent of the
market
whereas eBay takes about six to seven
cents and they're number two so there's
there's Amazon which is all the way up
here then there's eBay and then there's
I think it's Walmart and Apple so mmm
it's not even close you can definitely
try to salvage some of your business by
switching over to ebay but unfortunately
for somebody that's been selling on
Amazon for five years and this guy was
selling like hundreds of thousands of
dollars of stuff yeah you're maybe
you'll eventually get back to it on eBay
but not as likely from APEC why don't
all the main producers of phones etc
just come together and allow
cross-platform it would benefit
everybody and while they're at it why
can't we just get anything we want on
the platforms we want if people want to
buy a product they're just gonna buy it
so and why not just offer it across the
board on Amazon Google and etc you want
to you want to field this one I'm
looking something up right now it's a-ok
but if you want it I'll do it I'll do it
yeah there are a lot of things that
would be beneficial for customers that
giant companies obviously don't end up
doing and that might seem a little
mystifying for customers sometimes when
Amazon presents itself as being very
customer centric but big surprise
they're not customer centric all the
time and they don't benefit small
sellers all the time even though they
market themselves to be doing that and
being like a friend and a partner of
small sellers so that's and that's a big
reason why I wrote the story is because
that's that's that's how these companies
do present themselves but it's not the
case all the time that's pretty obvious
there's a quote from a Silicon Valley
that I always think about when I think
about this when like things could be so
much better if everyone just decided to
work together and like you know make
platform like products cross-platform
and things like that but I so
from Silicon Valley Gavin Belson he's
like the CEO of hooli which is supposed
to be like a fake Google Apple kind of
company and he basically says I don't
want to live in a world where someone
makes the world a better place better
than we do so everyone wants to and all
of these companies want to improve the
world but they want to be the one to do
it and it's it's incredibly frustrating
but I that's kind of the stage
of affairs and and you know big tech I
would say right and you also point to
the fact that if you were gonna have
some sort of cross-platform stuff who is
gonna call the shots yeah is it gonna be
an independent board is it gonna be the
company that ended up winning the big
competitive like products war at some
point and now everybody's gonna you know
follow their lead
so it's it's hard to say how that would
work and whether this situation is
slightly better in certain ways because
no single company calls all the ships
all the time also just take conflicting
interest and and you know what like
products people are selling like Apple
has taken a very different stance on
data privacy than a company like
Facebook or Google has or Amazon has
even because they have totally different
but yeah exactly yeah but anyway great
question and definitely kind of gets to
the heart of why these things happen in
the first place so let's take a little
bit of poll hunters asking which one do
we shop on and I think this is kind of
including an entire audience Amazon or
Ebay I myself have had positive
experiences and negative experiences on
both more positive than negative but I
definitely go to Amazon more frequently
because of the simplicity and just kind
of bare-bones I don't want to fight for
a price I don't want to haggle I just
want to get the thing I want what about
you guys I mean it depends on what I'm
shopping for like if it's a vintage like
t-shirt or pair of sneakers like I know
I'm not gonna find that on Amazon well
see that that used to be my train of
thought
- and then Amazon's inventory greatly
expanded to a lot of obscure stuff I
never really thought I would find on
Amazon I used to love hunting around for
like old analog music equipment on eBay
but the more and more small businesses
that got involved with Amazon you found
a lot more of that stuff readily
available yeah for me most of the time I
shop on Amazon I absolutely do shop on
eBay for kind of the longtail stuff yeah
the stuff that's like a little bit
harder to find I did have one negative
experience from eBay which was like I
remember it because it was so annoying
basically I ended up buying where does a
planet Earth - and it
the European version which wasn't gonna
work on my blu-ray and the guy
explicitly said it other than his list
things you cannot cancel after you've
made the purchase no matter what and I
tried to cancel within like 20 minutes
once I realized what the problem was he
gave me such a hard time it was almost
impossible and then he forgot to mail it
to me
I called eBay about this they told me
there's nothing they could do about it
whereas when I call Amazon customer
service yes they like bend over
backwards to be like yeah sure whatever
you know you broke this thing a year
later but you know what what do we care
yeah so but I I will say that that did
stand out to me but that's not the
situation that's not been the case most
of the time when I do buy on eBay yeah
they definitely have a very different
customer service experience from both of
them I mean I think because when you're
dealing with eBay you're like
specifically dealing with the seller
most of the times so you're like getting
a different bet like every time like you
buy something whereas if Amazon you're
not that being said though I still think
that most people should use both of them
and don't limit yourself to one website
on anything because that sounds like
like wrong I say but uh I think we all
catch diversify where you're buying from
right right and this situation could
actually benefit eBay where if you do
want to find stuff that's used
refurbished discontinued you might be
able to find a lot more Apple products
from these smaller sellers through eBay
because it's not like these products are
gonna disappear they've got to get sold
somewhere so eBay is obviously in a good
position to potentially try to grab more
of that market a lot of these merchants
already sell on both but it's possible
they'll grab more of the business here's
one from Hunter would Google ever want
to get into the vendor game they have so
many products plus the money to get into
something like that would be a large
incentive what do you guys think I mean
they are they they they sell their
phones like directly off their website
they have Google Express which they've
partnered with like Costco and all these
other retailers for I mean it's not as
expansive of them as Amazon's is but
fairly close yeah they are like I think
there were talks of them opening their
own
store somewhere in New York -
interesting yeah I'm trying they're
trying to like get their feet wet in
e-commerce I would probably say one of
the few that's really trying to give
Amazon a run for their money right now
is Walmart and they're throwing a lot of
money at it but we'll see how long-term
they are committed to it and also they
make most of their money off of their
stores so a lot of times these
traditional retailers they kind of like
have this epiphany years later and
they're like why are we trying to like
fight tooth and nail on online commerce
we're making less profit and online
commerce whereas like our stores are
doing really well I mean like anybody
that's read the innovators dilemma knows
that that's a situation that comes up
all the time but Walmart at least for
now seems to be very committed to try to
catch up to Amazon and so far they are
capturing more ecommerce dollars in the
US uh before we move on did you guys by
any chance and I never thought I'd
actually speak these words on a
broadcast but did you catch SNL this
weekend I saw the Amazon thing yeah oh
my god that was wonderful I just wanted
to bring that up if anybody hasn't seen
it Saturday Night Live took a real nice
swipe at Bezos this weekend I thought
was a pretty clever a clever duck on
their part it's it's worth the watch I
think I like that take because obviously
a lot of the other takes were
specifically like I've read a lot of
stories about hey these incentives are
too rich and like Amazon sucks because
they took the money that was on the
table that everybody knows was gonna be
available to them but the SNL take was a
lot funnier where it just kind of was
Bezos trying to troll Trump with to
headquarters so yeah definitely watch
that it's not that long either it was
pretty clever and it did kind of prove
the point that the headquarters probably
could have benefited from some better
locations but we won't go down that road
right now we got to talk about smash
brothers coming to a VR platform that's
gonna happen Alfred no definitely not
I mean it might if you're late if
Nintendo decides to go that route but
like considering that it's locked as a
Nintendo property and I have not seen
any signs of Nintendo
trying to go vr because they already
have a lot of stuff like motion control
stuff with it already and nobody plays
with motion control competitively like
you can you can probably play with like
the joy Kahn's and like you know swiping
up and whatever I doubt that anyone in
tournament play would do that and I
think that's the closest that you'll get
to having a VR like experience but
you're not gonna have like a headset or
anything like that any time soon yeah it
might come sometime in the future yeah
yeah what would you want to see out of
future smash installments Alfred with
your with your take away so far on
ultimate what do you think smash needs
to do next to keep things fresh and easy
question I think an online play like
they've done a lot to improve the online
system but I think that an online system
similar to what they did with Dragon
Ball Fighter Z or Street Fighter 4 5 and
Marvel vs. Capcom 3 is probably the
biggest thing on my wish list
so right now Nintendo they obviously
we're like pretty late to the game as
far as like online play goes but they're
still using friend codes which is
extremely frustrating to the point where
fans have to set up their own kind of
online system there there's one called
like anthers ladder where you're it's
ranked based on the honor system so you
play and you like you like mark like if
you won the match or not and then like
you ridiculous yeah you move up the
ladder that way until like you're
matched up against people that are at
your level because right now the way
that I've been playing it you just
matched up of random people all the time
unless you know good people and then so
one way is your match up with random
people and then like you never know what
you're gonna get also like connection
wise like you don't know if they're like
playing on a really laggy connection or
anything like that and it's just
generally frustrating if you know people
that are really good then you kind of
like have to do this like off off the
record not off the record but like it's
not on the platform like there's no
voice chat or anything like that so you
have to like reach out to them say hey
do you want to play blah blah blah like
here's my friend code and then once
you've added them as friends you don't
have to keep sending the friend code
it's just annoying you know like it
could definitely make that a lot easier
like Pokemon was able to figure that out
with like its online gameplay and I wish
that Smash had the same thing so
with this one they are doing something
like that there's like global rankings
now and that if you're good enough you
get in like some kind of like a higher
tier level where you only play against
other people that have also reached that
tier but I haven't seen much of that
like they didn't let you do online play
during the four-hour demos that we did
but that would be my biggest thing like
having the online play be much more
competitive I literally thought you were
just gonna say why Luigi don't care
about okay
other people seem to but yeah that was
the most well thought out response I
think you've ever given on the show
Alfred just putting that out there
before I I completely spaced on this but
big welcome back to APEC we haven't seen
you in the chat in a while and I totally
spaced on this when I noticed you
throw-in comments down but it's great to
have you back hope you're on the mend
and it's great to have everybody along
