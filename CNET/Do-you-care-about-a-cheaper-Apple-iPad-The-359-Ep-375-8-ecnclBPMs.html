I'm already off to a racing good start
I'm BBG and it's time for the 359
podcast episode 375 and your host today
are Alfred and Roger and we're talking
about some new company that is made us
start up weird big phones a young
startup I play I think it's like French
or something a play yeah yeah so uh yes
no surprise room we're talking about
Apple they're slated to hold its
education event tomorrow to talk about
what we expect to be iPads will will
break that all down for you is and we'll
talk a little bit about the FTC opening
an investigation into Facebook more
Facebook drama as always if you have any
questions leave them in the comments
section Brian will pick up the best and
we'll get to them three minutes and 59
seconds from 3:00 to welcome to the 359
I'm dr. Chang I'm Alfred hang apples big
education event is tomorrow and we're
expecting to see a new cheaper iPad now
Chromebooks have grown incredibly
popular in the classroom and Apple wants
to reestablish itself in schools what do
you think you think I just a cheaper
iPads gonna do it no not at all they
like even if there it was all right what
the rumored price is why like $259 right
yes so we don't know yet but we don't
know any confirmation yet but yeah
there's that stuff even all right let's
assume assume that that is a purse
that's still like $100 more than like a
standard Chromebook right the fact that
it doesn't have like a keyboard or
anything like that is is also gonna help
is not you know gonna help like make up
Apple's case for the iPads it's more
expensive and it as like less features
and I don't I really don't understand
why they would go for something like
that maybe this new iPad that they're
doing is like a cheaper version of the
iPad pro which would have a keyboard
with pencil has keyboard although those
things are separate accessories you
still have to pay for yeah I don't know
I'm not I'm not really buying it but I
will say that they do have a bigger
advantage in terms of like what apps are
available for it and like education
programs and things like that that might
be where they make their bigger selling
point
you say that but obviously applet
partnered with Pearson to create this
special curriculum for the LAUSD five
years ago Los Angeles if I School
District made a big investment trying to
get an iPad for every one of its
students turned out to be a colossal
failure they ended up Apple ended up
having to pay 4.2 million back to the
district as part of a settlement because
it was such a complete failure because
the iPad just didn't work like the kids
weren't using these weren't using them
or they weren't using them for education
purposes they were kind of locked down
for for specific curriculum kids forgot
how to get around that it's basically
use the iPad for their own reasons so
yeah there there's I think a lot of
reasons why I passed if it cost is a big
deal a big factor in why they've really
kind of struggled to get in more
classrooms whereas a Chromebook when use
how much is a Chromebook I actually
recently bought one for like $150 150
bucks that's pretty pretty interesting
so it's good self yeah and that's like
an average one like if you you can buy
ones for like $100 that only have like
two gigs of RAM on it right that said
sharra Tippecanoe who wrote our preview
on this Apple event did note that some
school districts actually found it a
better deal to buy an iPad because the
resale value these things are a lot
higher than the Chromebook Chromebooks
are basically worthless if you try to
resell them yeah so next up the FTC is
confirmed that it's open an
investigation into Facebook for the
Cambridge and like a scandal which isn't
going away anytime soon Alfred what are
the details yes so they announced this
this morning but it had been rumored in
reports last week from Bloomberg and the
Washington Post this is essentially over
a agreement that Facebook made with the
FTC in 2011 that was basically mandating
that you know you know Facebook users
would have to receive notifications if
like Facebook was sharing its data with
outside firms like Cambridge shadow
America right clearly with the news that
broke over the last two weeks that did
not happen and the FTC is now launching
an open investigation into this so how
bad is this for Facebook I mean you know
we had Zuckerberg on last week to
apologize and only I think that didn't
come off that great it came out kind of
awkwardly so that unlike their stock
like after so after this announcement
there
stock plunge by like 5% or so let's not
use the word plunge I'm sorry I don't
know I don't know 5% dip is not plunge
but you're right in the fact that it
took such a big took a hit right after
this news really shows that that I mean
this isn't anywhere near close to being
over no yeah and then there's still been
more calls for Zuckerberg to testify
before Congress right and you know so
yeah I don't think this is ending
anytime soon for Facebook we've been
talking about her a lot on his show now
absolutely for more on Facebook Apple
and everything else check us out seen it
I'm Roger Chang I'm alfred hang thanks
for listening
alright thanks for joining us for the
recording of the regular audio podcast
and now i'm gonna go ahead and have the
pleasure of delving through all of your
well-thought-out and interesting
questions and comments in the chat so we
can keep the conversation going
until then Alfred keep enlightening us I
want to hear more about what's going on
behind the scenes with the FTC and where
Zuck is gonna be in a couple weeks
well Zuckerberg has talked about saying
that he's willing to testify to Congress
if he feels like he's the most important
like he's the right voice for it yeah it
was very hedged and it just kind of it
feels a little disingenuous cuz you're
the CEO of the company like the buck
stops yeah you should know everything
you need like there is no this argument
is like because he's like the CEO of the
company he's not handling all the legal
like procedures that's why they would
send their lawyers for something like
yeah that's also a little bit of a
smokescreen yeah with the FTC
investigation I'm not 100% sure on
what's going on there I mean they just
announced it like what an hour ago but
yeah I mean it could be a while before
anything comes out of that yeah I guess
I don't know what other questions did
yeah oh well I guess well we'll take one
from Mike Shaw right now it's more of a
comments there's the one thing I do like
about Apple is that they are much better
about not selling all my data yeah
interesting thing to think about
nowadays is more culpable who is more to
blame these days and who is safer than
the rest I wouldn't say it's it's
necessarily blame but do you have to
look at how companies use your personal
and an Apple has made this point to
obviously to its favor and in fact Tim
Cook had talked about this over the
weekend about sort of doing a better job
protecting your data Apple makes money
when you buy its products right yeah if
you buy its services
it doesn't market to you and so it's
argument has always been the data is
valuable it's it's the data is not
valued valuable to us like it is for
Google which uses that that information
to cater yes in advertising to use so
you know the the you know the common
refrains always you know if you're not
paying for the service like you're the
peer of the service you're the product
basically your information is how they
make money and you know that's and
that's why you see things like what's
going on Facebook right now so what
you're saying is it's entirely likely
the company like Apple is more
interested in keeping your data safe so
that they can further abuse it
internally they don't even do that
because if they were actually if they
were abusing your data internally then
Siri would be much smarter that's a good
double burn let's take another question
from Danny Green our old buddy Danny
Green are the iPads more secure than the
Chromebooks
and Android tablets or are they about
the same so they're much more secure
than Android tablets because I like as
your iPads are about as secure as your
iPhones are and they're because they're
both using iOS and iOS is usually like
the hallmark of security among like
researchers and experts yeah versus
Chrome OS there I would make the
argument that there are about the same
I'm actually doing a story on that yeah
so yeah I would make the argument there
about the same level of security but the
difference is you're paying like three
hundred and twenty dollars for an iPad
as opposed to paying like a hundred and
fifty dollars for a Chromebook yeah so
let's go ahead and ask this question is
that investment worth the alleged
security is that what you're paying for
no on the surface you're paying for a
flashy yeah you say pay for security but
to you as a consumer where you
inherently spend more on an Apple
product and now knowing that there there
is an a modicum of increased security to
that is it worth it yeah but I would
think about it more so in the sense of
not buying it for yourself but buying it
for somebody else that you don't want to
have to worry about I think that's why
they're so popular among students
especially because their Chromebooks and
they're cheap and they're kids yeah it
sounds like this kid all right if I if
if my kid is going to break something
like do I want them to break this $300
iPad or do I want them to break this 150
yeah I mean I think that's plus I think
Chromebooks are generally yes but I
think that I think cost is the reason
why chrome Bose end up pointing out yeah
exactly it's like it's not disposable
but you're not gonna be heartbroken if
you break that version yeah I usually
anytime I go to like a security
conference I usually ask for a
Chromebook from the office and like I
just like have it like completely wiped
before I go and I completely wipe it
when I come back like that's like a
pretty like useful security feature on
that that is nice
yeah let's pose this question if you're
out and about no I'm gonna rephrase that
as a consumer or as a manufacturer let's
say what are some of the lessons and
this is we're gonna get cold Apple
fanboys in the chat so go ahead and
bring it on what are some of the lessons
that some of the other manufacturers can
learn from Apple what are the features
that could be taken away to increase
security I want to point out that
Siddarth points out that iPads more
secure because they contain 256 bit AES
encryption what are other elements that
could be better for devices out there -
I mean I think it's tough for anyone
else to kind of replicate that Chrome OS
being come exception because Google owns
it
it's the fact that Apple owns the entire
ecosystem they lock down the software
the operating system they own the
hardware they basically control every
aspect of the product that helps make it
more secure if you're working off of an
Android computer or a Windows laptop or
even frankly a Mac like a Mac it's there
they're more open you can do more things
with it and whatever you can do whenever
there's more flexibility and freedom
with your device downloading whatever
programs or apps you want from where
that's where there's a much higher
element of risk
yeah with iOS I would say like you know
one of its bigger security features
which Chrome OS does the same thing is
like it's a walled garden kind of
approach which Windows is trying to do
also of Windows 10s mm-hmm which is
their education edition of it where you
can only download like approved apps
from their stores yeah but yeah with
with iOS stuff like you that's why like
it has a like a really high hallmark of
security and also what our commenter was
talking about if it's encryption as well
yeah all of that is like stored on it's
like secure Enclave processor which is
like borderline impossible to crack
through which you can't say the same for
like a lot of like Windows and Android
like I would say the only exception
probably is Samsung maybe or mmm just
because Samsung has a lot of money there
Knox platform yes security platform
which it's supposed to be hardened
against hacks is supposed to be suitable
for government and enterprise employees
but most Android phone makers aren't
going to spend the time of resources in
the building that much security yeah
well you kind of rely on Google for
those security updates true but maybe
they should if there's anything we want
to take away from this obviously all of
these platforms have their merits and
their cons otherwise the ecosystems
wouldn't coexist they wouldn't compete
so effectively and that's something to
be said everyone should be able to find
the thing that fits right but do we
think we're gonna see any other grander
sweeping security measures start to get
implemented from a manufacturing
standpoint from a regulation standpoint
because the last year has just been this
terrifying unveiling of do the trolls
under the bridge yeah I think the walled
garden approach is getting much more
like you like like I said Microsoft
trying to adopt it also for for Windows
10s or like the education version
because that's like a very simple way to
make sure that you know your uncle is
not downloading like five toolbars that
you might not need and then it turns out
to be adware surprise surprise waiting
so there's a there's there's devices out
there now that will stop somebody from
doing that because it usually involved
me taking as 500-mile ride back to my
parents house and slapping them well
yeah that's yeah that's what Windows 10
yeah version you could only download
apps
from the Microsoft yeah and that's like
the big advantage on Chrome OS to like I
you can't do that on a Chromebook well
again natively Apple restricted you from
at least in the last couple of operating
systems they've restricted you from
downloading yeah any apps that were
there yeah by the App Store unless you
technically went around and deactivated
feature well I'm talking and I don't
know no in the App Store for Macs you
still have to like it's pretty easy to
just download whatever from the internet
yeah you try hard enough but as far as
making it available on Front Street
Apple did shine in that regard and
restricting you from they police the App
Store and when it comes to installing
software on like a MacBook yeah you had
to actively go out of your way to allow
unverified yes I have an iPhone you
can't allow one yeah you can just click
or you could put in your password yeah
we have I think an extra step at least
right but with now for say like with an
iPhone or iPad or Windows 10 s you you
can't there's no option got it yeah I
just I think it's very interesting to
see how how many of these companies are
becoming a little more amalgam Asst is
that the word I want I mean the the
argument against like closed ecosystem
though is that you know oh you don't
have as many options like I can't get
like Photoshop on this thing or
something like that but yeah I think
what Apple and Google are trying to do
here is essentially like we're giving
you all the options that you like need
like that you would use them yeah that
that is I mean I get that
counter-argument there are a lot of apps
that yeah especially for a Windows 10s
we use a little bit less mature yeah the
iPad or the iOS store wasn't like around
the beginning like when they first
announced they're like you couldn't get
Chrome on it like you had to use
Microsoft edge yeah because it wasn't an
approved app for like a decent amount of
time yep yeh that's like that's the
biggest argument against closed
ecosystem so like it's good for security
but it's also like you know so what is
the point again here if I can't do what
I want and the company can be
heavy-handed about what yeah yes here's
a fun question from Coogan I couldn't
ignore this how would you see
security solutions and smartphones
compared to blackberry days uh well I
mean it's such a different it's I don't
know if that was a joke if he wants a
serious answer what's a serious answer
like though the old BlackBerry Network
it ran on its own network which is why
it was more secure but of course you
couldn't really do that much I mean you
could download some apps out there but
it wasn't really you couldn't do all the
things back to the argument about being
able to do all the things you want to do
I think that's even more important
nowadays with with your smartphone and
Blackberry just couldn't compete like
it's super secure but like you're gonna
be playing brick breaker all day yeah no
users are gonna that wouldn't survive in
this current climate right oh it did
that's all there you go yeah also
BlackBerry's still likes to go around
today and say they have the most secure
Android phone which I would say Samsung
would quibble with that I would also say
yeah it's a very untested clan like
there's not there it's not like they
have like an award show for something
like that it's not like I don't the
Android security awards yeah well yeah I
would say that app security for for like
current like mobile phones are pretty
decent today if you're careful of what
apps you're getting because like it's
not like like I said like on iOS so if
you can't download specific software on
it so like it's really hard to get a
virus on a phone in that sense but the
way that like they're like infecting
phones now is like using apps that like
you don't really think are are you know
doing anything bad and it you don't ask
you for all these permissions like hey
if you want to use this flashlight app
you also have to give us your phone
number your address
what happened like there was this random
yeah he just there was this issue a few
months ago where there was like a like
it was like a normal app like a
flashlight kind of thing like you you
know you just use it to turn your your
light on or whatever got it and mine
went to a bad place the thing is is that
it had all these permissions that you
have to give to it was like oh it's
tracking you by GPS also knows what
calls and text messages even make it was
basically a somebody was using to spy on
people yeah but if they marketed
themselves as like a flashlight app it's
a you know kind of like Facebook's
permissions on their app
our missions are you serious well if you
look at so our colleague char did oh she
did publish a story on Saturday looking
at some of the legacy apps that Apple
and Samsung had on Facebook and for
Apple it was I photos iMovie aperture
for Samsung it was like the galaxy s4
app which I found out was still on my
facebook profile and still had all these
permissions it could theoretically look
into what I was doing my friends
preferences what they were doing GPS all
this stuff you know we talked to Apple
Samsung they said they'd never actually
collected in that data they just they
just had that but the fact that I was
still sitting in there yeah I was weird
like this kind of zombie app sitting on
my facebook profile was a little because
you you have to give that permission to
use Facebook on your like phone right I
think that's what happened when I logged
into a GS 4 mm-hmm
I had to basically give them yeah yeah I
don't have the Facebook app on my
personal phone but it doesn't matter
they shut it down years ago but the fact
that it's still there yeah it's still
worrisome right yeah oh yeah I was
looking through my apps on there's a lot
of I still have which that 70 show
character are you I can't believe I
actually did that Wow there you go we're
almost out of time cheers - Ricki
burrito says my Nokia 3310 was super
secure there you go man
I want to go I want to go ultra secure
feature phones get off the data grid
that's right no data oh you know from
Scott Maya this is a probably a good way
to kind of close things down if there
was if that was a real award what would
you say was the most secure device like
all phones together didn't you say
something about an Android award a few
minutes ago the Android which I don't
know who I'd give that to to be oh yeah
it's hard to tell I mean Samsung makes a
big argument the case for blackberry are
there any other Oh what's what role what
if they're pixels on water is there uh
there's a couple of other security
security first phones yeah but those are
those are like specifically modded for
like yeah there was a there's just
something like that yeah I was like
there was a Justice Department
announcement last week where somebody
got arrested
like for dealing in that stuff because
he was like selling specifically to drug
dealers oh yeah they like moderate
specifically say that like you can't be
tracked no no no but there are actually
phones that security firms of like mod
it you know into being more secure than
those aren't phones you're gonna be
buying yeah yeah all right just to
bringing around full full circle before
we do shut it down for the day what kind
of security features you think are going
to be on the table for this alleged new
iPad that's going to be unveiled
tomorrow what essentially parts of this
for kids do we can we speculate on I
know I mean I think it's gonna have all
the same security that iOS does I don't
think they're gonna make a special OS no
okay I mean it's really gonna be talking
about how it's gonna be using classroom
education type programs so they do they
all come maybe they should add like
physical security to it where they all
kind of it was like a rubber bumper on
it yeah and they drop stuff it's like
paint proof or something like that so
kids will see why was the event work so
we're gonna be yes we're not gonna be
here tomorrow because the Apple is
roughly around the same time and we're
all be heads down covering it but we
will be back on Wednesday to break it
all down for you for the regular 3:59
show until then make sure you tune in
tomorrow at C net on livestream and
youtube and periscope and so on and
we'll have Jeff and we'll have Bridget
and we'll have Dan Ackerman and Scott
Stein and Lexi at out in the field and
we're all gonna talk about iPads and
it'll be lovely time that'll be tomorrow
starting at 10:30 a.m. Eastern Standard
Time
yep the event starts at about at 11:00
but will be the previous show will start
10:30 right correct so please join us
