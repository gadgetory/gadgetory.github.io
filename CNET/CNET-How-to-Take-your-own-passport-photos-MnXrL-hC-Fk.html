vacation overseas somewhere you'll need
a passport the whole application process
is really time-consuming and expensive
but the icing on the cake is that 10 to
15 dollar photo not many people know
that you can actually take and print
this photo yourself without paying for
more than just the printing costs I'm
Sharon Vaknin frissina here to show you
how to stick it to the drugstores and
bring your own passport photos all you
need for this project is a camera your
computer and a photo printer unless you
take it to a store for printing to get
started grab a friend and get yourself
in front of a white or cream colored
background like a wall or a piece of
poster board now to get your photo
approved you'll need to follow some
guidelines first you have to be wearing
your day-to-day clothing so take off any
uniforms or costumes take off any
headphones Bluetooth headsets or other
electronic devices you can wear
prescription glasses but tinted glasses
or stunners are not okay
finally wipe off any weird faces we're a
neutral expression like a smile or a
straight face when you refined your look
have your friend ready the shot if there
are any shadows around your head or on
your face get rid of them by adding or
removing light also make sure there
isn't any glare on your face all of
these things are taken into account when
your passport goes through the approval
process once the lighting looks good
frame the shot so that there's plenty of
headroom and that your cropped just
below the shoulders
when you're done get the photo on your
computer by emailing it to yourself or
uploading it from your SD card then head
to the government's own photo cropping
tool which you can get to from this web
URL now upload your photo and zoom in or
out and move the photo around to match
your face with the green template when
you're done hit crop photo then save
photo to save it to your desktop now all
you have to do is print it you can put
it on a thumb drive and take it to your
local copy center or print it out on
your own photo printer the printed photo
should be 2 inches by 2 inches so if you
need to bring it into Microsoft Word and
resize it before printing it out when
you're ready to print you can use matte
or glossy photo paper either one is
acceptable
once you're done all you have to do is
attach one photo to your passport
application and pat yourself on the back
for a job well done to see the complete
list of requirements which you should
check out visit travel.state.gov and if
you live outside the US be sure to
follow the guidelines for your country
