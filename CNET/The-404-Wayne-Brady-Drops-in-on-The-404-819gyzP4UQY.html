this is I just walked into CES right now
like I was just assured inside so I plan
on spending the afternoon I'm a big
technophile and and this is I've got
gotten the opportunity past couple years
to actually play here for a few
different venues all right now and it's
been an amazing experience to be to be
able to see the latest things and to
touch them and to get stuff ya know this
is a this is like a big get free stuff
for for geeks and nerds it's the best
thing that we we could ever have this is
for Christmas this is Christmas pool for
people that love electronics girls
smiles back yeah just give me something
that blitz and whistles and I'm content
yes cuz this I can turn off your night
boy just in tonight
oh look i'm playing with it just awesome
this is awesome we're talking about
games before I found out you're actually
a big gamer here so yeah true you're
smirking like yeah you're about to admit
something yeah i just lost a few weeks
of my life to uh to skyrim i am right
there with you sir now i'm glad that i'm
in a room full of people that back
because of the wrong setting in vegas
you know that guy like you know my
cousin had to go same thing happened to
her yet that's a that's consumed a bunch
of my life and the new the new uh modern
warfare absolutely I've been online
playing angry racist 13 year olds from
Nebraska for months now I didn't know
what is it with that today give more
copies down there I don't understand how
to kill this up with that it's a and
they're all so young yeah and the
youngest ones talk the most crap and
their voices crack too while there do
you know what your mother let you live
with you in her basement ya know your
mother yes I'm I've seen her at the beat
a media disappoint yes Roger you say you
say hi for me it call me Dad so actually
a named you one of the 20 most
influential gamers last year but what
did that was that like that was amazing
they came on the set of let's make a
deal and they had this box and and
inside the box was a trophy okay big now
not just oh I went down to Al's trophy
shop right they went to Tiffany's it had
a trophy made there are only 20 of these
people 2020 Woodgate given out and I got
a trophy and they gave me a Letterman's
jacket a really cool leather Letterman's
jacket i'd even have a little bit
imagination right like they make me feel
but like i just accomplished something
but like I should been walking in slow
motion and big music behind me but don't
don't you did it Wayne Brady you wasted
your hours hey wait man
congratulations here okay yes your
ticket you've earned the end they gave
me free games and and and just the title
alone because a lot of folks don't know
like now but folks don't know that I'm a
gamer right and I've been a gamer for
here is that it's actually in my
contract when I play gigs like out here
in vegas or torn evening TV show i have
to have a ps3 and the 360 in my room you
are my idol it's an every writer and see
like some guys on TV or movies what not
will I need to have the mm's and this
and getting a crack at these treats as
well as I've got my video games I'm good
to go because the games keep me from
hurting people in real life just be
killing people left and right because so
many people welcome to me relate hey
Wayne do I have to choke a bitch if you
have that every single day you want to
go off on someone as well so I have to
go Musa and I sit down and I play get
the poison out that once i play i call
up Greg Grunberg and and then we get
online and we play and we hang out and
then you don't have to hurt people i'm
totally understandable well is there any
other games you're looking forward to or
tech you're looking forward to in 2012
in particular yeah like what's your most
anticipated game wow you know what i
think of I've kept my head down so much
I don't really know what's coming out
now what's on the books well they're
probably another call of duty game I
would imagine well there's one all the
time and so that yes I'll buy em just
sort of your ad undeserving call of duty
wats ya call of duty Sacramento
Albuquerque ridiculous they sort of just
shuffle up but i buy i buy them yes when
you mentioned that you're into online
multiplayer video games but are you also
until like social networking games are
you like doing the farmville Zynga thing
or are you like me and can't stand folks
like that okay yeah there's no judgment
here because I'm not part of me wanting
to do these shows or whatnot is to show
my online love and become a part of the
social media family but i have to say
with a little bit of scoffing and a
teeny bit of derision I judge the
farmville because I love video games so
I don't judge farmville because I know
the social aspect that people get
together and blue
Oh Jimmy wants to sell me a chicken
don't want a chicken in real life I'd go
to Georgia yeah so I don't need Jimmy to
sell me one online for sure so in video
games I look for a visceral experience
that takes me someplace it see it it
puts me into another world just like a
movie or a book farmville does not put
me into another world if I were 8 and
loved unicorns you're damn right that's
right up my alley but Nicole yes I mean
yeah for an eight-year-old for sure yes
but I'm not a big fan of home i think
i'm gonna try to play that there is one
though that I saw that looks interesting
the Mafia Wars okay maybe I'll jump in
that right if I can't really shoot
someone in real time then I don't know
if I want if I don't see blood yeah
Edmund if in multiplayer there isn't a
talk where where my guy goes hahaha that
I don't one note so do you feel that you
know ipad games are a huge business
they're selling millions of these games
there 99 cents of pops super cheap I
come from the school of thought that
yeah that's nice if I'm in the waiting
room and the doctor's office actually I
need a real sort of you know handheld I
need buttons to be honest get in there
getting some sushi and I'm cutting
strings in right that's great all the
Bible throw birds at as many pigs if I
want me to all day but give me you know
buttons gimme triggers have you had a
chance to check out the PlayStation Vita
that's coming out have you heard about
the Vita you just made me erect really
I'm so sorry to share that with everyone
but you said you said PlayStation Vita
and I got stirred is that wrong that I
came to Vegas and nothing else Third me
yeah but you said PlayStation Vita and
now I'm Turgeon Eddie six six to
midnight right away
Wow all right I'm sorry that well you're
welcome no one was a good play station
yeah they have a portable gaming system
that's already on Japan coming out here
februari 22nd I guess I'm gonna get you
on not kidding why did they get the best
stuff first over in Japan that is every
day so if so is it a date so it's
downloadable content so it's
downloadable games or it's going to come
in like a little card that you pop in on
the top they already have uncharted of
you are you familiar one sure come on up
she looks fantastic I'm sure running a
PlayStation 3 really because you made me
a little skeptical with the car thing
because I think we've all seen remember
those old school that that I forget the
system that there was a card video game
system where it was the wave of the
future where you take the cards and you
swipe him instead of cartridges right
and the cards never work metal band and
the images came out looking like someone
smashed your LCD screen yes wasn't
didn't take off no this is a different
sort of thing I think cartridges are
sort of lame but you know they look like
little SD cards you pop them in and you
know they have uncharted just fitting on
this little micro SD card oh hello I'm
waiting for the day where you don't have
to stuff to blow into the cartridge like
you did now i'm waiting because the
great thing about shows like this in
technologies this is a 12 2012 and I'm
third 39 so I'm excited as a gamer
because I think that my school of gamers
my generation you know born in 70 71 72
as we've gotten older now by the time
that we turn 60 you'll be able to have
virtual reality that is better than
anything that you played I hope and yet
that's what I'm hoping that yeah like
there's so many diseases that that is
that could be carried out don't get it
okay don't worry about that at all fixed
I want to be on a holodeck so I want my
body to be withering away while I'm
running away from the front from aliens
in in a virtual space you know that's
something we bring up all the time you
know
I'm about to turn 30 i'm still a big
gamer I think about when I'm you know at
that grandfatherly age am i still going
to have that reaction time yes am I
gonna be okay yes as long as your thumbs
work as long as this can happen that's
it really works already is all you need
leave me my game probably won't be still
be playing that like michael jackson
experience at the black eyed peas
experience but probably for the hand
wave games those huge fan of though
there's a blood type these experience oh
yeah yeah this is not really very sure
yeah there's we had wow yeah are you
into the dancing games yes I just got
just dance 3 alright and now we have
just dance three parties and four and
and I'm gonna start posting my videos
online of us playing these men fight
folks over because I've got to tell you
and this is no I kill that game yes I'm
a dancer yeah I kill that gang I'm
making up my own moves and laughing at
my age I relation I'm talking smack to
