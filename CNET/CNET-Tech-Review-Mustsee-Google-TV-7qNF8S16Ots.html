Google TV is ready for primetime a whole
slew of new phones from ctia the best
and worse from the paris motor show and
samsung makes a case for adopting 3d TV
it's all coming up right now
hi everyone I'm Brian song and welcome
to the cnet tech review where we collect
our hottest videos of the week and tell
you what's good and what's bad in the
world of tech and offer some unique tech
wisdom in the form of the bottom line
let's start off with the good back in
May google announced something called
google TV promising and combine
everything we love about TV and the
internet this week the google TV had its
premiere via a new set-top box called
the logitech revue and we were on hand
for its debut so the logitech revue with
google TV brings together the very best
content from the web from broadcasts
from your apps from your personal media
it brings all of this content together
and presents it in one unified interface
on the very best screen in your house
now i can bring down that search on top
of anything apps TV home screen it
doesn't matter it's universally
available and i can just search for
whatever it is that i want to want to
watch so for example i happen to like to
show top gear i'm going to search for
that now now notice as i type that in
how we see a range of different results
right these are just the instant results
that happen immediately for us notice
that the first one is from DVR
recordings so that's what I have on my
dish box the second one is from youtube
right so that's online that's web
content then I can do a deep search of
all I can exhaustive search of all the
content that's available everywhere
online I have top gear here it looks
like it's coming up on BBC at six
o'clock today so I could record that if
I want to let's start with the youtube
link so I'm going to click on that
chrome browser pops up and I'm instantly
taken to youtube right i'm now watching
this video i have the full power of the
web at my disposal on my TV right i can
watch it in HD i can watch it in full
screen this time let's choose the DVR
recordings I'm instantly taken to my DVR
recordings there they are so I'm going
to press the Dual View mode button and
you can see that my DVR
or my live content is now in the bottom
right and what I have behind that is a
browser so if I search again for top
gear now we come the results and let's
go to the site so I can find out some
more information and there you have it
we're watching TV and we're finding out
more information about the show now of
course review comes preloaded with a lot
of apps a lot of great apps that can
pull in all kinds of great content for
us so let's take a look at some of these
so we have CNBC we have the gallery so
we can have pictures not only on our
phones and our pcs but we can have those
shared with our TV as well where their
best viewed we have chrome of course
where we can go to any site online we
have the help assistant in case we need
a little extra assistance we have the
media player and vid and we're going to
show you both of these in just a second

on so now with logitech TV cam that
we're introducing today in logitech
revue and logitech vid HD on Google TV
we're able to bring a more comfortable
video calling experience to your living
room let me show you what the experience
looks like we have amazing jacadi and
consume and showing the house impeccable
it is it's clear it's Christmas
technology could be better with a lot of
ways to be and you can see I'm zooming
has to us we need and until then patent
code and measuring or get back to full
screen and watch the kids there on how
it's a fantastic while I hope so como
zoo in additional logitech google has
also partnered with sony to offer TV
sets with google TV built-in sony has a
press event scheduled for early next
week so be sure to check out cnet com
for a coverage and reviews in other
product announcement news cell phone
manufacturers gathered at the fall
installment of the ctia conference here
in San Francisco this week to show off
some new handsets our crack team of
reviews editors trekked almost
two whole blocks down to moscone center
to check out these new phones firsthand
here's a sampling of what they found hi
I'm pintura and senior editor at cnet
com i'm here at CTA fall 2010 in san
francisco i want to show you the
motorola defy it is one of the very
first really rugged android phones
motorola actually showed a video where
the people were throwing in the pool
they were using it in water and it kept
on ticking so does have a bit of a
sturdy feel does have a soft touch
material on this backside let's have a
little rubber siding so feels pretty
solid a little lighter than i have
experienced from a lot of rugged phones
but still think it should stand up to a
lot of bumps and bruises pretty small
display actually so not the biggest
phone around but Motorola says they
designed for just real usability
functionality it's kind of a low-end as
for our speakers go it is android 2.1 as
a McMissile camera is all the usual
Android features you're going to look
for so it has the virtual keyboards
there's no physical keyboard normal
phone dialer so pretty standard as far
as features go but it just has that nice
rugged design does feel a little
different it is going to be out pretty
soon again that's with t-mobile and will
hopefully get a review model very
quickly so we can take a further look hi
this is jessica's Alcorn senior
associate editor for cnet com i'm here
at ctia fall 2010 taking a first look at
the samsung transform for sprint this is
an Android smartphone running android
2.1 of the operating system it is a
touchscreen phone here pretty nice touch
screen it's got a full slide out qwerty
keyboard a front-facing vga camera 3
point 5 megapixel camera on the back
with a flash one of the interesting
things about this phone is that it is
one of the three that will have the new
sprint I Z sort of theme pack it's a
Content package that you can access with
different pre configurations possibly
for email theme skins widgets things
like that there will be 13 of these
content packs launching with the phone
the transform will be available on
october 10th and sprint retail stores
and online will cost 149 99-100 dollar
mail-in rebate i'm jessica delcourt from
cnet this is your first look at the
samsung transform
I'm Nicole Lee senior associate editor
for cnet.com and this is the first left
Eddie Motorola flip-out for AT&amp;amp;T and the
frontier is a very small square a 2
point 1 inch display but it flips out as
the name suggests to reveal a full
qwerty keyboard underneath that you do
get the very small and tiny little
navigation pad right here as well on the
top here is the screen lock key as well
as the end key you also get a 3.5
millimeter headset jack on the back is
the 3.1 megapixel camera lens the
motorola flipout comes with android 2.1
with motoblur that is the new moto blur
with all the motorola widgets that has
includes the facebook widget or your
social networking widgets and so forth
features of the phone are fairly basic
are they include the usual android
webkit browser you also get stereo
bluetooth on here Wi-Fi gps and AT&amp;amp;T 3g
network pricing is still and nobody will
be available before the holiday season
this year I've got the casio gzone
ravine this is a new phone for verizon
it is a rugged phone built to military
specifications that means it is shock
proof its water resistant and it's also
dust proof you can see that it's got a
very flat back and kind of like a
rubberized feel around it so that you
can wear it if you're in an industrial
environment wearing gloves it is a flip
phone it does have 3g capabilities as
well it's got this very spacious
keyboard with some spaces between the
keys and the keys are domed they almost
have a triangular peak on them so that
you can be able to press them pretty
easily again if you're wearing gloves
what you'll see on this phone like all
the other phones in this line is support
for push-to-talk so that's like a
walkie-talkie future there is also on
this and a standard micro USB charging
port on the back you'll find a 3.2
megapixel camera with a flash and this
phone will be available very soon for
149
after a fifty-dollar mail-in rebate hi
I'm interim and senior editor Christina
calm and here at CTA fall 2010 in San
Francisco and i want to show you the HTC
Desire HD this is more or less an
international version of the HTC evo 4g
so it's going to be available in europe
and asia you could probably get it
unlocked here in the US if you like but
it's not available with a US carrier on
a hobo it does you see a little bit of
that evos design it's about the same
size for it got a 4.3 inch screen it's
got a similar web profile you won't find
that kickstand on the back like we saw
in a sprint phone but you do have the
protruding camera lens and then some of
the panels are different you can remove
this and the SIM cards there you can
remove this side and the battery pops
out does have a nice feeling in the hand
you know some people might find the
phone a bit big I don't necessarily mind
that because I like that big touchscreen
but is very colorful it's very bright
you get up to seven home screen so you
can customize those as you wish with the
normal Android fashion this is running
the latest version of HTC Sense so that
of course is HTC's interface it sits
over android a little bit it doesn't
really interfere with android too much
doesn't drill down to the menus and
really change how they look but it is a
nice way to get a little bit
customization to the phone overall the
phone does that most the Android
features you'd expect it's going to
bluetooth it's going to have
productivity features all the Google
applications GPS does have an eight
megapixel camera given their side camera
lens and there's a flash next to it the
desire HD also runs froyo there's a
latest version of android OS that's
android to dot too so a pretty powerful
phone bill tim has had a similar to the
HTC evo 4g but with a few refinements
and this is phone is primarily available
outside the united states I'm Ken
Sherman and this is the HTC Desire HD as
usual you can find our complete coverage
of these phones and many more at you
guessed it cnet com next up we're off
two fronts for the 2010 paris motor show
to survey some of the new production
models concept cars even some electric
scooters here are some of the headlights
I mean highlights
not sure there's been a Lamborghini this
striking since the original Countach now
not so much is it a styling breakthrough
as it is an interpretation breakthrough
because this car has a carbon fiber
shell and underneath a carbon fibre tub
which is forged not laminated as is
typical with that material that
technique was developed in concert with
Calloway the golf club folks and not
just for looks by the way Lamborghini
says the future of supercars is weight
control not really power improvement
this concept ways just 2200 pounds and
would be fitted with the company's
existing 570 horsepower v10 that's a
power-to-weight ratio of around 3.8
pounds per horse for comparison a
current murcielago saddles each horse
with over 6 pounds about a forty-five
percent difference yes weight reduction
could be the next big thing in going
fast you could stand right next to this
car maybe not know it's a Jag Wow it's
the sea x 75 concept that's concept with
a capital C this one is way out there
it's conceived as an electric super
coupe 778 horsepower and get this 11
hundred and seventy eight foot pounds of
torque going out to motors that live at
each wheel that's the combined total
it'll get you to 205 miles an hour or 60
in three and a half seconds what's
really fascinating is where the
electricity comes from a pair of
turbines basically little jet engines in
the back but not pushing the car like a
plane instead spinning generators at
really high rpms to create a lot of
volts in fact this cars track mode would
power those four in wheel electric
motors directly not via the battery
because those turbines can spend those
generators so hard I just want to hear
what that would sound like in more sober
conditions jaguar imagines this car
would have an electric driving range of
560 miles it's a range extender
architecture kind of like a Chevy Volt
well
sorta don't look for this one in
showrooms anytime soon but jag is
working on a hybrid that will be for
sale
the new and very euro Ford Focus coming
to the US and early 2011 and among its
variants down the road will be this hot
rod version the Focus ST it just debuted
at Paris 2010 a two liter four under the
hood but with twin turbos and direct
injection that's for its EcoBoost combo
giving you 250 horsepower and 260 six
foot pounds of torque one gearbox a
six-speed manual of course the
suspensions been hotted up by ford's RS
team the rear end has all the usual
stuff the wing the air flow diffuser
senator ported exhaust all part of
current tuner thinking on all four
corners 19-inch wheels inside recaro
seats and a pod of additional gauges for
boost oil temp and pressure that
completes the story this guy doesn't it
show rooms till early 2012 but finally
our focus will get the guts the rest of
the world's been enjoying
bit of a counterintuitive trend at the
paris auto show was the big presence of
electric scooters first here's the MINI
Scooter II a concept from mini that has
a smartphone dock which functions as the
way you turn it on the gps nav the media
center the hands-free communications reg
because art phones do all that it will
also let you know when other scooter a
drivers are near you even flash its
lights at them when you pass 3 styling
versions have been mocked up all
distinctly retro in that mini way expect
50 or 60 miles on a charge that takes
maybe four hours to do over its smart
they too were on the e scooter bandwagon
with this concept that looks more
stylish than funky could be branded as
the 41 when it comes out get it also a
concept though it's envisioned as doing
62 miles on a charge but like the mini
it won't go highway speeds this isn't a
round city vehicle the smart would have
blind spot detection solar cells for
trickle charging and even an airbag and
if you think these two companies are
nuts know that Renault Honda pujo are
among the other companies that have
scooters planned as well
Audi doesn't have a lot of single-digit
model numbers left after the Paris debut
of the a7 slotted more near the eighth
than the six it's a big elegant
four-door coupe hatchback that excuse
the rather pudgy look of the Mercedes
CLS or Porsche Panamera has a tautness
more in line with an Aston rapide though
not quite we'll see a supercharged v6
version right off the bat and almost
certainly a v8-powered s7 version down
the road all-wheel drive will be an
option of course it's an Audi automatic
gearbox or a 7-speed dual-clutch look
for the latest in Audis excellent mm I
interface Bose audio at base an
egregiously price to be a no audio rig
optionally possible tech toys in the
u.s. could include a head-up display and
mobile Wi-Fi pricing starts at an
equivalent of about sixty seven thousand
dollars in Europe but that pricing is
still TBD for the US where it doesn't
hit until mid-2011 not all the cars
rolled out at Paris could be winners
though we'll have more of the duds later
in the show but right now it's time to
take a break we'll be back with more
Cena tech review right after this
welcome back to the Cena tech review our
weekly video digest of all things good
and bad we've seen here at Cena TV
continuing on in the good if you're not
ready to jump on the google TV bandwagon
but still want access to tons of web
content on your TV take a look at this
new series of plasma screens from
samsung hi there David Katz Meyer here
from cnet com and this is the samsung
pnc 8000 series video review this is the
50 inch version of the series there's
also a 58 and a 63 inch version we
expect similar picture quality from all
the sizes so this review will apply to
all of them this is Samsung's flagship
plasma TV for 2010 that means it has all
the features that the company can offer
and that's quite a few but we'll talk
about that a little bit styling here is
the first thing on the menu you can see
the TV is not your standard glossy black
around the edge of the frame it's
actually a gray or color relatively
light gray with the kind of transparent
border around the edge here and equal
width on all sides we really like the
look of this TV it's a very slick look
there's a little bit of accent provided
here by the stainless steel top stand
and of course it does swivel that
feature set does include 3d
compatibility meaning if you connect a
3d compatible device and 3d content and
watch through 3d glasses you can enjoy a
third dimension television on this TV
the TV also converts 2d content to 3d
which isn't found on all 3d TVs
available it does allow you to play
around with a couple the settings with
3d as well so I'll told a 3d feature set
on this TV is as good as it gets
although it does not include a free pair
of glasses another prominent feature on
the Samsung is the Apps suite if you
connect the internet to this TV via a
wire or an optional dongle for Wi-Fi you
can get access to a whole bunch of apps
Samsung currently has the most apps of
any TV provider that includes netflix
and hulu plus in addition to youtube and
a whole bunch of other video eat
streaming apps there's also a separate
yahoo widgets section that can be a
little confusing because there's apps
and widgets on this TV widgets will
include facebook and there's also a
facebook app so again if you want your
facebook you get it in two ways on this
set we did like the apps implementation
overall however and it's nice to see all
that content Samsung does have a
3d streaming video content app for
example that allows it to show some
video previews and stuff like that so we
look forward to seeing what else the
platform can bring more features include
some of the best adjustability we've
seen on any TV that includes a ten-point
grayscale adjustment gamma and color
management system you can also play
around with D judder on this TV it's the
only plasma on the market with DJ other
processing that's not really good thing
in our opinion but if you want to you
can engage a DJ in a couple of presets
and see how smooth the picture looks if
you turn off DJ arrival you'll find that
the Samsung is one of the best
performing TVs on the market we really
did appreciate its deep black levels
although they're not quite as deep as
some of the other TVs does have
excellent color and the video processing
is very good you can actually get it to
a handle 1080p 24 content correctly
again if you turn off d judder another
highlight on the Samsung is its
excellent bright room capabilities it
will preserve black levels a lot better
under the lights than most plasma TVs it
also reduces reflections relatively well
although All Things Considered it's not
as good as a matte screen LCD for a
bright room and of course like any plasm
it beats LCDs in terms of uniformity and
being able to view the picture from off
angle finally in terms of 3d performance
the Samsung was one of the best we've
seen so far it had very little crosstalk
compared a lot of the LCD models this
year and color accuracy was quite good
in the presets of course you can adjust
a lot of picture parameters in 3d which
is really nice there's also four hdmi
inputs on the back panel in one
component video input that's a little
bit less analog connectivity the most
TVs in this price range also pair USB
inputs on the back it's nice to have a
second one in case you use one for a
Wi-Fi dongle that's a quick look at the
samsung pnc 8000 series and I'm David
cast iron cats were actually called this
Samsung the second best TV the year and
I bet they could have had a shot at
being first if they had gone ahead and
thrown in a pair of 3d glasses or two
come on samsung now are you guys ready
for some more cars then get ready to dig
into the bad
let's return to the paris motor show for
a handful of cars that really weren't
anything to write home about if Nissan's
leaf and cube hooked up for a night this
might be the outcome the town pod
concept electric vehicle it's for the
entrepreneur nissan says with a highly
configurable interior or whatever kind
of entrepreneur you do you configure
various modules around the car via these
rubbery pucks that are molded for
different tasks one could hold your
iPhone another one could be a hook for
your bag a couple of them could support
a little desk in the corner good luck
getting that by federal safety
regulators and nissan hopes a vibrant
aftermarket would arise making such
pucks and presumably paying nissan some
sort of license fee everybody taking a
page from apple's playbook these days of
course those dual touch screens are
envisioned as communicating with the
drivers PDA says Nissan I hope they
meant smart phone and all that frankly
sounds a lot like a feature already
coming onboard sink okay this one I'm
not sure whether to drive or put it on
and lace it up it's the Kia pop a city
car concept that's one of the big
eyeball grabbers at the 2010 parents
show it's a three seater the sort of
thing concept cars can get away with via
one curvy purple bench seat that lives
under a very cool glass roof which is
also the windshield it's electric
because that's the theme at Paris this
year has the face of an octopus maybe
that's just me it's only a tiny bit
larger than a smart fortwo so you could
make room for it in the garage or in a
closet
VW says this new European cassatt isn't
necessarily our new Passat but it might
be there being cagey since reaction to
this design has been real lukewarm it
picks up a lot of the styling cues of
the newly redone Jetta which has been
very heavily mainstream interior
restyled as well nice looking but the
big idea for VW in the u.s. going
forward is to do battle with Camry and
Accord so they've also released sketches
of what could be a different passat for
the US market which they just called the
new midsize sedan for now whatever
becomes the new Passat for the u.s. is
expected to start closer to 20 grand not
around the current 27 grand engines will
include a two and a half liter 5
cylinder we know that one a v6 we know
that one and a two liter TDI we know
that one the coolest piece of tech easy
open trunk with your arms full of stuff
but the key in your pocket just waggle
your foot under the bumper the trunk
pops open
way to push the envelope there VW the
next thing you know you'll be offering a
built-in vase for flowers or something
oh yeah you guys already did that did at
you let's just move along to the bottom
line remember about 20 minutes ago when
we had the unveiling of the logitech
revue box with Google TV well Matt
Mackowiak got a sneak peek at the box
and here he is with the first look hi
I'm Matthew miskovic senior associate
editor at cnet com and we're here with
the logitech revue with Google TV this
is a set-top box that you're going to
put in your home theater system it costs
about three hundred dollars and it's
coming out in October and the idea is is
you're going to bring the functionality
of google into your living room if you
have content that you want to watch this
on the web whether you have content
that's on your DVR you're going to be
able to bring up the google search bar
and find whatever you want to watch the
system consists of a set top box so you
put under your TV as an HDMI input for
connecting say a cable or satellite box
and also has an HDMI output would you
connect to your TV now in a system like
this it all comes down to control there
are three different ways that you can
control the logitech revue now it comes
with an RF based keyboard and what you
have is you have a full keyboard like
you had of your computer so you can
search google but you also have a
touchpad for navigating the screen like
you would on a browser and you have
remote based controls as if you were
controlling a TV so you have pause play
channel up channel down and volume if
the keyboards too big there's also a
mini controller that's sold separately
for 130 dollars and it basically just
shrinks down the full-size keyboard into
something more compact now if you have
an android-based smartphone or an iPhone
there's also an app so you can just take
out your phone and you won't have to
deal with say the bulky keyboard and you
can do all the same functionality right
from your phone another cool thing you
can do it your smartphone is if say
you're watching a YouTube clip you can
push it to the TV and watch it on your
big screen instead of watching it on
your phone now the logitech revue with
google TV has an extensive set of
content that you can access you can be
able to bring up your EPG from your
cable box or satellite box and you're
going to be able to access services like
amazon netflix pando
aura and in the future you'll even be
able to take android based apps and look
at them on your TV now the big question
a lot of people are going to be asking
is will hulu work on google TV and the
answer is not right away that's
something that could change in the
future but right now you're not be able
to access some of the free hulu content
that you enjoy on your laptop finally
like a lot of other network streaming
boxes it also has the ability to pull
content from your PC so if you have
music stored on a pc with a DLNA server
you're going to be able to stream your
music collection your photos and even
video to the Google TV and that's all
searchable from that search bar as well
now it can access content from a cable
or satellite box and it can also control
it as the logitech revue has built-in IR
blasters so it's going to be able to
control other devices just as if you had
say a harmony universal remote all
together in our quick demo with the
logitech revue with Google TV it feels
like it has a lot more content than say
the just recently released Apple TV so
well it does cost more if you're someone
that watches a lot of web video and you
just want an all-in-one solution this is
something to look forward to and we're
eager to get our hands on a review
sample i'm matthew miskovic from cnet
com and this is the logitech revue with
google TV the bottom line this week
don't cut that cable just yet now even
though Google TV brings a lot of content
from the internet to your TV you'll get
even more out of it when you use it in
conjunction with your cable box and DVR
and if the three hundred dollar price
tag seems a little steep hey at least
you get access to cnet videos and that's
got to be worth something right okay
folks it's time for me to go but join us
next week when we'll have our first look
at the long-awaited windows seven phone
and of course the sony internet TV with
google TV built in until then there are
