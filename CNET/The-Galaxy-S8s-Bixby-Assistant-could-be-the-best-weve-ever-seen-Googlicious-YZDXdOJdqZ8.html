Google issues for everything Google you
can think of the official Galaxy s8
announcement is just a week away but
Samsung is already dropping some
knowledge on us about their Vic's Pai
assistant that will be their flagship
software feature on the new s8 now in an
official press release Samsung describes
how Bixby is different than any other
voice assistance in three areas the
first one is called completeness where
Samsung says a Bigsby enabled app will
be able to support almost every task the
app is capable of now other platforms
might support some tasks but Bixby will
be complete so you won't be unsure what
things it can or can't do
now the second context awareness mix we
will understand the current context and
state of the application to help carry
out the work in progress
it could be something along the lines of
an even better version of Google now on
tap feature for the Galaxy S 8 and the
third is what they call cognitive
tolerance where Bixby will be able to
understand commands with incomplete
information and execute it or ask for
follow-up information see there's plenty
of times or halfway I might forget
exactly what I'm saying so it will be
interesting to see how this works with
Bixby in real-world use now Bixby is the
result of Samsung's acquisition of viv
the original Siri team that took their
AI to a whole new level with viv Samsung
says a subset of pre-installed apps will
be Bixby enabled on launch third-party
developers can make their apps Bixby
enabled as well now it will also be
expanding to other Samsung products like
a washing machine or a TV set and will
live in the cloud for Internet connected
devices ai is the future I'm excited so
we'll see how this all comes together on
March the 29th
now FM blast is back at it again with
new leaks for the s8 and si+ this time
it's the three colors we should expect
to see in black sky orchid gray and
arctic silver take a look see that grand
silver though they look pretty similar
from the sides now images of another one
this time in violet have been posted by
KK sneak leaks we're not sure if this is
an actual color yet or a prototype but
hey it's out there
okay bloomberg reports Samsung's
seit will use facial recognition for
mobile payments within months of its
release up to this point it's been used
for phone and locking on the s8 but
Samson will now use it for mobile
services and financial applications
including Samsung pay this would add a
new tech feature that no other flagship
phone currently has and it's already
working with banks to help them embrace
facial recognition systems now the name
for this feature has not been leaked but
I'm really rooting for either face pay
or pay face I know they sound ridiculous
but you know what you tell me what you
want it to be called now I've been blast
dropped more bombs with a European
pricing for the new s8 and SAT with the
s8 starting at 799 euros while the
larger s8 plus is expected to be 100
more at 899 euros now that converts
roughly to 850 u.s. dollars for the s8
and 966 dollars for the s8 plus but
these are pricings for the European
regions and we don't expect them to
convert directly for US markets now
we're also expecting a new gear VR and
an all new gear 360 camera at the event
as well
all right Google has released the
Developer Preview for Android oh no
official name has been given but we're
leaning on Ori oh come on that's a
no-brainer their top priority better
battery life and better Android OS
performance over all new features you'll
now have fine-grained control over
different types of notifications picture
and picture display to watch video while
doing other tasks and adaptive icons
that will be selected based on the
device now Android Oh is still
unfinished and more features will roll
out but the idea is to get it into
developers hands early and if you're
tired of new apps and games coming out
on iOS first it's not going to change
anytime soon but Super Mario run is
finally making its way to Android on the
Play Store on March the 23rd now there
were more than 10 million downloads on
its first day for iOS and it generated
more than 4 million dollars on its first
day but only 5% of users paid the hefty
$10 price tag to unlock the entire game
now it really wasn't that great of a
game so after waiting for over three
months I'm not sure if the Android world
really cares nearly as much about it all
right that's going to do it for this
week you can email me at Google issues
at cnet.com or tweet me at brian tom
thanks so much for watching I will catch
you next time for some more of that
Google is
you're delicious</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
