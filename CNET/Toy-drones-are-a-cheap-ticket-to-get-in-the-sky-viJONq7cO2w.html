don't want to shell out hundreds just to
fly around your backyard welcome to the
big world of small toy drones also known
as multi rotors or quad copters or UAVs
or those little remote-controlled
aircrafts that you can torment your
friends family and co-workers with they
come in all shapes and sizes from tiny
ones you can fit in your pocket to
larger ones that you can fly indoors or
out and most of them are less than $100
and they weigh less than nine ounces so
in the US you don't need to register
with the FAA to fly them outdoors you
won't get a lot of bells and whistles
but you can find some the Cadoo flips on
their own or have cameras for shooting
photos and video and first-person view
flying since toy drones can be trickier
to pilot than those costing hundreds
more you'll want to look for models that
can handle a lot of crashes or can be
easily repaired with readily available
parts keep in mind too that flight times
are typically between five to eight
minutes and the batteries can take
upwards of an hour to charge so unless
you want the fun to be over fast go with
one that has a removable battery then
again five minutes might be just enough
time to satisfy your urge to take flight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
