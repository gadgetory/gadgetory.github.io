it launched the oneplus one a high-end
phone with impressive specs that cost
only $300 today oneplus has gained a
loyal fan base and its newest marque
phone the oneplus 5 packs a lot of
high-powered specs that many come to
expect first it has two rear cameras one
of which is a telephoto lens you can
also take bouquet portraits that feature
an artsy blurred background only a
couple of dual camera phones do this
including the Apple iPhone 7 plus the
effect can get patchy on both phones
especially when the objects outline is
tricky the iPhone is a slightly better
job at dealing with these situations and
its depth of field effect looks more
natural
but overall the five does well to stand
against the iPhone in dim settings the
five to comparatively better shots than
the Google pixel - which is known for
its excellent handling of low-light
pictures the five also has a snapdragon
835 chipset in benchmark test it beat
major competitors like the Samsung
Galaxy s8 the pixel and the LG G 6 and
real-world usage like firing the camera
shutter typing on the keyboard and
launching apps with buttery smooth the v
doesn't have a removable battery and it
has a slightly lower battery capacity
than before with the battery actually
last longer and during our lab tests for
battery usage the v clocked at an
impressive 17 hours and 50 minutes on
average as for software everything's
pretty much the same which is a good
thing because there's barely any
bloatware and you get a pretty skinless
version of Android there's also Google
assistant built-in ok Google where are
we
here's a map of seller Bob Garden San
Francisco California nine four one two
two and there's a couple of minor useful
features like a reading mode for reading
text and the ability to schedule a night
mode to take your display but there's
always room for improvement for one
thing it's not water resistant this
isn't a huge knock but it's one of the
key features if you want your phone to
stay competitive with other flagships
it's design is also feeling very
familiar at this point and it's not as
inexpensive as it was before at four
hundred seventy nine dollars for the 64
gig version and five hundred thirty-nine
dollars for the 128 gig model one plus
five continues to go a few notches
higher than its game changing $300 price
ahead when it first debuted nevertheless
the one plus five is an excellent phone
with a superb camera that can hold its
own against the iPhone and pixel it's
one of the fastest and most powerful
phones and it cost hundreds of dollars
less than its high-end competitors</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
