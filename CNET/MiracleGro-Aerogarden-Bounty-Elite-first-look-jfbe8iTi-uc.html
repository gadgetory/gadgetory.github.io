gardening is a lot of work you have to
have time-space motivation and at least
a little bit of know-how to get a garden
going but here's the thing you can still
grow food right on your countertop with
little to no effort indoor planting
systems like the AeroGarden bounty elite
from Miracle Grow make it super simple
to grow your own garden inside no matter
how bad your gardening skills are this
system which starts at two hundred and
forty nine dollars even comes with a
special bonus it hooks up to your home's
Wi-Fi network so you can keep track of
your plants when you're away the bouncy
elite is made up of a container for your
plants and water and bright LED lights
after you assemble the bounty elite you
follow the quick plant instructions on
the touchscreen control you have to
select what types of plants you will
grow and the bounty elite will tell you
how long it will leave the LED lights on
for optimal growth to get started you
add about a gallon of water to the
container
Erol garden gives you non plants to
start your first garden and they come in
these little pods that are pre packed
with seeds in dirt the AeroGarden pods
give you all the info you need about
each plant you're gonna grow on the
label you'll see the name of the plant
how long it takes for it to sprout and
how tall it will grow you pop the pods
into their own slots on the bounty elite
then you place little plastic cups over
each pod which creates a greenhouse
effect in which the seeds will start to
emerge then you add a little liquid
plant food to the bounty elite and from
there you let nature well more like the
gardening system do its thing we expect
to see some action in the next week but
until then enjoy not getting my hands
