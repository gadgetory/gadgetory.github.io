in recent times with the success of
vinyl records one music label has gone
back to basics with an all analog studio
and a sound that harks back to the 60s
and labels like Motown and Stax dapped
own records
located in the converted house in
Bushwick Brooklyn is home to such
artists as Sharon Jones &amp;amp; the dap-kings
and Charles Bradley DAP tone is also
recorded artists such as Amy Winehouse
and Australia's king gizzard and the
lizard wizard engineer and producer
Wayne Gordon showed me around the small
studio it's packed with vintage gear
which includes a massive Hammond b3
organ and an old-school 8-track
reel-to-reel recorder which is used for
all of the sessions Wayne told me that
the limitations of analog actually
helped the creative process if someone
comes in and records a guitar solo and
they say hey I want to record it again
you asked them okay we can do it again
but if you do it you're gonna you're
gonna go over your other guitar solo
even with vocals that happens a lot of
times and then you see this thing in
their head with it they kind of make
that decision like okay you know this is
probably the best I can do and then you
have some words like you know I know I
could definitely do better every note on
adapt own recording was played by the
band in the studio not fabricated later
in other words it's an auto-tune free
zone there's no undo there's no thing
dapped own has been around since 2001
and it was built with the help of the
musicians who actually record their the
thing about this place that's why it
feels magical is because it's not like a
label where you know say you're a
personnel and you're walking you say oh
that's
everybody we're family everybody's
friends and when someone's down
someone's gonna give you a call and be
like yo what's wrong
you know let's pick you up let's go have
lunch let's talk about it you know like
that's that's the vibe this place and
even even as far as records if someone's
working on the record
you know everybody's around to say I'm
here to help what do you need to make
your record happy you know it's a it's a
very family affair
Wayne says that while he loves recording
in the space he says that the gear is
secondary to the people who record there
he says that in the age of fixing it in
Pro Tools there's no substitute for a
good musician you can buy a compressor
you can buy the same way you can buy you
know the same guitar but you can buy the
same Claire like that's just something
you can't do the paper I'm bold enough
to say 95% of the magic and his records
are comes down to musicians you know and
I think for me the way I look at it it's
my job to just kind of capture that
while Wayne works primarily as an
engineer adapter he has also produced
one of my favorite new bands the mystery
lights
he said replicating their live show was
his main priority even gave the singer
handheld mic so he could jump around as
he sang there's this energy they have
about him I don't be ever so that's what
you kind of want to capture and that was
definitely something I've always really
gained on well some producers obsess
over every detail for Wayne it's the
field which is intrinsic to the depth
own sound it's more important than
fixing mistakes we're not sitting here
doing brain surgery you know what we're
making music I mean it's not that we're
gonna do is going to destroy the world
if anything we're helping the world no
matter what we do Steve Guttenberg for
