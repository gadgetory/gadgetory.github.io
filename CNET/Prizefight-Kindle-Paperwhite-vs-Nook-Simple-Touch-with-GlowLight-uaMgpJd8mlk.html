I'm Brian Tong and Irie ders continued
to be a red hot product so we're
throwing to see net editor's choice
readers into the ring it's a prize five
foot out between the Amazon Kindle
paperwhite with special offers and the
Barnes Noble looks simple touch with
glow light both price of one hundred and
$19 our judges for this fight are
executive editor John the melty Falcone
executive editor David the bad-boy car
Noi and myself really a ding dong that
will take all three judges scores and
average them out to the nearest tenth
each round the final prize five score
will be an average of all rounds using
the same system we're going five rounds
deep first up is designed Amazon's
Kindle paperwhite streamlines it's
designed with an all black border that
takes design cues from the entire Kindle
family its minimalist design brings a
soft rubber backside and it's about 20%
thinner compared to the Nook but a
little heavier in weight now the notes
simple touch with glow light has a
unique ereader design with rounded
corners accented by a gray border and a
contoured boodle design that's more
ergonomic and comfortable to hold we
wish it was a little thinner but it's
smaller footprint is still nice I like
curves but the judges overall give the
Kindle paperwhite the edge with a
perfect 5 and the note blue light gets a
4.7 next round is navigation and inner
the Kindle paperwhite removes all
physical buttons except for a power
button at the bottom the lack of a
central home button at the bottom means
you'll always have to change your hand
position whenever you want to access
your toolbar by tapping at the top or
even turning on the built-in light that
can be annoying now it's all touch
interface uses a capacitive touchscreen
for turning pages with a swipe and its
overall a tad bit snappier to use now
since we're comparing the special offers
version you'll always have a banner on
your home screen and your screen saver
so that can take away from the
experience
now the Nook brings both touch and
physical control navigation when reading
books you can move through the pages by
either touching or swiping the screen or
using the physical controls on the side
to turn pages pressing the center brings
up more settings and options the home
button is the heart of the navigation
easy to access and it brings up the main
toolbar plus holding it down activates
the glow light for reading and overall
the feel and controls here are just
better so this gets a perfect 5 and the
Kindle get to 4 after averaging 2 rounds
the note takes the lead next round is
features the Kindles biggest feature is
its new screen with the paperwhite
built-in light that's brighter and is
lit a little more consistently plus its
screen resolution is higher for slightly
crisper text now my favorite reading
feature is x-ray mode that breaks down
important characters or locations but
it's not available for all books and
time to read let you know when you'll
finish a chapter now you want to find a
headphone jack or speakers anymore but
you'll still get an experimental web
browser that I recommend you never use
ever now another killer feature is
Amazon's lending library and if you're
an Amazon Prime member you'll have
access to 180,000 books that you can
borrow including the entire Harry Potter
series and that's huge now the new Clio
Lite was the first eReader to bring the
backlit screen that set the standard and
it still works great but it's a tad bit
behind now that the Kindle is caught up
and improve their screen resolution but
the Kindle can't match the nooks SD card
expansion slot for storing more content
you can go into a physical retail store
and read a selection of books for free
and native epub support is a big deal
for hardcore users it also comes with
its own power adapter you can't say the
same for the Kindle that just has a USB
cable and you won't have to look at
special offers all the time both the
e-readers support overdrive for
borrowing books from local libraries
they can both lend books to other users
there's PDF reading support and social
hooks for Facebook and Twitter this
round's Jam pack features but the Kindle
takes it with the 4.7 and the note gets
a 4.3 next round is performance the
Kindle brings a pretty ridiculous
eight-week battery life with the
backlight on that's just dirty good it
also has a higher resolution screen and
it's slightly faster to navigate
compared to the note now the Nook has a
one month battery life with the glow
light on and that's impressive but just
not as impressive the Kindle paperweight
takes this round with a 4.3 and the note
glow light jets of 4dr averaging for
around we're tied at 4.5 the final round
that decides it all is ecosystem if
you've ever heard the phrase content is
king this is where Amazon shines Amazon
has 180,000 Kindle exclusive titles and
often offers slightly better prices but
you'll pretty much find the top books on
both stores now Amazon's lending library
is also a huge differentiator if you pay
for Amazon Prime
both ear eaters offer books magazines
and newspapers and you can even download
games on your Kindle Barnes &amp;amp; Noble just
can't match the Amazonian beast when it
comes to content and the Kindle takes
this round with a 4.7 and the Nook
Simple Touch with glowlight
gets a 4 so let's average out all 5
rounds and in a battle where the Nook
flow light came out hit and hard the
Kindle paperwhite fought back hard
taking the last three rounds and the new
kid on the block takes this battle 4
point 5 to 4 point 4 and is your prize
fight winner i'm bryan song thanks for
watching we'll catch you guys next time
on another price
