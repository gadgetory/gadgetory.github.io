the apple buy for everything good at-bat
inside the world of Apple lots of big
things happening this week but let's
start off with the Apple TV now Apple
continues to insist on calling it the
future of television but the future
might have to wait that's after
bloomberg reports CBS CEO les Moonves
who also owned cnet said that Apple has
put its live TV plans on hold at a
conference this week now Rico is peter
kafka reports the main issue was apple's
push for a skinny bundle of channels
priced at less than thirty dollars per
month Apple is interested in a base
package of about a dozen channels but
the report says content owners didn't
want their additional networks to be
left out of the base package now Moonves
added that it will eventually happen but
media companies are still showing
resistance to apple's plan now if Apple
can't get this together by 2016 it will
be a huge fail and will show us really
the lack of power they have with TV
studios sling TV and Sony's PlayStation
view did it Apple should be able to do
it as well but for now the big a is
pushing their app store and allowing
media companies to deliver content
through their apps a feature that's been
around for years on roku amazon in the
chromecast unfortunately that doesn't
sound like the future of television to
anyone alright if you're thinking of
getting an Apple watch with those 100
dollar off holiday deals you've seen
them you might want to hold off on that
9to5 mac reports Apple is planning a
march 2016 event to unveil the second
generation Apple watch the Apple watch
two would then ship out sometime in
April nearly a year after the original
Apple has been working on the next watch
before the first one even shipped with
some prototypes including a FaceTime
camera its own Wi-Fi to be independent
of the iphone and a thinner form factor
with similar battery life this could
make new Apple watches a more worthwhile
purchase but I would highly advise you
to wait it out for now the report also
says the rumored iphone 6c that we've
talked about in the past could also
appear at the event alright Apple
released some new hardware this weekend
if you saw it you know it wasn't pretty
this is the $99 Apple smart battery case
for the iphone 6s this is also what it
looks like
when the iphone 6s swallows an iphone 5
now this eyesore is from a company that
was believed to have one of the best
design teams ever until now Apple biters
own spry flies on Twitter called it the
Hunchback of Apple DOM and we've already
had battery cases from mophie and
incipio for at least four or five years
but come on Apple there has to be some
technical benefit for the user if you
made something this ugly right well you
can see the battery status of your
iPhone end case together in the
notifications pull down but the apple
case only gets you eighty percent
additional charge compared to a juice
pack air from mophie that gives you a
one hundred percent charge for this same
$99 price this isn't inventive at all
slapping on an apple logo and hoping
users will buy the apple branded version
come on let's be real it's also just
plain fugly and you know what that gets
a bad dirty rotten apple I'm literally
embarrassed for this company right now
Apple the one obsessed with making their
phones as slim as possible is now making
their own battery case because their
phones are too thin to get quality
battery life yeah okay another piece of
hardware that I'm actually happy about
the big a has released a lightning to SD
card reader that supports the iPad pros
faster USB 3.0 transfer speeds to import
photos and videos you can also use the
adapter with iPhones but it won't get
the faster transfer speeds it costs
twenty nine dollars and is available now
there's also a lot of software updates
across all Apple hardware this week i OS
9.2 fixes the issue where ipad pros
would become unresponsive after charging
thank you you can also take advantage of
the mail drop feature that allows you to
attach files up to five gigs in size and
it makes iphones compatible with the
adapter we just talked about but Apple
still hasn't fixed the fact that video
podcasts in the podcast app cannot be
viewed in full-screen I mean what are
you doing Apple this is a simple fix and
you're still getting a bad apple for
this
All Right Watch OS 2.1 gets mostly bug
fixes and improvements with arabic
language support for Siri and TV OS 9.1
now allows Syria to play Apple music for
users but an even bigger deal support
for the remote app is back for the new
Apple TV and I know a lot of you will
love that all right that's going to do
for this week so we're getting close to
the end of the year so if you have any
questions you'd like to ask to our good
friend no show Tongass for the Apple
bites prediction show send them to the
apple byte at cnet com or tweet me at
brian Tong and will include your
questions in next week's show this
question thanks so much watching we'll
catch y'all next time for another bite
of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
