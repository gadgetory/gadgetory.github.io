you're probably alone in a car a rather
big machine with a slew of empty seats
and three to four thousand pounds of
metal plastic and glass on four wheels
anything about that strike you as out of
balance in this scene that conversation
we meet a guy who thinks so he's put
together a company that believes the
perfect vehicle lies somewhere between
your car a motorcycle and a spinning top
she beautiful Daniel Kim is the founder
of San Francisco's lit motors and this
prototype is called the c12 wheels like
a bike fully enclosed like a car and
self-balancing like nothing you've ever
seen it does print motorcycle in that I
see it's got two wheels that you know
are lined up like a motorcycle but it
doesn't what am I seeing it doesn't
prove motorcycle in many other ways
right well it's the best of both worlds
so the only motorcycle part would be the
fact that it has two wheels yeah
and that at tilton leans oh that's tears
everything else is basically it has all
the creature comforts of a car and the
safety it's more than a fairing it's got
a full body right it's fully enclosed so
you can be your daily commuter you can
drive in the rain you could take it up
the mountain driving the snow you're
riding in your helmet so no leathers no
helmet no boots this is one of those
interesting things about this vehicle
Daniel is that it's basically you said
it's like you you're driving your helmet
right but you're also driving your
fishbowl you need great visibility when
you're driving a motorcycle that's a
paramount from a safety standpoint is
incredibly important to be seen really
yeah yeah of course we're having all of
this body uh-huh makes a bigger
statement that I'm here I mean your
guests bottle yeah I'm in your blind
spot I'm crossing the road you know I am
oh I'm going into your field of view
compare this to a motorcycle this is a
thousand times safer
but without a doubt the headline on the
Siwon is its ability to stay upright on
its own even in the event of a side
impact collision thanks to a couple of
gyros that are unique to this vehicle so
this is where I want you to show me the
secret sauce yeah absolutely
oh one of the secret sauce but the
lining is the most unique to what I've
seen your story is the idea that it's a
two wheeler tandem two wheeler it
doesn't fall down absolutely you made a
kind of a high-tech weeble here yeah you
know it wasn't just me it was a you know
with the help of a great engineering
team so but you know our paths are
basically in the controls for these
gyroscopes so here are two of our
gyroscopes our first full-scale attempt
and there's a slardar wheel on the
inside that spins it like seven to ten
thousand rpms and this is outputting
around five hundred foot-pounds of
torque that's a lot of torque adds a lot
of torque and that torque is used to
keep this thing upright yep so in every
situation you'll be stable we actually
bring safety to motorcycles okay so
here's the gyroscopic technology in
action I mean these guys have got this
thing I'm I'm putting a hand on it here
and I can feel it resists
it resists any interest in going over
puppets it's like it's got a will of its
own it's pretty impressive and it's just
those two gyros down there
creating these hundreds of foot-pounds
of torque
aside from balancing itself
Kim's tea names for the c1 to do zero to
60 in about six seconds 120 mile an hour
top speed and arrange pushing 200 miles
on a full charge that should take no
more than a handful of hours at most
now the real test cuz I'm I'm tall
enough to test any car let's see how I
fit in here works yeah yeah my knees
aren't up against anything that's kind
of a win for me great you still have a
couple inches behind you so yeah the
room is actually quite good great it's
quite good now tell me about your big
idea here all right so the big picture
is you know August go to mass production
there's a huge energy problem and
transportations the biggest one the
biggest pies to that so we're looking
really to change the way people move
around I basically create a very
efficient platform and bring a lot of
value to you know not just the United
States but also developing countries
where two wheels are actually a
necessity but you weren't just aiming at
the developing world with this it's
everywhere it's everywhere there's a
two-wheeler that's necessity so anywhere
there's a traffic jam a two-wheeler is
great for splitting lanes or chopping
off 20% of your commute it's incredibly
sustainable platform you know this is
the future of Transportation to be sure
the c1 is a ways off if all goes well
deliveries will begin in late 2014
at around $24,000 but even as it sits
today without paint windows or even a
decent seat it's part of a renaissance
of new ways of imagining how we handle
transportation with a little more
balance</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
