heartbleed had top websites like Yahoo
Facebook and Google scrambling to make
their site secure the attacker can
listen in on website traffic and stuff
that's supposed to be encrypted can
actually be decrypted as it's getting
bounced back and forth between you
communicating with the site and the site
receiving your communication that means
usernames passwords credit card numbers
home addresses phone numbers and all
kinds of information could be stolen the
problem stems from encryption software
called openssl some of the major tech
sites like YouTube Instagram and
Wikipedia say they have addressed the
vulnerability and have been fixed while
other companies like PayPal chase and
LinkedIn say they were not impacted use
a website checker last past calm /
heartbleed is an excellent one that's
been kept up to date on whether sites
are vulnerable or not but if you're
tempted to change your password right
away you might want to hold off if you
choose a new password now and then the
site fixes the problem you're just gonna
have to choose another new password in a
couple of days when when they implement
the fix if you have some critical
banking do it in person or on the phone
I would stay away from your banking site
I'd stay away from your bank's mobile
app as well but it's really up to the
websites to ensure security for its
users well make sure your password is
good we also have something called we
call two-step authentication where you
have to have both your password and your
phone to login for the latest
