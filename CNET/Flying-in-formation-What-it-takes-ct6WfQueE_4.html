are
so just flew with the frailing jet team
I'm here with Paco who was flying me
around I was in the back there
and you know when we were really close
by ten feet from each other right yeah
we're about ten feet from each other
that's right we are enduring between
four and five years which is four to
five times the gravity of forces yeah
we're really close together you know
there's a lot of news about self-driving
cars they have like lidar and radar
cameras for anti-collision do we have
any anti-collision stuff in these planes
yeah we've got a very big one what was
the brain this is you there yeah so
everyone else is just looking at the
instrument yeah it's your skills your
eyes your detection of all four are you
it's just thanks to our experience we
can manage to fly so close there's also
a lot of talk about virtual reality
these days do you think anyone can
actually replicate what we just went
through in there because it seems like
with all the g-forces that we're feeling
seems like it's not easily created again
yeah
what it once with 360 cameras that we
get on the plane and after you just have
to get the virtual Google you know the
masks and you can turn on the air on the
right on the left and you can see of the
difference plane but you cannot feel
really the sensation of G's even during
a loop unless maybe you wear a flight
suit that's the the flight suit we were
during the flight and in fact it prevent
the blood from going down when you take
Jesus for example at 5 G's your weight
is 5 ton your normal weight so it
inflates and it prevents the blood from
going down so you could have a sensation
of taking G's if you're whether in a
virtual virtual world so if you were in
the student you can feel the pressure in
those locations as long that suits on
you but I know that when we're in there
there's that immediate feeling on your
face see there's like oh wait I feel
pressure on the face can't recreate that
with the suit right away no we cannot
the speed was 350 miles per hour
350 miles an hour I know these things
are up to about 450 yeah yeah we were
taking it easy yeah okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
