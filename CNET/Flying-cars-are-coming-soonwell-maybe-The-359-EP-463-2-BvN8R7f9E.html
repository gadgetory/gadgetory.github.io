I'm alfred Aang
uber wants to make flying cars a reality
our colleague Clare Riley traveled to
Tokyo to cover an uber conference that's
focused on the ride hailing company's
skyward ambitions uber plans to start
trials in three pilot cities as soon as
2023 and already has designs for its air
taxis Alfred how realistic do you think
any of this is I get it pilot cities
haha I mean I think the technology is
probably there for it I think there's
gonna probably be a lot of you know
issues that come with it as it starts
and I think you have a much less room
for errors when it comes to flying cars
I mean like take a look at the you know
Technica the technology ubers testing
out on us roads with like self-driving
cars you would know what happened with
that one fatal accident in Arizona I
believe you're right about that yeah and
then you know you kind of take a look at
it from the perspective perspective of
flying cars now where you know I think
there's a lot more dangers that come
with that and I think that's why I think
it'll be a while before it comes to the
u.s. so they've talked about this before
where they want to do it in countries
where governments are much more likely
to be willing to work with them and also
govern more lacs
yeah not lakhs but more so that like
they don't have all this like
bureaucratic red tape to go through
where it's kind of like dictatorship
countries where they can kind of just
say what do you want to do this and
we'll do it yeah an interesting element
that I saw from this related to the
autonomous vehicles on the ground were
that they eventually want to make these
autonomous flying cars they eventually
want to make them autonomous as well by
2030 so I guess that would make them a
little bit safer potentially or at least
they'd make them cost a lot less if you
don't have pilots for every single one
of them so you know kind of kind of hard
to tell I'm not really sure what I feel
about this so I'm gonna put it in the
same file as Elon Musk creating a moon
base and Amazon's delivery drones I'm
not really sure that's a big file of big
promises from tech companies that like
we're not really sure like
where this is going but it sounds cool
yeah it's fun to write about that's for
sure
next up instagrams founders are heading
out the door instagram CEO Kevin Systrom
and chief financial officer Mike Krieger
will be leaving in the coming weeks the
departure comes and it seemingly as
another seemingly bad piece of news for
instagrams owner Facebook which is
having a really rough year now they
didn't specifically say why they were
leaving the company but this comes after
Yann Combe who was the founder of
whatsapp also decided to leave Facebook
this year that was back in April so I
don't know what do you think about this
one there was a report in The Washington
Post today that basically mentioned that
they had issues with Mark Zuckerberg
which was also the same reason why
whatsapp founder left and for keeping
score here I also clearly remember
Facebook's legal officer leaving I
believe in August and that's coming
after another so you know these are
several big rounds of executives leaving
Facebook and this is a company that you
know they could have been making
millions at and for them to choose to
leave there they also met the instrument
founders mentioned that they want to you
know channel their creative energy more
are they gonna make the next Instagram
or something like that it's hard to tell
but I mean it definitely is a badge line
for Facebook when you know all these all
this talent is choosing to get out of
the company yeah absolutely
last tech analyst ming chi quo reported
that sales of the iPhone 10's max I
actually got that right is far
outselling the smaller 10s this makes a
lot of sense to me because if anybody's
gonna buy like a cheaper new iPhone I
feel like they would get the 10r instead
so if you're gonna go and buy one
immediately you probably want to get the
maxilla and if you already have a 10
it's kind of just why would I get the
10s when there's not that many
differences but in 10s max you know I
have much more reason to get that if I
already own a 10
yeah so according to this analysts it's
actually it's it's basically like for
every three or four cell sales of the
max that's like one sale of the 10s so
it's doing a lot better anyway if you
want to read more about these stories
check us out on CNN I'm Ben Fox Ruben
I'm malphur ding thanks for listening
all right thanks everybody for stopping
by and joining us for the recording of
the audio podcast which you can
subscribe to using the links below now
we want to take your questions in
comments to keep the conversation going
first and foremost James bless you many
people are scared of flying in normal
planes I'm not sure flying cars are
going to take off zing I don't get it
that's the other thing that we didn't
mention on the podcast by the way was
the whole issue with infrastructure uber
has said that they were gonna spend
something like I don't know a hundred
million dollars or a hundred million
dollars a year to create these sky ports
which are basically you know is the same
thing of as a heliport where you you get
up and you take off and you land for
these flying cars but I think that the
infrastructure as Claire mentions in her
story is gonna be much more extensive
than that and ultimately it's gonna it's
gonna take a lot of time to try to
figure out how you're gonna fit all
these additional vehicles into the sky
they're supposed to fly somewhere
between a thousand and two thousand feet
in the air if I remember correctly I
mean that's that's always been something
really interesting that I I feel was
never addressed in any like futuristic
movies that have flying cars they just
like you really think that there would
be no such thing as traffic if like
flying cars existed like Futurama was
probably the best at like show it being
realistic about it yeah I'm sorry the
problem with the Fifth Element was that
that was probably the most dangerous
situation you could ever consider with
flying cars I mean like Bruce Willis
made it look really cool and interesting
but he was flying in between buildings
going up and down that's that's like
yeah dangerous for most people and then
what happens if it's like a police chase
or something like that with flying cars
then what I don't know it sounds like an
awesome movie but I very my point like
that there's a lot of like boring like
issues that come with flying cars I I
think when people like to think of
flying cars like yeah go anywhere and
then you'd like don't really think about
you know all the regulations that would
like be in place like traffic laws and
things like that is oh cool way to take
something really cool and make it sound
like really drab so yeah that's my job
here at sea nice going going in that
direction
- so apparently these cars are supposed
to be battery charged so they could
travel up to 60 miles on a single charge
and then they would get like you know
you could you could rapidly increase the
battery charge in as little as eight
minutes or something but it's still it's
another one of those issues where it's
it's probably gonna be really expensive
initially and it could only go 60 miles
I don't know why they have to be cars
why don't we have flying scooters like
like bird the bird scooters you could
make a flying bird yeah maybe I don't
even just like rent them and like dock
them and stuff even one like the roof of
a building because they have giant wings
like a Pegasus at least then I would
kind of get it and think the wings are
overrated
okay okay we'll think of something maybe
a bunch of birds will fly it around I
don't know ready for some more questions
I think so - says I hope flying cars are
autonomous people can't drive in two
dimensions
could you imagine people driving in
three expanding on that Mike Shaw is
asking what the flying cars be able to
talk to each other with 5g and even
further down in the chat Alex Mitchell's
standing it's more likely that when this
all comes fruition we're gonna be on to
6g and beyond yeah probably
I mean having the cars talk to each
other this is completely hypothetical
but making sure that the cars could
actually talk to each other especially
if they're autonomous makes a lot of
sense and that's probably how they would
actually do it and make sure that it
would be safer that's the same idea with
autonomous vehicles on the road as well
where if the cars are not only
autonomous but have some amount of
awareness around them they could
significantly reduce the number of
accidents because they would know what
other cars were not only in front of
them behind them but also around the
corner across the city so you would have
to do something similar to that with
flying cars yeah that's really the only
way I would see flying cars working out
in a safe way just in the sense like if
if people are try are driving their own
flying cars it's like there there's
gonna be a lot of accidents and to me it
seems like this is initially gonna be
like a cheaper version of having like a
private helicopter yeah that's how
they're gonna start it and if they have
any plans on making the
a mass-market thing they would have to
make them autonomous that's where
they're hoping to save money the initial
cost of uber air they say at lunch would
be $6 per passenger mile traveled so $6
a mile
$6 a mile that's kind of crazy I mean
how much is a taxi cab in New York
definitely not six definitely not dial I
like it's somewhere between $1 to it's
like two to three dollars so yeah that
so more than double but hey you get to
tell your friends that you showed up at
the party and from a flying car I can
tell my friends that anyway what are
they gonna do go outside and look for
the flying car like that's your friends
are much more gullible than my friends
but yeah that's that's a good ok but
even if you did even if you did show up
in a flying car and you told your
friends that they still wouldn't believe
you if your friends aren't gullible they
wouldn't believe you it like you're
right anyway more questions sir enjoy
what are the rules for public airspace
usage that's a complicated one I don't
know how well that we can dive into that
they're working on that same issue with
drones too they're hoping to get like
different bands of public airspace where
they would utilize drones that's the
area that I know about specifically
because I cover Amazon so I feel like
the band between a thousand and two
thousand feet in the air they would hope
to create that to allow for air taxis or
flying cars so my assumption is is that
they would have to create new
regulations to make sure that that area
would be workable but again this is all
caveat on the fact that like none of
this exists and this is gonna take a
really long time for them to air this
out so air it out nice thank you
Wow I'm totally not doing any of these
on purpose but my puns are really taken
off so thank you I mean it's not like we
had Highlands about flying cars for
decades I mean this isn't a new idea but
I'm excuse me
plan to actualize it it's just like for
some reason anytime something cool in a
cartoon or a movie happens in real life
it just doesn't seem as cool anymore
like when when like Scott watch's came
when smartwatches came out like all the
commercials for them were basically
you'll remember when Dick Tracy had like
he could talk into his watch and then
remember you know like the Power Rangers
had they're like watching and things
like that check it out now Samsung we've
got our own SmartWatch and then it's
just like this isn't cool anymore like
this it's like when your mom joined
Facebook yeah I agree with you though in
that I mean like if I got an Apple watch
and my friends got Apple watches like we
couldn't create Voltron and that's
really a no very uncool
yeah it's super super sucky but if you
got the flying cars made your step
closer then look it's real min the
flying car with your watch and then yeah
crash them into each other like a giant
robot
more questions James asked if this is
gonna have any kind of impact on
Airlines would cheap flight Airlines be
affected by this kind of an
implementation great question probably
not because these would be much shorter
like in city fly yes I mean we haven't
figured out fuel efficiency and they're
talking about six bucks a mile do you
think you're gonna take this to the next
county or state override yeah I imagine
it'd be really expensive I feel like it
to be comparing the differences it's
between like having your own car versus
taking a bus mmhmm yeah yeah it's like I
think Airlines would still be the
cheaper and probably safer option well
for now they're only talking about 60
miles on a single charge so you're not
gonna take a flying car Norwood I think
that it would make any logical sense to
like go from New York to LA in a flying
car it wouldn't it wouldn't work that
way I don't I don't believe so there's
the they would be in cities and maybe
the farthest you would go is like to go
from the city to visit your nice grass I
will say it is a very it's a much nicer
alternative to taking the subway if
we're available in New York mm-hmm
because the subway infrastructure is all
like messed up so either they can spend
millions of dollars trying to ears
trying to fix that or just you know do
away with them and have those cuddles
new thing yeah just have those tunnels
be empty where the the mold people can
live mmm
one interesting thing the Claire story
references is that they've done studies
about ride-hailing companies like uber
and lyft and they found that at this
point the
ride hailing companies are just clogging
up the roads a lot more so the idea of
alleviating some of the space and
helping them continue to grow that's a
big reason to create something like uber
air because a lot of the times these
ride-hailing you know the folks that are
working for uber or working for a lyft
are just driving around waiting for
their next ride and they can levitate
instead yeah or they could just be like
sitting on top of skyscrapers so they're
not clogging the roads you know those
parking lots in the city that like are
kind of stacked on top of each other
mm-hmm they don't need the those are
parking garages no no they have like
outside oh right yeah no no I know yeah
buildings where they essentially lift
the cars okay
now I'm following you they don't need
those in order they can just fly it
right into that instead I'm like as
we're talking about this I'm like
progressively being like okay this is
not gonna happen yeah probably in my
lifetime but these are fun questions to
answer so keep them coming
can you imagine driver's ed like what
self-respecting teacher out there which
sign up for this I say let's put a
teenager behind the wheel of one of
these no there they would be a minister
these are gonna be pilots up until the
point that they make them autonomous so
the problem is is that making them
autonomous like did somebody mention the
point that like the like I'm afraid of
like regular flying then like if you're
in an autonomous vehicle or an
autonomous flying car one of them is
gonna crash eventually yeah that does
actually happen who knows how that's
actually gonna impact the market and if
people are gonna be concerned and say
like I don't want to do this anymore
yeah I'm also very curious what the
potential for like terrorist attacks
with like flying cars would be okay
great yeah now this just got super dark
I totally you're absolutely right though
that was a question in the chat yeah
that's I mean it's like legit arson man
it's a totally legitimate point and it's
something that would be happening in
very dense areas like cities so making
them autonomous could also potentially
help with that but at the same time
for you being a cybersecurity reporter
you probably know that any system could
get hacked so and we've seen like some
early signs of that with autonomous
vehicles on the ground yeah I'm very
curious like what the security going
into these cars as far as like that the
pilot programs go is but yeah you know
I'm not going to one of these 23 cities
that they're testing it out and I know
none of them are gonna be in the u.s. no
no that's where you're wrong hold on
three pilot cities Los Angeles Dallas in
the United States and then a third
international city that they haven't
announced no I am wrong but I will be
staying put
yeah I'm very curious about how they got
like the not permits but like you know
just got like the okay to do that in
those cities those it really condensed
like cities are they actually going over
like highways and roads or send out an
airfield kind of area I I would probably
think the latter more sense
I would I would probably think that
these are happening and at airports or
something like that so yeah James is
asking if we know how they're powered
it's gonna be Jets or fans and they're
gonna like blow over stuff in the street
and knock over fences so they're
apparently supposed to be way quieter
than helicopters I'm gonna read this
from Claire story
Uber's design has four sets of twin
rotors that it uses for vertical lift
and a single rotor for forward
propulsion its cruise speed is 150 to
200 miles per hour in an altitude I
mentioned this earlier of 1,000 to 2,000
feet and could travel 60 miles on a
single charge so it would be battery
charged but that so hopefully that
answers the question they do have design
because dash is asking about fuel
efficiency and that's that's not bad
really when you think about it to send a
flying car sixty miles on a single
charge it's really not bad if it's in
gate if it's in the city sure yeah I I
know but it's still very preliminary
like if they actually do these trials by
2023 I'll be pretty impressed and
you know hopefully we send somebody from
seeing it out to Dallas to check them
out well until then we can all just
dream along with sir enjoy about the
Intel volley copter oh yeah
yeah another company called Kitty Hawk I
think Larry Page yeah Larry Page is
backing that one they're also creating
they're developing one there are a
couple companies working on these yeah
so Kitty Hawk is being tested out in Las
Vegas actually got an offer to try it
out
but I don't want to go to Las Vegas so
I'm just gonna wait until it's you know
more accessible but yeah it Larry Page
is you know funding that startup and it
is based not based but like they're
flying it out like in Nevada yeah yeah
and meanwhile there are a lot of trials
that are going on far away from
population centers in the United States
for delivery drones and different types
of drones as well Amazon is working on a
pilot delivery drone project in the UK
right now with like a handful of people
so that's another one to look at but all
of these are now being like very tightly
regulated and controlled so it's gonna
take a while if any of this stuff hits
the mainstream and even when the
technology finally does come to be true
it will be a regulatory nightmare
alright let's move on the Facebook sir
enjoy ask do you think Facebook will now
pull Instagram strings hard enough to
affect it as a social media platform I
just remembered slack acquiring and
killing Astro mail recently while typing
this I I think Facebook has had a really
tough go this year and then really
rocking the boat at Instagram to me
feels like a really bad idea and that's
a great way to instill a lot of fear and
uncertainty for the people that decided
to stick around after the founders left
so if you're definitely trying to get a
bunch of people it'll like walk out the
door really quickly I feel like yeah do
that make a lot of changes really
quickly but at the same time like
Instagram is like one of the primary
gems of Facebook and they are probably
the way they Facebook thinks they're
probably gonna try to like take more
advertising money out of them yeah I
would argue that Instagram is
likely Facebook's future here in the
sense that you know younger folks are
leaving Facebook and you know but then
they'll be like Oh Instagram is still
fine though like there's all these
issues with Facebook that you know for
some reason hasn't really hit Instagram
yet and there it's bet easier for
younger people to go there you know
Instagram stories is pretty popular now
among like teens and you know younger
folks whereas you know Facebook really
isn't that popping anymore mm-hmm
so for them to like for that for the
Instagram founders I mean to kind of
leave like makes me think or like
suggest that Facebook is trying to have
more of an influence on Instagram and
that they might not be that into that
yeah it's the same thing with the
whatsapp founder I think but that's what
happens when you acquire a company
everything is like hunky-dory to begin
with and they say oh we're gonna let you
remain independent but Facebook is a
business
they've also like their stock has
struggled a lot this year so and they
very carefully kept adding more and more
ads into Instagram and I think the
expectation is is that especially with
the founders leaving now Mark Zuckerberg
can kind of have his way and add even
more advertising into Instagram so I
would say expect that but as far as like
big wholesale changes to features I
think that if they are gonna do that
they are gonna roll that out a little
bit more slowly just to not scare the
troops can I just point out that the
generation divide came to be very
prominent in this last bit of
conversation where as what Alfred
described as poppin been equated to
hunky dory yeah I am 52 years old so
hunky dory
I'm 51 yeah just a couple more questions
before we say goodbye Scott Maya do you
think this is the slow decline of
Facebook and do we think it's gonna go
the way of MySpace
no no I mean like MySpace I think it was
a much different like Beast it's it's I
don't think it's fair to make
comparisons between Facebook and MySpace
you know MySpace really hasn't hat like
the dominance that Facebook has had for
such a long time
like considering like if Facebook were a
country like they would have more people
than like the US they would have more
people than India and China put together
yeah that's a better I didn't know if it
would be more than China it's just cuz
I'd be more than China okay I didn't I
forgot about the cool I'm 52 years old
but I'm a little older than you you turn
from 51 52 yeah yeah like comparing
those two is like completely different
like Facebook has had this whole
strategy of we're going to be everything
that you want to go on like that's why
they have like Facebook live that's why
they have like the they bought oculus
that's why they bought Instagram that's
why they bought whatsapp it's it's
myspace was very different in the sense
of like we just want to be like this one
thing like you connected your friends
here and you post chain mails for your
friends to share to five people and the
love of their life will kiss them
tomorrow boy they what not hold on to
that mo for very long but like Facebook
it's kind of like they want to be
everything in the same way that like
Walmart doesn't just sell one thing it's
like they're they want it to be like the
everything store or whatever there's
that what Amazon calls themselves that's
that's what's Amazon's been called but
yeah yeah so they're the everything
social network yeah that's kind of what
Facebook wants to do I mean like there's
a reason why they try it where they bid
for the rights to air what what was it
Thursday Night Football was it did
Facebook Facebook was a part of that
yeah they didn't win it twitter twitter
actually had it on it yeah gotcha yeah
like they're they're really trying to
make it like this is where you go for
everything and Google has done the same
thing so I think that's why it's a
little bit different from Facebook's
perspective now will it be the downfall
of just facebook.com I don't think it's
possible I don't think it'll go away but
I do think that there are like a lot of
younger people that are basically not
really seeing a need or a use for
Facebook anymore or like things are
really but then it's kind of like so I
don't use Facebook anymore but I still
use Facebook messenger which is a part
that's my point though like they're like
setting up everything so that everyone
is on it and even if I'm not using fake
even I'm not posting on somebody's wall
or like wishing somebody happy birthday
or going to events on Facebook I'm still
using messenger to keep in touch with
people I'm still using like
Instagram to upload a photo or something
like that so you can cut off one
tentacle on like Facebook's like Empire
here but like three years will grow back
I'm not growing back but you're still
using like many of its other ones yeah
and when you look at it when you look at
it from a competitive side
nobody is anywhere close to facebook i'm
thinking about snapchat twitter and to a
much smaller extent google+ there were a
lot of expectations that google was
gonna dive in social so it is still a
thing and google has an enormous amount
of resources but they never really saw
the movement yet obviously they were
hoping to get from that at many
congressional hearings Facebook will
always be asked you know do you consider
Facebook of monopoly they've asked us to
Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg and
college stretch and they always
mentioned basically well you know there
the average person uses like 8 apps on
on their phone and Facebook is just one
of them but like if you really take a
look at the numbers it's like ok the
average person uses 8 apps but it's like
Facebook is one of them Instagram is one
of them whatsapp is one of them Facebook
Messenger is one of them I there's
probably a fifth one too but it's just
like ok cool like you're really gonna
try to hide your hand here and say like
yeah Facebook is only one of those 8
apps except we owned like a majority of
the other ones as well well correct me
if I'm wrong here too is that usually
when they're asked that question they
try to broaden it out as much as
possible and they say well if you're
gonna look at this from a social media
perspective obviously we're dominant but
if you look at it broadly from a digital
media yeah or just like a user
consumption perspective we have to
compete with television and radio and
all the other internet sites that you go
on serve to me though in the sense of
yeah like they're saying you know we're
big in social media but we're not big in
like the Internet
which is really funny to me because
anytime like you wouldn't ask an oil
company that like are you a monopoly I
was like well we have to compete with
all of business
like that's not compete with the guy
that tells you it's like we have to
compete with Nike come on guys this is
like that's not like it's such a weird
comparison for me Amazon does the same
art yeah you know where they say
like you know from from an international
perspective Amazon is less than 1%
I think of international retail so but
they also they don't sell they don't
know Big Oil they don't know gas
stations and also by jazz yeah you can't
buy gasoline on amazon.com
come on Bezos I got I got it I got my
fuel from Amazon Prime it came to me in
two days oh that's that's pretty awesome
yeah you ran out of gas the day earlier
prime mobile with prime juice alright
we're just about out of time real quick
on the iPhone Mike Shaw says the iPhone
10s and 10's Mac's
have been so inspiring to him they
inspired him to get the Samsung Note 9
got'em fever says and I think this is
the the most culminating statement about
the entire development here today the
iPhone 10s max is the one with the
biggest change if you're going to
actually get an upgrade you might as
well go all the way through why would
you just get a phone that is almost a
carbon copy the one you already yeah
exactly
except for the price yes yeah I agree
with that argument but like from the
pricing in your town already throwing
money away
yeah so the 10s isn't like kind of this
weird middle child like mode where you
know like if I'm going to get a new
phone and what I want to get the one
that has a larger screen way oh there's
a whole thing with like the the 10s max
and like the are like being the same
size or something everyone ok so the R
is six point one inches and the max is
six point five inches and the 10s is
smaller yeah I think it's five point
eight inches but it's somebody in the
chat correct me on it it's stuck in this
weird phase where if I'm like going to
buy phone why would I get this normal
one that's the same thing as a ten and
even arguably the same thing as the ten
are and slightly smaller than the time I
don't pay more money for it when I can
get like the 10s max or the ten are just
for essentially the the same thing for
$250 less it's it's very weird like
phase right now I don't really
understand why it's there yeah which
Apple kind of showed showed you their
cards a little bit by sun setting of the
Tenten because they were like the ten so
damn similar to the 10s that if we kept
it around people would just buy the ten
if we could cut the price on the ten by
a hundred bucks then why would anybody
bother buying the 10s it doesn't have
any cool new features like an emoji or
whatever yeah yeah yeah I feel like
we're gonna have the Soylent revelation
where it's like the ten s is the ten
right it's people
yes I don't think Alfred gets a
reference no he doesn't he's just the
one I just didn't see the problem with
that like eat people it's fine that
might be the most Millennial thing you
said and that's saying a lot
yeah those are killing people that's not
cool that's the next market that the
Millennials will kill humans all right
we are out of time we gotta get going
