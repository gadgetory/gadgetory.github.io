at the 2014 editions of the razor blade
and the razor blade pro two new gaming
laptops the blade pro big 17 inch laptop
1920 x 1080 non touch display but it
does have that very unique razor feature
that's this smart touch pad over here
it's a glass panel that's a touchpad and
the backlit touchscreen with some
customizable buttons on top of it
they're not that many games and apps
that use it but razor you know is adding
more here and there you certainly not
going to find that on any other gaming
laptop and of course no touchpad here
you got to remember it's all the way
over here much more interesting is the
new 2014 edition of the razor blade this
is still a super slim 14 inch gaming
laptop last year's model looked very
similar had one big problem it had a
1600 x 900 display that was a non touch
display and frankly just didn't look
very good they finally fixed that for
the new version this is of course a
touchscreen it's got edge-to-edge glass
on it and here's the real key not only
is it an IPS screen it is a 3200 x 1800
resolution screen they really took that
weakness from the previous year's model
and turn it into a strength for this
year and of course both these models
have nvidia snoo 800 series graphics
cards this has got the 868 and this has
got to even more powerful 870 em and
they say that you can pretty much take
any current game crank it up to 3200 by
1800 and medium to medium high settings
because you're really pushing so many
more pixels we're just really amazing
with something so thin of course these
don't come cheap this guy's start to
2199 2299 you can add some more SSD
storage that'll drive the price up even
more i'm dan ackerman with a 2014
editions of the razor blade gaming
laptop lineup</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
