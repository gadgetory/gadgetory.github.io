basic general-purpose devices that
probably won't impress you with their
performance
the HP 23 11 X I however has an IPS
screen giving it a few powers beyond
your usual 23 inch err hi I'm Eric
Franklin and today I'll take a first
look at the HP 23 11 X I the X side has
a wide foot stand includes back tilt but
no pivot or height adjustment
technically there's no swivel but you
can slide it around very easily
connections include HDMI DVI and VGA OSD
options feature the usual brightness and
contrast but also color temperature 5
presets and red-green-blue adjustment
options movies display deep blacks in
pretty good color although they do tend
to push a bit too much green games look
vibrant with a high color saturation but
again have that slight green tint to the
images the most impressive thing about
the performance though is the viewing
angle the X I uses an in-plane switching
or IPS panel which gives it really wide
viewing angles very noticeable when
viewing from the bottom of the screen
but also from the sides or top from off
angles like this the IPS panel allows it
to retain this kind of image integrity
that twisted nematic or TN panels don't
have but it's not just that the X eye
has an IPS panel is that it has this
very powerful panel but costs starting
at only $240 which is cheaper than even
some TN panels which usually start at
pretty low prices check my full review
for more info
once again I'm Eric Franklin and this
has been a first look at the HP 2311 x
eye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
