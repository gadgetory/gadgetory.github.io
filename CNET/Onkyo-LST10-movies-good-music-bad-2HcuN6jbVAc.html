poorly as they do these days interest in
sound bars and the newest sound basis
has increased dramatically sound bases
are an evolution on sound bars in that
they are designed to rest your TV upon
them and take advantage of the acoustic
benefits of a bigger box hi I'm Ty
Pendlebury from cnet.com and this is the
onkyo LS t10 this certainly looks the
part and it's heavier than most sound
basis which means you can plunk down
your TV without much worry this onco
features six speakers with two mounted
on the sides for surround type effects
and a subwoofer on the bottom it comes
with a small credit card remote which
controls most of the functions but is
harder to use in the dark
it offers Bluetooth and USB mp3 playback
but you'll probably never use the ladder
as it's not compatible with anything but
flash drives and kind of hard to use
Janka comes with a selection of sound
modes but unfortunately movies and music
sound very similar and that's bad if you
want to listen to music
most music as a result is mushy and the
faux surround effect doesn't help in any
way movies on the other hand are good
with clear dialogue and decent amounts
of boom in action movies the onkyo LST
10 is okay but as a saving of $50 the
sony HT xt-1 is a better rounded
offering with more features and sounds
better with music this has been Taipan
