world that can impress people in Monaco
around breakfast time and do the same
thing in Salt Moritz at lunch the same
day what do you do for an encore you
take the top off let's drive the 2013
view Gatti
Grand Sport Vitesse and check the tech
in fact this is the halo car of halo
cars back in 1998 Volkswagen bought up
the rights to the bugatti auto brand
name about all that was left of a
storied French car maker that by then
was better known for making aircraft
landing gear probably holding up the
last jet you flew
but with this move VW set out to prove
it's about more than just jaunty Jettas
and failed Phaeton's and by 2001 they
unveiled the Veyron this is its latest
iteration
not that you got a staff ten yards away
from me and I'll still tell you this car
is not exactly conventionally pretty to
my eye but such as the tyranny of
aerodynamics if you want to do 250 plus
and stay on the surface of the earth you
shape the car exactly as the wind tells
you to and do it with a smile what's
interesting is those who've taken this
thing to the limit on the track with the
top off always remarked how still it
remains in the cabin the body is
basically all carbon-fiber you can even
order the car finished in a clear coat
so everybody knows it it seats two in
front of its massive mid-mounted engine
and offers virtually no rear visibility
you handle blind spots by driving away
from them now when you build a car like
this nothing about its routine it's kind
of like one big rolling book of Bar
trivia just at this one corner I could
tell you stories for an hour these tires
for example they're made to order
because no other car uses them and
they're about $25,000 a set and when you
replace those every third time you're
advised to replace the wheels as well
pushing about 40 grand a set even these
valve stems are unique extra strong
springs in them because at 3,000 or so
rpm on the wheel when you're at full
tilt conventional valve stem Springs
would open up and bleed out the tire not
good at 200 plus when you do get a
tune-up most of this outside bodywork
has to come off to get to the spark
plugs on those months your mortgage
drops to number two in the budget
now the specs of this car and
particularly its engine have been
breathlessly over covered by every blog
and car magazine on earth so I'm not
gonna kill you with that except to talk
about the architecture of this guy this
is an 8 litre quad turbo w16 the w16
part throws a lot of people here's what
it means it's basically to kind of v8
that are both Siamese together sharing
one crank I say kind of v8 because each
of these two banks of 8 cylinders are
sitting in a nested format that means
they take up less longitudinal room when
those two 8 cylinder banks are put
together on one crank and that means
much better packaging this engine would
be substantially longer and more
unwieldy and throw off the balance of
this car if it was a traditional
architecture the result 1,200 horsepower
and 1100 and 6 foot pounds of torque yes
both four figures I have never seen that
in a car we've reviewed before that
means this roughly forty four hundred
pound vehicle it's quite dense gets up
to 60 in a mere 2.6 seconds all of that
thanks to a 7-speed dual-clutch
transmission has been beefed up quite a
bit for the additional power of this
Vitesse going out to all-wheel drive
there's no other way you could
distribute that power otherwise mpg if
you care is about 8:15 you don't care
now inside this guy's frankly you've
seen that's nightmare we don't have
every tech option you can get navigation
they don't make a big deal about it
so you can imagine why instead it's a
simple set of climate controls some
basic radio and CD controls good old
analog gauges that are real crisp and
nicely placed there is an iPod connect
this is relatively new for the Veyrons
on a cool little retracting spool reel
here why don't other car makers do that
so here we go traffic in California's
wine country and believe it or not this
is not wasted footage because I've
driven a lot of so-called super cards
that have a very unsupervised very
cantankerous sometimes at this level
this car has impressed me with its
ability to be docile and drive like a
slush box when you want it to and then
of course transfer all that power at
other times when you want it to that's a
pretty good trick it makes the most
amazing sounds there's whirring there's
growling
there are these sounds like a medium
caliber handgun going up
those are the boost valves on the turbos
releasing excess pressure now well this
car has been clocked at 254 miles an
hour with the top off it's actually only
going to go there if you have a special
mode on a high speed mode that limits
the top speed into a mere 233 neither
it's 0 to 16 or top speed or any other
vector have much relevance on the street
about the only icon of its prowess is
that the windows automatically raised at
95 miles an hour which point you are
still in second gear and wondering where
that stretch of road went willing up in
a Veyron creates an event in the space
of 20 minutes I had one person offer
rather seriously to trade me their child
for it several beg to be allowed to sit
in it dozens took their picture just
near it and a few resentfully and
clearly purposely ignored it
people react because until that moment
it was a myth and because of the price
okay now the fun part let's put a price
tag on our little orange friend base is
around two and a quarter million dollars
or roughly forty five years of the u.s.
median income on top of that there's a
fifty one thousand dollar destination
charge because they air freight these
things around via DHL not kidding
sixty-four hundred dollar gas guzzler
tax you don't care and about a two point
six percent customs duty I bet you've
never seen that on a car bill of sale
before in the end this car is
phenomenally expensive and you would
look at its German engineering French
manufacturer and Italian heritage and
see a bar joke coming but this car most
certainly is not one for its big company
sophistication brutal yet controlled
performance and cheeky open top design
it really is a class of one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
