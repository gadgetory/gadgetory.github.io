another episode of cracking open with me
we've got our cracking open expert of
course Bill Detweiler this is as always
a partnership between tech Republic and
CNET and this time we're cracking open
one of the more popular drones that
sometimes called the selfie drone bill
tell us about what we're gonna do today
yeah so we've got one of the smaller
drones the DJI spark this came out in
2017 and it's sort of it's just above
maybe the toy category yes groans it's
sort of an entry-level drone it costs
retails I think for 399 mm but it's down
to about 299 right now and if you're
looking for a drone that's just slightly
above maybe a $69 $79 $150 toy this is
kind of a good option and we thought it
would be really cool to show people the
tech inside these drones it goes into
keeping them stable that goes into
taking photos and letting you control
them sure and we'll talk a little bit as
you're gonna crack this open we'll talk
a little bit about the difference
between this drone and some of the other
drones that DJI has to offer they now
offer three drones under $1,000 this
being the least expensive you can
typically pick this up in a street value
of 3 to $400 and then then all the way
up to the DJI mafic Pro at about $1,000
999 DJI has become the leader in this
category especially in consumer prosumer
drones and they are based out of China
as we know they started out making
gimbals which is the the stabilizer that
the camera turns on that's what they
really know how to do really well and
that is the key part of these drones so
as we take it off we're gonna talk a
little bit about what makes these drones
so useful and and easy to fly yeah so
we've taken the battery off there is
some screws here that hold the plastic
body together
these are Torx screws so you'll want to
make sure you have
eh I think I'm using 81.5 to remove
these screws what these once we remove
these screws we're gonna be able to pop
off the top cover here this plastic top
cover and that's one of the nice things
you can see one of the screws fell out
there that's one of the nice things
about these drones is that most of them
are designed to be repaired because they
know they understand that you know
you're probably gonna crash one you're
probably gonna break one you're gonna
break the propeller so you get extra
ones of those so I'm actually gonna to
keep us from breaking the propellers I'm
gonna go ahead and remove them nice
thing about the spark here is it has
these little quick-release propellers so
you push them down they're spring-loaded
you push them down you remove them I
have the screws removed from the bottom
and kind of get a shot here they use two
different types of screws so here they
have in the middle they have these Torx
head screws okay but on these screws
here they'll have a hex head you just
have to be prepared that when you take
these devices apart you you have the
bits that are the right size that you
have the bits that fit the screws and
usually there's a lot of information
online to do that so now that I have the
screws removed we're going to take off
the last propeller here I'm gonna go
ahead and we're gonna start trying to
pop off this plastic housing now there
you go we're gonna try and be gentle and
not break it I'm gonna start at the back
here and I'm gonna use we have several
different types of plastic tools these
little plastic spudger is here these are
really great you can use modified guitar
picks you could use something metal if
you wanted and I have metal tools too
but depending on how sturdy the plastic
is will depend on whether or not I you
know whether or not I want to use metal
or plastic just because I don't want to
break or Mar the plastic and plastic on
plastic tends to do a little bit better
at that then not doing that yeah metal
on plastic so you see we're starting to
sort of pop the cover off we get here
that we're gonna slowly work our way
around and this is gonna get us into the
guts of the spark like we say with all
these cracking opens you know bill sort
of has the hands of a surgeon and the
patience of a saint you know is that you
have to to not force it know don't force
it you can see right there
you slowly work our way around and now
we can remove the plastic cover we can
see the inside of the DJI drone there so
we can see a lot of the components
already exposed which is really nice
some of the other devices we take apart
you can't see that we have a couple
circuit we have a cooling fan here we
have a couple of circuit boards here the
main circuit board is under here a
little bit of a heatsink right here and
so we can now start removing those
internal components so as long as you
have some small screw screw drivers you
should be able to work on this yourself
and I'm gonna start by removing this
little card up here we this is the UM
the communications the wireless
communications card right here it's hard
to tell sometimes what these chips are
but from the connections now it's hard
to tell I can't tell for sure here but
we're gonna remove these screws nowadays
if you're gonna work on your own
electronics go online you can find a lot
of you know there's plenty of tools
online specialty tools when we first
started it's a hazard of the job and
little screws fell into the device so
with the screws removed I can't just
lift
I can't just rip this board out there's
a connector right here so again when
you're working inside these devices you
want to make sure that you either use
plastic tools as much as you can or I
have ESD safe tweezers metal tweezers so
that they don't you lessen the
possibility of any type of spark or any
type of short and damage in the
electrical components inside so we're
gonna pop this connector loose and I
should be able to lift this board off
right there yeah and so we can see this
board comes off I believe it actually
has the GPS chip in it so it's important
that it you know you can only go in one
way yeah it makes it it's important for
it to be oriented correctly in terms of
so the drone knows how to fly knows
which way it's forward like that so
we're gonna lay this aside right now and
the next thing we're going to start
doing is we're gonna go ahead and remove
some of these other screws and start
removing the the main circuit board in
here so with all of the screws removed
these were just regular Phillips screws
lots of different sizes lots of
different lengths so
one thing you do have to remember when
you're doing this on your own devices is
to make sure that you either set them
out in a way that you will remember so
they know how the screws go back into
the device and where all the pieces go
or take some time take some photos as
you go along you can see there's a lot
of technology in this drone clearly from
from all the chips that you're taken out
and it does some really interesting
things this is a drone that you can fly
just based on gestures so you can have
the drone you can have it take off from
your hand and give it gestures to get it
in position and then take a photo
give it gestures to take a photo that's
the that's why it's sometimes called a
selfie drone you can also fly it from
the app the DJI app from your smartphone
you can use that to control it and then
we've also got one of the controllers so
this controller will let you take your
smartphone connect to this and then use
this controller to control it much more
precisely so in much more ways that the
professional drone pilots will do so
that they you know put this drone up
higher to get exactly the right shot now
you do have to keep in mind with this
drone you're only gonna get about 15
minutes of flight time this drone at the
price though is pretty remarkable for
what it can do what I'm doing right now
is there's a lot of connectors yeah
cables these little flat flexible ribbon
cables oh yeah flat flexible cables they
connect like said the motors the gimbal
the cameras all the Wi-Fi antennas to
the motherboard and so we're having to
go through and disconnect all of those
and you want to make sure that you do
this very carefully and you don't damage
any of the you know damage any of these
really light ribbon cables they're
hidden under these little metal pieces
little little shields here is um and one
of the things that's really interesting
is there's actually a little bit of glue
okay which you don't normally see on a
lot of these connectors but there is
just a little bit of glue here on the on
these connectors holding them down to
the motherboard just to make sure that
you know as device flies if you crash it
as it lands a vibration
voters you know it's tried to be
insulated speciale but they don't come
loose right don't say CLE they don't
shake loose so then it causes the
malfunction and yeah you know you always
want to make sure that you understand
the warranty information when you when
you buy a device whether it's a
smartphone whether it's a drone whether
it's any other type of gadget so if
you're going to do this kind of repair
you want to make sure that you don't
violate the warranty you don't by doing
anything that would be covered under the
warranty so there's one more I've got
these two connectors disconnected a
little bit of glue there we'll pop it
loose there we go these are likely for
the gimbal that's mounted on me out here
we're gonna remove that in a second so
this drone if you were to crash this
drone that gimbal isn't gonna
necessarily break which is what you see
when mind that gimbal was damaged when I
crashed another patch mine so I had to
send it into DJI for them to to repair
that and so we've got the motherboard or
the main system board whatever you want
to call we call it mother because there
is a secondary board here removed you
can see on the back we have these large
metal shields and it looks like they're
not soldered on so we'll often actually
get to see some of the chips underneath
which is always fun before we do that
let's go ahead and let's let's remove
the rest of the components here there's
two other things that we really want to
talk really want to take apart that one
is sort of this front facing a sensor
array that has a camera and the IR
sensors and then see if we can't get the
gimbal apart luckily now that we're
inside the drone I was talking about
those torques and screwdrivers on the
outside once we're inside it's all
Phillips which makes the teardown go
much easier so there's a couple screws
here that we're gonna remove it looks
like there's a little bracket here
that's going to hold the gimbal in the
screws for the gimbal are down there
there's a screw here that's holding in
the front sensor array we're gonna pop
that off there's one head and screw on
the other side I thought I had removed a
knot and sometimes that's these you know
sometimes I've never taken this apart
before so you see Ally first time here
and you know it did come out
back in 2017 yeah there we go
all right so we can lift out the
front-facing sensor ray here we have all
my screws in the body we can see here I
like to keep all the screws nice and
sort of organized together you can see
the front-facing sensors that help the
drone like you said have a little bit of
obstacle avoidance and you know know how
to navigate itself we got an IR a pair
of IR sensors here and in a little front
facing camera there so we've got our
sensor board out with that I've already
removed the screws that allow us to lift
out here it's got a little metal bar on
it it holds the gimbal in place and pull
this out of these the cables for thee
I've seen you go for an hour at a times
where it where there will be something
you're like I know that there's just
something holding it on this and then
I've got to find what it is so that we
can release it yep and that's what it is
he did not break there's a little rubber
piece here that goes with the gimbal I
don't want to break it so yeah it's like
a little rubber band okay go okay
now that has come loose there we go now
let's see if we can lift the gimbal out
there anything else holding it in there
no no I have the gimbal and camera
assembly it was this little piece of
this little piece of metal here that was
attached to this little rubber rubber
piece there and you can see the gimbal
and you know the front-facing gimbal
camera assembly like you were talking
about that was what DJI was really
before they got into sort of drones that
was what they really sort of they are a
gimbal company for a long long time and
that's why they transitioned pretty
easily to drones because this is what
makes this device right here those slow
pans and zooms and tilts is what gives
you and then of course the drone itself
flying in in a slow pattern is what
gives you those really really
interesting shots and so we finally we
managed to pop off the little
light here because this actually does
light up there's an LED ring under piece
under these motors so you can kind of
see the drone more easily at night and
it makes it cool to look at and fly
around like a UFO right there's a pair
of screws here on this little plastic
part of the housing and then we can see
the chips here the controller's for the
for the motor and for the the LED right
there one other thing I'll see if I can
remove this here this is the attach to
the body you see this is really
componentized so it's really nice when
you know taking these apart when you
have all these different separate
components that can be if they break
they can be replaced it's one of the
things that we really like to see you
know they don't have manuals for them
yeah so you kind of have to figure this
out as you go check the internet see
what other hobbyists have done see what
other sites have done checkout see nets
and so youtube channel cracking open
videos so here's the bottom here's the
lower got it out yeah so here's the the
bottom sensor right we have oops
dropping things all over the place so we
have a lower camera here and then we
have the IR sensors to detect the range
from the ground right and again this is
one of those things that could be
damaged it could be broken and you it's
nice to be able to remove it
individually and then replace it without
having to just sort of scrap this whole
plastic body right so that's kind of
about it for the plastic body we don't
see the cables that run to the motors
there's a few more there's a Wi-Fi
antennas attached here a few more pieces
of a few more cables attached the
battery contacts and of course the
motors that's kind of about it for the
body the last thing I want to do when we
set this apart is I'm going to pop off
if I can these metal shield gallier that
protect take a look and we'll see if we
can see the chips underneath that's one
of the things that we really do like to
do and it sometimes some manufacturers
will actually will solder these to the
boards and so it's a little difficult to
do it's impossible to do there's one
problem I always like it when it's not
so that we can see the actual brain
you know we can see the real chips
underneath sometimes we learn
interesting things about who makes chips
for who you know the fact that this is
how we know about all those chips for
example that Samsung makes for Apple
that are often not very public and lots
of other devices too and that tells you
a little bit about those companies and
how well they're doing and how some of
the chip makers are doing and some of
the component makers when you start to
look up these chips which you you will
do especially in the more popular
devices and we learn a little bit about
you know who their partners are some of
which is not this is always yes which is
not public and that's why Jason I say
you know definitely if you're really
interested in learning more about the
chips check out the full sort of
cracking open article and gallery on
TechRepublic
after this if you watch the video and it
will have a lot more information about
the chips that are in the device is and
what's really interesting as we've
talked about before Jason on some of our
previous episodes is that chips get
reused will see chips designed for
automotive use in in devices like this
will see chips designed for smartphones
in these devices like the GPS they're
the triaxis gyroscopes or sixaxis Tyra
scopes
will see all kinds of dual use products
in these in these devices and it's
really kind of interesting to see that
yeah so we've got the fan is here I've
disconnected a fan cable gonna try and
pry it loose just probably a little bit
of yep comes right off a little bit of
glue holding that down here we've got a
little bit of a heat sink
right here to help dissipate these fins
help dissipate the heat from the chips
underneath I think this will these metal
shields will pop off - yep they sure
will work our way around real gently do
this is the last thing we're done new
this is this has been actually didn't
expect it to be because it's pretty
simple to this place to replace a rotor
pretty simple to replace up pretty
simple to replace a you know broken
maybe the gimbal things like that we see
a little bit of thermal paste yeah right
there that
helps conduct the heat from the chips
underneath we're gonna pop these off
there's one I am or thermal thermal
paste there there's another chip yeah
we've got one of our chip fire meaning
so see we'll take this one off it's a
flyer yeah so here we've got our last
EMI shield off here EMF shield and we
can see the chips the real brain of the
DJI spark there's a lot of there's still
some thermal paste on there we'll get
that cleaned off we'll take some really
nice pictures put those up on
TechRepublic
and on CNET so that everyone can see
what the actual brains of the DJI spark
is very good another successful cracking
open all right remember you can see more
of cracking opens all of the photos all
of the commentary on TechRepublic and
you can see all of the videos for all
the devices that we crack open on CNET
and on cns youtube channel and if you've
got something you'd like to see us crack
open leave us a note in the comments
we're always looking for new things to
break open take a look at and learn from
so thanks for watching we'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
