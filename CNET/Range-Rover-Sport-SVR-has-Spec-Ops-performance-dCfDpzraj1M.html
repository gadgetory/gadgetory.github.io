see so we'll have lots of power and rear
drive for example a saloon will either
go super diesel or silky smooth petrol
have lots of space and be very
comfortable an SUV though well that can
be all number of things
the range rover sport for example works
wonderfully with a diesel engine some
people would argue you don't need
anything more or there's a beautiful 500
horsepower supercharged v8 but Jaguar
Land Rovers special vehicle ops didn't
think either of those were really quite
up to snuff so it came up with this the
SVR a 542 brake horse about 502 pound
foot monster utility vehicle
SVO Jaguar Land Rovers new company proof
skunk works is there to churn out all
manner of cars SVR cars will be the
performance motors svx is all about
off-road prowess and SV autobiography
motors are for people who like a little
bit more luxury in their lives
cars with an svr verge all have four
main attributes the four-wheel drive
they have better arrow less weight and
more power and because this is s vioz
first full production car it's something
of a shop window for them and the stats
this thing has well they're pretty
impressive nor 262 takes 4.7 seconds in
its top speed is over 160 miles an hour
that's quite fast especially considering
this thing tips the scales at 2.3 tonnes
and its shape doesn't really lend itself
to going mega quickly but hang what's
engineering for you right here's some of
the particulars the rear brakes have
special carbon cooling plates while the
fronts are chilled by air intakes where
the front fog lights live on the
production car those intakes help cool
the SVRs new engine it's the same one
you'll find in a Jag f-type R one of my
favorite cars ever but it needs more air
to keep it from going bang the spoiler
on the car's rear isn't decorative
either it works to push the car through
the air and aids downforce weight has
been shaved off here and there too all
in order to make it a cut above the rest
aside from being a technically tweaked
tank the new engine adds so much more to
this car I mean the standard 5-litre
supercharged range rover sport sounds
pretty good quite raw and nasty for this
this is something else it sounds like an
f-type it has that same tone that makes
me fall in love with the Jag it pops and
bangs and it sounds angry and mean and
well like it's going to eat the world
but unlike the f-type in here there's
room for people
there's a few driving modes to play with
all of the usual Land Rover toys to
ensure you can climb a mountain of an
afternoon should you choose to but
you'll be spending most of your time in
either normal or dynamic normal is this
cars Dave today dropping the kids off at
school going to work going to football
practice mode and it makes it feel like
a range rover sport which is a good
thing a wonderful thing in fact the
dynamic well dynamic turns the wick up
by a factor of a million it completely
transforms the car the steering gets
heavier throttle response gets sharper
gearbox angrier and everything becomes a
lot more fun
I think gathers pace and coming so I
cried son right
this is a really really heavy car it may
be two and a half tons for God's sake
yep it doesn't feel like a heavy car
there's no effort involved in you can
thread it through Ben's you know where
the front wheels are you know what the
cars doing you feel safe in its hands
the ride as well as fantastic it's
smooth you don't feel nasty lumps and
bumps in the road the car just absorbs
them even in its Porteous setting it's
still smooth it's still a joy to drive
it still easy you can sling it around
the corner and arylene quite a bit not
as much as a standard range rover sport
I hasten to add but it doesn't feel like
it's gonna fall over it doesn't feel
unstable and you can really hurl it
around you can hustle this thing that's
some quite silly speeds
the people at SVO they aren't just
people who are employed to put different
bits on a car and see what sticks their
proper engineers these guys have come
from the likes of Williams Formula One
places like that they know how to make
cars go very quickly it's been their
entire lives so when I say this is the
best possible example of a Range Rover
Sport you're going to get this is the
best possible example of a Range Rover
Sport you're going to get the interior
most of it is words it's what you're
getting a range rover sport the
materials are fantastic the touch points
are lovely there is one exception that
makes me a little bit hesitant about it
and that's the seats I know they're
there for a reason because this is the
sporty car and their sporty seats but
they are a bit tacky not a huge fan of
those and the infotainment system
remains rubbish it's hard to navigate
it's complicated it's overly men you'd
and it looks very very dated but I know
that JLR has a new one because I've
driven it in the discovery sport and the
Jag XE that works really well and is
really lovely so expect that to appear
in these at some points in the future
presumably when the facelifted the
gearbox is an 8-speed auto and it's
seamless it's smooth and it just I just
weren't it works beautifully well
look at the thing has been a touch
polarizing because it looks like a range
rover sport that's handsome aftermarket
stuff done to it but I'll say this
nothing is on this car that shouldn't be
there there's a reason things look the
way they do so the fog lights were taken
out so the giant engine could be cool
and yet it looks a bit odd but if that
didn't happen the engine wouldn't get
the cooling it needed and then bad
things would happen and you don't want
bad things to happen good when things go
pop on a range rover things tend to get
going expensive is it better than other
stuff on the market I'll certainly give
it a look if I were you I definitely
definitely would because it's hilarious
fun I don't know any other SUV that
makes a noise quite like this big old
dirty v8 slinging out anger and hatred
on the road I like it a lot
I like that it exists because it's proof
that if you give some talented engineers
time and the tools to work they can
create something that's faster than
Porsche handles in a manner best
described as unnatural and still works
as a car I don't like something else
about it though and that's something
that's no fault of the people who made
it there will be some people who won't
fall under this sweeping generalization
but there are certainly going to be a
few who will our buyer is going to
understand just what went into making
this car so brilliant will they get that
this is the most impressive the most
advanced version the range rover sport
you can get now and will they understand
why will they get the engineering that
went into it will they appreciate it or
will they simply see the most expensive
car on the list and buy it just to show
off not that there's anything wrong with
being in the position to tick the box
and by the toy but wouldn't it be nice
if more people knew what went into their
cars or maybe I'm being a bit of a
curmudgeon buyers aside the Range Rover
Sport SVR seems like an answer to a
question that didn't really need asking
can the Range Rover Sport go any faster
the 500 horsepower VA is quick enough
hell the diesel will do for most people
but because someone did dare to ask that
question we ended up with something
pretty cool it's a Range Rover but with
added anger</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
