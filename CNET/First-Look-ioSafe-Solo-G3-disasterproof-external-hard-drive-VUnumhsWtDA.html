death taxes and the loss of detail well
we cannot do anything about the first
two but there's something here that
might prevent the third from happening
hello my name is Don oh and this is the
solo g3 from Iowa safe this is a
disaster proof external hard drive now
this is not a drive for everybody
because of its huge size and heavy
weight in fact I decided to skip the gym
today because I've been carrying around
all day as 15 pounds is about as heavy
as I can bench on a good day now the
reason for his size and weight is
because of the layers of protection here
the drive can survive temperature up to
1500 degrees actually 1550 hundred
degrees Fahrenheit and can be submerged
in the water up to ten feet for three
days now I thought of setting my office
on fire to test this but it'll have to
be not a good idea so I didn't do that
with the drive but I witness a few
demonstration where the drive was really
really tortured I personally actually
shot at one of these drive a few times
with a real shotgun and hit every single
time of course and the drive survived on
top here you can see a bunch of screws
which you can unscrew to take off the
layer of protection here to take the
hard drive inside out for data recovery
that is what you do after the dry has
gone through some extreme condition now
after that you will need to buy another
drive if you want to continue to protect
your data on the front here the drive
has nothing but a tiny blue line that is
very pright which can be annoying if you
want to keep the room dark on the back
and see the drive has a power switch and
one USB 3.0 port now the drive work also
with USB 2.0 in my testing is actually
very fast being the fastest actual drive
ever tested when used with USB 3.0 when
used with your speed 2.0 is was not too
fast but it's not too slow either notice
this hole right here which allows you to
lock the drive at a place to prevent it
from being stolen note how this Drive
has no
fans making it very quiet when working
which is great the question is how much
does it cost the drive come in three
capacity one tier by two terabyte and
310 by that cost three hundred dollars
350 and 400 dollars respectively now
that's not cheap compared with other
external hard drive but considering what
it has to offer it's not too bad to make
that a better deal I will save include
with the drive 1e a data recovery
service that cover up to $2,500 in case
you have to pay to recover the data and
the company said that it would honor the
warranty no matter what happened to
drive no questions asked
which means you can actually buy one try
to destroy it and have it taken care of
by the company now but don't tell them
that I tell you to do that it is secret
the solo g3 is pre formatted to work
with Windows but can also be reformatted
to work with Macs you can find out more
with the drive including is full review
and other demos etsy.com once again my
name is Domo and this has been the first
look at the iOS a solo g3 disaster-proof
external hard drive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
