betas of iOS and ie how to put itunes on
a diet God games that put the fate of
the world in your hands and a GPS unit
for all you truckers out there it's all
coming up right now good buddy
hi everyone I'm Hollywood and welcome to
the cnet tech review where we collect
our hottest videos of the week and tell
you what's good and what's bad in the
world of tech and offer some unique tech
wisdom in the form of the bottom line
let's start with the good at Apple's
music event held here in San Francisco a
couple weeks ago Steve Jobs gave us a
little sneak peek at iOS 4.2 an update
aimed specifically at the ipad now that
the beta version of the update has been
released into the wild brian Tong is
here with a taste of what you can expect
hey guys Brian song here with sina com
and Apple's iOS 4.2 beta that specific
to the ipad was recently released so we
wanted to show off some of the major
improvements and some of the more subtle
ones as well the biggest addition is
multitasking and it works just like it
has on an iPhone double click the home
button and you'll see apps that are
currently running in portrait mode
you'll see six apps at a time and in
landscape mode you'll see seven now
what's great about this is that I've
been dying for Pandora to have
multitasking on the iPad and it looks
like the app was built already with that
in mind so it works like a charm I can
listen to my pandora stream while
checking out a recipe for dinner or
surfing the web now just like an iOS 4.1
once you've accessed the multitasking
feature you can swipe to the right to
reveal the music controls and more a new
change is that the screen orientation
lock is now accessible here so you can
lock the ipad to portrait or landscape
mode the physical button on the right
hand side that used to be the screen
lock is now a mute switch but I'm not
sure if I like that change it and the
biggest addition that I love the ability
to control the brightness of the screen
with this slider without jumping into
the preferences thank you now folders is
here on the iPad and you can put up to
20 icons / folder compared to only 12 on
the iPhone airprint makes its debut and
the wireless printing option is
integrated into the apps so if I'm in
the mail app it will show up here and
I'll be able to select a printer it sees
and choose how many copies I want you'll
also find printing in the photo app and
Safari airplay is Apple's wireless
streaming feature that streams to the
new Apple TV or other compatible devices
you'll be able to access it in the ipod
app movie app and youtube app now let's
show you a few other features in 4.2
game centers here on the ipad and it's
pretty much what we've seen in iOS 4.1
male now has a unified mailbox for your
multiple accounts and you can also
organize your emails by threads which I
love Safari has an updated icon that now
shows you how many Safari pages you have
open in the background and closing them
feel snappier than before now all of you
fans of the Notes app will now be
getting a few other fonts that you can
change in the settings instead of just
marker felt so you guys can rejoice and
if you're using the ipad 3g with the
cellular data option turned on you now
have the ability to toggle between 3g
and edge if you want to reduce the drain
on your battery even if it means slower
download speeds I'm Brian Tom for cnet
com and remember this is the beta and
there's sure to be more improvements on
the way before it's November release but
we wanted to give you a sneak peek at
iOS 4.2 in action yeah maybe Brian's not
sure how he feels about that screen lock
thing but I'm sure I do not like it at
all okay speaking of betas the
pre-release version of internet explorer
9 is now available as well and with so
many other web browser options available
from Firefox to Chrome even opera I
pretty much never use IE anymore but as
seth rosenblatt found out Microsoft's
browser may just be worth another look
after several months of teasing internet
explorer's upgrade with a series of
feature free developers previews
Microsoft has unleashed on the world a
fully functional Death Star I mean fully
functional beta of its next-gen browser
the new Internet Explorer 9 beta some of
IE 9 betas features bring it up to
parity with other browsers well other
improvements definitely push it ahead as
you can see from the interface the
minimalist approach to browser UI is a
major change to Internet Explorer but
Microsoft takes a slightly different
approach than its competitors which have
also stripped down you eyes tabs are on
the same level as the location bar
whereas Firefox Chrome and opera all
have tabs on one row in the location bar
on a second it looks fine on a
widescreen desktop monitor but on a
standard laptop screen the combination
of tabs on location bar feels a bit
cluttered Microsoft has included the
ability to ripped ABS off in two
separate windows and you can arrow snap
them as well since the search bar is
gone you've probably inferred that
Microsoft has beefed up the location bar
search feature this too now sits on a
level playing field with competitors
although internet explorer's version has
some nice twists to it you can also
change search providers at the bottom
which is a slick merge of the old search
bar functionality into the location bar
another interesting feature comes from
Microsoft's take on the trend of
browsers becoming the operating system
since Microsoft already has an OS
Windows anybody they've taken steps to
integrate ie more thoroughly into
Windows pin sites allows you to pin
websites directly to the desktop taskbar
in Windows 7 however it only works when
your taskbar is in the default bottom
position hopefully that will be fixed
before ie9 leaves beta windows 7 jump
lists have been integrated for websites
that include that functionality and
thumbnail controls and inbox counts in
webmail pin sites are now included too
there's a new tab page that utilizes
favicons instead of snapshot previews
which is different but definitely
likeable the download manager has been
beefed up with enhanced reputation based
security features which have not been
seen in browsers yet but
do exist in modern security suites the
add on performance advisor will
automatically tell you when toolbars and
other add-ons slow down IE improved
process isolation prevents individual
tab crashes from killing the whole
browser and there's now an option for
automatic updates as you see in Chrome
performance has been a perennial
stumbling block for internet explorer
but the new JavaScript engine chakra
combined with full hardware acceleration
means that this isn't just the fastest
internet explorer yet it's also the most
competitive now whether it can stay that
way is up to Microsoft with your first
look at internet explorer 9 beta i'm
seth rosenblatt frisina have the words
minimalist and microsoft ever been used
in the same sentence before but hey if
they can strip down the interface and
beef up the features i'll give it
another shot why not there was a time
when the fanciest piece of tech in the
cab of an 18-wheeler would have been the
CB radio but as with most professions
technology continues to change the way
truck drivers do their jobs car tech
editor antuan goodwin brings us this
first look at a gps system designed
specifically with truckers in mind the
car tech guys here at cnet spend a good
deal of time on the road every week
testing the latest cars GPS devices and
in car gadgets but you know who puts us
a shame when it comes to raw seat time
truckers isn't it about time somebody
designed from car tech specifically for
these masters of the road enter the pc
miler navigator 450 GPS for truck
drivers the pc miler looks like your
average consumer gps device it's got a
4.3 inch touchscreen a mini USB
connection for charging and an SD card
slot for loading data and maps going a
step further this unit also features a
headphone jack and the TMC antenna input
for an external traffic receiver there's
also an input for the included magnetic
external gps antenna that increases
positioning accuracy when the unit's
mounted in a compromised position of
course there's also the internal gps
antenna if you don't want to fool around
with the rudder in the cable
for this guy powering up the pc miler
reveals that this is no typical in car
navigator running a version of the
copilot 8 navigation software that's
specific to trucks the pc miler has a
host of features that make it useful to
big rig drivers users can input the
height length with weight and weight per
axle of their truck to receive truck
specific routings users can also save
multiple routing profiles to hold these
presets for later retrieval presumably
after inputting this data the pc miler
won't try to send you under low
overpasses or across bridges that won't
support your payloads wait the unit also
features state mileage logs which is
quite useful for independent operators
for billing purposes the copilot
software is very flexible with rutting
presets for automobiles motorcycles
bicycles and RVs as well as walking
directions so you can even use the pc
miler outside of your truck however
there are a few things that we don't
really like about it from a software
standpoint the copilot software can be a
bit too complex and tricky to use one
adjust the volume good luck finding that
on your first attempt the hardware also
suffers from a tricky car cradle that
makes it difficult to adjust and tricky
to connect the external gps antenna so
do the advantages of the truck specific
hardware and software outweigh our
nitpicks about the interface and cradle
design check out the full review at cnet
com to find out I'm antuan goodwin this
has been your first look at the pc miler
450g pf4 truck farmer
what a cliffhanger Antoine feel free to
go check out the full review at cnet com
but here's a hint he liked it enough to
wear a trucker hat for the video so it
can't be too bad plus I call him rubber
ducky now and I've said it before and I
will say it again routers and Ethernet
hubs are awesome and powerline adapters
don't even get me started so naturally I
am super excited to see this network kit
singled out as an editor's choice tell
them about it dome how I adapted at
those that help you expand your local
network via your home electrical wiring
today and show you the best one to date
hello my name is dango and this is the
lie why powerline AV network it from
Western Digital this kiss is the first
among homeplug AV powerline adapter that
own CNN's errors Choice Award now there
are few reason why this kid is the best
first of all it come with two identical
adapters each has four network ports
this means you can use up to 4 internet
ready devices at the far end of the
power line connection at the new end
where the other adapter is connected to
your router instead of losing one that
will port for it you now actually gain
three this is because the adapters can
also work as a 4-port hub so out of the
box the kid can support up to seven
devices the light white kids adapters
the rather bulky also have a nice design
with detachable power cables this allows
user to place the adapter away clear
from the power socket the adapters have
an on/off switch and a sink button
pressing on this button within two
minutes from each other when create a
private network between the two adapters
preventing other homeplug AV adapter
from connecting to them this is a good
security feature in case you want to
keep others living in the same apartment
building for example from tapping into
your local network or the internet
connection the livewire adapters are
also great where it matters the most
performance in our testing the to
produce the highest throughput speed
among powerline adapter we were reviewed
for
these reasons at about 110 dollars the
WD live wipe our kid is possibly the
best band for the book on the market for
more information on it check out the
in-depth review at sea calm once again
my name is dong woo and II was just
seeing the first look at the lie why
powerline AV network it from western
digital what did I tell you I'm all
tingly let's take a quick break so that
I can calm down a bit but we'll be back
with more Cena tech review right after
this
welcome back to the cnet tech review our
weekly video digest of all things good
and bad we've seen here at cnet TV
continuing on with the good many of our
shows have titles that are pretty
self-explanatory the apple byte all
about apple news and apple products
how-to videos show you how to do things
and so on so the scene at top 5 should
be pretty easy to figure out right well
usually it is
let's face it nothing like coming home
with a new TV that impossibly bright
picture the new features you scratch
your head over and of course that giant
box you don't know what to do with I'm
Brian Cooley here with the top five TVs
as rated by cnet so far this 2010 number
five a ty at cnet rating 7.6 now brace
yourself in this competitive class we
have a lot of ties coming up this one's
between the LGP k 9 50 series and the
samsung see 8000 models the PK 950 is
LG's best plasma ever we think a real
flagship it has a magic wand remote we
think works well but is still kind of a
gimmick streaming services on this guy
are a little thin compared to some of
the competition but it's an affordable
TV the Samsung see 8000 is an edge-lit
LED LCD with 3d ability a really good
picture as well but the remote was a
mess and it didn't include any 3d
glasses streaming an app support was
superb though but the price kind of
tempered things it was almost
unconscionable at number 4 the panasonic
g20 g25 series cnet rating 7.7 great
black levels so the colors really pop
lowish power consumption and a rather
effective anti-glare coating but this
plasma is a little behind on the
streaming functions and there are
persistent complaints rumors that this
series has trouble with black levels as
it ages over time coming in at number
three cleverly enough is a three-way tie
all with a scene at rating of 7.9 first
there's panasonic tc-p z1 series their
flagship with tremendous black levels
and color rendering really solid
wireless technology to connect your
components to it at a nice slim case but
as you might imagine all this comes at a
steep price next up is Sony's HX 909 a
great-looking LCD set with both 3d
ability and 2d to 3d conversion that
actually works well like most on our
list it has a good array of streaming
services
perfect if it didn't start it close to 3
grand street we'd be a little more
excited and also here is vicios to xvt
series anything but overpriced in the
visio tradition we think it's a great
value this LED LCD has Wi-Fi built in
outstanding streaming services probably
the best and a bluetooth remote with a
qwerty keypad but the awful viewing was
weak and the LED backlighting could be a
little uneven number 2 is a two-way tie
this is set up coming in both at a cnet
rating of eight point out the Samsung
c7000 has superb internet streaming in
widgets and apps it's the least
expensive 2010 plasma so far to offer 3d
and the picture performance is really
good too LG's le 8500 series is
interesting we actually dropped this
local dimming LED LCD television from a
monster cnet rating of nine down to
eight because of uneven backlight again
yet it still impresses with otherwise
outstanding picture and low power use
this is an early 2010 set by the way so
no 3d built in but it does have a good
array of streaming features by the way
before we get to our number one TV in
this top 5 be aware of a controversy
swirling out there around 3d TV it may
have some health risks in the minds of
many including I strain dizziness
headache and nausea and that's just from
watching the marriage ref I thought it
was funny anyway seventeen percent of
Americans are already sure 3d TV makes
you ill another fifty five percent
aren't sure it doesn't the jury's out
that's a pretty wide population so try
it out before you buy okay our number
one TV as of this point in 2010 is a one
way it's an on-time finally it's the
panasonic viera BTW 20-25 series with a
big cnet rating of 8.7 outstanding
picture in both 2d and 3d modes that's a
tough trick a strong if not
class-leading set of streaming services
and it includes a pair of 3d glasses it
does have some minor
concerns about those fading black levels
and being a plasma it's a little bit
power-hungry so there you go a top five
that somehow had nine products in it
find all our TV reviews at cnet com the
televisions are right there just click
on the left side easy to find I'm Brian
Cooley thanks for watching we'll see you
next time
so what's it going to be the Le 8500 or
the 2x VT maybe the HX 909 is more your
style regardless of which one you choose
I will have no idea what you're talking
about and with that let's take a look at
the bad I'm not going to spend a lot of
time explaining this next video because
well I'm in it so suffice to say that
itunes is probably taking up too much
room on your computer and i'm here to
fix that hi i'm holly wood from CNN and
i'm here to show you how to install
itunes on windows without the bloat many
thanks to our ZDNet colleague ed bott
for posting this lifesaving how to if
you used itunes on windows you know it's
big slow and filled with features and
components that you do not need I mean
think about it every iTunes installation
has the necessary elements to control
several different ipods an iphone or an
ipad or an ipod touch it syncs with
Apple TV it has that whole store element
has networking features you may or may
not need and then there's quicktime it's
huge well ed has helpfully created a
step-by-step list for installing only
the features of itunes that you need now
I suggest you start by uninstalling any
previous versions of itunes and
downloading the Installer all over again
you probably want to uninstall bonjour
too if that's in there next download the
itunes installer but do not run it now
navigate to wherever you downloaded the
file called itunes setup.exe right-click
on itunes setup.exe now you may have to
have winzip installed because you want
to extract the file to folder called
whatever whatever itunes setup now you
can see all the individual installation
components check out ed's article for a
full list of all the things contained in
the installer for our purposes suffice
to say you don't need all of them okay
here's where we customize if you only
want to use itunes with an ipod that's
not an ipod touch so a mini a classic a
nano or a shuffle then move these three
files into a new
folder you'll need apple application
support msi quicktime msi and itunes msi
or itunes 64 msi on a 64-bit windows
system now press the windows key and
then hit our for run and then drag the
first file into that window this will
put the folder path and the full file
name into the run dialog that's actually
a cool trick all on its own and then
after the last quotation mark type /
passive and hit enter or click ok now
this will actually install that
component so do the same with the other
two packages in your folder and once you
complete the installation you'll have an
itunes that lets you manage music on any
ipod that's not a touch you can rip in
burn cds play music and shop the itunes
store it's kind of like an iTunes
Classic if you will ok but what if you
want to connect an Apple TV or browse
iTunes libraries on your home network
you'll need the same three packages plus
the modular MSI package which you also
install using the slash passive command
you'll need bonzers installed on any
computer whose library you plan to share
now what if you're managing an iphone
and ipad or an ipod touch well you'll
need those original three applications
apple application support msi quicktime
msi and itunes msi and you'll also need
apple mobile device support msi or the
64-bit version if you have 64-bit
windows finally there's the tricky issue
of Apple software update you really
don't want that to come along and undo
all your hard work now if you do enable
automatic updates just make sure you
download them and then manually install
updates following that same process now
bot also recommends disabling two of
itunes startup files which can really
slow down your boot times and they don't
seem to help you in any way to do that
click start or hit the Windows key run
and then type ms config DXE now click
the startup tab and find itunes helper
exe and QT task exe and uncheck the
boxes next to each one then click apply
now you'll probably need to restart your
system but after that you're off to the
races and you will be writing a much
Limor much faster horse winner first
thing that how to I'm Molly wood and
you're welcome glad I could be of
service let's move right along to this
week's bottom line shall we pundits have
often referred to the iphone as the
jesus phone well on this week's tap that
up Josh Lowensohn has found a Holy
Trinity of games for the iphone and ipad
that will actually let you play God or
at least a god welcome to tap that app
I'm Josh Lowensohn and this is the show
where we cover the hottest apps in the
mobile space this week we're looking at
apps that lets you play God all three of
them are iPhone games that put you in
complete control of a virtual world
where you can do good or bad sure their
time wasters but some of the ones on
this list can be just as fun and
addictive is full game titles let's
start off with pocket god from bolt
creative which is probably the
best-known God game on the iphone and
one of the best-selling iOS games to
date since launching in january of last
year it's been updated with 33 content
updates all of which have added mini
games and activities you can do with the
game's pygmy tribe the game provides a
number of ways to end the lives of these
virtual people be it feeding them to the
Sharks burning them with a magnifying
glass striking them with the lightning
and even harpooning them underwater and
bringing them back to life is as easy as
hitting a little plus button in the top
left hand corner but there's more to the
game than merciless death you can help
your pygmies catch fish fend off bad
guys and pass the time by dancing to the
beat of your finger tapping the screen
there are also mini games galore like a
spinoff to the popular iOS game doodle
jump and a cliff jumping game similar to
the also popular Canabalt along with the
basics the game offers a number of
add-ons that lets you reskin the
characters and their surroundings as
well as add new animations these costs a
dollar a pack and are entirely optional
but are a nice addition to big fans of
the game up next is God finger from ng
moco a game that has you micromanaging
the lives of your followers who you can
get to do manual labor and return for
coins the game has you expanding the
world in erecting buildings terraforming
mountains controlling weather cycles in
creating
bodies of water the aim of the game is
to get more and more followers and to
keep up the energy of your workers and
the building's they're working on both
of which can be replenished with mana
mana regenerates but sometimes not
quickly enough more can be purchased
using in-game currency which is bought
with real world dollars similar to other
ng moko freemium games godfinger is free
of charge and can be played without
spending a penny although if you want to
build up your world quickly and spend
less time micromanaging your followers
you can spend a few bucks godfinger can
be found on both the iphone and the ipad
but between the two the iPad is both
better looking and easier to play
oftentimes you'll be pulling a follower
from one side of your virtual planet to
the other and this has made less of a
hassle with a larger play space it's
also easier to see more of the game
store items at once last on our list is
finger Zilla by a nerd soap this to buck
title is easily the most manic of the
bunch and puts less of a focus on
helping small people survive versus
letting you destroy anything and
everything in sight in finger Zilla you
are a destroyer of worlds and you can
blow up buildings automobiles army
vehicles and just about anything with
your finger much of the gameplay depends
on you simply mashing your finger on the
screen though making use of the iphones
multi-touch screen lets you play with
several fingers or a friend to rack up
higher scores there is also a strategy
in working on a certain part of the city
and its landmarks before the citizens
can rebuild them the game has seven
levels that are ready and willing to be
destroyed as you gain access to later
levels they're larger and there are more
things you can destroy there are also
extra levels and power-ups that can be
bought including a mutation pack which
brings extra destruction and an add-on
that gives you more time within levels
at the end of each time level you get a
summary of how much damage you caused
which includes things like helicopters
buildings and people that you squashed
iPad users looking to try the game out
can pick up finger zilla megacity which
brings the same gameplay mechanics but
lets you see more of that on the screen
at once so these are just three
absolutes you play God and based on
their success more likely on the way
don't forget that if you've got an app
that you want us to tap send us an email
at tap that app at cnet com I'm Josh
Lowensohn and thanks for watching
the bottom line this week thou shalt not
covet thy neighbor's apps actually
aren't most iphone users self righteous
enough without giving them a real god
complex just kidding everyone just
kidding and that's our show everyone
join us next week when we will have a
whopper of a prize fight between two big
4g phones until then there are tons of
great videos available every day at CNN
TV com see you next time and thank you
for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
