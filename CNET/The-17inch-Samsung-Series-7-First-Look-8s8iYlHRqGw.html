set to bring you a first look at the 17
inch version of the samsung series 7
laptop now with a 17 inch screen that
makes us a desktop replacement the kind
of big laptop you just set up on your
desk to replace what you used to have
which is probably that a desktop
computer and monitor setup this is a lot
thinner than a lot of desktop
replacement laptops in fact they finding
a thin 17 inch laptop is pretty rare
these days because Apple has
discontinued that kind of cult favorite
17 inch macbook pro you can't even get
that anymore this is the closest that
I've seen to it it comes in at just
under one inch thick which for big 17
inch laptop is actually pretty thin
despite the fact that they pack inside
it a new third generation Intel quad
core Core i7 processor and a fairly
decent nvidia 650 M graphics card along
with a big 1 terabyte hard drive now
it's not one of the solid-state drives
you get an ultra books or anything it's
just a regular old spinning platter hard
drive but this is probably about as
close to in an ultrabook style as you're
gonna find in the 17 inch laptop right
now I really like the the big keyboard
that is backlit but the actual size of
the keys themselves glow and that gives
you kind of a nice look when the lights
are out it's got a big touch pan that's
about what you'd find on a macbook not
quite as responsive but fairly decent
and it's even got three different video
outs it's got HDMI DVI and the old VGA
port so you can go out to multiple
monitors at the same time the screen
itself is a big highlight it's a full
1920 by 1080 resolution and it's a matte
screen so it's not super glossy not
gonna pick up a lot of glare from nearby
lights we always like to see that even
though the system is made of aluminum
it's not done into quite as dirty of
something like the 17-inch MacBook Pro
did but this is also a lot less
expensive at $14.99 I've actually seen
it for $100 or so less if you look
around online I'm Dan Ackman and that is
the 17 inch samsung series 7</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
