remembered at CNET that we've taken a
look at the evident technology which is
virtual retinal display on your face now
CES is here and the advocate glyph has
emerged which takes a headset and
combines it with virtual retinal display
where is it it's actually inside these
headphones right on the top band here if
you fold this down there is an eyepiece
that goes right over my face and I can
adjust the diopters and look at 1280 by
800 resolution video that actually looks
a lot better because it's using texas
instruments based DLP technology to
project right on my retina looking a lot
more vibrant and a lot more crisp than a
screen this is a Kickstarter project
that's going to be sold for $4.99 and
this is the latest alpha design of what
the glyph looks like there's really
nothing else I've seen that matches this
type of design because it's not a goggle
that goes over your face alone it's
actually meant to fold up and be more
discrete like giant headphones obviously
in this mode you're going to look like a
cyborg but when you fold it up it kind
of looks like a big set of headphones
and it's going to look smaller in later
iterations before it's released and
there are controls over here to adjust
the volume there is a Bluetooth head
control technology inside which can work
potentially with games and the
connection is HDMI so it not only does
it work with your iPhone or your Android
device to play any video on there like
you would with an HDMI connection you
can use HDMI 1.4 to connect for 3d
content on blu-ray players or whatever
you'll see you have that plays 3d
content like games this is one of
several new interesting technologies
that are coming out I haven't seen
virtual retinal display because this is
the first of its kind and take a look at
it at CES it is definitely eye-catching
and unfortunately with my really
horrible prescription it doesn't quite
work for me right yet but it is made to
work with a variety of prescriptions and
the nose pieces and everything else will
be adjusted so there could be hope for
you too severely myopic person if you
want part of the advocate glyph the
Kickstarter campaign starts January 22nd
and they can be available to you if
you're interested in exploring headset
that's really more about entertainment
than it is virtual reality but it still
could potentially do that stuff in the
future I'm Scott's time with a look at
the advocate cliff which is currently on
my head</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
