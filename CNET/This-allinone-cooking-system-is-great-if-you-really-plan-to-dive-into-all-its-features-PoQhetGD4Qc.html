the three-in-one ninja cooking system
now why is it 3 and 1 it's three and one
because it works as a slow cooker but
also as an oven and as a stovetop type
cooker so what that means is you'll
switch this knob over here for slow
cooking and then you'll switch it back
over here if you want stovetop or all
the way over here for oven mode on oven
mode you can set it anywhere from 250 to
425 degrees and on slow cooking you can
set it anywhere from 30 minutes up to 12
hours now that's a lot of versatility
for a counter top slow-cooker usually
you just pour your ingredients in set it
to lower high and then walk away for
eight hours and come back to a
home-cooked meal now with this you can
do a lot more you can bake cookies you
can saute vegetables you can steam bake
and steam roast meats and all that in
addition to the basic slow cooking
functions now one important thing to
note about the ninja is that it has a
metal pan as opposed to a ceramic crock
that we've seen in a lot of other
machines so if i take the lid off and
take this pan out for you you can see
that it's this aluminum nonstick
material it's pretty easy to keep clean
dishwasher safe that's nice but it's so
thin and that means that it conducts
heat pretty well cooks fast but it
doesn't retain heat that well that means
that when you're traveling if you're
throwing this thing in the backseat and
driving across town to a party if you
get stuck in traffic this one's going to
lose a lot more heat and your foods
going to be a lot colder than it would
be in another machine so if you're going
to travel a lot maybe consider something
else if you're looking for a countertop
slow cooker that can do other things as
well and add some functionality to your
cooking repertoire the ninjas are pretty
good device it costs 199 dollars and
that's pretty expensive for a slow
cooker you can get it a lot less than
that at Walmart or Target or retail
outlets like that but still it's a bit
of an upgrade from your standard $25 $35
machine I think it's worth it if you're
going to use all those extra features if
you're going to bake with it if you're
going to replace your oven replace your
stovetop sure that that's a good
investment but if you're just looking
for a classic slow cooker that's going
to make meatballs and BBQ for your next
big game day party I say go with cheaper
machine for seeing it I'm wreck rest
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
