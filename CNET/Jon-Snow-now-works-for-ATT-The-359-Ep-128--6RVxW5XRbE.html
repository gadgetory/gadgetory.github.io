episode 128 of the 359 podcast with Ben
Fox Rubin and Alfred and good morning
guys good morning welcome back everybody
so today we're gonna be talking about
obviously the big AT&amp;amp;T Time Warner deal
we're gonna get into more samsung galaxy
note 7 I thought we were done with now
it'll never be over this is like jon
snow coming back to life again yeah even
even worse even worse than that and then
we'll end with an interesting feature
that Alfred you wrote about that came
out today as always send in your
questions and comments Brian's going to
get through them at the end of the show
and yeah ready let's get moving do it
and in 32 welcome to the 359 where we
talk about the top tech news of the day
plus whatever crap we want to throw in
I'm Ben Fox Rubin now I'm out for dang
alright the big news this weekend is of
course a TNT's mega deal to buy Time
Warner with the phone company snatching
up the owner of HBO CNN and movie
studios Warner Brothers the acquisition
is expected to close by the end of next
year so Alfred do you think this deal
makes sense I think it makes perfect
sense i 80 you know they were looking
for a content provider hmm you know they
have this giant platform that where they
have you know they're trying to push out
DirecTV now and you're just there online
streaming service that they're going to
yeah it's supposed to come in November
yeah you know they're trying to you know
just have more content for all their
devices that they have out there and it
makes perfect sense for you know to have
time warner so instead of you know them
trying to create their own content they
have this you know giant platform what
they can just take all this stuff that's
already being shared like crazy i mean
think about how many people tweet about
Game of Thrones every Sunday and then
there are going to be able to have have
that I i can buy that that makes sense
from 18 tease perspective but what
exactly this time warner get out of this
i mean like are they going to benefit
from this deal in any way do you think i
think they get a massive platform to be
on now I mean obviously they're already
on everyone's television and
you know you have all these apps that
you can already watch it from you can
watch it from roku amazon all these
different you can watch out on your TV
or you log in from your smartphone but i
think you know this partnership with
AT&amp;amp;T gives them kind of more you know a
place to provide more features yeah
maybe yeah i'm not i'm not buying that
as much I like what you said about the
AT&amp;amp;T stuff yeah the other aspect that I
think is interesting is that first of
all regulators still have to approve
this deal and if they do I basically
think that like every telco and every
media company is going to be scrambling
to try to find a partner so I for one
will welcome our new corporate overlords
when CBS gets taken over but we'll see
what happens with that I I think they're
gonna have a hard time getting it
through the regulator's day you know
they did a conference call today and
they're not worried about that at all
they're kind of you know they made the
same argument on Saturday that this is
not a horizontal integration more so
vertical and I know haven't I convinced
but um you know we'll see how it goes
when it gets to Capitol Hill yeah next
Samsung is reportedly still trying to
figure out why Galaxy Note seven phones
are catching fire and that's now causing
delays in the development of the
upcoming Galaxy S aid so do you think
Samsung is ever going to be able to pull
it together this sounds really
problematic that they still don't
actually know why the phones had those
problems I think they'll be able to pull
it together I think this is you know a
pretty big deal t that you should
probably solve before you start you know
developing your next phone you know
they'd solve it before they uh the
regular recall so it's kind of one of
those things where it's a you know
probably this is just should be priority
number one I think it's a good thing
that they're you know not saying we'll
figure out of the next phone but I do
think it's weird that they still haven't
been able to figure it out yet
considered a that's so many of their
other devices aren't exploding you know
yeah it's weird that this one you know a
device has been tripping them up so hard
yeah I think they will figure it out but
it is surprising that it's taking time
and it's expected that there would be
some bleed over be fair though please
take your time like yeah can you imagine
how embarrassing oh to be in the next
year when they drop it again
I really really don't expect that to
happen I would hope so last outfit you
wrote a story today about a company
called sesame enable which develops an
app for people with physical
disabilities can tell us how it works a
bit yeah so it uses the front-facing
camera on your phone you need an android
seven point 0 device though and using
that at track it scans your head and
then it basically generates a cursor on
your phone screen and then you move your
head around you know pretty much as like
a mouse mmm kind of on your screen so
you don't need your hands or anything
like that it's been really helpful to
the paraplegic community who haven't
been able to use their hands are needed
a caregiver at you know control their
phones for them some people have been
able to use it to run their own
companies now others wow you know they
can make private phone calls or the one
man even use it to you know order
flowers for his wife who what usually
was the one helping him use the phone so
you can never really surprised it with
anything Wow very cool well check out
this story and if you want to read more
about that or other stories check us out
on cnet I'm Ben Fox Rubin malva I'm
Alfred Aang thanks very much let's say
that line was your last I can edit that
in post so I'm just giving I'm
everything okay I'd have no clue i
botched that it's okay isn't just saying
they had cut this later I'm out for dang
there we go oh that was nice I like the
second go-around that was that was
highly happened for messing up your name
that was very confident second well I
don't think it was the name I think was
that I'm whatever yeah I maverick it's a
daily podcast people just bear with us
while we which means he should know his
own name by now okay I don't try to be
nice look I don't introduce myself to
people very often okay really I always
introduce myself as I'm Ben Fox women
nice to meet you it's true because I as
every time he sees me in the hall goes
hey I'm still I as I nice day so I
should yeah um elfin in the room an
iphone 7 exploded as well yes okay talk
about that half a fair fair absolutely
all right I think it was just one is
very uh it to me it seems like more of
an outlier at this point then what
happening with the notes Evans which
they were happening so often that they
had to do multiple recalls on them right
so well this is a first though maybe
like there's going to be more happening
on next two weeks maybe we'll be doing
to be kind phone Apple can't figure out
why their iphone sevens are exploding if
that were the case then we have a
serious problem with battery technology
and we don't know why our technology is
doing what it's doing which would be
extremely scary and I'm getting ready
for the headline unlucky number 7 ooh
don't steal that don't steal that don't
steal that but if that does happen you
know oh yeah of course I'm like
terrified of battery technology now yeah
but what's weird about it as smartphones
have been around for like 10 years like
white well more if you're going to
include blackberry of course but why
would it be happening now with the
iphone also i think i keeps coming back
to that conversation we had i think last
week maybe the week before is it's gonna
completely change the game for quality
control maybe we just got lazy yeah
collectively but i think that the other
thing someone else in the in the chat
last week definitely said you know it's
it's electronics and mechanical moving
parts and chemicals like things are
going to explode and they absolutely are
but like you said this is what was that
look I'm sorry about like what thank you
for not dropping this bomb thank you for
gonna explode well the written you seem
like Irish technology has been around
for less so the risk factor in really
the risk is that's like saying as far
whenever such as the fire again like
there's always going to be an inherent
working with these elements especially
when they make them smaller pack in more
technology for sure however when they
have an assistant basis I would go out
on a limb and say Apple would be one of
the dumbest companies in the world if
they saw what was happening with Samsung
where they were twisting themselves in a
pretzel over the fact that their
flagship phone was literally crashing
and burning yeah and and then they still
came out with the iphone 7 if it if it
did have quality control problems I
think that that seems unlikely to me
however crazy things do happen so we'll
see if more iphones evans catch fire at
this point it seems like an outline
we're not like other previous iphones
also catching fire but again
was an outlier case where it was like
kind of just like that one phone yeah I
mean they make millions of them so there
are always going to be cases where
something is going to go horribly wrong
collective percentage across all
smartphones we're not doing too bad I
hope so I hope so because of those two
flagship phones let's suggesting that
were the case and it's not the case at
this point if that were to happen we're
like going back to the Stone Age like
I'm gonna just buy a flip phone because
I know it's not going to explode a
better face yeah just get of agent or a
brick phone I would love it if fashion
were the way that it is where brick
phones leasing back yeah or just come
back with these things I mean it's not
been to Brooklyn lately okay no I
haven't I make it a point not to go find
it and then just use the Find My brick
phone app by my break it's actually just
a string then that you keep time to your
belt loop or like I'd like I'll ugh what
are those like twisty cords or something
at least taken technology two cups yeah
that's what I use now trace have nothing
will blow people explode in your face uh
we've kind of touched on this before but
maybe opinions have changed their main
the chair asks will they permanently
stop the note line now we've taught
we've definitely talked about that
before and there are many people that
are on this podcast Roger and Alfred
included that seem pretty confident that
that's going to happen I'm still
skeptical that they're going to give up
on the note line after our developing it
for years but let's sit tight and find
out well you think about that story that
we were you know just talking about it's
saying that you know these battery
explosions are delaying the s8
production not the note 8 right because
the s8 is the next one to come out in
like late februari or march so they're
still working on the no date i hope i
don't know maybe they might not be yeah
if I were them I would sound like if I
were them I wouldn't be you know what
they could call it is the Samsung iphone
and then there's brewing and then ruin
that name too and then there's also
talks about you know just essentially
Samsung moving to a one year one phone a
year like timeline as opposed to you
know dropping
like three or four different phones yeah
that is you know it could be a way of
you know maybe they would just call it
the s8 plus or something because sa name
as a like the S name hasn't been
tarnished the same way as the notes him
yeah so you could do the essay tej the
essay that's Roger and I were talking
about though it's not oh is that right
it's not them like just like dropping
the note line I think it's more so
dropping the name of it just because
it's such like bad press for them now
that like whatever phone they drop you
know whatever note they drop next year
it's gonna be scrutinized like crazy
yeah yeah yeah absolutely um do we have
any like 18t time warner question yes
here's a really good one with the
marriage of 18 teen Time Warner will
that start axing HBO from other carriers
like Comcast and xfinity right so that's
a big big concern from a consumer
perspective that if AT&amp;amp;T ends up
controlling HBO CNN those different
places are they going to then put them
in their own little garden and not let
anybody else have them from a
distribution perspective that's
obviously very problematic for Time
Warner because they make the most money
by distributing it to the most places
but you know would a AT&amp;amp;T benefit from
that in some way maybe I think that
would be really stupid on 18 days part
especially for CNN because it's like an
editorial type of situation I mean they
already noted today that eighteen t is
not going to have any like part of CNN's
editorial decision hmm which is smart to
say that I think and I am I am saying
that would be a really stupid play for
AT&amp;amp;T just because you know a lot like
even CNN and you know Game of Thrones a
lot of their like popularity has been
through you know people unfortunately
taking their clips and posting it on
their their own pages and things like
that just like you know just getting
around everywhere like the time warner
model you were talking about and you
know for AT&amp;amp;T to just say we're just
going to keep this private to ourselves
i you're basically they're basically
they would just be saying you know
please pirate our content yeah that were
the case i would say though that like
don't take a tease word at face value
and like obviously regulators aren't
going to take that position either and
that's why deals like this where a like
a distributor ends up
a content provider is problematic for
consumers this is like okay is it going
to be harder for us to get this content
now so that's why I think I'll
regulators are going to scrutinize this
one very very closely and related how do
you think this whole up to chain into
Warner Brothers movies similarly um so
that distribution model is a little bit
different right opposed to like TV and
cable so distributing it to movie
studios is probably distributing it to
movie theaters is probably going to stay
the same because those are different
companies afterwards maybe the
distribution model could change like
after like leaves the theaters like
maybe AT&amp;amp;T ends up holding on to those a
little bit longer I have no I mean I
think I see the like peculation is more
so about like you're probably not going
to see that many you know time warner
movies on netflix or who you know amazon
prime anymore with that in that regards
with AT&amp;amp;T wanted to put it on their own
platform right like DirecTV now yeah I
think I think that's a little bit more
likely and i think netflix has been
preparing for this for some time now if
all the original program that it's been
mm-hmm you know adding to its library i
think they expected you know all these
like conglomerates should just take over
and you know take their fringe yeah yeah
yeah yeah i i'm definitely good with
that it's kind of a shame because it
kind of defeats the purpose of what we
were all helping the internet would be
those of us who were the code cutters
really yea the a la carte model now
you're just making it more complicated
now I'm gonna pay the exact same amount
of money to buy like 27 different yeah
yeah that being said a lot of the that
those fears haven't really born out with
NBCUniversal one time when when comcast
bought NBC Universal like you can still
get a lot of NBC shows on Netflix and I
think Amazon so it benefits these
companies like the content providers it
benefits them to get their stuff in as
many places as possible Netflix pays you
know so it I don't I don't know how much
sense it makes for them to like only
have it in DirecTV now but it is
certainly a possibility so from from 18
T's perspective it would benefit but
wouldn't benefit Time Warner I think
we're in that post honeymoon online
streaming content phase where everybody
starts diverting off on their own path
and then we realized that was a stupid
mistake yeah it fix it later right let's
let's we had it right the first time
it's ruined let's ruin everything and
then go back and fix it later that seems
America that seems to be the direction
the world is taking it breaks it on 2016
theme 16 theme let's break stuff and
then sugar how to fix it later so maybe
they should be more concerned for Warner
Brothers to actually start making some
better comic book movies whoo oh that's
that's a burn it's accurate too that's
that's a samsung note 7 right there and
on that note yeah seven probably done to
rip it up okay that works for me thanks
everybody for your questions as always
