a look at the Alienware 18 a very
unusual computer indeed in that it's a
big 18 inch desktop replacement gaming
system and even most of the gaming
laptops that we've seen this year have
actually been this new breed of smaller
13 inch and 14 inch gaming systems maybe
the kind that you're gonna plug into an
external monitor and only use the
built-in screen when you're traveling or
where you don't want to bother with that
this guy gigantic 18 inch 1920 by 1080
screen this is primarily the display
you're gonna use I can't imagine this
dragging this over to a TV and plugging
it into you know and even larger screen
even though it does have HDMI and may
display four it outputs pretty much
everything you need is built into here
it's gonna take up your entire desk the
thing is gigantic and it weighs more
than 12 pounds just like this if you add
in the gigantic AC adapter then it's
more than 15 pounds now Alienware did
sort of stack the deck a little bit when
they sent us this configuration it's
super high-end it's it's got a top of
the line into a core i7 it has got a 512
gig SSD and a regular hard drive on top
of that it's got two nvidia geforce 780
graphics cards and it's got a whopping
32 gigabytes of RAM I don't think I've
ever actually gotten that in a laptop to
review before you put all that together
and it's more than four thousand dollars
for this particular very very very
high-end configuration although the base
model starts at about 2100 but of that
level you're not really buying a super
gaming machine which i think is really
what you want from this guy now we've
got all the typical Alienware bells and
whistles you know the light-up touchpad
all the different lighting zones here
and there and the build quality and the
construction you know it's it's
excellent because Aling where as part of
dell and they can afford to design and
build these big gaming chasings whereas
if you get a gaming laptop from a
boutique pc maker it's generally off the
shelf body that they buy that's maybe
not specially made for gaming and they
just cram all this high-end stuff into
it so that's the real advantage here you
have this big kind of matte black slab
maybe a little bit like the obelisk in
2001 just sort of lands on your desk
takes up the entire thing if you're
going to spend that much
you certainly want to trick this out all
the way up to the top and we can play
just about any current PC game cranked
all the way up to the top levels I was
playing battlefield for an ultra mode
and it worked just fine but keep in mind
this is not something that's even
remotely portable it fits the definition
of laptop only in the broadest sense of
the word I'm Dan Ackerman and that is
the Alienware 18</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
