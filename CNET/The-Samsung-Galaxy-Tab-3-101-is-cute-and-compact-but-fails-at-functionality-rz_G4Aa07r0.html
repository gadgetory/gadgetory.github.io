taking a look at the Samsung Galaxy Tab
3 10.1 the 10-inch tablet is the largest
in the Galaxy Tab 3 lineup but its
design is relatively thin and light the
tablet is comfortable to hold and feel
smaller than other 10 inch tablets
thanks to its smaller bezels on the top
edge
there's the power button volume rocker
and IR blaster with the headphone jack
not too far away on the top-left
edge above the speaker the speaker's
located on the top right and left edges
are powerful and can be turned up pretty
loud although the sound quality is still
average for a tablet the bottom edge
houses the microphone pinhole and a
microUSB port the top three ten-point
one fatal flaw is the location and high
sensitivity of the menu and back buttons
on the lower bezel when holding the
tablet in one hand it's extremely easy
to mindlessly graze the buttons and
activate their function there are no
options to deactivate them or decrease
their sensitivity the screen is
responsive to touch but performance was
rather slow and often lagged the tablets
1 gigabyte of RAM is evident when trying
to quickly navigate from one app to
another especially if multiple apps are
open the 3.2 megapixel rear camera
offers no manual focus option or flash
but photos come out clear with lifelike
colors the 1.3 megapixel front-facing
camera isn't very sharp but otherwise
produces well exposed photos the Tab 3
10.1 runs Android 4.2 with Samsung's
TouchWiz interface and how this a 1.6
gigahertz dual-core CPU and 16 gigabytes
of internal memory with about 11
gigabytes of free space the tablet's
resolution is average but unimpressive
by today's standard at 1280 by 800
pixels at $400 the top-three 10.1 is too
expensive for what it is I like its
lightweight and compact design but the
extra sensitive buttons on the bottom
bezel are a constant nuisance for more
information check out the full review on
cnet.com i'm Xiomara blanco and this has
been the first look of the Samsung
Galaxy Tab 3 10.1</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
