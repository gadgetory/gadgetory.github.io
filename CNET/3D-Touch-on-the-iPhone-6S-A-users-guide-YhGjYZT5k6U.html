up their sleeve 3d touch
what exactly is 3d touch how does it
work
what does it do come with me I'll show
you once upon a time
smartphones were 2d touch panes you
swipe you tap 3d touch adds a
pressure-sensitive layer the Apple watch
has something like it so did the new
MacBook trackpads
but this is called 3d touch because you
can push in anywhere at varying levels
the more you push potentially the more
things happen almost like a button it's
not really like a button though it's
more like you press and apples new
tactic vibration gives you a gentle
throb so what does it do open up an
iPhone 6's out of the box and make sure
you try these things out it's time to
learn some new tricks shortcuts try
pushing in on app icons ones that work
with 3d touch have pop-out menus mail
Apple music photos maps and more they
don't all work but more will come pink
and pop hi there little pop-up previews
they leap out of apps or links for you
to look at you can peek it mail photos
addresses map locations and apps like
Instagram and Pinterest already use it
things the home button used to do you
could press in from the side of the
screen while in an app to swipe and
switch apps used to have to double click
the home button for that change the
keyboard into a trackpad push in and the
keys go blank
now you can swipe around and move your
cursor anywhere to edit there's a lot of
potential yet to come
3d touch has varying levels of pressure
games are starting to use it you could
put it into other apps -
pressure-sensitive sketches or who knows
what 3d touch is just in its early days
just remember to push in from time to
time you never know what you'll find
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
