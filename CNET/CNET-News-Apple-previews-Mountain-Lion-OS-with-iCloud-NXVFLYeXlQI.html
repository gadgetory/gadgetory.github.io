with mountain lion our mission remains
the same to deliver the world's most
advanced operating system for notebook
and desktop computers with an interface
optimized for multi-touch trackpad and
mice and at the same time line makes it
more natural than ever to work with the
other new devices in our lives now
mountain lion is a major release with
over 200 new features this morning I'd
like to detail just 8 for you and we're
going to start with iCloud so when you
sign in to your new mac with your Apple
ID we automatically configure all of
these applications to work with iCloud
and so whether you're working in your
mail with your contacts your calendar
all of your content is up-to-date across
all of your devices and with mountain
line we introduced three great new apps
optimized for iCloud messages which
brings I message for the first time to
the Mac reminders and nodes but we're
also bringing integration for your
document based apps in mountain lion for
the feature we call documents in the
cloud now documents in the cloud does
two important things first it makes it
provides a simple new way to access your
and organize your documents when you
launch an app like pages it comes up
with a document library of all the pages
documents you have in the cloud
organized chronologically so the newest
ones are easy to find right at the top
and second documents in the cloud makes
these document libraries available and
up-to-date across all your Mac's and all
of your iOS devices now we've adopted
documents in the cloud on all of our key
document based applications like Pages
Numbers and Keynote and system apps like
preview and text edit and we have a
developer SDK so that developers can add
the support in there
apps as well but of course Game Center
is ultimately all about gaming and we
support both turn-based and head-to-head
gaming both mac to mac and
cross-platform iOS to mac / game center
I'd like to give you a little demo of
airplay and Game Center now and here I
see my game center account and I can
also see all of my game center friends
I've got one here mr. X who's been
meaning to play me in this new game
that's coming out called CSR racing mr.
X here is actually working on an iPad
and on his iPad he can invite me to play
this game CSR racing which is an
upcoming title from natural motion and
when he does you notice i get of course
a notification in Notification Center I
click on it and I'm instantly launched
into the game now natural motion was
originally developing this just as an
iOS title but they found it so easy to
bring it to the mac and integrate game
center they'll be simultaneously
releasing it for iOS and Mac this summer
all right looks like we're up to race
i'm in the red racer OS 10 on the right
in white here we go
again this is over airplay everything
you're seeing
all right I think I gotcha
oh well this is just a quick overview of
mountain lion and in addition to these
major features there's so much more
there things like vips in mail where you
can mark any people that are important
to you and new incoming messages will
show up as notifications for you search
in launchpad gatekeeper to help keep
your system free from malware and
offline reading list we're in Safari if
you add things to your reading list you
can still read them later even when
you're disconnected from the internet so
mountain lion we're going to be
delivering it to customers next month
via the mac app store and you know while
lion was priced I think very
aggressively at 2999 we want even more
people to get their hands on mountain
lion it's going to be just 19
and this price is for upgrades both from
lion and all the way from Snow Leopard
and you're single purchase will upgrade
all of your personal max</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
