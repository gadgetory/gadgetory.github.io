tuning in to the 404 show on this friday
jun 10 that is the date it is that is
the data of today I'm happy to be here
because across the table smiling me like
he always does mr. Russ fresh dick hello
I'm trying to do the dreamwork smile you
know that smile we're like a half smile
that all their characters do I don't
know what the hell that is perhaps to
explain that is Sadie Gennis from TV
Guide thank you so much welcome back to
the show Sadie again thanks for having
me of course what uh what's new with you
what are you watching on television
right now Game of Thrones obviously and
unreal just came back for a second phone
man everyone loves that show i've not
watched it yet what I do like Pamela
Alden I believe her name is o brien
right from californication yeah to be
honest I don't actually know his or she
choosin Louie she's Louis XI Xin Liu
issues don't think she's on that really
i saw an ad for in the subway i was like
oh pamela why she's the voice of bobby
from king of the hill yeah also that I
think you might be confusing her with
constant Zimmer okay do they look some
more maybe it's short brunette yes oh
maybe with a bob yeah okay so speaking
of Game of Thrones we're gonna spend at
least 15 minutes at the end of the show
just going at it yeah uh so I will once
again pause the show and sort of like
throw out a little disclaimer that we're
going to get nasty with Game of Thrones
obviously when we've got a TV Guide
editor here we need to do some
dissecting right we need to put on the
latex gloves we need to break out the
scalpels a little bit of the nitrous and
we're going under ok we're doing a
little bit of surgery we're going to
talk about the current season of Game of
Thrones spoilers in which Peter Dinklage
has been on in two weeks but that's fine
but that's at the end of the show that's
at the end of the show again no spoilers
till we get to that point in the program
so other than Game of Thrones what are
you watching well we just talked about
unreal yeah but that's not a show for me
right um
every I think it's interesting the
premise is very interesting you would be
shocked at how hooked you would get on
it what uh what network is it on hey ok
it's on lifetime go on it's basically
like the behind-the-scenes production of
a bachelor reality show and so you see
how the producers sort of manipulate all
the contestants into doing horrible
things that's so meta it's sort of like
a Larry Sanders right for reality is
that a fair comparison I kind of I don't
know it's it's really smart it's very
political they have like the first black
suit or this season and one of its
characters came back after the hiatus
now a men's rights activist so it's
exploring sort of like feminism and the
men's rights movement okay is it I it's
set in the 90s you said or is it modern
oh it's modern day okay I'm for some
reason I thought it was like early in
the days of money TV but it's it's all
modern day it's a comedy no it's a drama
oh it gets really dark because because
all that is dark it's me yeah it's
bad I'm sorry I don't know if you like
that stuff like real life bachelorette
stuff we're like they have these poor
assholes on TV or like I was falling in
love with him when I was seventh in line
to make out with him I thought we really
shared a connection it's like no you're
just being an idiot on TV that's why I
didn't want any of the bachelor shows
but i watch all of the vh1 reality
dating shows those forces yeah yeah
those like the the what's it called the
way Shawn Michaels well yeah yeah I like
the idea of realloc reality shows are
taken to the level of self-parody all
right and unreal takes that like a step
further and makes it this really intense
smart soapy drama can be really funny
too oh yeah I like survivor that's the
one reality show I can watch that is a
great CBS property it is yeah I feel
like it that's the most genuine you can
get I guess raised the race game as well
whatever amazing another only on CBS
what's the second you're right the
second it's like you fall in love with
this person forever and ever like all
you get is like people that are really
obsessed with you know themselves which
obviously you get on Survivor too but
there's so much like trumping up like
emotion and feeling and
they just give them booze and no food on
the first night so it's do they do they
do that on an unreal do they talk about
that oh yeah at one point they figure
out one of the girls has an eating
disorder and they purposely take away
her marker food so that she won't know
when to stop puking I don't know what
marker food is it's like she would eat
Cheetos so that when she threw up she
would know what stop oh my god it's dark
I can't believe it's on lifetime yeah
usually lifetimes like reserved for lamb
but I think that's like a rebrand bad
right huh they want to like they want to
set them so they don't want to be
thought of as like crappy TV movie yeah
yeah they're sort of China well at the
same time like hold on to those movies
of the week they're trying to move past
this i get rid of the whole thing well
they're cheap I mean they cost nothing
to run right they're great I want them
on demand so I love having Sadie on
because like I've never agreed with
someone so often and disagreed at the
same time like her see I'm gonna talk
about you like you're not here for a
second her fluctuating like taste sure
is so off they're all over the radar
with me it with mine at least I don't
know it's really funny the baby is that
them do they do santa baby what the
hell's that oh I think are you thinking
like the hallmark yeah holiday movies
yeah is it a different they both do a
lot of holiday I'm not a holiday movie
personal I don't like murder what if
it's murder / days okay that sounds like
home alone at this point yeah that
sounds a little it's gonna have a
wholesome ending I don't want to hold
them understood understood mark alright
so we want to talk too much about all
that TV stuff I am looking forward to
June up to july i think you know why
show that comes back mr. robot mr.
effing robe i still haven't watched
season one do your you yeah I know I
sitting waiting for me to watch it I
need to it's one of those shows that
like we just finished better call Saul
season two okay so there needs to be
like a little bit of a buffer before we
start like another serious show and
we're in that buffer now and it's it's
the next on the docket it needs to
happen that shows that's just great and
I remember uh Sadie you were here with
Adam Brian who's no longer at TV got
we were you were basically like trying
to pitch me on all of the upfront shows
right there were like being announced
did you remember that angle vaguely and
like mr. robot was mentioned and I'm
like oh what's that and we just got into
and just on paper I was like oh I'm
supposed to like this show and then I
saw the trailer and I was like okay yeah
okay and then BAM like that show that
show works it's just got a great pilot
you know I've just have to do I feel
like there was a lot of weird upfront
stuff announced this here do you want
like any any shows that stand out for
you yes it is called downward dog oh I
haven't heard of this one wha what
network is it on it's on ABC any stars
because how much fun it stars Allison
tolman from the first evil our guy oh I
love her yes she's great yeah but the
shows about yoga I talking dumb hmm this
is amazing it's narrated by her dog okay
so it's like uh that's not I'm saying no
oh no no it's not like Wilfred like it's
a dog and they CDI his mouth to mrs.
it's like shaggy dog the Tim Allen movie
place is like Garfield it's not bad like
it's is it is it single-camera like no
no audience yeah no audience okay and in
kind it kind of gave me Louie vibes it's
cuz it's very dark it's like ABC's not
that kind of network sad sure and weird
okay no idea where the shows going after
the pilot picked up Wow I liked it like
I and not just cuz it is hilarious sure
it's a talking dog two mommies imma beat
you and cg the guy's face like was the
voice of dogs I have no idea really they
wouldn't get it cuz she's not a would
obviously very talented actress but not
a lot of name recognition outside of the
media I would say this is like her first
big role right Fargo it's a very
interesting choice for her but I
definitely see what I turned into her I
fell in love with her and Fargo I was
just like oh you are so wholesome and
lovable and the energy was great you're
just an it's also a network well you're
not gonna turn down a network no of
course not anything where I go like the
most part which I'm sure when like
someone pitched her on it she was like
and run my buddy the dog what now yeah I
say give it a chance it probably won't
really hit it off with audiences but
it's definitely interesting and there's
so many reboots coming out so a show
like downward dog really stands out and
at least like it has that guy anymore
look I respect Taking Chances I respect
a breath of fresh air so when you say a
lot of reboots like what what is some of
that stuff lethal weapon The Exorcist
training day oh I heard about training
yeah I mean those are all like very out
of the Exorcist who wants to watch that
every week right tune in next week where
we twist the head off this young girl
that's the other ones are like I think
pretty straightforward like whatever
it's a cop show and it's it's like a
light-hearted cop show but yeah it's
very obvious what they're trying to do
and even though they're reboots it's
like how married to that format are they
nuts all you need is like a crooked cop
for training day and you're like set
yeah now so I get it you can call that
training day but yeah that's a little
discard it's good to hear that there's
more original stuff obviously networks
tend to be a little more safe when it
comes to that stuff but I guess downward
dog proves this proves the rule yeah two
thumbs up from me to pause that was up
yeah it's like Turner and hooch or
something like yeah alright so that's
that's we're watching on TV I have a
confession to make I have recently
fallen in love heads with yes Pence is
for the YouTube personality okay i'm
sure most of the people listening to
this will know who he is yeah his name
is casey nice that yeah and I'm I've
just fallen down the hole and I think
he's amazing really yeah uh so it's
tough to describe without kind of like
just going in I told Sadie like a half
hour before we got in here and you
watched the first you watch like one of
his videos or some of it I watched
almost all okay I'm what okay so here's
the deal here's who this guy is sure
okay uh he's arguably the most
he's the arguably the hottest the
buzziest YouTube personality right now
okay so you have people who have like
you know PewDiePie who's got like 45
share subscribers and you got people who
are in like the the 52 tens I think he's
right around like 3.4 million okay
harbors her up but that's just a number
it's all about like but his trajectory
right now guys on fire okay I'll just
say I'm just saying talk about like was
high when I'm very proud for him I'm not
again so let me explain who he is right
yeah so he grew up in a numb in
Connecticut okay and he must have like
some kind of history in production he
has like a background in production him
and his brother sold a show to HBO like
six years ago okay not one percent sure
if that's totally accurate but the show
went nowhere never got picked up I think
HBO bought it but sure enough the show
didn't do anything so he's been all over
the place he did a few YouTube videos
about like iphone or like the original
ipod not having a replaceable battery
and he's done some like weird like new
york city bike lane videos that like
really took off how he wasn't the one
that did the snowboarding video yes I
saw that okay okay that was pretty good
right that video is amazing yet when you
just look at it from like the production
value sure so now what he does is he has
a social media company that he runs I
don't know how well that does but he's
just now chronicling his life and he
does daily vlogs and he does these like
daily videos that are like 8-10 minutes
yeah and the production value is just
off the charts he uses a series of like
time lapse and drones like each video
yes has like these amazing sweeping
drone shot air that's all New York and
it's just his life and he's got a very
busy schedule and like his entire
existence is this self-perpetuating
machine right so like he's become super
popular on YouTube so obviously brands
give a about the right so like
brands come to him and say hey come here
and like his life gets more interesting
the
more he's exposed to these things which
in turn makes his vlog more interesting
right so it's kind of this like
fantastic storm for him but he's not
doing like place like he's not doing
like height trying to hide that brands
are paying him to do stuff or is he I'm
still not totally sure about that but
I'm also not walking away from each
episode he does where it's like oh that
was a samsung thing or that was a nike
thing okay have any of the episodes been
like hey we're gonna walk over the
Samsung store and check out the new
Samsung Samsung yeah so there's one time
where he's like Samsung invited me to
this party I'm gonna go check it out
okay and he goes and he doesn't talk
about Samsung isn't talk about anything
he just talks about like the DJ that's
there or something like he's being paid
by I'm sure he's not I'm sure he's
getting taken care of yeah okay
obviously he's making money off his
being such a big do you think he has a
production like still around him that's
the thing I want to know like his videos
are so well done and look Sadie you
watched you watched a little bit of one
episode I watched almost all of it and
you could tell like the production value
was really good were you engaged by it
no I thought he was in college I made it
about like eight minutes into a 10
minute video its pretty long for web
video I thought it was so boring his one
did you watch the one you told me two
oars like my skateboard fell in the
river yeah it would be like a minute of
Henle shopping for a camera and then a
time-lapse montage set to music and then
a minute of him like skateboarding yeah
and the time-lapse montage sent to the
exact same music sounds very indulgent
is about that yeah it's self-indulgent
it's boring his life is not that
interesting like why is it just because
you like the production values or do you
actually finally I mean interesting I
find the content interesting I think he
gets to do a lot of cool stuff to me
like I watch what he does and there's
like how does he have time to do this
the fact that he's filming for hours on
end every day he'll on hold that thought
please hold that thought because I need
to tell you why you're wrong now I'm
kidding he has all this stuff and then
he somehow finds the hours and must take
to edit it because he publishes yes
today's video today yeah there's no way
he's cutting it himself yes Ross that's
right that's where I would think why are
you assuming this I don't know I just I
feel like I have a fairly good
production I and like again could he
have all these people behind maybe but
like when he has the drone shots you can
see it's a video of himself flying the
drone like okay do you like sure but a
drone takes 10 seconds 10 minutes to fly
you'd be supporting a 10 minute video
that's like heavily produced today it
sucks that you could be in eight hours
at least of work right I agree so who's
doing is it him cutting it who is 4
billion whatever he probably a he makes
money if the social media company is the
JT makes money there of course he would
spend 30 grand a year to hire some kid
so maybe he's not cutting it but he's
shooting it oh shoot at all it doesn't
matter exactly just drop the actual
video no video was boring well that was
good that's what you you recommended
that that's the best of the vascular
knows that isn't one you told me I got
that's the one I just watched and I was
like this is really good and I saw the
as i mentioned i saw the snowboarding in
New York's a little bit of context here
up into January there was like a
four-foot blizzard the hit New York he
and this other video guy decided to go
out and snowboard through the streets of
Manhattan and they covered it really
well with like a lot of drone footage
and yeah cool camera angles and Sofia it
was cool for a good minute it was cool
yeah but like that doesn't make me an
all-out hardcore all right aside from
the fact you guys clearly don't give a
 about what I'm bringing to the
table and saying I like this guy yeah
I'll get my interested that I wasn't a
pen so I'll give you that great that
means a lot so what I need you to do is
like again I should have had you watch
this before you came on but it's fine
because I want I'm clearly not doing a
good job pitching it to you yeah but I
want you to watch it okay and be like
something happened where I was watching
this every day and I'm just like man
this guy's like really good at what he
does and he's just found him really
likable yeah I 30 that was the thing
we're like I saw his photo and I'm like
this guy's a douche bag right and then I
watched him and I'm like
oh no wait he just has a fairly
interesting life he's got a wife he's
got a kid he's in New York he's doing
his thing I don't know yeah I guess it's
boring huh I guess it's boring do you
remember when Twitter came out no
everyone was complaining like why do I
care if you're eating a sandwich right
it's that concept but in a 10 minute
youtube video every day but there is an
audience yet so that's the things like
whether or not you think it might be
interesting no no matter how you feel
right now at this table clearly a lot of
people dig it yeah and he is an
incredibly popular public figure to the
point like he goes around it everyone
knows who he is I would know where he
cuts it in such a way that any he only
leaves the shots in were people
organizing right but like it's every day
so it's not like or he is paid to go
places and the PR guys like hey see
maybe I'm sorry I maybe it's a ruse
maybe it's all a facade start yes but to
your point that like oh like its good
clearly people like it a lot the most
popular things are not necessarily the
best right quality things that I hold
the big bang theory and I already said
how much I love CBS properties so I can
knock at least one of them it's called a
big bang theory I'm glad you said it or
nothing okay I don't necessarily enjoy
that show either I know a lot of people
do sure again maybe that's like a
generational thing and maybe that's the
thing with this too right cuz like and
that's where I want to get with this
where this is like the new face of
entertainment thank you it's a new face
but sure I just think it's it's way more
important like it's way more impressive
to me that he'll put a video up and over
a million people watching 24 hours like
a TV show wishes it could do that so
what does that mean TV shows get more
views than that right I feel like moat
at these days I don't know like cable
stuff hey I don't know I feel like it's
a lot so I'm not going to deny that a
million views in a day is a lot it's a
lot there's notes a lot yeah it's just
weird cuz I see some of these YouTube
people like flame out like I get very
fascinated when you see like hey
person has six million subscribers and
they were huge six years ago and now all
their videos get like 2,000 views
because the way YouTube sort of
prioritizes like new subscribers right
so i don't know i don't want to rip into
the guy too much because again I'm not
as familiar and you haven't seen Isaac
no I saw there's other words no way
which is okay yeah I think if you can
summarize the video in a gift in 10
seconds you know you probably don't need
10 minutes of masturbatory production
value we're gonna use that word I just
find it incredibly hypnotic and are
soothing okay there's something about
his show that is like very relaxing to
me okay that's why I found it boring it
was kind of repetitive but I understand
like how that could be soothing in your
eyes very reliable yes consistent yeah
just do me a favor Sadie and you don't
even have to report back you can report
back to me like I will not watch another
video yeah really you have it is to the
best that is very generous of Sadie to
do something so long on the internet
sees and like I do not care to watch
most things that are 10 minutes long I
don't even wash this song that's over
four minutes under still watch a
10-minute video understood that's what I
found the most compelling about his
stuff where it was like I did not
realize eight minutes had gone by okay
and I was like this this is good he's
kept my attention here I don't know okay
so wait so you you won't listen to a
four minute song you won't watched a
video how do you read a 20-minute
article do you do that in pieces ah yeah
increases in pieces that is what this
show is falling into pieces thanks a lot
singer well I can sit down and like read
a book for hours on end yeah video it's
hard to make a 10-minute video that's
not like in episode of some right there
was no narrative art so like here's the
thing there is a narrative arc not in
the video I watched and not in any of
the description that you know but it's
like a it's always constantly going on
Mike his life is just constantly
happening at you and like what I
asked you to do is just like peek in
real quick to like a UH out of context
sort of video yeah you know you have to
watch many episodes you can watch our
videos in Jeff's defense you do have to
watch like six episodes to justified
before it starts getting good so I as
someone who just are watching justified
I disagree really you think it's great
for it from the beginning I think it's
solid and I think it's solid but not
great one a door with the pilot on the
rooftop no I don't know what he's like
honor justify with Timothy old oh I
actually I sound like very like a gun
under the table yeah yeah that file it's
not bad yeah the pilots okay yes okay
and then it sort of falls into
procedural stuff for a little bit and
then it gets amazing well well once
Walton Goggins gets free hey hey oh no
no I'm unlike season three and i think
walton goggins is my dear soul fantastic
he's amazing i'm so excited as vice
principal are you it feels very
eastbound and down these pendants better
now had one good season that's not true
no no no one and a half I'll give you
one I like the last season really I did
yeah yeah what a hell that was you
enjoyed that i only watch the scene with
lindsey Lowen the end isn't was very
funny the end with the future yes uh
yeah it's I don't know not for a row not
for everybody but yeah I'm excited for
that show for sure he's amazing he's
also a great cross dresser and oh yeah
concise manner gate you did you saw
those right I saw the photos I quit
watching sons of anarchy yeah I stopped
it's not it wasn't the best show um it
was good but it wasn't the pay fell off
let's talk about Twitter okay I had no
idea until yesterday but there's been
all kinds of crazy Twitter acts like not
just like a few here and there but like
super mega yeah brands and people Mark
Zuckerberg the NFL Katy Perry what uh
what's going what's going on well here's
what's going on it a lot of it has to do
with people using the same password for
multiple accounts right so like that's
how they got zuckerberg sure zuckerberg
was was exploited and they used the same
password he used for another server what
was his password i think it was like
something
so and that's the worst part is when you
find out with like how they're not using
some sort of hexadecimal right like
Alvin numeric generic like craziness I
think Zuckerberg was like da da da or
something like that you look embarrassed
for him yeah because it's like
humiliating right like when your
password gets out and your passwords
like something real stupid and like
easily guessable yeah would you stop
watching Casey if it came out that his
passwords like ABC 123 I think I might
be like oh ask this guy what a dumbass
uh but but i think you know you can talk
about like why um all of these you know
pet passwords are getting out there but
it i think like the bigger issue is like
what like what is happening right now is
also Lana Del Rey Kylie Jenner who is a
person people give a about I
probably would probably happen was that
they access something that a lot of
people used so it wouldn't be facebook
but like something as ubiquitous his
facebook youtube or whatever and and
then they just search for celebrities or
celebrity names that matched because
it's like for them all to happen at the
same time seems very weird otherwise
they've been in waves oh yeah there was
recently a big linkedin hack oh right
which I don't think celebrities are on
linkedin benoni but that is another big
server that was recently hacked this is
interesting the NFL got the NFL handle
at NFL got hacked and they actually said
the they tweeted out that roger goodell
the Commissioner was dead like imagine
seeing that tweet from at NFL thats dark
like that eft it's basically the exact
opposite of what they did from katy
perry's account which was tweeted
something along the lines of like i love
you Taylor Swift oh good Eve oh they
have crazy beat really I'm there uh oh
they both date john mayer they both
dated john mayer and there were like
rumors that bad blood is about katy
perry and that she tried to sabotage
Taylor's tour really ya see that tweet
is why i know about the hat because i
saw that as like crazy
not right someone who's not into katie's
Twitter I thought that was all about
like female empowerment know that squad
goals is the music video is all like the
women like no it said asses but it's a
group of women preparing to fight
another group can you can you got it can
you like give me a crash course in like
what Taylor Swift is she's great i
really liked hours both cuz i kind of
love her too yes fine that's great
you're perfect for this job I don't like
I know who she is i could pick her out
of a lineup sure i know she has a song
shake it off shake it off yeah is that
it players gonna hate haters gonna hate
her whatever it is yeah I don't
understand like is she country too she
used to be country and now she's moved
whose christian bulb pop was she
christian right or am i thinking someone
else I thought she had like a Christian
a series of really I believe you're
thinking Katy Perry Katy Perry really
into the Jesus guy okay loves them that
guy loves his work sure she is moving
into a convent is she what she's gotten
a legal battle with a bunch of nuns to
buy a convent and another like you are
not allowed to live here right but you
know you don't exactly look like you're
devoted to the man upstairs me know
nothing honey nuns gonna still live
there when she moved in I don't think
that I think like they were selling it
but they didn't want to sell oh I see
and it's yeah oh man well look like you
could just say Price is Right the price
is right yeah that's that's interesting
she's really into religious as far as i
understand it all right Katy Perry I
know she comes from a really religious
family I can't speak to her personally I
want to say she has like religious
tattoos but that could be maybe I I mean
they're both just I've pop stars
essentially like ready wat but are they
good like Taylor Swift like Lady Gaga is
good I think Katy Perry has good tunes
as well like does she write her stuff
katy perry has hits taylor swift rights
album right i wouldn't say katy perry
has like a gang that's like when Oliver
Stone told Quinn turn tunes like I make
films you make movie
off rap brittle brittle so okay so she's
popular she its boobs her thing with
like she was like the ambassador for New
York unlike that when you wrote a song
called welcome to New York and I was
somewhere else not from New York she's a
country i'm here now somewhere okay
regards we also know that she has a cat
named uh meredith gran Olivia Benson
Olivia Benson right live events is a
character on law and order SVU and
Meredith Grey is from Grey's Anatomy all
right that's kind of funny yeah ok so i
guess that explains it does it that had
explained it all right yeah who she is
analyzed I think you just don't like pop
music which is fine no no I like lady
gaga um yeah she's kind of out of vogue
now right oh she's more like he hasn't
put out in music album artpop which was
any strong best yeah yeah I think we got
all the gear like musically riskier but
not you know but yeah she just hasn't
been in the public eye for a while if
you're into jazz together Tony Bennett
album no I know that that's a nest thing
she'sshe's what does she be coming she's
becoming like the she you could tell
like she had she has sort of ambitions
that reside well beyond just music Lady
gaga yeah she wants to act she wants to
chuys in wants a better horror story
right she wanting children go love that
she's kind of crazy yeah it's a go-go it
was fun dessert not her I mean Golden
Globes they kind of give out and like no
one cares no golden globes are bought
yeah basic well so our Oscars yeah
that's Jordan Hoffman told us yeah sure
um alright so I don't know how we got
there wide-ranging that was a little
wide-ranging but there are significant
Twitter hacks and I guess like so you're
like okay I heard about all these
Twitter acts how does it affect me don't
use the same password or if you're going
to do that use use some authentication
two-factor authentication right which
really is pretty easy all things
considered and will protect you but
that's all but to two-step verification
is really just a cell phone thing what
do you mean like so i guess like if
someone has your cell phone and has your
passport or fine that's valid those two
steps are compromised
yeah I have a question go for it I do
not have a password on my phone is that
a huge mistake I don't think so uh I
mean it's sort of depends so the
question I would say is like do you have
like a banking app on your phone yes and
when you touch the banking app does it
open immediately to all of your accounts
no you have to enter your pass and you
have two factor authentication on that
banking not quite sure what that means
verification is like okay you you know
the password right but do you have the
phone of the person it's generally it's
designed for like oh you've never logged
in on this computer before that's
sketchy yeah yeah but it since I have
logged in on my phone right that
wouldn't I don't know I it's like for
google google i do is that happen to you
all the time but two step I use it on I
mean we have to for work but I for even
for my personal use all the time it de
no it I once I've logged in on a certain
computer at least 30 days advice yeah
and then you just whatever enter I've
the app and it entered the code and some
other 30 days it's a long-winded way of
saying it's a backup it's a safety net
yeah we're tech just because you have
this person's password well maybe you're
still not who you say you are let's take
it one step further and send you a text
message and maybe you enter that pin I
would say if you became like an
overnight celebrity for some reason or
other you might want to increase that
security a little bit okay so maybe like
one or two months I'll need to do why do
you set a password on your phone as well
i'm lazy even an easy password is like
enough to discourage people from toronto
i guess it yeah I I do um I do the the
thumb thing the fingerprint thing yeah
but no that's what do you mean that's a
low noise it's great and you can also
set it to be like oh I all only ask for
the password like once every six hours
yeah okay so there are options to like
look I don't know i think it's worth
doing yeah I take it back I said it
wasn't a big deal you should do it yeah
I take it back all right I'm just
thinking I'm looking out for your safety
Sadie thanks stuff that means a lot look
yeah we're friends we gotta watch each
other's back to you okay world okay now
we're gonna talk about one other thing
and then we'll get into again Game of
Thrones which you will know for sure
when to stop yes
ah so last couple weeks as I was
explaining to you Sadie Russ and I and
our guests have been balancing /
juggling the many social etiquettes that
we all face on a daily basis it we went
from when is the right time to give
someone a hug or kiss on the cheek which
kind of want to get that answer from
everybody that we have on so when is it
okay to give someone a hug when is it
okay to give someone I'll peck on the
cheek or when is it just like hey let's
shake hands because this is professional
well I think if you're in a professional
situation of course no kiss is on the
try right yeah all those you remember
the media and you see a friend of yours
that's also remember the media at a
press event and but you're close you
were college roommates I think friend
like there's like a hierarchy of like
titles like which matters more and I
think friend is above like professional
sure co-worker here yes so that then the
friend rules would apply round in there
yes right here so though yet that they
Trump the professional rules yeah is
there ever a situation where you've
someone's like giving you like the kiss
on the cheek in like whoa all the time
no what's that what why all the time
it's like my boyfriend's family whenever
I see them they like hug me and give me
like kisses on the cheek double kisses
not like the European thing I think just
one ok but like I grew up we're like we
never did that also thank you once I met
his family they started happening every
time I said hi to someone and it's it's
not weird but it definitely like threw
me off any signs family is from Long
Island yeah that's what I'm sayin like
that's normal to me yeah yeah I like I
don't think there's anything wrong with
it it's just weren't right wasn't God
expecting it and so like I froze and I
was something like his dad was like
hugging me and kissing me on the cheek
and I to the first thing you met I don't
think the first time we met but like the
second time sure shadys part of the
family yeah yeah yeah like once I became
like a member of the family sure it
threw me off but now you're cool with it
yeah like I don't think there's anything
wrong with kissing someone on the cheeks
right I was not a primeira and I did not
want reactor
really yeah and there are obviously
instances where it is inappropriate to
kiss someone on the cheek as i mentioned
right like your mailman I don't do that
that's weird unless your college
roommates with your milk right nearly
all my god it's you okay you brought up
a subject that I think is well worth
bringing up um can you can you like
introduce it for us real quick yeah okay
like I I just want to get this out there
I think chivalry is great when I'm like
on a date with a guy and he opens the
door for me or like pulls out my chair I
think that's lovely it like really makes
me happy right however when men I don't
know do certain chivalrous things to me
I get really angry to cash thing so
examples what are some of the everyday
you come in and out of this office on
the elevator and if I'm in an elevator
with like three dudes even if they're
standing in front of me they will wait
to get off the elevator until I step off
yeah and I why it's jeff done this
before do you that's not me what but
things if Jeff didn't it wouldn't bother
me cuz I know Jeff it's more when like
strange Ranger strange men I got a free
pass do you do things like that like
they don't owe me anything I don't need
that sort of special privilege it's just
an elevator just okay so yeah so right
so what we're getting I yeah do you
wanna you ever thought you want to Finn
oh yeah what we're getting at is like
this like we talked about these
unwritten laws like unwritten social
etiquettes that like I've kind of been
around for hundreds of years we're like
what you're describing is like strangers
when it's a male-female sort of thing
have these acting a certain way things
that they do whether be holding a door
open or waiting till they get off that
the elevator sure like that okay so
I'm gonna paint a scenario okay um is
630 at night you're on the L train it's
a zoo on the L train there's no seats at
all and there's a guy standing in for
sitting in front of you and he offers
his seat to you how would you internally
react to that situation
a to a question obviously I would take
the seat because the killer be killed on
the subway I totally agree I would take
the c2 was offered to me but do you like
would you sit down and be like that was
 up that doesn't make me like
upset like the elevator thing cuz to me
it's like oh like he's doing cuz he
thinks maybe she's tired or something
but what ya say that is that I guess
what makes me so angry about the
elevator there's no benefit like there's
no need for me to get off first I like i
don't understood it's this and the logic
it is a same instinct yes it is born
from the same source where it's like I
didn't say you would not bother you oh
well no like and you you put it very
succinctly to start as well like this
the humanitarian ization sure of the
world yeah right so it's well the idea
of everyone being equal of course where
it's like is that okay like is that
legacy of men going out of their way not
going out of their way doing social
nuances right favoring the female
variety like what it like yeah is that
good that go away that go away or is it
okay I don't think it's black or white I
think it's in the middle right I think
it's in the middle and I don't let me go
also explain myself I answer a little
more okay when I am on a subway and I am
standing I spend the entire time like
10-20 looking for a CEO total so I'm
putting out a signal that's like
communicating I want to see right and so
for a man to see that and respond I
don't really find that offensive if I
was just standing there like clearly
like reading a book or something my
agent something else yeah then I would
it would ruffle my feathers a bit right
but like if he sees me looking for a
seat you're just then I don't feel like
oh maybe he's doing this cuz I'm a woman
it's like oh he sees me like wanting
something right like I don't necessarily
know that I'm sending that message at
yeah it's when they think they know
what's best for you right that's that's
what I have a problem with when they
like assume that you want something or
need
things like you don't know any better
yeah it's like you want to get off the
elevator right you need this right yeah
let us do that for you yeah so the
obvious tricky situation here is and I
don't necessarily fall one way the other
in terms of like what but the tricky
situation is there are obviously a
number women that feel the same way you
do which is like this is in a whatever
it makes me feel weird and like they
shouldn't be doing this why am I being
treated differently differently and
there's a number of women that I would
save to have an expectation of certain
steps being taken in their favor because
that's how they were raised like oh man
should behave like this to you because
you're a woman the question I guess I
the issue that I run into as a guy is
that I I don't know who I'm interacting
with I don't know what makes them
comfortable in that situation so I mean
I guess the obvious solution would just
be like treat them like like anyone
without factoring in their gender to
make a decision yeah but hey it's going
against like what my grandmother told me
a and B it's just it is tricky because
it's like is there an expectation there
um you know I try to be generous and and
relatively thoughtful about like other
people's feelings and stuff like that
but I don't know it's just like a very
thorny thing you know I would say that's
what you feel comfortable doing like you
naturally want to like hold the door
whatever form and that's fine because
when I get upset it's not like at the
man of course really it's like okay I
get upset because it's a moment that I
am forced to realize that the world
looks at me differently sure look I
don't think minarik trying to upset me
or have ill intention no do what you're
right comfortable with no one's gonna
but there's obviously a limit to that
cuz like you know construction worker
and thus on the street whistling at
women is obviously not appropriate and
like well that's also not chivalry no
idea that is that very antithesis yeah
that's a whole other yeah situation yeah
true um Russell knows all about that
yeah I mean he gets cat called all
that's it's weird I don't know why it's
just half all the time I'm a big hit
he's history look they just want you to
smile
is she I mean I would say this sort of
falls into the argument of like paying
for the check you know on a first date
or something like that um yeah I mean
it's it's tricky and obviously we're in
this period of transition for a lot of
these slight social norms so that's
always a really sticky thing where um
you know 50 years ago with a lot of
other sticky thing like Oh women should
show there whatever ankle that was a
problem 50 years it's just like
communicate like if you don't know talk
to the woman you're like confused how to
act around like if it is right yeah like
be upfront have discussions about these
things yeah then yeah but then but then
you hear those stories of like oh like
this guy want to split the check with me
and that's cheap on the first date you
know no but like that's their problem
there is nothing wrong with splitting
the check right there judging you tomm
awnings rather than there are awful
people yeah that's not you do something
wrong that's right your expectations
don't match and like do you really like
wanna be with someone who expects men to
always pay on the first date right
judges yeah it's its butt but I feel
like Eve not even ten years ago like
there was maybe more of that waited
there was a point where like that was
expected right like wasn't even like is
this person nice or is that or are they
not it was just like it's something you
do you say bless you when you sneeze and
the guy picks up the check right like
that's was a thing yeah right but things
are changing I'm with you I'm totally
with you communicate there is a man
there isn't enough of that right oh and
I also think there's not enough of like
just everyone being cool with everyone
else you know what I mean sure not not
about I like what can we all just get
along right well but it's true yeah yeah
so you're cool with Donald Trump nice
great guy didn't what you guys good my
villain only only he's very charming
screwed up without that man so we were
doing this Facebook live thing yeah on
Friday and someone in the chicken though
the comments was like why does Jeff like
Donald Trump Wow and I'm like what no I
don't like that douchebag like yeah like
nobody and it was like I felt like
McCarthyism where was like all of a
sudden I was laying fingers is like
being a communist yeah like no no no no
no no look at my house I look I'm a
family man no yeah I'm look really
terrifying you don't know why they
thought that I don't know did you go
back and like watch the video and no
don't the video unrelated completely
unto it out of context hmm so maybe it
was I don't know she's always on it
should be inherited through the Trump
guy like there's no way don't judge a
book by it's cover yeah ups know first
of all I judge every book by it's cover
I think a lot I do too because if you
can't afford to hire a good artist that
has the boots on yeah like the
publishing house is not investing come
on did you guys see there was a tweet
from whatever conservative they only had
like five thousand it wasn't like an
actual media company but they had a
picture of an actress from UM the Bruce
Campbell Evil Dead show on Starz I guess
oh yeah and then the caption read uh
this Trump supporter was attacked by
quote liberals and she was like decked
out in like zombie makeup and like but
it looked like she was assaulted oh my
god like this is what's going I like
they say there's like this crazy
misinformation campaign going on and you
might have been part of that trial read
the word that you were at Trump's I was
a victim yeah what's victimized alright
we've hit the portion of our program
where we're going to spend 10-15 minutes
or so we're going to talk unfiltered
uncensored about Game of Thrones yes if
you don't want to hear that you kind of
just search turn the pod casts off now
just do it because the rest of the show
we're gonna be that I saw the part where
brand fell out of the tower are we
covering anything else yeah a little
beyond that just a little beyond that
sure ah so okay again this is your last
chance turn the podcast off thanks for
being here Sadie is really
say goodbye we're not gonna do anything
anyone anyone is here okay let's get
into Game of Thrones so I I guess the
first thing I want to talk about uh with
this recent season it's twofold right so
you and I went on CBS n earlier this
season and we talked about I think was
like maybe the second episode which side
was enough for it is the fourth fair
enough it was shitty it's like a shitty
episode I liked it I thought it was
superficially fun yeah I thought it was
not for something like happening
episodes which one was that it was the
episode that ended with generis burning
down although yeah and was cool i like
the idea it was fun and like compared to
the episode we just saw like at least it
was interesting so okay so the episode
that just happened just passed on
something the Hound is back yeah hi we
shine exactly York idea Jeff why was it
any person on the show or pretty much
any other show that does not get their
head cut off visibly on the show is
still alive unless in special status is
coming back I what I will admit that
like when she was like well he's dead I
was like he's probably still alive
somewhere come on come back yeah no
that's the thing it's like if it
happened I'd be like yeah not a shock
you're alive in the books too but I am
pretty sure sign on the show and yeah I
agree I like man why he got me made me
feel like such a dumbass uh yeah I mean
come on no no they left him after seein
and a half I know that's not like what
was he doing was that actor doing you
can tricking was gone for since season
three didn't just exact on his lands bro
brands younger brother to you soon he
died too busy woman on screen I think a
I mean it's been though they wanted
people to think that he was dead what I
would say is when you're looking at
these characters you ask yourself has
this character had some what if they're
a major major character not like OSHA
the wildling person has this character
had a reasonably ripped like full arc
like have they got I thought he had a
decent arc no they said I'm dying by
that would been ok they
set up way too many storylines and then
never rivalry with Gregor his brother
the fact that his brother burned his
face off and he hates his brother to
brother the mountain yes you notice the
Frankenstein yeah well now yes you don't
set up a story line like that and then
cut it off before you can actually pay
it off it's just the way I get it I can
waste of everyones I get it um so you're
an idiot that's fine I did love seeing
in McShane because he's fantastic but
his name he's right let's all take a
moment well see her show name was raised
his name was brother ray which is the
worst name some of the names aren't
greeting that surprising it doesn't
really fit in bed I mean Ned Ned doesn't
mean she was murdered yeah what about
jdb ray is short for something we died
too quickly yeah I know and what about
Jamie James Jimmy works Jamie's norling
there's slime array like you just
picture like maybe it's like Thor kill
you you I know I remember what hey they
do that because I I got so obsessed with
trying to figure out this guy's name
that I watched the like inside this did
you know he was gonna die before the
episodes I felt I knew he was only gonna
be in one of us that I knew tithe but
money oh yeah I know he'll that they
only shot for one day with guess what
what hounds guy get his hearing checked
mine okay yes 60 people slaughtered
within like 30 seconds here's the one
scream and they're all dead well maybe
they have shadow babies attacking them
what right well sure it is the
Brotherhood and they have the Lord of
Light by their side so show me that
that's who these people yeah didn't know
that they'd literally said the night is
dark red and it followed out or that
they said that's the Brotherhood I
didn't know the Brotherhood meant the
brother of light it's that's not what
they're called the Brotherhood without
banners but right the Brotherhood you
understand that's the guy that came back
to life after this K in half in the cave
Fran so that's that organization
interesting but they're like brigands
they're not like major characters sounds
like they're barely in it they may play
a larger those are three people know the
Brotherhood and
and oh yes I do you like they have to
because Aria so some of that stuff too
and like she's been exposed to that now
her this guy keeps coming back to life
like at a certain point when I gonna
catch up to him yeah uh let's talk about
Aria okay oh I got lots of theories okay
none of what areas are true uh in terms
of where you think things are going with
her Oh of what happened what do you
think Jeff do you think she's dead and
she like she just walks into the
distance and that's the last time we see
are here I love it like she's walking
through that market and she's bleeding
out and everyone's just like it's
Braavos that's no one cares everyone's
like oh this chick Stella bleah now
would we do not know whatever I got fish
to sell yeah like voices to shuck I have
some serious do so what do you were you
think things are going I really like for
the record before you go I love the guy
who ran the junky car he's a great guy
will love this theory i'm about to lay
down here it i'm not even gonna touch
upon the fight club theory if are you oh
no i'm nothing okay so some people think
that the way fan re are the same person
and the wave do you know anyone's name i
did not actually know that her care and
her name was doing as they never
specifically say that and the show that
her name is the height that's just add
option saying a lot of characters names
yeah hence my inability to remember
anyway yeah and i read the books and i
don't remember her name was the way oh
my god okay so wife is the one who tried
is also a hater are ya some people think
that like the way fanara are the same
person how I don't even know what that
means Todd like Tyler Durden oh and so
no it makes no sense let's move on if
that's what it is they really took some
liberties with violet she stabbed
herself yeah because she's trying it's
like the last ditch attempt to like no
Hilda Arya Stark and become don't let
her suffer number okay so what ya know
that's pretty close okay the theory I
don't have a theory that I definitely
think is true but this is the one that
makes the most sense do is that so the
Faceless Men so far we've seen them
physically have to cut faces off dead
body yeah I'm glad we got to see that
yeah two weeks ago that was great that's
great or last week it was cool it's cool
they somehow retcon this earlier like Oh
jockin hogar has glamour magic because
he does mention the red God in season
two so maybe I was like powers like
Melisandre sure he could potentially
assume Arya's identity and so the person
we get stabbed in that scene is actually
let me explain it no once again they
don't do that in our show they don't do
reveals and then flashbacks why we
wouldn't have to flash back because
you'd have to establish it was him now
you would learn that the new so when
he's like bleeding and he takes his mask
off or whatever but she's a foot taller
than her can I just lay out the evidence
here evidence a days lay down there's
evidence alright so at one point in this
scene you notice Arya's not wearing the
costume she was wearing in the previous
episode where she was a like a behind
the stage act yeah she's wearing a
completely different outfit she's
walking very different than she normally
walks and it at one point she passes by
someone who is dressed and has the exact
same hairstyle as Arya in the previous
episodes oh and pretty good it that's
pretty good too much of a coincidence
not only true why would why would he do
that well so the wave wants to kill area
because aria is not no one Sheila can't
let go these personal vendetta right but
he loves exploiting that but neither can
the wave she has a personal vendetta
against re s economy just as bad because
she is not no one I've exactly and she
didn't kill her quickly yeah so she
failed like jockin within like assume
Arya's identity to test the way if to
see if she can be no one and she said
that would be okay I be pretty cool I'm
signed up and here's my favorite part of
this theory is that if you watch the
Bravo see you play scenes and like the
whole thing with Lady crane and the
other actress it kind of would
foreshadow that because there are two
people who like work together in this
profession where they have to pretend to
be an evil and one of them like as a
rival it there's a rivalry and hates the
other one and at the last minute Aria
steps in and is like watch out for that
one she wants you dead and then the
camera pane
ends between the wife and the younger
actress like back and so then maybe
jackin would take on the aria role in
the re oh wait I think that out that I'd
be very impressed if they pull that off
that that is like a very cuz you you
know where that off but you also have to
like explain it and not a stupid like
way that's very tough but and also so
the reason I think even though i'd be
very impressed if they did that the
reason i don't think it's going that way
is because i feel like they're just
setting up are you being saved by that
on really is Atlantis uh I thought they
were in Braavos no they're in volantis
heading to marine oh ok sorry my bad I
thought she was in bra all but on the
dump promise and volantis clearly look
like the same city they probably shoot
it in the trailers for Sunday's episode
are I don't watch that that is a spoiler
totally real don't watch don't watch it
totally agree CD that's got to draw the
line are insane you plan the drug like
magic there okay that's not a spoiler
yes it is showing you that's gay if
he one thing it was the madman trailers
that literally showed nothing I was like
no shows nothing but in everything we I
knew she wasn't deaf thought she was
dead late aria is fine in the trailer
that's more than that was more than I
wanted to know Sadie you could join like
I don't see it on the front I ain't no
running you don't run with exactly once
a day yeah maybe you do but listen this
isn't a spoiler but is it should be
trailers are not showers they are
wheelers they are lines are no special
seconds saying don't tell us this and
then you don't they are voluntary
spoiler yes you're not going Tony you're
watching the credits do you stick around
after the credits to watch the thing
never never and I also don't watch the
dumb infomercial stuff they run after
the credits either I wouldn't you know
it's like hey we've decided to make
marine look like a Grecian paradise and
blah blah blah like so stupid yeah I the
super teased at the beginning where it's
like this is what you need to know going
into this episode
obviously fine that's not a predatory
talk about like seriously free of course
maybe I'm just even though I would
because some people say don't be spoiler
a bespoke is like oh I guess that
characters coming back obviously that's
what it is and you must need that
because if you don't watch that you're
like so out of ending a lot of that is
spoon-feeding but I understand what but
when you think about it like those
little recaps are vital to comprehension
like they really are I'm sorry yes and
no I don't care how brilliant you are
but if you're whatever what happened
season 1 episode 3 sure but if you're
watching it on netflix they don't have
them because you're watching them in a
row fine do they okay my friends isn't
I'm saying but the shows so shows don't
rely on those previously on we know
there but but maybe aren't they part of
the episode isn't that intercept part
whatever is I don't know if I fine okay
but the towers are crap yes let's get
two more bigger picture stuff yeah arm
this season is being written without
books as source material sort of like
the show's e 40 yeah showrunners the
showrunners there's a lot of stuff in
there that is it in the books right or
will be in the books or has or even a
lot of the shoes though the showrunners
had a meeting with george RR martin and
they're like hey what's the deal with
some stuff that you got down yeah can we
use that in the show and some of the
show is gonna spoil the the books right
coming out right like the whole hold or
thing is going to be in the books so
here's the thing is they're gonna hit
those same plot points like holders
gonna die hold the door whatever but
it's gonna happen in different ways okay
so sort of ruins the books for me but
yeah I mean like so my the the point I'm
getting at is like does this show feel
inherently different because there
aren't books already are in yes yeah I
think it does I think I think it feels
different I think I think it's better i
think that i don't think the I think
it's conversations are better i think
the dialogue yeah notably worse the
george RR martin is so good with words
and if you look back to all the best
game of thrones quotes from previous
seasons they were taken directly from
the books there's not one line this
season that's been like
that was such a good quote except for
maybe tyrion saying like I drink and I
know things bright many good speeches so
I would say I don't agree that george RR
martin is a good writer is a good story
to think he's a great storyteller i
think he's a great world builder but
when it comes to actual writing I think
he gets very distracted by boring
details see a book for which may want to
jump off a cliff what like what so
you've read them you haven't yet ever at
all you have so what what do you do that
what you mean I think he has created a
world that's far larger and with far
more characters than the TV show has
created but the TV show is a much more
focused and enjoyable experience it's
easier to digest because the fact
martyrs like the whole like Jon
connington Fiat like fit like the fact
that they've condensed so many
characters together on the show which is
obviously a normal thing to do but even
the fact they did that there's still a
dozen storylines going on and the fact
that the books have 24 storylines going
on I think is just bad writing I it's a
I'm not gonna necessarily disagree with
that but i will say i don't find the
seat like I'm enjoying it but I think I
went into this being so excited like
we're going off books like I don't know
what's gonna happen next year we're all
females yeah everything that happens
I've been able to predict like Oh
Melisandre is gonna bring jon snow pack
yeah the most obvious answer but that
was going to be the obvious answer the
most a thats for everything that's
literally every plot point this season
has been predictable i was simple
obvious it doesn't surprise me anymore
the San snake assassinating the prince
of durhan was surprising Dorn was
surprised he only likes we rising in
that scene was how uber Obara and I'm
area got to King's Landing and why
trystane was on a boat were they all in
line boat who know he the two sand
snakes right I know they shoved the
spike through the kids face yeah right
basically trystane was on the boat with
Jamie and Marcela you didn't know that
though yeah we saw that in the finale
last year his own but it was it right
the two sand snakes were not
us there so they took a little boat no
it's cause trystane still on the boat
after they had doc did dr. were there
for a while she died and they were
probably worried about his safety but
they didn't explain all this they didn't
explain where that boat was or how the
sands things got there that was
surprising I don't think like I mean I
wasn't shocked I do you know you know
what's funny is like there's so many
things going on right like yeah they
literally I would love like a time of
positive screen time like counter right
like there are some storylines yet have
had seven minutes yeah sure for it was
really easy show to shoot if you're an
actor on that show oh my god this is
right like you could do an episode in
probably two days yeah I would imagine
well I don't think they really film like
that I know they know but they must know
what I mean like much yeah I don't know
there's just so many storylines going on
it's like it's not like West Wing we're
like everyone needs to be there for like
every minute right and it takes like
nine days to shoot I mean they're all
broken up but the logistics of shooting
that show must be insane must be
terrible but I think that's also working
against the show right now is all of the
characters we love are spread all over
the world and we're getting those we're
not getting those interesting
interactions like Arrested Development
on that foot that's exactly what i was
thinking more like no one can be there
at the same time Littlefinger has been
in one episode he'll be back by Reuters
but i think it's only been one maybe two
are you a 2 we saw Santa you spoke to
Sansa some convince Robin yeah and then
the next is should we tell him through
the mundo it wasn't too short this I i
would say i agree that this season has
not been full of surprises yes i would
say anywhere I don't think it's been I
think it's been predictable but I would
also say like I think the books inform
some of this because like as you said
forty percent of this if not maybe even
more maybe 5050 have either already been
covered in the books or were so far
along in the books that they really had
no other choice in terms of what they
could do so I think that's part of the
lack of surprise I would also say like
they're clearly building too I mean I
guess the climax of this season has to
be Winterfell do you think that's what
they're
I think that's this that's the they
always a second wait a second last one
there's gonna be the battle of the
bastards there's gonna be Circe's trial
wait what is it Oh Jon Snow and Ramsey
rent farmer I also don't really like
Rams everyone over the moon about roads
no one likes Franzi would you know but
like people like him ISM as a villain I
don't think he's interesting I don't at
all think people like him as a villain
really all I see are people being like
Oh Ramsey's evil weekend right so it's
like it's an offering isolation is like
rain Joffrey was he you are more
interest because he he was a petulant
child in watching Tywin be like Joffrey
go to bed yeah was hysterical yeah there
were some layers there later he had
interesting things to come up against
yes Ramsay has just you know I any of it
yeah I do I would say in terms of quote
villains I think the this high Sparrow
uh Jonathan Pryce is great yeah I think
he's excellent killing the part yeah I
just you know that is yeah i just think
his characters like so lame though but I
think he's no I thought you got far more
interesting in this most recent episode
because for the first time he wasn't
sort of playing the big game he was
really dealing with the micro things and
trying to manage Marjorie so he saw his
cards a bit more yeah but i think it was
i also and you're right when just the
circle back to like things being obvious
like you knew Marjorie was like not
having any of that or she's like clearly
in on something yeah yeah yeah they
didn't yeah i agree with that i would
just say i think it's i think it's good
the way they've built his character is
they did such a good job of like slowly
like being like yeah oh he's pure oh he
likes Grandpa Charlie but he's just as
bad as everyone right what's funny to is
uh he fought all have you seen a picture
of him side by side with the real pope
they look a lot alike I'm just saying
they look a lot alike they look it up on
the Internet is a weird thing yeah um
okay we've covered a lot yeah I don't
know if I don't think I it's hard to
judge a show in the middle of especially
these kinds of shows so it all this how
many we have left three yes is it free
yeah that is not on also this is
supposed to be correct me if wrong but
is this the last full season
as that was that up yes the rumor is
that it they're gonna be 13 more
episodes after they split up seven and
six right but none of this has been
confirmed by HBO but one of the
directors jack bender did give an
interview saying they're only gonna be
seven episodes next year right which is
pretty crazy and I'm sure age that kills
HBO's like cash cow plans no it's way
better why do Breaking Bad and Mad Men
doing a split sure but they want it for
four they'd want it sticking around for
four years oh no it's always been a
seven season plan oh noes originally it
was supposed to be a book a season right
right it was always a seventh season
plan right I didn't know that so but
they're gonna they're gonna split the
next group of episode 7 and sex is what
you're saying report and reportedly so
the one last question i ask is so the
show ends they know how the show this
serie at the big fight i guess with the
others or whatever that and the White
walk the white walls is also winter
coming right winter is coming so so the
producers of the show the show runners
know how that story line ends because
they were told three things that we
haven't that were covered in that
meeting with george RR martin they were
told they were about Shireen yeah being
set on fire who Shireen the little girl
services daughter against a fire last
season okay they were told about Hodor
right and they were told how they like
big arc ends so I feel like I didn't
know that yeah those were sets it is
that what you've heard as well well I
know they knew how the show was gonna
end I thought that they described is
like three oh moments and I thought
the third was something we haven't seen
yet that isn't how it was like I said I
read it as like there's another like no
I'm sure how about I love obstacle and
so the question I have is like look the
show has to if it ends after those
thirteen episodes like you said
theoretically again all reportedly if it
ends there that has to be the final
battle between like they can't end it
before that battle happens unless they
want to do movies and stuff like that
right it's pretty I think the battle
will happen in the show ideally I think
it should end after that because one
thing I really miss in the show
we had in the books was we keep getting
all these big moments of like war and
tragedy and the books was really good at
exploring the fallout of that sure the
consequences of Warren they show is just
like no we're just going to keep doing
other battles and I would like to see
the show explore what happens after that
so maybe the winds of winter is the end
of the like that ends with the big
battle and then the last seven books
evan is all just like a dream for spring
well yeah it's basically I mean the
titles sort of imply that to a certain
extent yeah um I don't know that I would
be motivated to read the books after
seeing the show if they did that much I
really don't know I i think the books
are gonna have so much more interesting
things happening I think they will have
things happening but like I'm so stakes
me so long to get through these books
it's just like so much time and it's
like oh I know that this guy's gonna die
stuff like that it's very discouraged
this season is making me more excited to
read the books because i want to see how
Jordan are Martin does it especially
like with Doran like they screwed darn
overs so I barely talk part in the show
and I just want to know like what the
point of them in the books it I mean in
the books it's it's not been handled
super well either door is on my favorite
in the butcher but like I want to know
their purpose maybe it's a more of a
curiosity yeah I want to know why did
you waste all this time in the books um
I know I know you mean it is interesting
because they are like it this weird X
Factor that doesn't seem to factor into
the whole like prepping for battle thing
and there's there are a few like ditto
with you know the Iron Man and stuff
like that there's like a few elements
that don't totally match up yeah like
where does where do they just play and I
think they are probably gonna be the
ones that fairy Danny over and their
boats here's my theory okay good i want
yeah let's finish up with the theory
let's finish it up with it I think
you're on grey Julia's funding the sons
of the harpy the way you're on is beyond
sister no llora you're on is their uncle
he's just the count he's the gap he's
the new king you think he yes is funding
the sons of the harpy even though when
Tyrion like confronted those dues
they said the slaver said no yeah
they're like no and they rolled their
eyes we saw Varys interrogating a woman
and then it cut away from the actual
reveal of her saying who was funding it
I think that's a really odd way to do
that it was like he's like okay tell me
who it is and then it's Varys walking
over to Terry and be like I found out
it's the slavers that's suspect to me
the slavers denied it also like if the
slavers want donairs to leave why would
they burn her quickest transportation to
Westeros she wants to go and leave yeah
why would they take that away you're on
is like we're gonna build a thousand
ships and then guess how many ships
denair says she she means a thousand
also we're now they can build ships oh
that's its total not you told 12 people
to build a thousand ship on an island
that has no trees yeah my point is that
we are rocks that's so much more
interesting yeah Euron is like playing
this long game of like destroying
generis is fleet and forcing her into a
in alliance I just don't know where that
leverage give Sadie credit yeah we're
just having the ship's is the leverage
that's clear burns them so we can be
like hey right on the shows and chips
I'll take you there like yeah marry me I
gotta hand it I did it yeah that's
interesting it that's why she's got TV
guys why you do channel how do i you get
paid the big bucks Thank You reddit was
that all it is god damn it why'd you
show your hand it's like part me and
part reddit right it's you in reddit in
a twitter twitter ok i love it i were
all internet it there's nothing better
than conspiracy theories I mean I love I
kind of you know you knew the whole
thing about Jon Snow right because that
wasn't that much of like a shocker were
you surprised though I was like I said
have shitty his resurrection was cuz it
was dumb I thought you're talking about
his parentage no yeah well that is at
that everyone knows that too they have
to do that this season to this race card
is doing it you have but like let's tie
that up um the way melisendra brought
back she was like yeah but it was lame
here's a little sand on your face come
on it was lame bringing someone back
Scott be harder than that also if you
look at
john derian his wounds never write
healed or as john is fine yeah he should
have like gaping wounds still on his
chest yeah I mean we haven't seen her
less but like fortunately they also
haven't dealt with the fact that like
his body would be like three days to
cater yeah yeah there was she should
always just have flies buzzing around
him that'd be funny for the rest of the
season uh CD Ganis thank you so much for

time travel in the show now so it's like
that's the thing how would that affect

she could be a time traveler she could
be the mad king yeah like it's yesh she
could actually be the mad king sure but
they did introduce time travel for the
record in this season they're like oh by
the way the time travels a thing to a
certain extent they did the idea they
did but they also established that it's
a it's a set time so you can't change
