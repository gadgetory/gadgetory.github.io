clock and initially I thought I was
gonna have a lot of the same
functionality as this the Lenovo smart
display just sort of shrunk down and
that's kind of true it's cute it's got a
four inch display and it does have the
Google assistant built-in so you can
issue all the same voice commands you'd
issue to a Google home and you go home
mini but a lot of the functionality has
been streamlined specifically for your
nightstand so first off there's no smart
home control panel here you can't watch
videos there's no photos it's that all
the things are gonna see are the ones
that you might want to prioritize first
thing in the morning like the weather or
your calendar or your commute to work
this thing's smart enough to actually
suggest alarm times for you based on
that calendar and then it really starts
shining once you set that alarm when
it's getting close to going off the
screen is gonna get brighter and then
the alarm rings and what's cool is if
you tap the top you'll snooze it if you
tap it twice you'll dismiss the alarm
and then that can immediately kick off
your good morning routine so Google
allows grouped commands called routines
that can trigger your smart home devices
and things like that your good morning
routine can be tied directly to this and
tell you the weather and what's on your
calendar and then play your customized
news feed for the day all from giving
this a double tap in the morning when
the alarm is sounding so Google and
Lenovo are thinking of smart clocks as
an entirely different category of
product from smart displays but it's
still based on Android things and
there's still a lot of familiarity here
you can still pull down for a similar
control panel you'd see on smart
displays you can still group the device
with Google cast devices so it should
still be pretty familiar if you're used
to the Google assistant ecosystem but
really Google and Lenovo want this to
feel right at home on your nightstand
there's no camera and a lot of the
smarts are based on setting the right
alarm for your schedule and gradually
waking you up in the morning so I'm
interested to see the Lenovo smart clock
in action and
fortunately I won't have to wait that
long it's due out this spring and it's
gonna cost 80 bucks and I'm excited to
see what this can add to my nightstand</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
