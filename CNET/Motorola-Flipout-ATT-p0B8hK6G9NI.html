cnet.com today we're gonna take a first
look at the Motorola flip-out this is a
new Android phone for AT&amp;amp;T it does look
like the Nokia 7705 twist that we saw
about a year ago has that same square
shape with the flipping or swivel action
it's about 2.8 inches which is fine for
most phones but on a touchscreen phone
found it just not adequate the touch
screen is pretty responsive but even
when you go to the seven home screens
which is nice you get seven it's still
pretty crowded so if you put a few no
you put a couple if you couple up with
the widgets they're that available with
your motoblur so like you're in a fight
inbox and maybe a Twitter module they
take up almost half the room so wasn't
really impressed with that
did like the keyboard however I found it
was pretty big pretty spacious so
actually quite surprisingly spacious for
the phone of this size the keys are
domed so they feel nice meeting of the
fingers they're pretty stiff and I could
almost type I feel if I wanted to the
swivel mechanism does feel pretty sturdy
um also another thing about the display
I found is that it does have 16 million
colors but not the greatest pixel
resolution it's 320 by 280 so some
photos and graphics didn't quit look
quite as sharp as I'd like you'll see
that the phone dialer is the virtual
dial pad didn't have a problem with that
found it pretty big there is a
accelerometer on their phones if you
like you actually can use a virtual
keyboard but I don't know why you'd want
to because it's really really really
small menu design is pretty standard
very Android inside you'll find I'm not
a huge amount of features as far as the
smart phone goes but has all the
essentials for communication standard
Google Apps like Google Maps with
navigation Google Talk has bluetooth
with organizer options camera media
player so everything you'd expect in
here a couple things that I did like
though are it does have a dedicated file
manager you also have this thing called
phone portal which actually allows you
access to one convenient access to sync
in your phone either through a USB cable
or through Wi-Fi so that was pretty
convenient - motorola does include an
orange back cover in the box so if you
have the black and orange you can just
turn them out as you like the flip-out
does run Android 2.1 we'd really like to
see Fri oh but 2.1 is a really good
start it will be upgradeable to 2.2 at
some point overall I think the flip out
if you can deal with the size it's an
interesting
phone certainly has some good features
and I like that keyboard but I think
that displays much too small for a
touchscreen device I'm Ken Sherman and
this is the Motorola flip-out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
