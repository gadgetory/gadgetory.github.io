to the bus report the show about the
tech news that everyone is talking about
this week the English language takes a
nosedive google gets motorola mobility
and radio reception in a can but first
the gadget of the week the gadget of the
week is the samsung galaxy note it's
like a phone tablet hybrid it's a
phablet i'm actually not making this up
people are actually calling this thing a
phablet like it's some sort of new
category of device called phablet anyway
the Galaxy Note has a 5.3 inch screen so
it's just about as big as a tablet it
also comes with a stylus so you can take
notes and draw and stuff but mainly it's
a phone a phone as big as my face it's
also lte-capable it has an 8 megapixel
camera and like every new android phone
that should be running ice cream
sandwich but isn't it's expected to get
an upgrade sometime around someday it's
actually pretty good as a phone but only
for people who carry purses or man
purses Merces and who can say phablet
with a straight face phablet phablet
what is this world coming to and now for
the news back to the good old days when
tablets were tablets and phones were
phones the world is awash with ipad 3
rumors and those rumors say it's coming
soon the latest batch of unnamed sources
say the newest iPad could debut March
seventh which would be right on time
considering the ipad 2 came out just
about exactly a year ago in fact ipad 2
prices down to four hundred twenty nine
bucks by the way rumors suggest the new
ipad could have a Retina Display a
faster maybe even quad-core processor
and support for 4G LTE data and some
reports say that Apple's been testing a
new smaller version of the ipad closer
to about 8 inches which if that also
came with 4G LTE networking built-in I
mean you could use that as a phone too
and then it could be the world's first I
phablet okay last time I promised the US
and the European Union have approved
Google's bid to buy motorola mobility
which means the deal is very close to
done the purchase gives google access to
its own phone hardware plus a treasure
trove of crucial phone related
+ + Motorola's entire TV set-top box
business and its relationships with
cable companies who license those boxes
the EU and the DOJ approved the deal
with no strings attached saying hey yeah
I mean sure Google could combine its
search services and operating system
businesses with hardware to create a
technological juggernaut that would
control and distribute most of the
world's information music TV video and
books on its own branded platforms
crushing all other competition existing
and nascent but let's be honest this is
google we're talking about they're not
really that organized anyway we'll all
soon forget all of our troubles because
the two great opiates of the masses
Angry Birds and Facebook have just
joined forces with angry birds for
facebook the wildly popular physics and
puzzle game now gets new features new
powers like a burn quake and social
gamification features like the ability
to compare scores there are daily
rewards for playing all the time you
know that kind of crack type stuff so in
order to save society let's just make a
new rule okay no Facebook angry birds at
work none no whiskey at lunch no angry
birds at work the fate of the world is
at stake here google recently held a
conference called solve for x it's part
of their new project to encourage people
to come up with crazy texts Aleutians
two huge problems and the big hit at the
first conference this week spray on
antenna startup cam text as you can
actually spray the antenna in a can on
almost any surface and improve your
various radio receptions including cell
phone reception they showed it off by
spraying it on a tree and it worked hey
oh maybe if you mix this with the
spray-on hair stuff then pretty soon all
the tall balding guys in the world could
be like walking femtocells I love solve
for x and that's it for this week
everyone I'm Mollywood and thank you for
watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
