2012 is January 13 2012 I'm Brian song
and I'm Molly would welcome love it's
like the holster you like you a little
ear wave and you hear that oh that's it
is it's our last show from CES and we
were sitting up your life and then all
of a sudden the music and the clapping
and I just we're back we're back babies
yeah yeah we're we're alive the show
also we promised all of them for those
of you watching on the live stream we
promised everybody a sticker if they
clapped really loud for us I think
that's a fairly common superior
backstage and see if we had any leftover
shrine to give our sorrow without a
doubt male something yeah are you guys
having a good show so far look at that
nice I'm so amazed to see so many people
still here on the last day this was
awesome absolutely got some of our
regulars in the chat room yes Derek
Andrew back over there we appreciate you
guys coming out here so shall we just
talk about what's happening over the
past four days totally it's obviously
gonna be another CES heavy show
yesterday was kind of our big showcase
day because we gave out the best of CES
Awards we are the official awards
program for the consumer electronics
usual and the best of CES words I gotta
say people were so excited yesterday
that I felt like Santa Claus that if you
were here in the booth you saw it was
like it was packed yeah there were tons
and tons of people and it was like
giving out the Oscars it is it is you
know it's bigger than the officers here
at CES I mean these are all these are
the awards the official words all these
vendors and people that are coming out
here to showcase the product something
like over 3,000 individual companies
came out to CES this year to showcase
their goods and from that list how many
categories do we have total have 11 11
categories those are the final winners
of CES and now we talk about who is the
best of show will kind of get to that
LG's 55-inch oled display TVs were a
huge theme here and a lot of people you
know my friends at home they're like
really at
TV but I think all of you that are here
in this room that have had a chance to
see these OLED TVs are all going to
agree that was the best of show and the
thing that it's really interesting
because you know that Samsung it will
just give you like a peek behind the
curtain into our editors thinking
because obviously samsung also has a
stunning 55-inch oled TV on display they
were having the Battle of the world's
biggest oled tvs i think what put what
pushed LG over the edge is the fact that
this is a big thing for editors the fact
that LG plans to ship that TV this year
that's almost always if it comes down to
a razor thin margin like that that's
almost always the thing that's going to
make the difference because we are you
know we come here to revel in the
amazing new technology but at the end of
the day we are trying to help you make
the right purchasing decision we're a
very practical site you know we don't
want to sit here and talk about TVs that
are going to mean we're a practical site
even though we awarded what will
probably be an eight to ten thousand
dollar TV well but a little bit come out
right at least you have that eight to
ten grand you can totally buy that
sucker yeah and a lot of times for you
for those of you that are here or
haven't been here we see so many
products and sometimes we see some
amazing things that never come out and
that's always the biggest disappointment
when you give a product in a word that
you just never end up seeing that year
or maybe it takes a year plus for it to
finally hit market so that's one of the
criteria that we have to use to you know
consider the best TV best of show but by
far yeah less than four millimeters
orgasmic it's just stunning it's
absolutely stunning I hope that
everybody gets a chance to at least he
went in the store if you weren't here at
CES to look at it I hear that the voting
that there was a there was kind of a
little upswell of the other kind of
possibility for best of show was simple
TV which was the the device that one in
our home theater category I don't even
know if they know that but but there was
a push for them because it is
potentially like the next thing the the
little appliance that makes it easy for
you to cut the cord it's sort of a DVR
without a built-in hard driver video
output it lets you supply your own hard
drive and then you can stream either
recorded or live TV the live TV
streaming involves I think like a five
dollar a month subscription but it pulls
locally broadcast over the air stuff and
it's it's outside you can stream your
live and recorded over-the-air TV
outside your home network sort
slingbox style it's like your personal
cloud for over-the-air TV also the word
that really maybe some people say
matters the most was the People's Choice
Award this time we had a returning
winner from razor last year they had
their gaming laptop this year they
brought their project Fiona now we don't
know when it's going to come to market
yet but this was a tablet that
integrated to kind of controller handles
on it and would allow you to play PC
style games directly on a tablet device
this was what all of our viewers here at
cnet and all the readers and Watchers
chose as the best people's choice award
because they don't really have the same
sort of senses we're all about like a
product that's going to come out there
just like this looks awesome oh really
love yeah exactly the razor one for the
Switchblade last year and i don't i do
not want to dump on these guys they're
making incredible concepts so far we
haven't seen any products even the
Switchblade has not come out it's still
in the concept stage hopefully one of
these going to hit the market soon
because the Fiona tablet does look like
a lot of fun yeah definitely so we also
want to kind of just briefly go over
some of the other winners for those you
that weren't here in car tech qnx car to
mobile apps platform amazing self with
dashboard technologies NFC ability to
sync some of your Bluetooth devices
really easily also full quality high
definition audio integrated into the
system as well for voice calls we all
know like we all want to use our phones
and our cars even with you know
Bluetooth headsets but the audio quality
nine times out of ten depending on the
headset use pretty crappy not great so
this is one of those solutions that
hopes to push that forward well it's an
in-car app platform too so it allowed
developers to write html5 apps for
in-car use which i think is to know
because I think html5 will save us all
and it will make I to me the biggest
problem that automakers have is that it
takes a really they're working off old
technology in a lot of cases it takes a
long time for them to update their
in-car systems because some of because
their their production cycles are so
long if this is a kind of like a
platform that can be in carts almost
like an operating system for cars like
you don't need Microsoft anymore and if
you are thinking to yourself I've heard
that cue next thing before that's
research in motion that's the blackberry
guys so they're doing any cars and they
got to do it somewhere which is a good
thing though you know so our smartphone
category kind of no surprise here
actually the
coolest phone here even though it felt
like it wasn't announced here because
there were so many rumors ahead of time
but it was announced here the Lumia 900
the Windows Phone to beat is what we're
calling it that was the best best of CES
and self smartphones also cameras we
have the fujifilm x-pro 1 in emerging
tech a huge theme here the 3d printers
MakerBot and a cute qubit home cube the
3d cube system they were going
neck-and-neck but MakerBot replicator
came on top for the 3d printing kind of
phenomena that we started to really
emerge here at CES and we'll kind of
track that and see how that translates
over to the actual home consumer but a
lot of people here if you have a chance
in the central hall there's a 3d at home
kind of area and you can check out what
they're doing out just some awesome
stuff that was our emerging tech
category again that one's gonna ship
shipping in six weeks two thousand
dollars you could totally have one in
your garage and print your own iphone
cases cups and stuff I love it simple TV
like I mentioned in the home theater
department in pcs the HP envy 14 Spector
was the best of Joe yeah the visuals
itself just made this a hot device it's
a little worrisome if you drop it
because it's covered in a gorilla glass
Gorilla Glass 2 really well that this
this one is actually covered in the
still the original Gorilla Glass because
yeah oh no glass 2 is on its win they've
showed a demo that but um it looks
amazing probably scratch resistant but
drop resistant probably not as much yeah
well you know but no laptop is actually
yeah but if you don't watch shatter your
laptop terrifying shatter the lot you
know dent laptop it still hurts daddy I
stop shatter oh look man I'm so
beautiful in software and apps with
BlueStacks for windows 8 which lets you
run android apps on windows 8 which is
just cool right I don't know we liked it
in tablets the asuste memo 370 T which
you haven't heard of but it costs 250
bucks which is totally why at one right
I mean we're still seeing Android
tablets come out like the toshiba excite
10.1 was a strong contender in that
category because it's the thinnest one
it's beautiful it has good connectivity
and storage but it's over five hundred
dollars 534 16 gigs 599 for 32 gigs and
if you're there with two hundred fifty
dollars and pretty similar specs it's
going to put you over the edge and then
networking just around things up we have
the d-link amplify HD
media router supporting USB 3.0 450 bit
megabits per second of data as well as
the ability to do like cloud-based
streaming as well so those are the
roundup of all of our best of CES award
winners one thing that though we kind of
want to talk about is things that here
at CES we were disappointed in you know
things that we were hoping assembly I
may be out that that didn't maybe take
off and I guess I'll kick things off we
always everyone knows you know the
e-reader category with e ink is really
popular we've always been talking about
what's when will we see color ink and I
was actually really bummed because
Qualcomm they are in that booth right
over there but they showed off last year
color ink where we were hoping hey let's
maybe we can see magazines I'm not a fan
of reading for a long time with looking
directly at an LED screen so or LCD
screen and so what Qualcomm has this
mirasol their color ink they showed the
next generation of it but it has a not a
backlight but a front light but either
way it is a lighted glowing surface it's
not true coloring they were really the
one hope to champion this technology and
oh there's no there's nothing else
they're out there so I i don't know i
don't want to say it's dead but it looks
like the idea of color ink is dead that
was kind of disappointing yeah i mean i
hope it's not because i do think that
that would be that would you know to be
able to do magazine subscriptions that
are inked but have color pictures i'll
be able to do children's books on
something like a kindle I think that's
huge because the LCD thing really is it
seems like that's going to become the
future but a lot of people do have
problems reading those I don't like it
and so I'm with you I show that's what I
hope it's not I hope they I hope so or
someone else does that because last year
their demo looked like real Ian color
but then I talked to the rep there he
said well that was a cached demo and so
we should try to get them on the show
when we get back nice that was really no
I never do that we should try to have
them on the show when we get back the
San Francisco to talk about because
maybe this is just an unbelievably
difficult than being challenged and we
don't realize quite how hard it is I
from my perspective I gotta say I was a
little bit disappointed in the
ultrabooks showing not they all look
beautiful we had you know if you saw our
laptop talk show with dan ackerman and
Scott Stein you saw like these
tops are gorgeous right the Ultrabook
the form factor all of that is really
beautiful but I was very surprised that
they're not as baked as I thought they
would be at this show and that so many
of the features that Intel wants to
happen even that Microsoft wants to
happen are coming way later and that
ultrabooks really seem to be suffering
from mission creep right there not
talking about 11 and 13 inch laptops
like the macbook air now it's sort of
like well the 15 inch samsung series 9
is also an ultrabook but i don't i
thought it was little and it's sort of
the definition is starting to wander I
mean that can happen when it's a
definition that was solely invented out
of the brains of Intel but it's that
whole category feels very messy to me
and then meanwhile there are MacBook
Airs it's kind of like that they I think
they have a little more catching up to
do than I would have expected I think
even more just not disappointing but
when you saw some of these ultrabooks
there was no shame in like copying the
apple macbook air and it's like can you
at least throw maybe a little few
different design elements in there you
know I like mental yeah there it was
they look exactly alike I you know you
lied about it is it is pretty but you
know this must be a little different
yeah I mean I they're definitely worth
some you know I think like a sous going
with the rose gold was beautiful the
spectre is really interesting the
ideapad yoga nah that one's fun an
interesting sort of a convertible tablet
style laptop thing that I've seen that
is just it looks totally usable it
stands up in a bunch of different
configurations it's very it's very cool
I think though that ultra Brooks do have
a lot of catching up to do i'm also
watching to see though if those really
thin and light and cool laptops with
windows 8 start coming out with touch
screens before Apple does touch screens
laptops I think that's going to be a big
surprise the interesting we were
surprised i don't know if i'm
disappointed necessarily but i was
surprised that there wasn't more phone
news yeah you know we've been littered
with phones and past CES is I think
maybe part of that I was kind of
thinking it out is the fact that now we
get up we get almost wet two phones
every month now during the course of the
year display there are only six ruling
phones here it's really changed how CES
has delivered phones and how companies
are doing it where
it was a swarm you were just hammered
with like 20 phones they're like any of
these could be pretty legit decent
phones they should have felt maybe like
three or four yeah so although I am
there's one trend I am pretty excited
about we saw the motorola droid maxx
yeah and sams which is a totally all
about long battery life and then Samsung
is promising all-day battery life on all
of their phones it's because that is
just a huge that's like oh why haven't
you fixed this thing right battery life
in general that's a big selling point
for ultrabooks yeah and for smaller
lighter laptops and so it's great to
hear mobile phone manufacturers directly
talking about battery life and even then
introducing phones that are like yes
this I don't know what else it does but
it's gonna last all day yeah so that's a
promising trend all right you want to
take a little breather and then we'll
just kind of wrap a few stories do it
yeah actually one little news point
before we go on phones the Lumia 800 may
already have a shipping date it's a
rumored to be coming out on March 18th
so we'll film after wallets ready and
with that we'll take a little break when
we come back we're going to talk about
some guidelines for ice cream sandwich
out the therapy because there's not
that's totally not and a CES breakup see
you in a minute
welcome back to buzz out loud live at
CES everybody it is our last day it's
the last day of the show it's our last
day everybody's exhausted way vicki we
have a really big turnout though I'm so
excited to tell them here there are
still people wandering for I actually I
took this opportunity to add speed over
to the north hall this morning which is
which is why i was giving everyone a
heart attack likely regret but i had not
gotten over there cuz i'm so curious to
see what they sort of connected car cuz
for a long time North Hall it would be
like all stereo makers mention cars yeah
it's really it's looking filled out and
Audi Howdy's booth is beautiful there it
looks like an apple store in there it's
gorgeous and there it's like a car show
yeah but I this is just the thing that I
discovered this morning they have the
coolest heads-up display there that I
feel like we totally missed I want to
get a camera crew over there right now
I'm sure they'll be excited to do that
are you doing it here they're not
showing this off at Detroit because the
Detroit Auto Show is happening right now
but so they're showing off in their
booth we get a chance this their new
heads up display system so they have its
heads up display obviously for the
driver right a lot of people Mercedes is
doing the heads up display for the
driver so that you can see navigation
you can see information come on screen
without having to look away from the
road then they also have a middle screen
that both the passenger and the driver
can see not that this is all not new it
was it that was in Frankfurt but now
they have a passenger only heads-up
display so that if you're bringing
because you can bring a lot of media
content into your audi via your you know
bluetooth connection or USB or SD card
your passenger could potentially be
sitting there watching a movie on a
heads-up display while the driver is you
know just navigating safely I mean it's
kind of but the cool part is that they
have this minority report gesture-based
heads-up display thing going on if I did
not know this so you can yeah so you can
kind of like sit on that middle screen
right let's say you have some point of
interest data that comes up right we're
passing by the Bellagio right now
they're here are some restaurant
information the driver can kind of like
flip your hand up like this then the
point of major stuff comes
up in the middle screen and then you go
like this and they shoot it over to the
passenger so the passenger could read a
couple restaurant reviews may watch a
little video the food coming I see I'm
gonna be like yeah let's totally go
there and kick it back to the middle
screen so that will navigate for the
driver I was dying that's like the
coolest thing I'm like when is this
gonna come out there like oh we have no
future it's the future but it is super
cool and they talked about how you could
do video conferencing like you can
imagine right traveling sales people or
people who are in the car a lot working
you could fully be having a video
conference from the passenger side on
the driver side you might just see a
little still image of who you're talking
to or something like that it was really
it was very cool I mean you need your
car to be self-driving really to get the
most out of this that's my big thing
Google's helping us out there right
hopefully and they have google maps
integrated into the Audi vehicles and I
think that is huge because car
navigation is not kept up with just you
know as easy at it as it is to use an
android phone it's so go check it out if
you get a chance because it is really
just like wave your hand something and
nobody realized it right like the Audi
guys start showing us this and all the
people standard how can you tell us this
I'm like that's cuz I'm rolling with
brian cooley they tell him everything
yeah all right here are some other
things that happen at the show a couple
last wrap up things Google this is kind
of interesting after Eric Schmidt
insisted to me personally that
differentiation is a feature not a bug
and that it's not fragmentation in
Android Google quietly released a new
Ice Cream Sandwich style guide for
device manufacturers and developers yeah
according to Android's developer blog
this is a place where developers can
learn about the principles the building
blocks and the patterns for creating
world-class Android user interfaces to
follow you know we've I'm it's
interesting you know they I think they
they can throw this out there and we'll
see how consumers respond but man we
know what companies have done with
Android whether there's style guidelines
or not we know the fun stuff verizon
likes to put on their phones I can't
wait we love that yeah that so the
guidelines are completely optional
google is making it clear there the
recommendations are optional but they
say that any apps that are built outside
the guidelines will see
so it is they have definitely they've
already said that they want ice cream
sandwich to be a little more
standardized don't try to take some
steps in that direction and you know I
mean Eric Schmidt said look if it was up
to me I would love it if I would love if
every manufacturer just put stock
Android on their phone but we want to
give them the option but I like that
they're saying okay you have the option
but here's what we suggest for the
optimal experience and then hopefully
consumers can help drive with our
dollars you know the choice by saying
like you know what I don't want this
welcome to samsung galaxy s ruined by
Verizon experience that I had a couple
years ago yeah well with irate with the
response of the Samsung you know with
the Galaxy Nexus and we've seen how
that's going to be a pure Android
experience that's going to help give
cues based on how it does overall as a
phone to other companies of maybe we
should they're going to decide from
seeing how that how people react that
maybe we should kind of all these
guidelines a little more because that's
what we want right and so hopefully that
works out because I I mean I like HTC
Sense UI I've actually always liked a
lot personally but then there's other
companies that just butcher butcher it
so and I think you'll always find I mean
one of the things that was interesting
that he said was sometimes he finds out
that Android is running on a device when
it comes out you know that's sorta it's
just out there and there will always be
manufacturers to do whatever they want
they'll modify it in some way to make it
run on a refrigerator or you know
whatever and that's fine but I think
when you're talking about major
manufacturers selling with major
carriers it's a benefit to everyone it's
getting you know especially as Windows
Phone I think is going to start to make
a strong presence in even in those
retail stores it's a lot easier if all
those android phones look and feel the
same so people so that the buyer is not
standing there being like you know this
one does this now but they say they're
all Android i'm confused and you know
don't make it confusing you know then
you'll sell more stuff now we also
talked about breakups here at CES and if
you guys had been have been watching or
listening or paying attention two
monsters keynote there was no mention of
the of the beats franchise and this is
because monster and the beats headphones
that have taken over a fifty percent
market share of the entire phone
headphone market there's they're
breaking up because according to report
they had they had trouble they had a
problem with figuring out really who was
deserving of more credit for the success
of both companies to again two companies
that form together and and decided to
take over fifty three percent of the
market they couldn't figure that out and
now they're breaking up and going their
separate ways they have an
irreconcilable dispute over who is
moreover those Yahoo's more awesome you
can't you really you guys you can't just
sit there and rake in the money you get
you gotta just be like think this is
what happens when you have that many
egos involved I like no Lee from monster
Timmy I vine these guys are it's their
their gigantic ego enemy bit but that
said each of them already has a new
flame they've already moved on we know
that HP and beats have been kind of
hooking up on the side for quite a while
now they say they're going to be very
happy together Beats Audio is on that on
the envy spectre and no Lee is talking
about how they're cooking up with who Oh
jy Park yeah designer diesel and radio
shack so there you also comment I think
also he feels like it's moved on to the
hot girl yeah also also ACC owns a
majority stake in the in beat they've
invested in them so we'll see the beats
name at least live on in other
electronic devices it's not like it's
just dre and jimmy iovine you know i
mean just they have support from the
technology market so beats isn't going
to go away it's just that we're not
gonna see monsters and beats together
but it's just they should that's good so
really it's so weird the holidays i'm
gonna get weird at the same time those
headphones look hot but they sound
horrible they do well the base is
oversaturated and muddy I mean I'm the
first one to love hip-hop but it for me
it's just too too heavy on the base if
any of you have heard them and match
them up with other headphones they all
end the slogan that they've always been
pitching is the best highest quality
pure sounding headphone that you can
have and it's just anything further from
the truth so wow those are bald work i'm
up but i think what yeah i'm not in i'm
not in an audio file by any means but
anyone who's been able to match them up
well you can to the balances its I have
you know and I had an HP Envy with Beats
Audio built-in and I definitely think I
mean base is where they put all the
emphasis for sure and that's like you
know that's fine but your taste it
should taste absolutely alright that's
all the CES news that we have for you
guys I hope that you've all enjoyed the
show I'm so happy that you came by live
audience stick around we have stickers
got stickers if you guys clapping in the
show we're gonna give you more stickers
I know headed back to San Francisco we
will have our regular buzz out loud
episode coming to you on Thursday back
in the studio with some other who knows
what you're saying back to reality
bacteria longer staying up til 3am
back-to-back nights I guess not all
right I get that back to San Francisco
there's a full slate of programming
coming up on the show on the stage today
we've got rumor has it coming up eric
franklin and Sharon Vaknin are going to
do sort of a like best and worst I think
of the show it should be really
interesting to watch them do that so
we'll be here we'll be here often sit
tight alright guys thanks for coming out
there you have it
