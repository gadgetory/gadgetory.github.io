but I don't have to kick because it's
got a powered rear wheel now there's no
throttle on the smart ped all my speed
is controlled by how fast I can kick
this up and I don't have to kick very
often because as soon as I get to speed
the powered rear wheel takes over and
keeps me going
holds a steady speed however fast I can
get it up to to stop I just hit the
brakes and then I just kick it to get
going again and it holds it steady speed
with 16-inch pneumatic tires the ride is
also really good the smart ped has a
steel frame weighs about 25 pounds and
you can fold down these handlebars to
make it portable that way you can bring
it up to your office or onto public
transportation but the secret sauce is
this rear smart wheel here all the
electronics are located in this hub
there's a 250 watt motor there's a
twenty nine point six volt lithium-ion
battery and takes about three hours to
charge through a little port here and
there's a waterproof hub that'll get you
about eighteen to thirty miles which is
more than enough range for a scooter
and there's a Bluetooth transmitter here
that'll connect to your smartphone
fly the company of the make smart pad
offers an app called bit ride you can
download that now for iOS or Android
that'll actually track the routes you
use and give you suggestions for better
routes it'll also show your remaining
range and it includes an immobilizer
will actually lock this rear wheel with
a pin code Wi-Fi is offering the smart
ped through a Kickstarter campaign so
you can get this basic model for eight
hundred dollars or you can go up to a
premium mile for nine hundred fifty
dollars that folds in three places
making it even more portable and
includes lights and a kickstand</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
