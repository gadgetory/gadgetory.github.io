Snickers bar nothing too surprising
inside it just satisfies and a few
things about it are nuts let's try the
2015 Acura RDX all-wheel drive loaded up
with the tech package check that nutty
jacket now if you haven't driven RDX in
a while you might notice the lines have
been a little cleaned up and streamlined
it's got less of an overt kind of a
sporting look and more of what most
degree is in mature look whether you
like that or not that's a big change
under the hood in the last few years
I'll tell you about the moment and
overall this remains a compact premium
SUV not quite in the full luxury
category and two rows no 3rd available
just no place for it now the first thing
I notice when we get into our RDX is our
old friend from back when Nixon was in
office this is one of the oldest dated
head units in auto dumb right now
doesn't mean it's not functional but
while it is not exciting anymore the
maps I've always thought looks just kind
of crunchy and juvenile the audio system
and other menus have kind of a strange
way that they arrange things with the
control knob rolling you through a
rectangular square of menus it's just
not great UI and it isn't pleasing to
the eye the rest of the cabinet is so
that's why it bothers me as well as the
fact that Acura is supposed to be a tech
forward brand and this is tech backward
it doesn't have any live search 3d
building representations that are
sophisticated ways of showing the map it
doesn't have any live Google Earth none
of the things we're seeing in other
brands out there that would be tech
forward in this car specifically you've
got am/fm radio but no HD radio on this
car that's a little frustrating
satellite radios in there with pretty
decent metatags although a lot of things
get truncated even though it's a huge
screen like a title of that song right
now is that really what it's called
under your special medium in you've got
bluetooth streaming on this guy then
you're gonna get into your hard drive 15
gigabytes that I'll never use cuz I
don't get those kind of things you've
got a USB jack for your iPod what have
you there's no app support except
Pandora and even that's only if you have
an iOS device there is no Pandora
support for Android you just go through
bluetooth streaming like I'm doing here
which is okay but again not tech forward
now one interesting tech trick on here
that
notable is song by voice which is more
than just song the music on your iPod or
iOS device and/or what's ripped to the
harddrive is searched by the car and
indexed by all of its meta information
then you can call things out by artist
by genre by song title works like this
iPod search please say the music play
song green green that's pretty cool
lot of cars can't do that now entering
destinations you have this menu here
much of which gets locked out when
you're driving so you drop back to voice
command let's see how well that works
good you're gonna need it this is not a
touchscreen would you like to set your
destination after the beep please say
one of the highlighted options address
Street I got to push the button I guess
again to get the next thing said even
though it doesn't tell me that it should
be listening and notice when I want to
turn up her voice this knob doesn't do
it it's buried in a menu somewhere I
hate that address like City fourth
Street that should be please say one of
the highlighted option City
push the button again after the beep
please say the city name or if they
wanna cup San Francisco after the beep
please say the three listen you've
verbose pain in the ass cancel basically
after you enter an address once by voice
you're gonna want to do it a little
differently you're gonna want to put
your fist through the screen which is my
inclination or better yet I got up my
windshield mount and went back to my
phone oddly tied to the GPS in this car
is the climate control system this is an
old Acura thing from years ago
supposedly it monitors what side of the
car the Sun is on and then will adjust
the climate control to make up for that
sun intensity but shouldn't you just
monitor the temperature and it doesn't
really matter where the Sun is I've
never quite understood that mumbo-jumbo
but it's in here if you want to impress
your friends rear view camera is
standard on these RDX's and the nice
thing is you've got several views as you
can see here you've got a sort of a main
wide view hit the button again and
you're getting a little more of a close
in focus and then if you hit it again
you get a trailer view basically if you
got a hitch on this guy that lets you
match up the hitch and the tongue real
easily so that's very functional and
it's actually great that it's included
now under the hood is a big story a few
years ago they moved away from a highly
regarded turbocharged for in these RDX's
to a more garden-variety three and a
half liter v6 those who are kind of
enthusiasts are not pleased about it but
I think for everyday driving this may be
the better choice we're gonna find out
three and a half liters I mentioned
sitting sidesaddle front-wheel drive by
default all wheel drive is optional like
we have here the numbers 273 horsepower
251 pound feet of torque zero to sixteen
about six and a half seconds for a car
that weighs about 38 50 and delivering
MPG of 1927 which is dramatically better
than that little turbo for used to do
Mama's not stupid part of how they're
getting good mpg out of this is cylinder
management iller one is a three four or
six cylinder engine depending on the
load but by the way it does not use the
latest direct injection which tends to
help mpg it's still using older style
multi-port now all that power goes out
to a single choice transmission setup
which is a six-speed automatic which
goes straight back from reverse to drive
and then an additional notchback to get
into sport mode and then your shifting
is accomplished by the paddles here on
the wheel when you really want to get
engaged when you're in the sport mode
it's going to hold gears longer hold
revs higher shift into a next gear a
downshift more aggressively a basic
sport profile I think let on to accurate
made the right choice and going with a
v6 you're first of all because they
raise the mpg by two on the city and
five on the highway if I recall
correctly that's a significant jump with
more cylinders except when it runs on
fewer with that cylinder management so
overall you've got an engine that's got
plenty of guts when you want it you just
have to unbundle a couple of top gears
from time to time to get to that power
but the paddles and the sport mode help
you do that
now the all-wheel drive rig in this car
is interesting it biases or defaults to
front-wheel drive but then when it finds
it it has too much power for the front
wheel grip to handle or you're getting
some kind of a bad road condition that's
when it'll send the power
out to the back 25 up to 50% front rear
but it's not a handling all-wheel drive
as much as a traction and bad surface
all-wheel drive no buttons or controls
for it as you may notice no drive mode
controls at all just gathering sport or
you're in Drive the suspension is not
terribly sporty I've got some pretty
good body roll here and over a really
choppy bad tarmac like I'm going around
this corner right here it's hopping and
losing traction it kind of an unnerving
way whoa it's a little bit on the taut
side without being all that compliance
so the ride quality can be annoying at
times not bad but it's not gonna impress
you in that respect now a lot of you
asked about space inside of compact SUVs
I'm six-two and there's plenty of room
in this vehicle this is a well
proportioned interior on this car
nothing about it feels tight in fact
nothing about it feels as small as it
seems from the outside that's a nice
trick so as I mentioned nothing really
excites me about the RDX but it's
satisfies on many levels at a pretty
good price in the market by the way it's
chasing the Cadillac SRX it's been a big
hit in sales so far in 2014 and kind of
neck and neck with a bmw x3 now let's
talk about pricing this car you're gonna
start off at about thirty five eight for
an RDX base front-wheel drive 1400 more
gets you all wheel drive 3,700 more gets
you into the tech package and that it
leads quite a bit
GPS and a half with voice recognition
the rear camera power liftgate enhanced
surround sound with more speakers and
power that GPS climate control I'm a
little dubious of xenon high-intensity
discharge front headlights and fog
lights as well all in here a little
under 41,000</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
