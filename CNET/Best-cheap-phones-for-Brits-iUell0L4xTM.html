smartphone that wont to decimate your
savings here are just a few of our
favorite low-cost Mobile's Motorola's
third-generation Moto G is its best yet
with a 5-inch display 13 megapixel
camera and a colorful customizable look
perhaps our favorite feature though is a
water-resistant frame which means the
phone can survive an accidental trip
down the toilet the Lumia 640 s best
features are its crisp colorful 5-inch
screen and an 8 megapixel camera that we
found took some rather lovely snaps it
runs windows phone which is easy to
navigate and easy on the eye but be
warned it doesn't have quite as many
apps as Android does the alcatel one
touch idol 3 may have a frankly terrible
name but it does have some nifty
features including a bright 4.7 inch
screen and a rather tasteful slender
design which is something that's not
always easy to find on cheaper mobiles
another motorola mobile the Moto e 4g is
very cheap indeed but it's also good
value boasting 4g a decent screen and
loads of apps by the android OS we
weren't too impressed with the camera
but there's still a lot to like here
finally something perhaps worth
investigating is whether your carrier
has slapped its logo on any own brand
cheap phones recent efforts like the
vodafone smart ultra 6 or ETS harrier
mini hook piqued our interest in the
last few months see anything you like
well we've got loads more information on
all these phones plus many more
affordable Mobile's on cnet com so be
sure to check that out alright that's
all for now i'm luke westaway and happy
shopping
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
