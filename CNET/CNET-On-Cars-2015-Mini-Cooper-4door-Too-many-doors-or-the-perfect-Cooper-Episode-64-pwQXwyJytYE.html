it still a mini never mind possible will
self-driving cars ever be illegal and my
top five tips for finding good car
repair time to check the tech EC cars
differently we love them on the road and
under the hood but also check the tech
and are known for telling it like it is
ugly is included at no extra cost the
good the bad the bottom line this is CNN
on cars
welcome to CNET on car the show all
about high-tech cars and modern drive
i'm brian coolie well thanks to a
bewildering array of options the Mini
Cooper has always been basically
whatever you wanted it to be except the
4-door now it can be that as well but
along the way towards beginning the Mini
Cooper did they lose any of its mini
appeal let's find that as we drive the
15 Cooper S 4 door and check the tech
now the key to the Mini Cooper 4-door is
of course for dorks they've never had a
cooper with four doors before though
there are other minutes that have four
doors the whole car is six inches longer
nose to rump about half that much is in
between the wheels extending the
wheelbase two inches more rear seat
legroom which if you're gonna put in
rear doors
you better have a reason to use them
even the front doors are different to
allow these doors to be bigger and you
also get two inches of additional
shoulder room in the backseat because
the whole rear quarter of the car is
contoured differently it's not like they
just took the two-door and hacked it and
stuck in an extender this is a
substantially different car from the
cowl on back still after all that it
picks up only 110 pounds over the
two-door now the first thing I notice
when I get in the current generation
Mini that brings a tear to my eye is
that this round bezel thing is just a
thing it's no longer ever that big
iconic speedometer that minis used to
have back in the day now it's simply a
place for a screen we have the largest
screen the eight inch that has
navigation now your other interfaces up
here you've got your motorcycle style
takun speedometer and a little helper
LCD down there as well there's one more
screen that's optional but we have it
that's the little motorized head-up
display this kind of visor style you can
set that to show speed navigation
prompts calling and audio if you use a
connected phone in the console cradle
nobody has more audio choices than these
guys including Pandora Rhapsody tune in
audible stitcher Amazon Cloud and Apio
and all of that is via the mini
connected app on your phone slot it into
a phone dock in the console which also
gets you power and an external antenna
name without an app you got am/fm HD
radio satellites optional six disc is
optional like you'd really want that
auxilary Jack and USB basic audio is a
six speaker rig and you can upgrade to
Harman Kardon surround sound which we do
have now controlling all of your head
unit gear is an i drive controller down
here but very different than BMW not in
its layout but in its altitude when it's
up here in a console like on most BMWs
ham is like so as it operates it now
your fingers like this you're using a
down pointed fingertip this was a pain
to use now driving arm and he gets us to
this automatic shifter because we have
the six-speed Automatic will size it up
on the road paddles on this car because
of the automatic around the shifter
you've got your drive mode control like
you've never seen before take it over to
the green mode the normal mode or the
sport mode now under its cute little
snout you've got two engine choices
depending whether you get a cooper or a
cooper s the base Cooper's got a three
cylinder this is an S we've got a four
both engines are turbocharged but ours
has got two liters of displacement
versus one and a half 189 horsepower 207
pound-feet of torque 0 to 60 and 5.6
seconds mpg varies on your transmission
2940 if you get a manual interestingly
lower mpg if you get an automatic it
doesn't usually go that way and
regardless of what engine size our
transmission you've got front-wheel
drive let's go for a ride out on the
open road I'm pleased to report that the
mini hasn't lost its meaning this even
though it's a little more Mexi than it
was it still has this go-kart like
steering short wheelbase tightly sprung
undercarriage and a stiff shell all
leads into them
and you can hear that nice little
exhaust snarl before you turn your back
on that automatic know that it's a
really good one especially when the
rings in the sport mode or the shifters
in the sport gate gears change tightly
and cleanly I find this is what works
best sporty-er rewards what this car is
all about the ride quality is what I
would call a comfortable go-kart it's
not jarring it's super tight some minis
in the past especially with the Cooper S
package could be a little bit brittle
anymore
and all around the Ergo is really good
it's a spacious enough car for me I'm
pretty tall and visibility's not
terribly constricted even though we have
some very chunky pillars back in the
rear corners okay a Cooper s 4-door is
26 or so based exactly a thousand
dollars more than a two-door you're
paying five hundred bucks a door if you
won't look at it that way now 1500 more
if you want the automatic transmission
it's a pretty good one I got to say and
it seems to pair well with the mission
of a four-door car once you load this
guy I've seen that style you're right up
against 30 grand they've retained the
essential meanness of the vehicle even
though they've added some inches and
added some doors a pretty good trick
they did their homework and the fact
that you've got a more practical and
justifiable platform for the purchaser
who wants to make sure it's the right
car for more years to come they should
sell these things like that find our
full review on the Cooper S 4 door where
Wayne Cunningham fought it lost a little
more of its sap than I did at cars dot
cnet.com the UN Convention on road
traffic observed by 85 countries makes
it clear every vehicle shall have a
driver that thinking is reflected across
a globe full of regulations insurers and
traditions where do you start to change
that
these martyr driver will find out when
CNET on cars returns
the assumption that every car has a
human driving it is being updated though
gradually in 2014 the UN amended its 46
year old rule to allow self-driving cars
largely at the urging of Germany Italy
and France the homes of some big car
makers that are developing the machines
the new language states that a driver
must be behind the wheel and can take
control back at a moment's notice
but that they may legally pull back from
managing the wheel and pedals for some
extended periods notably this UN
convention though has never covered
Japan China or the u.s. in America four
US states and the District of Columbia
have legalized autonomous cars on public
roads though for testing and with a
human standing by another eleven are
considering the idea twelve states have
already done so and said no this sets up
a problem in the huge and lucrative u.s.
car market fragmentation insurance
companies or the other major rule maker
if you will so far they envision a world
where the driver is still fully
responsible though there's been a call
by California insurers to have car
makers shoulder some or all of the
liability around autonomous accidents a
2014 study by the RAND Corporation
looked at that idea and theorized it
could quickly throw a lot of cold water
on self-driving cars or limit the
technology to high-priced flagships
where the volumes are low and the price
is high enough to fund the additional
liability but that puts the self-driving
cars benefits into a lot fewer people's
hands much more to come on this of
course one day it may pay the double
check who is liable in an accident do or
maybe your car mate
welcome back to see net on cars coming
to you from our home at the Mount Tam
Motor Club just north of the Golden Gate
Bridge well if you're like most people
you probably think of the tires on your
car are just an expendable
not unlike toilet paper you want
something good but mostly you don't want
to have to replace it very often you
should think of your tires as the more
sophisticated expendable more like
running shoes yes they're going to wear
out but they're a key part of the
engineered experience in the mean time
and deserve a car Tech 101
now I could do a half an hour on this
subject alone and put us all to sleep
but instead I want to touch on four high
points about tires that I think you can
keep on your mind as you go shopping for
them first thing to know is the big
concept which is your tire isn't this
big blob of rubber there's a lot of
engineering going in here a structure
that is built to operate a certain way
not just hold air
and unlike just about any other part of
your car this one changes shape rather
dramatically when it's working that's an
amazing thing to keep in mind as well
the first concept is the contact patch
or the footprint that's where this tread
here sits and meets the asphalt and it
varies in width and length if you will
kind of this way depending on the tire
design crasher and your cars weight what
happens that the contact patch is
amazing that footprint allows three
major things to happen first of all for
cour to be applied to the road as the
wheel is turning one way in relation to
the car and for braking to happen as the
wheel is being resisted kind of in the
opposite rotating direction in relation
to the car and then you've got the other
two axes which is kind of out and in
glad early across the tire that's how
cornering happens and you get that nice
grip and all of those dynamics typically
will happen all at once or within a
second of each other and the tires got
to be able to deal with all of them well
the next thing that we all notice very
much and you should be aware of is the
profile of the tire its height with
relation to its width now we love our
low profile tires they look great on
almost any kind of car it's been a big
trend the last few decades to get this
sidewall lower in relation to the width
of this trip but what does that is the
frame inside the tire they're called the
belts they're made of either Kali ester
or steel and they don't just bring that
profile down when you do
you change the nature of how the tire
operates in two kinds of loads one is
radial load the load that comes if you
will kind of vertically down on the
tread the stiffer this is that may
change the ride comfort you get more
drumming in the car you get less of a
soft compliant ride and this low-profile
tire also has a very different behavior
for lateral loads which is sort of this
side to side load think of it as a
cornering load for the most part this
low-profile sidewall is stiffer the
tires gonna kind of scooch less left to
right as you go in and out of a corner
that's great for performance but that
can also harshing up your ride because
there's less give in this overall design
it's a trade-off between that sharp
performance and that comfortable
compliant ride part and then of course
there's the tread itself that actual
intricate pattern that we all know and
see on the face of the tire this isn't
just here as a random pattern or to look
cool make a deal tire to be honest
there's no tread if you're driving in
perfect conditions on a dry piece of
pavement on a summer day like this slick
right here it puts the maximum amount of
rubber on a dry clean smooth piece of
pavement but that's not the real world
so our tires on passenger cars do have
tread we drive on roads that have gravel
that have snow that have rain so your
tread is designed to deal with all those
to work its way around gravel and find
the traction between the actual rocks to
get down in snow and find some grip in
that material or on a rainy day to take
the water in the middle of the tread as
you race down the street and evacuate it
out the side otherwise you end up flying
on the surface of the rain that's called
hydroplaning and that's no fun
and two other factors about tread design
the way that it grips and then releases
the road is a key part of how well this
thing does in corners is it going to
create oversteer or understeer all tires
have some slip as they turn but the
nature of that allows the car maker to
dial in the cornering behavior they want
in their overall vehicle and finally
tread has a lot to do with quietness of
a tire the way these lugs grip and
release at the road creates more or less
and varying kinds of sound that's where
all the road noise you hear from tires
comes from and that's a big deal on
luxury cars in a different way than on
sports cars a last thing I want to bring
your attention is rolling resistance
what it takes for this tire to roll down
the road varies dramatically by its
design the really grippy wide sticky
tire is going to be great at cornering
accelerating and braking but perhaps
require more energy just to keep the car
moving at a set speed let alone to
accelerate it and that's not a good guy
in an era when automakers are looking
everywhere to save even a few drops of
gas per mile now it used to be that low
rolling resistance tires which you'll
find on many very high efficiency cars
were awful they were like having a
three-day-old bagelman on each wheel now
they tend to be pretty decent
performance tires not extreme but
acceptable they're much better at having
a quiet rod pretty good performance and
actually looking good as well oh by the
way if you want to know what all this
stuff on the side of the tire means it
calls out much of the technology within
it and we did a separate piece on this a
little while ago about how to read your
sidewalls it's important for the tires
you've got but especially for the ones
you're considering buying I'll put a
link into our episode 64 shownotes take
you right to that piece and that's it

in a moment car insurance of the future
and five things to do before you drop
your car off for service you've seen
that on cars continue
in 2011 Alfa revealed the 4c when you're
not going too quickly it's a really
wonderful wonderful thing and by not
going too quickly I mean comfortably not
very fast because it has an interesting
little trait in that once you start
accelerating the wheel starts grabbing
and shimmying left and right and in the
end you end up hanging on for dear life
more than actually feeling as though
you're in total control by more from the
ex car team of C net UK at C Netcom /
welcome back to C net on cars i'm brian
coulis time for the part of the show we
take one of your emails and this week it
comes in from andre d who talks about
the future of driving in a big way
hany says all this talk about
self-driving cars and driver assist
technology got me thinking about
insurance rates of the future do you
think car insurance companies have a
future interesting question Andre
believe me insurance companies are at
the heart of self-driving in the heart
of that future vision without them the
whole thing stalls because liability is
not going away anytime soon the good
news is insurance companies are
generally behind and eager to get into
an autonomous future to some degree
because it reduces accidents in
everyone's projections and that of
course reduces claims good for us not
getting injured good for them not having
to pay for the injuries the tricky part
is that for decades to come
self-driving cars will have accidents as
the technology gets debugged and matured
and they'll be occupying roads with
human driven cars so the accidents are
still gonna happen and therefore the
whole idea of drivers insurance is still
going to apply even if you aren't
driving now that may seem patently
unfair if it happens when you're in a
car that is driving itself and it runs
into something
it's like wait a minute it told me it
was driving and I was doing something
else you are still the person
responsible for the vehicles operations
and of course any damage it causes
you cannot envision yourself as a
passenger when you're in the driver's
seat now if you get way out into the
future to the v2i or vehicle to
infrastructure era then we start to see
so much data connectivity and control
between cars cars - roads roads and cars
- central monitoring authorities you can
start to then see where the nature of
insurance could change dramatically but
at that point you're also starting to
look at our cars being more like
privately funded public transportation
than the kind of independent
unpredictable modules they are today
okay unless you turn all the wrenches on
your car and I mean from tail light to
transmission but most people don't
you're gonna need a good shop and know
how to spot and find one but can you
think of much else that inspires so much
trepidation and basically feelings of
inadequacy here are my top five ways to
spot a good auto repair place
now all of this assumes that you've done
your basic googling already to figure
out what kind of and number of shots are
available in your area then to winnow
them down start like this number five
look for certifications things like ASE
Triple A Better Business Bureau and your
state's Bureau of auto repairs complaint
records they do count for something
especially if they're current and not
from 1969 under the previous good owner
now plenty of mediocre shops have these
things in dusty frames on the wall but
it's a stock number for tidy if grease a
dirty shop can be a good shop but all
things being equal tidy tells you
something this is auto repair not
Grateful Dead trip dancing a certain
rigidity of process technology and
workspace make good things happen there
are great mechanic sewer slobs I just
haven't met one yet
number three lots of questions from them
to you nothing gives me the willies
faster than a service writer or shop
owner who takes in my car with barely a
curt question or two you see details up
front lead to the best least repair in
my experience this is also key to
getting it done right the first time not
the second or third infuriating time
number two no flushes when they urge you
to do a preventive transmission cooling
system or fuel injector flush but the
car maker makes no mention of in the
owner materials we need to flush the
shop these are signs they're likely in
the upsell business more than the auto
repair business before I get you to
number one here's what it won't be don't
sweat
getting your parts back I know that's a
classic old-school sort of a thing but
it's predicated on a toxic relationship
from the get and you're not gonna be
able to recognize that greasy bag of
parts even came off your car or not
shady shops know that my number one tip
is basic but there's nuance to it get a
reference but not from your friends
those same ones who are fooled by that
bag of greasy parts off some other car
instead hit the forums that deal with
your kind of car that's probably one out
there and if you find one with enough
members you're probably gonna find local
ones
who've been to every shop in town if you
do have a friend who his car repair
savvy of course ask them but just
because you know someone who's had their
car repaired doesn't mean they know car
repair ask the right people thanks for
watching hope you enjoyed this episode
don't forget to keep those emails coming
I read every one of them and a lot of
them make it into the show and look for
us wherever you like to stream video
whether it's on your Roku box or over at
YouTube or just about anywhere and tell
your friends they can do the same I'll
see you next time we check the tech
