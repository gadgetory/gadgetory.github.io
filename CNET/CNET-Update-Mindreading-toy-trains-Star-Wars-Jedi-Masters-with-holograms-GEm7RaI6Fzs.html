check out which tech toys are all the
buzz I'm Bridget Carey and this is your
scene at update
Crayola Color alive brings your
creations to life color a character in a
book and a smartphone or a tablet app
will animate your work of art and you'll
be able to order a 3d printed version of
what you just colored you can take it a
step further with the easy animation
studio it uses a poseable mannequin to
transform a coloring book character into
a two-minute animation that comes out in
the summer for twenty-five dollars this
is the miposaur
these dinos are reacting to the
remote-control ball essentially you
could send different moods you can feed
him you can play games when he's not
listening to the ball he'll listen to
the app if X is the remote control you
can spin them around and also feed them
a few things but if you feed them a sock
peen won't be too happy these aren't
just remote-control cars that you
control with an app these are artificial
intelligent cars you get a pack of two
for $100 one you control the other one
the computer will chase after you and
fight and battle you or if you have a
friend they can take over and have some
control to unki is now Anki overdrive
coming out in September for a starter
pack of 150 dollars these intelligent
cars know exactly where they are because
they have a little camera on the bottom
that can read where they are on the
track and you use an app to race and
battle your friends or battle a computer
car the app has a few extra bonus
features new weapons new games with this
new version an iPhone user can play
against someone with an Android app the
Star Wars Force trainer creates a
hologram projection when you place a
tablet on top of this prism the headset
reads your beta brainwaves so if you
concentrate just right you can
the x-wing out of the swamp or push back
your enemies I am on my way to being a
Jedi Master moving along here at Toy
Fair this is the io hawk it's an
intelligent personal transporter to move
all you got to do is just lean back and
lean forward a little bit or if you're
like me and you're wearing heels you
have to really use your core 6.2 miles
an hour is its top speed but I'm afraid
to actually take it there move over Easy
Bake Oven because there's a new
high-tech oven in town by the Girl
Scouts in this new Girl Scout cookie
maker you're able to make your own
cookies of your favorite flavors like
the Thin Mints and others once you put
it in the whole thing from prep to
finish is about 15 minutes this is my
kind of tech toy I think we need do a
little more research though on it maybe
I should say this booth for a little bit
longer really get to understand the
product I mean does they even have any
milk well because hmm why is it good
just doing it I'm Bridget Gary</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
