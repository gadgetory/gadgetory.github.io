just so you can watch a movie or TV show
you're doing it all wrong with every new
home theater purchase comes an
accompanying remote one for your audio
system your TV your streaming box and on
and on you probably know where this is
going what you need is a universal
remote this way you can put all of those
remotes away in a drawer once and for
all and deal with just one remote there
are a lot to choose from you have a
simple varieties that look like a
regular remote that can be programmed to
control multiple devices usually through
punching in and code for each device and
then you have the more advanced variety
our favorite is Logitech Harmony home
control this one's unique because it
also lets you turn your phone into a
remote control plus it uses RF which
gives you more flexibility than infrared
and you can even use it to control some
smart home devices including the Philips
hue light bulbs not only can a universal
remote help you get rid of clutter it
can also give you some bonus features
that will make your life even easier and
now you're doing it right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
