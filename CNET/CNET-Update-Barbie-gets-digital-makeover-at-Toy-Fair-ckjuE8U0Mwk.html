in New York to see how technology is
going to be in tomorrow's toys you're
ready for a new type of battling robot
The Bachelor Borg by Thome this is the
starter set and it's a wireless fighting
system the goal is to hit your opponent
five times in the helmet and then the
robot will be disabled you can even have
up to 20 of these guys fighting at once
if you're so brave enough to engage in a
battle royale of that size Barbie has
quite the high-tech dress on this is
barbie digital dress it's kind of like a
lite-brite meets Barbie maybe it's your
own little digital bedazzle lean if you
want you can use a stylus to draw what
you want on her dresses and you can save
different versions of it or you could
even have her address move to the music
if you want to be a true barbie girl you
gotta have Barbies look so why not have
Barbies digital mirror makeover where
you can have a digital makeover with
fake makeup all on a screen what you
need is a stick your parents iPad in the
screen and it uses augmented reality to
kind of paint your face and save
pictures of your new glamorous look and
be able to send it to other people oh
yeah that's it another big trend we're
seeing our toys that work with your old
iphone or ipad and Mattel is doing this
big time here you have a fisher-price
app mobile where you can stick an iphone
inside or put an iphone in a book
there's iPads in other learning games
and it goes up in age so it's kind of
fun how you're taking what you already
have in the house and iPad and bringing
it to life with new toys here's a toy
that puts a tech twist on nerf this is
the Tek recon and it has actual ammo but
you put a smartphone on top to be able
to find out where your opponents are who
also have a smartphone or where your
teammates are all the GPS and radar and
of course Hot Wheels has to have a
piece of the app action as well if you
don't need an iPad to have fun with it
but if you do it has a video camera with
augmented reality which gives your place
at a whole new level of fun here you
have a shark that's jumping over the
cars as they race by it's going to be
about forty five dollars and available
in July even Lisa Frank has gone techie
they have light up diaries now excuse me
I'm having a moment it's clear that tech
is making playtime more fun I got a
castle that's calling me for cnet I'm
