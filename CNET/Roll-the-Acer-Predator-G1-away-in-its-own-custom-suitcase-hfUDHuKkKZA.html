isn't the fastest or most powerful v
already desktop we've tested featuring
invidious new GeForce 1080 graphics
cards nor is it the least expensive or
the easiest to upgrade button playing
with it testing it and using it
alongside many of its bigger and more
powerful competitors
I found it had a better sense of for
lack of a more precise technical term
fun it's a gaming desktop that doesn't
take itself too seriously and that's a
rare thing plus it plays new PC games
and even VR games just fine thanks to
that Nvidia 1080 card and it's
reasonably priced making it easier to
overlook any performance or design
issues certain features feel like a wink
and a nod to the excessive sci-fi
inspired design they're not one but two
separate pullout headphone holders
basically reinforced sticks that extend
from the left and right sides of the
system and if you buy the special
edition bundle which we have here it
comes with a custom rolling suitcase
designed specifically to fit the g1 and
its accessories it's an aluminum case
with the same armor design as the
desktop but it has a pullout handle and
wheels like any suitcase you'd see at
the airport inside our custom foam
cutouts for the desktop its power supply
and its keyboard and mouse it's
hilarious but also kind of awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
