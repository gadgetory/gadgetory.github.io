partnering up with phone makers to
create its Nexus phones Google is taking
the rain the company released its first
pair of pixel phones and while HTC may
have put it together
Google engineered it designed it and
branded it so what are they like well
there are two of them the pixel and the
pixel XL they're nearly identical except
that Excel has a bigger sharper display
and a larger battery both are
beautifully made they do look a little
like the iPhone but they have angled
edges flush cameras and this funky
two-tone colouring and yeah that glossy
shade does look weird at first but it
kind of grew on me the pixels are also
deeply integrated with Google search
services and are the first phones to
come with Google assistant which you
activate by either pressing the home
button or saying okay Google what is it
a young museum here are some information
about a young assistant is basically an
AI bot that uses Google's vast search
database to answer all kinds of
questions
when does it close today but it's
conversational and you could speak to it
in a natural back-and-forth way young
Museum is open right now and closes at
5:15 p.m. often with most voice
assistants you forget that it's there
but when you do remember Google
assistant can be useful and works
relatively fast but of course there are
some things it just doesn't know okay
Google why am I so lonely there might be
some info on the web
another cool software feature is
launcher shortcuts which is Google's
take on Apple's 3d touch just long press
on some of the apps and additional
options will pop up right away you'll
also get a Jif integrated keyboard a
nightlight mode that tints the display
and a fingerprint reader on the back
that you can use to pull down your
notifications all right so how's the
hardware the Snapdragon 820 1 processor
is fast and smooth and the battery
lasted a solid workday with medium to
heavy usage during our lab tests both
phones clocked in over 13 hours of
continuous video playback on air
mode oh and don't worry you still get a
headphone jack Google made a big deal
about the pixels camera and suffice to
say it's excellent
by default the phone shoots in HDR auto
mode and a flick of the wrist switches
between shooters the camera's lens blur
feature could news work but overall
images look clearer sharp and vivid
photos taken in low-light understandably
weren't as sharp but the pixel did
manage to take in a lot of light
brighten up scenes and capture
relatively clear shots the camera also
uses a combination of the gyroscopes and
software to steady your videos this is
useful when you're moving while
recording but it does give your videos a
sort of surreal almost drone light
quality the phone has a few drawbacks
though it's not completely water
resistant which would have been fine a
few years ago but now that many others
like Sony Samsung and Apple have phones
that are water-resistant having the
pixel rated below ip67 seems like an
oversight the screen is also pretty dim
in direct sunlight and its most
noticeable when you're out shooting
photos in general though the pixels are
superb devices and you don't have to be
some sort of Android enthusiast to
appreciate them they look great and work
fast plus with Google Assistant it's
kind of like having a helpful friend bot
who talks a little stilted but knows
everything in your pocket ready to go
