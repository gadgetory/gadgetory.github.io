Nintendo put out a press release
bragging about the success of its newest
console the Nintendo switch to quote the
press release despite launching in March
a month not usually reserved for home
console launches and with the busy
holiday shopping season still in full
swing the Nintendo switch system has
already sold 10 million units to
consumers around the world according to
Nintendo's internal sales figures that
10 million unit mark was reached within
nine months of release for comparison
the Nintendo Wii U sold around 13.5
million units since its release over a
period of five years the original Wii
sold over 100 million units over its
lifespan as it brought motion controlled
console games to the masses if you want
to compare the switch to its current
rivals the Sony Playstation 4 sold 10
million units worldwide in just under
nine months after its release in 2013
Microsoft said that the Xbox one was
nearing 10 million units sold in to
retailers within about a year of its
initial release the switch was no doubt
helped by strong games like Super Mario
Odyssey which CNET editor Jeff Bakalar
called an absolute must own for anyone
with a Nintendo switch and a prime
reason to buy one if you don't have one
already 2018 will see a spate of new
games heading to the switch including a
new Yoshi game what games are you
