censored what so you've already finished
sense8 the Netflix series from the minds
of matrix creators the Wachowskis here
are our picks of what to try next like
sense eight heroes is about a group of
strangers around the world who realize
they're all connected by strange powers
heroes mixes comic book abilities with
absorbing drama and while ratings
certainly dropped over its initial
four-year run there's plenty to love
about the show's earlier seasons through
the cheerleader do the world sense eight
co-creator J michael Straczynski is
perhaps best known for creating Babylon
5 the cerebral sci-fi TV series about
disparate alien races coming together
and the conflict that creates despite
some decidedly vintage visuals this is a
show with plenty to say and deals with
war religion and substance abuse among
other things
if you liked sense eights big ideas
about tearing through the fabric of
reality but found the show sometimes
felt painfully slow Luc Besson's Lucy is
your remedy starring Scarlett Johansson
as a woman who achieved seemingly
limitless power as her brain's potential
is unlocked this surreal fast-moving
action flick polarized critics but if
you enjoy to watch a sqeeze own brand of
weirdness
you might just love Lucy
Canadian drama orphan black is another
sci-fi series with an ensemble cast but
this time all played by one person the
talented Tatiana maslany this tale of
cloning and conspiracy is still running
and has plenty of enthusiastic fans so
is well worth checking out families are
there finally if you want something a
bit lighter or suitable for the whole
family
try the Wachowski 2008 film speed racer
critics didn't have much time for this
saturated hyperactive adaptation of the
classic cartoon but it's an incredible
visual ride that's considered by some to
be a cult hit can you think of any other
shows that would be perfect for fans of
sense8 let us know and happy viewing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
