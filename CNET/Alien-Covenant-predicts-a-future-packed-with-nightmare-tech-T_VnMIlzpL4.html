Walter we certainly see kind of robots
good and bad in the film are you are you
worried about technology at all
ah no I mean there's no I mean I think
you know that it's important to keep
things in check and but it's happening
it's happening at a rapid speed of
course a is it's happening it's it's a
foregone conclusion I think it's just
about um in some ways containing them I
guess well because it would make sense
that they would start looking around CS
is the only problem on the planet and
you know maybe get rid of us my personal
feeling is there's a lot of things to be
worried about in the world right now and
artificial intelligence isn't the first
on my list okay Danny yeah I would have
to agree I feel like we're just gonna
all numb ourselves with our phones and
our technology that when we do create
being smarter than us
we'll already just be mush yeah I think
it was Bill Gates that said a couple
years ago in a really chilling article
if we don't all want to become the
family dog we've got to put some serious
paulie's policies in place about how we
develop artificial intelligence and that
image of human beings becoming the
family pet was pretty disturbing image
and it's not like that guy doesn't know
anything about what's coming and
Technology you know what I mean if you
had a robot double in real life which I
think I'd be a good thing when you go
send out to do interviews oh yeah that
could be quite handy actually how do I
know you're not a robot now you don't
say something only Michael Fassbender
would know but how would you know that I
would only know that good point that's
good where is it
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
