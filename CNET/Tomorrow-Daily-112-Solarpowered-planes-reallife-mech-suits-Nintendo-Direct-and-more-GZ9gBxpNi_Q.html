plane is going to attempt a trip around
the world you can now buy a mech no
seriously you can now buy a mech that
must be exciting for you and also
Nintendo holds their first Nintendo
Direct of 2015 lots of good stuff some
bad stuff too some are daily
greetings citizens of the Internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best ski
talk show in the known universe I'm your
host Ashley together join me as always
kale anonymous step by step yep kill
love you can drive it he's obsessed
we're gonna to pay a licensing right you
brought it up no I hate myself for
listening to you said to me you know
what I really miss new kids on the block
and I was like I'm talking about kill no
he's all you have a deeper over time
they were the manuto of the 80s late 80s
it was really nice no were you nope all
right on that note I think it's time to
hit the headlines just kidding we're
gonna sing new kids on the block know
that but no no we're definitely not
gonna do that I like that you freaked
out all the people listening on the
audio podcast or like no my ears why
they just drove off the road to get away
from it there like I just want to crash
my car I won't listen to this okay so
solar powered planes like we've kind of
seen ideas about this like maybe sort of
so kind of solar power not a hundred
percent solar powered until now so this
plane is called the Solar Impulse 2 it's
the world's first airplane that is one
hundred percent power a big plane those
are some very long wings if you're
listening only you have to watch this
video because the wings are insane it
has a very large wingspan so uh Solar
Impulse 2 fully powered by sunlight it
has it's going to be going around the
world there in prep right now for their
very first around-the-world flight it's
going to take 12 legs 12 12 stops and it
could last up to five months so here's
here's the deal on the solar power well
because of the weather they're not
really sure so it's like if they get
really good weather and they have enough
charge to fly the plane at night then
they'll be able to do that but if not
then they have to stay grounded until
they get enough charge with good weather
with sunlight and to put the plane back
to Gary unload the details okay so the
details are this is going to start in
March it's piloted by a guy who is a
hobbyist named Bertrand Piccard so he's
Captain Picard we're gonna call him
captain picard oh boy and then
lead engineer Andre Borschberg uh there
is not so funny to you his last name is
Borschberg uh they're gonna actually
take turns piloting this craft like it's
this is really fast there's only room
for one person in there to fly it around
real practical use of money a practical
mill okay so it's gonna start in the UAE
and Abu Dhabi and then it's going to go
over India my anmar China the US and
then southern Europe northern Africa ish
and again daylight needs to be strong
enough to charge the planes lithium
batteries uh but they were saying that
this is not actually something that they
would see being integrated into society
in the future they were saying maybe
it's just a really good jumping off
point for more eco-friendly / efficient
right planes which i think is really
cool so it's like kind of how some cars
are like hybrids they run off some
battery and then write some because some
you know engine maybe we get so far yeah
we could have a plane that does use a
little bit of solar power yeah exactly
or like or you say okay well you know
like if something goes terribly wrong
with your fuel tank maybe you have some
solar power to keep you afloat until you
can safely land that's great yeah so
it's a really interesting model and I
really liked that this guy Captain
Picard okay now Borschberg Captain
Picard's this guy bertrand piccard his i
believe it's grandfather or great maybe
great-grandfather flew one of the first
like hot air balloon like there's like a
whole he has a whole history of like
piloting and his family like a very
storied long history which is pretty
cool that's super super cool his dad I
think his grandpa maybe his great
grandpa like it's it's kind of awesome
so I just thought that was pretty neat
yeah harder percent solar-powered I tell
you what though not as cool as owning
your own mac that is true okay so I got
some details we got ups and we got major
downs for this maybe with the good news
first okay so good news is that you can
buy your own you can buy your own neck
here one night a million dollars off of
Amazon's I love that they're selling it
through amazon they deliver to me via
this is the kuratas 001 kit and it is
from us i'm gonna try this Su Su dobashi
heavy industries okay so it's a kiss
hibachi okay alright so here goes
news it has touchscreens inside we can
control the there's a little controller
inside they can control from the inside
as well as there's our control you can
control the mech from the outside and
there's an app where you can control it
from your phone this is even better than
Pacific Rim this is even better we're
all I need are some KY dudes to fight uh
it goes that way I don't wanna go to bad
stuff yet no not yet i'm still living in
the good stuff it has a launcher so you
can launch like like turrets or like
just water right now they used water
okay how's a working uh what is it
called a revolving turret Oh a Gatling
gun that a gattling gun that shoots bb's
sad part and it it also tracks your face
like it tracks your enemy and the way
you fire it is the pilot smiles all the
pilot has to do is smile and it starts
firing you're like gotcha yes Dora don't
be happy all right time for the bad news
hold on let me prepare okay go ahead
okay there's only one of them that makes
me sad drive it only goes ten kilometers
an hour super slow you can only get this
if you're in canto Japan yeah it doesn't
come with arms I thought that was like a
big letdown well that's enough eye on
you can buy it separately that's dlc
it's like real life deal right uh and
there's lots and lots of assembly
required okay well I assembly worse the
world I'm paying a million dollars
they're not gonna bring it to me fully
assembled we're stuffed that's five tons
I'm just gonna okay worst of all three
dollars shipping three dollars shipping
weight no only three dollars not buy-in
it I mean I have prime so I would if
it's on amazon if i prime i should get
free shipping totally not getting it so
that well you know what I'm out I don't
even wanna there you go a lot of people
are assuming that maybe this is like
because of the high price and what not a
lot of people thinking maybe it's just
like an art installation coming but for
1 million dollars that's that that's not
bad oh nuh mek especially there's like
face tracking and you commute some
islands got touchpads it's got a
gattling gun I feel like we need to
start Andy go go for this like I feel
like we just need a tomorrow daily mech
yeah maybe you can come on Scott maybe
replace to Ashley a scalar I it would I
less robotic than me I would go I would
go so far oh my god
so again wit between the solar plane and
and the mech there's a lot of like kind
of maybe it's okay but yeah there you go
still pretty good you get a mech yeah if
anyone has an extra billion dollars
laying around would like to donate a
mech to tomorrow daily just email us
Tuan sina.com yeah um so Japan well
we're yeah no let's keep going on like
yesterday uh nintendo nintendo had their
very first Nintendo Direct of 2015 and
again with the highs and lows there's
good news and bad news so what do you
want first you want hit me with the good
news no look it was bad news I want to
hear was bad and then we'll smorgasbord
of like what they said just shotgun this
stuff just so like we don't have to let
me go to blog here we go first thing new
Nintendo 3ds XL so here it is it's in
red and black you can get it actually in
less than a month it's gonna be out on
fixed rate that seems I think we're
started bad no I see I'm just gonna
shotgun it at you so here's the new
Nintendo 3ds XL has amiibo support it
has a/c controller this weird little
kind of see stick new control things
like camera angles and things like that
which i think is awesome they also have
went to micro SD cards and this is new
face tracking 3d that makes looking at
it at an angle of the 3d on the 3d s
amazing so Mike Cobbs friend of the show
mike hobbs went to japan and he was able
to see and he said it was just it was
unbelievable is so good man so people
are actually gonna start using a play in
3d yeah exactly keep going built-in
amiibo support NFC all that good stuff
um here's the it's gonna be 199 on Farah
where 13th here's the weird here's the
bad news kind of weird that you get no
AC adapter with it you can't charge it
well apparently Nintendo is saying
they're assuming which i think is a big
mistake that people who are going to buy
this new Nintendo 3ds XL already have a
previous either to DS 3ds whatever that
has the same charger so they're like
well you already have that charger so
you don't we don't want people to pay
for another one when you can just buy it
or they wanted to have the price low to
keep it under two hundred dollars
captain that's what I show you they
kicked out your little charger because
you're never gonna need that no
definitely not especially when they said
it would have liked a little tiny bit of
battery better than the 3dsxl right now
we're the chosen one
sorry oxide a billion of me bows while
speaking of amoeba soham Evo's more and
more me bows and bebos everywhere I
loved your meme this morning he had the
buzz lightyear like amiibos people's
everything it was great so amoebas
they're releasing a new pack of amoeba
specifically designed as like a theme
for Mario Party 10 so Mario Party 10
they showed off know which I thought was
really fun they're gonna have Mario
Luigi peach toad and Bowser and you're
going to be able to bring them into the
game and all this other stuff but again
there's a downside so let's say for
example you have the original Mario
amiibo and you've been leveling that
amar that Mario amiibo in super smash
brothers ok fair enough um you will not
be able to bring that amigo over to
Mario Party 10 without erasing the data
on your meebo for super smash brothers I
kind of don't like that I think that's
it's kind of cheap honestly it's a
little cheap it hurts me a little bit
Nintendo but but for people who really
like them Evo's it's like okay well I
have my you know super smash brothers
mario with the flames and then I have
like my Mario Party Mario and like I
think they're kind of hoping that they
can get people on board with this idea
of buying multiple amoeba yes so
basically what you're saying is during
the announcement they announce that
you're gonna have to buy more stuff well
you have if you want to use any
integration if you want to use more me
boats you have to buy more amiibos if
you want to play the new diaz you have
to buy a new power controller if you're
new to the 3d asked you have to buy a
new adapter but like look I think the
arguments we made is how many people are
going to have an overlap between i'm
specifically leveling say a Mario
character in super smash brothers and I
also want to have a Mario amiibo in
Mario Party 10 I don't know it's kind of
like listen guys it's kind of lame like
I'm gonna fully full disclosure it's
kind of lame but I also I get it I kind
of get it but i also don't understand
why they can't just have both both data
like why can't we just have all that
data on there it's kind of a weird
backwards thing ok last thing trailers
we saw a lot of trailers for games that
we already know exists that we already
know are coming out like kirby and and
things like that but there was in
particular a weird new free-to-play
project from a third party which is
super
air with Nintendo you only yeah party
games this is a namco bandai game and
they had this awesome guy oh I I don't
know what his name is this guy looks
super legit like an assassin and he
talked about this 4 player co-op game
where you have to collect treasure and
clear traps and like get through stages
what's a game called they they haven't
said yet they haven't announced it their
various there they say they're very
excited about it but their code name for
it is project treasure project treasure
it do you know if it's a it's just a
brand new IP they said it's brand new
game and and to me when they were
talking about it was like okay four
player co-op Lutz Lutz Lutz stages
things like that could like almost like
a dungeon crawler Mike Diablo like so
for we it was kind of like it reminded
me of Diablo for me the way that they
were describing is because you like
Diablo I'm interested to hear what
everybody else is what they think it is
yeah i'm sure people I've watched this
or seen that trailer and have some ideas
as to what it could be so thank you have
a if you actually are much can reach the
comment section yeah if you're laying on
a couch if you have access to a keyboard
you can use our hashtag of the day which
is hashtag TD Nintendo a couple
different things you can either tell us
what you think project treasure is you
can tell us what you want to see from
the next nintendo direct or you can tell
us what you were kind of mad that wasn't
covered in this Nintendo Direct like I
was a little bit sad that I didn't see a
star fox trailer yeah that would that'd
do it give me miss starfox I want I just
want more Kirby honestly yeah I love
Kirby games well Mario they've done so
much mario i just need some work you're
ready for it a little pilot Clinton yeah
we've got enough Mario we've we've had a
lot of like pokemon and I'm sure people
would actually like to see more fire
emblem somehow yeah I want me they said
um the Marth amiibo that like super sold
out and everybody was selling them on
ebay for like a hundred dollars yeah
they're gonna bring more to stores so if
you missed out on a Marth don't buy one
I did you hear the news story about that
no there's a guy that is he spending oh
he's value zero dollars to buy out all
of them because he hates the fact that
Martha's in the game and so he's buying
them all so nobody else can have them
protest he said he has up listen guy
five thousand dollars in which he can
spend it's hilarious you should go look
it up because there's pictures of him
giving he has giant piles of it and that
he's just giving the finger to the
picture to the that's great sir if I
ever find your other street that I use a
heartbreaking jerk but it's still pretty
funny I mean he's trolling everybody
pretty hard I'm sorry spent nine
thousand dollars and also just in case
you were curious or if you have a wii u
and you've been going god i want to play
wii games they released super mario
galaxy 2 and the metroid prime trilogy
is gonna be coming to the actual we you
like you can get wii games now from the
eShop with your children it's a good
trilogy like a trilogy i just want a new
metroid game thank you very much uh but
on that we're going to take a quick
break we'll be right back we have a very
interesting rumor mill this week that
we're very excited to talk about
regarding spider-man and of course your
ears are feedback so don't click away
tomorrow daily
welcome back from a show you're like
just it you're in the zone in that
jacket kale yeah it makes my eyes please
stop you sound like you're walking
through snow it's like crunch like
you're a fully artist um we have we
don't do this segment very often but
because i don't like reporting on rumors
because i like them to be facts yeah
exactly breaking people's hearts yeah I
don't want to make people sad but this
one was pretty juicy and also came from
a place that is pretty credible so let's
get into the rumor mill couple things on
this what was that that was our rumor
mill graphic I've never seen that but
well now you have new 4 2015 a rumor
mill graphic no girl like we've used it
maybe once before by for you I've seen
that before ok so this rumor comes from
Latino Review which traditionally is my
boys gets really good scoops on
superhero movies yeah really good scoops
um get to the scoop I don't want to get
into all the spoilers if you go over to
their site I'm gonna warn you there are
a lot of spoilers about what's gonna
happen in infinity war okay yeah that's
good right the rumor is the deal is done
and spider-man will be making appearance
in Avengers infinity War part 1 whoo
yeah welcome back that it's not even in
talks that the deal is done that's
fantastic only part one though huh Sony
needs that money back I guess so well
they gotta you know I'm yeah I'm all for
this man well obviously because he's in
the Avengers right but because I can't
watch this I'm doing some quips with
some of the other Avengers question is
who's gonna play spider-man because is
andrew garfield signed on for that many
spider-mans ifs Peterman's yes
pettersson sermons is right on for that
many I'm not sure and the thing is is
maybe Sony might say okay well let's
let's renegotiate your contract first
like because they're doing sinister six
and it's like well maybe they have him
for three spider-man movies maybe
they're not gonna make a third
spider-man movie maybe they'll option
him for Avengers part 1 how would I feel
like Sony likes money the story the way
if you go to the site and you read it
what is it spoiled Maori
the civil war storyline so if you have
not read the civil war storyline which
is a lot of the basis of civil the
Captain America 3 and then also a lot of
infinity war like there's a lot of
spoilers as to what the potential and
likely plot of those movies are I I mean
yeah Joss Whedon's been all about like
changing the story though like you said
like we want to change this because we
do it in the comics all the time we just
change stories so might as well do it
here but it's also the thing is is when
you think about actors and their
contracts there are certain Avengers
that only have certain numbers of
pictures that they are obligated to
appear in meaning we may see a couple of
Avengers either unavailable for part 1
of infinity war and come back in part 2
or doesn't make any sense we may see the
death of an Avenger we may see an
Avenger die again I guarantee you'll see
an Avenger day I most likely yes but I'd
the thing I didn't want to I don't want
to make anybody sad yeah but that makes
it even more exciting okay well they
might die probably in the comics so
don't say no spoilers kill anonymous not
your place to spoil these fine you know
what it's not a spoiler because it's
it's you don't know who listen and it
raises the stakes what are you gonna
watch up all these Avengers movies and
no one's ever gonna die that's not
exciting somebody has nobody has to die
yeah it's go but that's the the thing is
is there are certain picture obligations
for different actors depending on the
actor depends on how many movies they're
obligated to appear in for Marvel and
these are these huge multi-picture
contracts that they lock them in do now
because of how much money Robert Downey
jr. MIT has made you coming back over
and over again and renegotiating after
every picture so um it'll be really
interesting to see who makes it through
yeah the next few like phase 3 of Marvel
movies because they're gonna have to
integrate guardians of the galaxy
there's a lot of Avengers have yeah it's
look it's not it's not gonna spoil look
if there was no risk of anybody dying
these movies wouldn't be exciting I
think there's they always do it near the
end of movies like Thor's mighty big
this time it might not even be Hawkeye
like people go oh just dump Hawkeye he
sucks but cuz he's boring but it's like
it may not be may be a bigger maybe an
actual movie started with Hawkeye just
going Oh guys he I just got choked on a
verse 5
took them falafel Varma and it's over
just by a hawk is so sad yeah so there
you go this is something we've all been
waiting for spider-man to join this
universe and bring all his quips and
whatnot just really briefly before you
before we get an user feedback did you
ever think that we would live in a world
where cause like when I was a kid like I
i read a couple comic books here and i
wasn't nearly as into it as a lot of
people I knew but I never thought that I
would see things that I loved like nerd
stuff becomes so mainstream and so
consumer driven like this is unreal like
we're in this weird golden age of like
nerd cinema and it's exciting than that
the fact that people are like taking
comic books to it look it's seriously
like no but you you understand the
history I Captain America it's like
they're especially among us and that's
cool i like I'm all into it I love
infinity gauntlet one of my favorite
comics so I'm really excited about it
see fit any award it's like Danis isn't
easy I haven't read a jerk I haven't
read it but even I'm like super excited
about it and I just I love that you know
everybody's taking i know i don't i'm in
for such a ride too i love it i don't
know what's coming I don't and you know
what you don't know what's coming ms I
don't know what's coming what is it you
do but its user feedback yeah I know
you're mad at me you can you can just
stand out maybe it was like cookies or
something no maybe it was a spider and
then maybe I just spared you think of it
that way that's true oh please one time
co-host with a spider just a little tiny
tiny spider yandel oh my god no no no
miss my co-host um okay so yesterday we
asked you guys use the hashtag TV hollow
