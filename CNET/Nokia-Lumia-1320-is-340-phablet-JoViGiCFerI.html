Cena taking a look at the Nokia Lumia
1320 a pretty good budget phablet it's
got a 6 inch screen that's what makes it
a phablet super-sized phone here
now one interesting thing is that the
screen has a resolution of 720p HD
instead of 1080p HD that you're gonna
find on the higher-end versions of a
phone like this namely the Nokia Lumia
1520 phone dimensions are large but the
rounded corners help make it appear a
little bit smaller the color I've got is
this bright orange it also comes in a
bright yellow both of those are matte
however if you're a little bit more
button-down it also comes in white and
black pricing is really important it's
three hundred and forty dollars off
contract that is about half the price of
what you're gonna find on a premium
phablet and that's really going to be
key when you think about the trade-offs
and the features so in addition to the
slightly lower screen resolution there's
a five megapixel camera on the back
which is pretty low does come with flash
and autofocus and one thing I love about
Windows Phones is that there is a
dedicated camera button on the front
you've got a VGA front-facing camera
also pretty low that'll do the trick but
you're really not gonna want to rely on
it for a lot of video chats for a
lengthy amount of time they're gonna
look pretty blurry to the person on the
other end of the line internally you've
got a 1.7 gigahertz dual-core processor
we're seeing a lot of quad core
processors these days everything runs
smoothly it's just not going to be the
fastest for playing games compared to
some other phones there is LTE on here
you do have NFC as well bluetooth 4.0
and you can change in the settings the
sensitivity so that you can operate this
phone using gloves internal storage
capacity is also on the lower end of the
spectrum at 8 gigabytes but you can peel
off the back cover and add a microSD
card to expand that out on the plus side
you do have a 3400 milliamp hour battery
in here so that's gonna last you for a
good long time and of course this phone
is running Windows Phone 8 update 3
which means that you're gonna have three
columns going across the front a couple
other features as well nokia has added
all of its software amenities on here
also you're especially going to see
those in the cam
Department now the phone itself is a
little bit large you are gonna have a
hard time fitting it into smaller
pockets I did find the mat to be pretty
good although at times I also found it
to be a little slippery well you will
have some features trade-offs overall
for $340 this is a feature packed
phablet that people on a budget should
definitely take a look at I'm Jessica
