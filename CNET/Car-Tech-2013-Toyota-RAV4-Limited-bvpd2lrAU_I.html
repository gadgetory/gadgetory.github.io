you hate crossovers blame Toyota they
invented them with the rav4 and here's
the latest the 4th generation the 2013
let's drive this limited-edition
front-wheel drive and check the tech now
as you can see toda did not dramatically
reap rapport shim the rav4 they did
dramatically he stylet them it's about
an inch shorter about an inch wider what
you do see is a much more dramatic
pointy nose and those kind of shoulders
or the taillights leave those really set
off the new model more than anything
from the outside now the first thing
you're gonna notice in the new rav4 is
the interior is much nicer it's not so
utilitarian in fact it's actually kind
of ritzy now the main star of the show
of course is the head unit we have two
major head unit choices on this limited
first of all you can get display audio
which is LCD with entertainment
Bluetooth and all that on there and some
vehicle settings and your sources will
be am/fm CD aux USB with iPod support
and you'll also have bluetooth streaming
all in the base display unit if you
upgrade to the navigation rig you also
get satellite radio HD radio with iTunes
tagging and of course Entune apps the
end to nab stroll in I Heart Radio and
Pandora so roll in more media choices as
well when you get navigation it's really
the smart way to go as you'll see when
we check the prices later there's lots
of pros and cons to this full-on head
unit first of all the navigation voice
is really good you press this button you
blurt out the whole address and it finds
it damn Nets avenue San Francisco it was
even good with a fuzzy search I did I
said take me to Twin Peaks in San
Francisco which is kind of an undefined
sort of a search term and it figured it
out a downside though is that the voice
command doesn't work for the Entune apps
so you can use voice command to do all
kinds of things for communication
navigation and such but you cannot use
it to do a Bing search for example or to
tell it to do something with I Heart
Radio or Pandora so it's a mixed bag
here now in terms of what you're
listening to and how it gets out to the
speaker's you can also option up JBL
audio which takes you from six speakers
and kind of nondescript amplification to
ten speakers and a powered sub with J
the audio amps behind it let's talk
about some driving tech now the BSM
button down here blind spot monitor not
on every rav4 but a lot of the packages
have that like our nav package and that
gives you little indicators in the
mirror but no correction if you're
drifting into someone also has a cross
traffic alert it'll keep me from backing
into someone who's going to hit you
sideways the main story here is that
we've got a transmission that is a
six-speed but it's a fo 6 it's actually
a CVT with variable pulleys but that's
better than the 4-speed cogs
transmission that we had in the outgoing
model that was positively antiquated the
Soviets were loaning them to Toyota or
something no paddles on the wheel but
you could drop it back here into a gate
for sport mode and then shift within
there up and down now of course
crossover vehicles descend from sport
utility vehicles so the utility matters
in these guys let's check it out on the
rear end of the rav4 first of all power
lift gate on this Mollica it's high trim
I got to say it's one of the slower ones
to start and it's pretty slow to go up I
only bring it up because you get
impatient day in and day out with slow
power tailgates this one kind of got on
my nerves after a while fold-flat second
drone it's very easy one lever at the
side of the seat and whacking goes down
no screwing around with multiple sort of
levers and pulls
you'll also notice they no longer offer
a third row option the engines a new
story as well the engines not really new
but now you no longer have the choice of
a six-cylinder it's an inline 4 or
you're not getting a rav4 at all that's
your choice the number 176 horse 172
foot-pounds of torque it's this 3,500
pound vehicle to 60 in about nine
seconds that's very average for its
class the mpg is not bad though 24:31 is
nothing to complain about now we have a
front-wheel drive car here it's also an
all-wheel drive variant and limited slip
differential is included on this
front-wheel drive as well
now tell your first thing you notice
about driving this car is there's not
much to notice the power comes on just
fine you don't miss the v6 not being
here really what you do notice though is
there a little bit of that yo-yo effect
it is sort of a CVT and a 4-cylinder
that's kind of struggling a little bit
that does lead to some sort of strange
kind of loopy spooling acceleration but
there's plenty of power here it's just
not real responsive I'm not crazy about
the degree and note of the engine noise
you hear it's not the kind of engine
noise that you listen to them sounds
good it's the kind that goes in engine
eco and sport don't seem to make much of
a difference in the drive field and the
shiftable gate over here this is not a
responsive transmission in terms of its
fo six gears I would never use it in
kind of a sport way it doesn't really
pay off leave it and drive in you're
fine okay let's price this 2013 limited
front-wheel drive out 29 grand delivered
member this is top of the stack 1400
more gets you all wheel drive as a
driving experience it remains a
relatively high-tech good value
civilized driving machine but it's not
gonna blow you away in any one direction</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
