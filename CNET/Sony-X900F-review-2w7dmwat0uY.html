second-to-none
even today when Samsung and Vizio
dominate sales and upstart brands like
TCL make waves
one reason Sony's still great is models
like the X 900 F this TVs predecessors
one has seen its favorites last year and
the 2018 version is even better
excellent image quality sleek style and
plenty of smart TV extras make it one of
the year's top mid-range choices you can
get a sense of Sony's super minimalist
style on the 65 inch version seen here
this TV has an ultra thin frame around
the picture with a little accent strip
along the bottom and the dark color is
understated and classic the legs are a
bit chunkier than competitors and sit
closer to the center and I appreciated
the little cable management channels in
the back fire it up you'll be greeted by
the Google Android TV system one of the
most capable around if a bit slower to
respond than some other systems
it delivers great app coverage however
with not only big names like Netflix
Amazon and Vudu complete with 4k and HDR
but numerous others including YouTube TV
PBS KIDS Pluto TV and more you can also
cast apps from your phone fans a voice
will also appreciate the built-in Google
assistant which lets you talk into the
remote to get responses from the TV
speakers and on-screen
the TV can also connect the Google home
and even Amazon Alexa devices for select
commands hands-free but what really sets
the x9r deaf apart is picture quality it
uses full array local dimming to achieve
superb black levels and searing light
output the latter a big strength and
brighter rooms
it also offers extremely accurate color
and even better video processing than
last year in my side-by-side comparisons
it couldn't compete with OLED but still
delivered excellent image quality for an
LCD TV on the other hand it cost quite a
bit more than similarly excellent sets
from TCL and Vizio so bargain hunters
might want to look elsewhere but if you
value that Sony name and want Android on
your TV the X 900 F is a great choice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
