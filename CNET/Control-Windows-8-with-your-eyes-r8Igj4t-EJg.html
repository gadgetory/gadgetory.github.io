what I have here is a laptop with an eye
tracker drifter and foreign I track you
can do is measure with about a quarter
inch level and position where the eyes
are looking at a screen what you're
going to see here is that we combine
this and with the touch pad to make it
possible to do everything you would
otherwise do on a tablet but now since
then you can do it on a laptop and a lot
of things become very easy to use so to
start off if I want to launch an
application in the news 8 all I need to
do is lay down the windows button and
then whatever I look at will
automatically light up so I'm looking at
the Explorer now but you can ignore that
because I'm
and upward to now go down to open work
and then I say release writer opens up
for me now here in word I've got to word
documents open and if I want to scroll
through them just like I would on a
tablet where I would do this type of
thing here is that I just look at
whatever I want to scroll through and
then quickly swipe spike up on the
touchpad and it'll start scrolling for
now I'm going to go to this one when I
swipe out the same way back at the left
one swipe back down and the the document
comes back for me so going back now into
the Starkman I can do a lot of other
things as well for example it can get a
very high level of precision that I
could never get on a touch device so if
i go into excel for example i can really
hit each and every individual SL here
within
on a touch device I would touch down and
then if I try to hit that cell GG it
might mess up in an hiep g2 is that same
thing kind of course happen with gays
but here i have the advantage that my
fingers man you here so if i want to
touch the cell I 6 here now I just hold
on my finger and then if necessary I
advise you and I can always get right to
wear when I do I want to make the text
bold I just look up there hit the home
button
and this
through this way of interacting I can do
all kinds of business and that would
otherwise become boring entire set to do
on the laptop the way of traditionally
always had to do it with the keyboard
and mouse</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
