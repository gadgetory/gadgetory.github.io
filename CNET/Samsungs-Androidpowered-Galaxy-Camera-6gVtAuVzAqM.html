we've seen it and this is a look at the
Samsung Galaxy camera which is basically
a point-and-shoot camera that's similar
to Samsung's WB 850 F with a 21 X zoom
lens and a 16 megapixel backside
illuminated CMOS sensor but instead of
just a camera operating system you get
Android 4.1 jelly bean and the option to
add 18 T 4G data service those things
give you access to a world of Android
apps and the ability to share your
photos and movie clips on the go you
also get this huge 4.8 inch HD
touchscreen that's not only handy for
framing your shots but the extra space
is really nice for viewing and editing
or doing just about anything else that
you can do with other Android devices
and it even has a headphone jack on the
side shooting modes range from full
manual and semi manual to full auto plus
there are a lot of options in between
for example there's a best face shot
which will take a burst of five pictures
and then let you pick the face that
works best for the people in your shot
overall though what I really like is
that the camera doesn't feel separate
from the OS it's a cohesive experience
that other camera makers probably
couldn't pull off that said it's photo
quality is no better than a good point
and shoot and it's battery life isn't
great and with a price of about $500
without a day to plan it's a tough sell
unless you really need to shoot and
share immediately and want the benefits
of a better lens and sensor then you'll
get in a smart phone
