all I'm Bridget Carey and this is your
cnet update HTC has announced a brand
new flagship smartphone called one HTC
has not been doing so well lately so the
company is really hoping to WoW you on
this new phone it has an all-aluminum
body moving away from the cheap plastic
feel of most Android phones the home
screen interface called sense looks
different gone our widgets like that
retro flip clock instead the home screen
has something called blinkfeed which is
like a flip board collection of news
stories social media updates and photos
that you can flip through oh and there's
no way to shut off blinkfeed entirely
another unique feature is something
called zoe which is a photo mode where
the camera will automatically take a
short three second video at the same
time you take a photo so when you scroll
through the gallery it looks like the
photos come alive a little it might
remind you of Harry Potter photos but
the only people who can see Zoe files or
other HTC owners unless you convert the
files oh and there's also the matter of
the rear camera which is 4 megapixels
HTC calls them ultrapixels and that the
sensor can pick up more light and can
work better in the dark than the iphone
or galaxy s3 but that's going to be a
hard sell for consumers who only care to
look at megapixel numbers and most top
phones have 8 megapixel cameras the
company's trying to streamline its phone
models this year so the HTC One will be
the same version sold that 18t Sprint
and t-mobile the 32 gig model is two
hundred dollars with a two-year contract
it appears that Google doesn't want to
feel left out of the retail store trend
and is looking into opening google
stores later this year at least those
are the reports buzzing around there
wasn't word on exactly where or when but
it could be a place for Google to show
off its products like Chromebooks and
the latest nexus tablets and smartphones
hotmail is entering its final chapter
microsoft is starting to move all
hotmail users to outlook.com the new
free webmail service and the hotmail
service is being phased out users can
keep their a hotmail com accounts but
they'll just have to access them through
the out
look calm web portal some folks joke
about people who still have hotmail
accounts but I see no shame in hotmail
it could be a point of pride when it's
hard to get like owning a classic car I
still have my AOL account and I have no
plans on getting rid of it because it
was my first email address and now it
manages all my grey mail but what's your
take on all the email addresses do you
use hotmail proudly or get teased for an
old email account send me a video reply
using tout or email your comments to
update at cnet com that's your tech news
update you can find more details on

update from our studios in New York I'm
