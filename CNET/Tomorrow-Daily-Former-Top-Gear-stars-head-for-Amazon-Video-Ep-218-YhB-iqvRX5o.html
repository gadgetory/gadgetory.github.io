glows with the beat of your heart Nokia
is getting into the virtual reality game
but it's not a headset and top gear is
finally making a comeback put the
confetti graphic in the air Wade smart
daily
greetings citizen through the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best geek
talk show in the known universe I'm
Ashley sceva as always to my right your
left kill anonymous our budget is what
26 cents an episode we can't afford the
graphic for confetti you know we had to
put in for that for budgetary and we got
denied money's tight well I mean there's
still good news about the whole top gear
thing but it's it's tricky news so I'm
gonna have to explain it for you here's
today's headlines top gear is kind of
back what in a better fashion listen
this is great everyone's excited about
this it's great news all around but as
we all know Top Gear had some like
controversy as they let go of one of
their stars and the whole show crumbled
and fell apart yeah BGC was like ain't
no more of this Jeremy Clarkson punched
a producer he called it a fracas and
then BBC was like boom why and then
everybody lost their minds yeah okay
continue well so the show kind of they
they kind of like everyone left the show
and they're like well we're gonna make
the show again but will they can plot a
completely different cast everyone was
like boobs right well guess what today
amazon has announced that they are
bringing the show back with the entire
cast Clarkson Richard Hammond and James
May they're gonna be they're gonna be
coming back as an Amazon show basically
the same premise the whole cast Wow yeah
and even hit even one of the executive
producers they're all coming back to
make pretty much the same show it's
gonna be coming back next year okay
everyone rejoiced yeah people pretty
excited about this yeah I know that as a
host I can't condone violence I would
never hit producer Logan unless he
deserved it and so no I've never hit
producer Logan but that being said I
think a lot of people don't care about
what Jeremy Clarkson does in his
personal time or I look whatever I said
whatever choice you make they just want
to see some top anyway yeah so the crazy
part is that not only amazon said
they're gonna bring it back but they're
gonna bring back for three seasons
they've already signed up for Muricy
uh there's a quote from from one of the
people Clarkson has said I feel like
I've climbed out of a biplane and onto a
spaceship oh sick burn I'm BBC peacock
basically matter to the BBC is a biplane
like an outdated biplane ship I always
had faith in where Amazon intends to go
and their their potential as a platform
because you know Netflix is already kind
of say their place but there needs to be
some sort of competition hello ain't
gonna do it so an amazon has the power
they have the nominations with
transparent they do and they have the
money to do this but this is a huge
opportunity for them to also open the
gateway to new content also start
bringing back other shows this this is
this is a big big move and a lot of
people are excited all amazon has to do
is fix their stupid player we are
centrally which seems to be let it for
everybody's problem that's every its
felt bad that's yahoo everybody's player
is just garbage this is a great way to
bring people into amazon prime oh yeah
really huge sneaky intelligent way to
bring people in amazon prime i wonder
how much they paid how do they give how
much money does trucks full of money
they have it delivered by drone maybe
just piles of money these people because
i can't imagine they came over to amazon
cheaply yeah we already know that they
were making a lot at BBC having been
around so long and negotiating and stuff
like that i'm sure we'll get a number
sooner or later but she sign up for
three seasons amazon has a lot of faith
and I for good reason I mean it was
BBC's number one revenue generating show
for years yeah so we uh we look forward
to seeing what comes out of this we look
forward to seeing amazon's content again
I'm not like trying to you know butter
up amazon or nothing because I mean
there's just a lot of work to be done
there as well as every other yeah one of
these hugs good job yeah nice if you're
just glad that the street come back yeah
great pool so you know again next year
you'll be able to see it but that brings
us to our hashtag of the day which is TD
prime gear I think I'm so they should
call the shows on prime prime gear yeah
let's call it prime gear instead of top
gear I can't do that it can't call a
prime gear if they wanted to the same
can they call it top gear 222 gear to
up to gear to cantankerous that's Jeremy
Clarkson the show's getting canceled its
is a European amazon so our question to
you for TD prime Garrett's how can the
show differentiate itself from the BBC
version how they're gonna I can't really
up the ante Asia change the format it
maybe you should make it better yeah
we'll make it what would make it
different or better in some way because
i have a feeling like the exact format
of top gear I don't know thinking it
might be there might be some sort of
copyright on our trademark on the format
of the show I know with like Writers
Guild stuff here if you submit you know
your writers guild stuff for a treatment
of a show that tends to be your
intellectual property so just what I
think they're gonna do I don't know I
think they're gonna bring in celebrities
I know they've already brought in
celebrities for top gear but I think
they're gonna try and up that I know
they brought on like Aaron Paul they
bring on everyone to show up their cars
and talk about their favorite cars but I
think there amazon is really going to be
trying to draw like new eyes to the show
gotcha the best way to do that as
celebrities um I think that what do you
think high tech of course you were gonna
say hi tech space vehicles so I think
they're gonna put them in like you know
the Virgin Galactic has like their test
flights and stuff I think that they
might put them in stuff like that and
have them just try and then explain what
it's like so get them a little out of
their comfort zone come on apush I'm a
little out of their comfort zone I mean
listen they're talking about going from
a biplane to a spaceship why not just
actually stick them in a spaceship I
like this just saying or maybe put them
through like astronaut training to get
ready to be in a rocket or something
like that I think it would be awesome
top space gear yeah I'm cool so yeah let
us know what you think that they should
add or where they think they may go
hashtag TD prime gear but that brings us
to our Ashley story of the day yeah it
does um actually I was expecting you to
talk about this because it's virtual
reality but then the top gear's
Storybrooke so i figured i would talk
about it uh nokia nokia nokia like oh
it's very differently yeah it's not
nakia i've heard it drunk nokia over it
over seas Lakia they are okay so when
they got purchased by Microsoft it
wasn't the entire company it was just
the handset division so they bought the
phone part of Nokia and then they
said okay like you go and go away now
like Microsoft's like okay buh-bye so no
key has had to kind of figure out what
they want to do next and they have
decided it is the ozo and here it is
this is the O's oh it's a virtual
reality camera it's a capturing camera
it's a beautiful spirit I mean it looks
amazing it looks very sleek it looks
very interesting to me and it's made for
creators they had an entertainment
industry event earlier this week which
can I just really briefly say nokia
thank you for not inviting us because
we're right here in LA and you could
have called you didn't have really sad
about big thing invited me well I said
don't bring that a skill that they said
don't bring that quesadilla with you so
so they okay so this has eight cameras
that's what it looks like right that's
standard looks cool it's got there all
synchronized global shutter sensors
eight integrated microphones full
stereoscopic 3d video they're saying the
recorded content can be published to VR
headsets that's the goal they want you
to be able to publish directly to
different VR headsets commercial ones no
pricing yet but they said this will be
available this fall so in time for the
for the vibe so they're incredible they
wanted out before all of the retail
headsets start coming to market which I
thought was a really good strategy and
it's apparently not aimed at the
consumer market so it's it this is like
prosumers or and professionals well yeah
right out of the gate when he sort of i
granted you a check it's just gonna be
for prosumers but i gotta say the
sleekness of this is is great i mean you
think about go pro that was the first
one to kind of look right really sexy
and easy to use and so i think they're
kind of going for the same they need to
know that price i know yeah and so you
need to know that so go pro has a six
camera rig that they're bringing the
market at some point but if you do the
math on it let's even say it's one of
the less expensive ones you're still
looking at like a couple grand like
after all said and done like if you have
six cameras and you get the four hundred
dollar ones that's $24 just for the
cameras the cost of the cameras then you
got to add in the cost that the rig and
all this other stuff yeah i think this
is gonna be one of those this is gonna
be a race just like with just like what
the headsets whoever gets it whoever
nails it first just like with gopro
nailing that sort of like crazy camera
type thing yeah they're gonna win small
size good idea
it looks really really nice really nice
it is important however because go there
go pro one it also came with like a
stitching software too yes it's I think
Nokia is saying they want to do
something very similar where you're
going to be able to literally just like
import this footage and then pub or
publish it directly after capturing it
you'll be able to publish it directly to
my headset manufacturer so for what
that's worth very interesting stuff
happening over at nokia husband yeah i
wonder how much it's going to cost who
knows take a guess i'm going to say 1499
yeah if they're saying prosumer it's got
to be a brother super i'd say i'd say
1499 at depending on what resolution
shoots in yeah if you shoot some 4k i'm
gonna say 1990s yeah camera buffs let us
know what you think on that yeah I'd say
1999 if it shoots in 4k probably around
there if it's prosumer if it's
straight-up industry professionals only
then that cameras gonna be like also 20
robot very 3000 also camera buffs are
you interested in the 360 are you ready
to dive into that I know I am and I'm
not even a camera but yeah we're above I
i want one I'd like that really tapped
into some creativity of the camera buffs
also for the record this is an alcohol
it's green too he's lying trader joes
all right let's talk about you don't
want to drink and drive for your green
teeth and but I'm going to tell you
about some car stuff this really briefly
is a really awesome promotional idea
from lexus but it is not going to be
coming to a car near you at least not
for now so this is a modded car that has
been redesigned to light up and pulsate
to the heartbeat of synchronized with
the heartbeat of the driver so after the
car hits 100 miles per hour then you get
to see like so the app they have these
chests fans that measure their heart
rate and it's all synced up and so he
gets in the car and as soon as it hits a
hundred miles an hour like all these
drivers men and women that you can see
their heart rate as it flies down the
road which is pretty on you have to go
100 miles per hour I think that's what
when it starts because that they want to
see like how cool you are under pressure
like it's like okay like how cool are
you under pressure you hit the hit 100
miles an hour and then
the sudden we're gonna see what your
heart rates like because really if
you're driving it like 55 this is boring
heart rate not gonna have an exciting
heart rate so this is obviously just to
show up the Lexus cuz it's not gonna be
street legal of course oh there it is
activated boom car lights up that's his
heart rate that her is your cool as a
fan of Tron that's super cool this is if
not if this is not in Fast and the
Furious 8 like I just want to make this
abundantly clear this is a huge
opportunity missed by everybody involved
if it's not in Fast and Furious 8 so
this is it the one thing I'm like no
this is it's interesting how we're kind
of using biometrics in really fun
creative ways so like her heart was
racing really fast right there 183 beats
per minute that's a lot she was she was
jacked up she was intense so yeah man it
just slows down and heart rate slows
down then I get out that's a very
awesome who's our car guy at seen that
uh well there's a few there's Brian
Cooley Tim Stevens there's a few of car
guys seen it I'd love to throw one of
those guys in there that would be
amazing i'd love to see that I i just
threw motorcycle limbo at tim stevens
cuz he rides motorcycles and he rides
like ducatis and stuff and it's actual
like you're on them like fast motorcycle
and they set a bar low and you just
slide underneath it it sounds terrible
it looks terrifying I would never do it
but people are really into it motorcycle
limbo look that up in the internet
you're welcome so yeah well we see
things like this in the future we're
gonna see like wearable tech we've seen
kind of fashion stuff tap into
biometrics we saw the Spider dress we've
seen the proximity it's kind of
different proximity sensors things like
that so really cool stuff and on that
note we're done with headlines we're
going to be right back it's Thursday
we're going to tell you what we're into
and then we're going to talk about your
user feedback so don't click weights
tomorrow daily
welcome back to the show we've returned
you know it's Thursday and even though
this is the episode traditionally where
the rails come off of the show we still
like to talk about things that we like
so this is into it kale I think what you
have listed is something I was really I
thought you had seen but you just saw it
okay you can't make that assumption and
I'll chand i'll tell you why once i get
a little further into it um besides
being into blueberry green tea from
trader joes i am again trying to make
sure we're gonna make you put it out in
a paper bag next but the overlords have
cnet aren't fully aware of that not
drinking on the job i am sorry i
wouldn't i wouldn't even be able two
words talk um but I'm into it this week
I just watched it last night which is
the europa report which is available on
netflix that's what i wanted to bring it
up you can go watch this right now it is
about a group of scientist that that
find out this is based around the 2011
announcement that there was like water
yeah potentially on on Europa they fly
which is one of the was it Jupiter's
moons so they fly all the way out to
Europa and they're there to investigate
the water and see if there's any life in
there well it's not just a fun little
documentary it's actually a suspense
movie yeah about like all the dangers of
having to go to an unknown planet and
landing in the wrong place and things
are going wrong and spoiler people die
people don't make it people die I'm not
gonna say anything beyond that but the
suspense builds more and more and more
and more and more and more and like I
was watching him before bed and had a
hard time going to sleep was your dad
like lighting up like the Lexus your
heart is racing really fast couldn't go
to sleep it was strobing it's a
fantastic if you're indicas there's a
lot of science jargon it doesn't like
veer off to a super-duper fiction it
stays pretty accurate they talk about
radiation they talk about um just
everything like oxygen it's it's it's
very realistic and and well really like
a considerable a second yeah I didn't
like the ending but everything else was
fantastic and now here's why I say you
can't assume
I've seen it okay movie costs 10 million
dollars to make it looks fantastic very
sure looks great there's great acting 10
million dollars to make made two hundred
thousand dollars yeah which is just a
shame like let's all talk about what a
shame that is because I saw it the very
first weekend it was out I bought it we
bought it I was like I gotta see this
movie and I loved it it was a year like
a year ago and it was out on like on
demand and they release it all I they
didn't even do it the a triple release I
think and if it was it was very limited
and you could just get it video on
demand like that was that was it and for
most places that was the only way you
could see the movie and it was so so
good and you're right there is a lot of
research scientific research that went
into this movie where the space travel
part of it is very good and very well
done but I love sharlto copley in this
movie is fantastic rohtak oh please he's
delightful King King Stefan from
Maleficent also I don't want to give
away the ending of district nine but
he's in district 9 let's see that anyway
go check this out it's great it's it
again it's on netflix so that's i wanted
to pick something that people could
access i try and pick something they
will be able to to grab let me know if
you watch it tweet at me let me know
what you think because last time i did
sorry attempt the mic last time i did
humans and a bunch of people hit me up
in a belay thank God thank you so much
it's been great I didn't want to keep
doing this stuff and if you have
suggestions for me on netflix or
television is always looking let me know
I'm just I just gotta have something new
all the time so that's mine I want to
know what Ashley's is because she always
picks something good to well it's also
on netflix so conveniently and I know
you're gonna be watching this this
weekend it's wet hot American summer
verse oh yeah you're right it's boiling
here we go to moon tomorrow wet hot
American summer finally Netflix decided
to make a TV show based on the hit film
which is so so funny it's not really hit
that was like a cult films cult film
back to camp firewood this is a prequel
to the film which is hilarious and so
and it will this looks to be just this
funny if not more they all play younger
versions of themselves fourteen years
after the original movie aired which i
find hilarious that's watch Paul Rudd
entrance here just dumps a motorcycle on
the ground is like hey so judge john
benjamin is there I mean there are so
many stars you can see Amy Poehler
Bradley Cooper you got Elizabeth Banks
christopher meloni Ginny grovel janeane
garofalo and then newbies to they got
Chris Pine they've got Jon Hamm they
also Kirsten Wiig so this is and it's
the original director and the original
screenwriter are working on this show so
this is all of the same people came back
for this and and from what I have seen
from the reviews who have seen an
advanced version of it everybody loves
it it's so so funny and it's great and I
can't wait to see it yeah and if you're
completely unfamiliar with the show
please movie is also on netflix watch
the movie is a cult classic so it's one
of those kind of like really fun and
Paul Rudd Michael area if you don't if
you didn't already love Paul Rudd this
is your Paul read this you're Paul Rudd
access Ken Marino this is a great Kim
Moreno access point who is a very very
funny character actor just hilarious how
much you love um what hot american
summer Logan 5 stars yeah that's the
Logan seal of approval run the graphic
Logan Super Bowl we don't have that
graphic ng oh that's right also not
approved in the budget yeah also alright
guys so that's what we're into let's
talk about your into it stuck for user
feedback we got a couple of really good
responses about TD Henry so the virtual
reality oculus story studio short film
Henry was debuted what was the question
and we asked what would the plot of your
VR blockbuster bay oh yeah you have to
pick a VR blockbuster then you guys came
up with some good one so we'll Rodin
said another slender game with some
turtle beach headphones out of the fear
yeah I don't like you will are fine
that's 50 yeah I Corey wrote in and said
a mystery where you have to look around
and watch the whole scene to understand
the plot no Ashley likes that idea I
like the idea of having a mystery movie
where you can only unlock the ending if
you can actually solve the puzzle oh
that sounds infuriating so like your
Colombo or whatever Matlock bad choices
but yeah castle castle can we do a new
one sherlock holmes professor layton
fish
yeah I went on and you have to solve the
mystery and it can't you just never see
the end like you get a bad ending and
they're like no you're wrong like sorry
sorry pal listen that's infuriating all
right and yes yeah and then pin did
right and he wrote an email attach the
screenplay no I'm just kidding oh thank
god here we go no no he said hayashi go
it's a little longer than what you see
on the screen so this suggestions once
again probably too long to read on there
but it's too good not to share murder
mystery in VR be immersed in the scene
as the plot progresses the viewer can
pause the movie at any time to examine
the crime scene two modes with and
without characters present when the
movies pause the viewer can also choose
to interview any of the characters at
the scene character interview would
utilize the same tech as Cortana or Siri
except it would do it search within a
wiki for the story and filter for what
the interviewed character knows or
thinks he or she knows what are you
reading from this is the full email me I
like to short it cuz otherwise it's just
a little little tiny wall of text that
no one can read so then he said the
script to be structured like the law and
order TV series first half procedural
second half his legal drama second half
the viewer can choose to be part of
prosecution or defense I'm gonna go
ahead and interject that this was
already done with that rock star game
I'm hub ah ok was that rock star named
Colin Poli right no now is more LA noir
LA noir pretty much already did this
yeah so if you did LA noir and VR which
would be great you made their faces
facial expressions yeah listen later
basically le noir and VR i love that i
see Brett is so good but pin added that
you'd also have to go to prosecute them
yeah I'm one different thing about super
intense but yeah thnkx is always pin
thanks art alright guys time for our
very last piece you use your feedback is
our phone tog refer of the day
I was thinking about the cover for bully
and for some reason I accepted maybe I
really want to prosecute the logo jerk
children little jerk children I'll
played the game in a different way than
everybody else did I always do alright
John wrote in our phone target for the
day and he says here's a picture for my
