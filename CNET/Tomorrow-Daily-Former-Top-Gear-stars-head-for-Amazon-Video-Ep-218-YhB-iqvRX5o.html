glows with the beat of your heart nokia
is getting into the virtual reality game
but it's not a headset and Top Gear is
finally making a comeback put the
confetti graphic in the air Wade smart
Daly
creating citizen through the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best geek
chalk show in the known universe I'm
Ashley sceva
as always to my right your left kill
anonymous our budget is what 26 cents an
episode we can't afford the the graphic
for confetti you know we had to put in
for that for budgetary and we got denied
money's tight well I mean there's still
good news about the whole top gear thing
but it's it's tricky news so I'm gonna
have to explain it for you here's
today's headlines top gear is kinda back
but in a better fashion listen this is
great everyone's excited about this it's
great news all around but as we all know
Top Gear had some like controversy as
they let go of one of their stars and
the whole show crumbled and fell apart
yeah BBC was like ain't no more of this
jeremy clarkson punched a producer he
called it a fracas and then BBC was like
boom why and then everybody lost their
minds yeah okay well so the show kind of
they they kind of like everyone left the
show and they're like well we're gonna
make the show again but with a
completely different cast and everyone
was like boomers right well guess what
today amazon has announced that they are
bringing the show back with the entire
cast Clarkson Richard Hammond and James
May they're gonna be they're gonna be
coming back as an Amazon show basically
the same premise the whole cast Wow
yeah and even hit even one of the
executive producers they're all coming
back to make pretty much the same show
it's gonna be coming back next year
okay everyone rejoiced yeah people are
pretty excited about this yeah I know
that as a host I can't condone violence
I would never hit producer Logan unless
he deserved it and so I've never hit
producer Logan but that being said I
think a lot of people don't care about
what Jeremy Clarkson does in his
personal time or I like whatever I think
whatever choice they make they just want
to see some top ten anyway yeah yeah so
the the crazy part is that not only
Amazon said they're gonna bring it back
but they're gonna bring back for three
seasons they've already signed up for
racy
since when there's a quote from from one
of the people Clarkson has said I feel
like I've climbed out of a biplane and
onto a spaceship Oh sick burn
I'm BBC basically letter to the BBC is a
biplane like an outdated biplane I
always have faith in where Amazon
intends to go and they're their
potential as a platform because you know
Netflix is already kind of stayed there
placed but there needs to be some sort
of competition hello ain't gonna do it
so if amazon has the power they have the
nominations with transparent they do and
they have the money to do this but this
is a huge opportunity for them to also
open the gateway to new content also
start bringing back other shows this
this is this is a big big move and a lot
of people are excited all the other sign
has to do is fix their stupid player
yeah so really which seems to be
everybody's problem it's bad it's yahoo
everybody's player is just garbage this
is a great way to bring people into
Amazon Prime all away yeah really huge
sneaky intelligent way to bring people
in Amazon Prime I wonder how much they
paid how much do they give how much
money just trucks full of money they
have it delivered by drone maybe just
piles of money to these people because I
can't imagine they came over to Amazon
cheaply yeah we already know that they
were making a lot at BBC having been
around so long and negotiating and stuff
like that I'm sure we'll get a number
sooner or later but she signed on for
three seasons Amazon has a lot of faith
and I for good reason I mean it was
BBC's number one revenue generating show
for years yeah so we we look forward to
seeing what comes out of this we look
forward to seeing Amazon's content again
I'm not like trying to you know butter
up Amazon or nothing because I mean
there's a lot of work to be done there
as well as every other yeah what are
these hubs good job yeah
nice we're just glad that the streets
going back yeah great pool so you know
again next year you'll be able to see it
but that brings us to our hashtag of the
day which is TD prime gear I think it's
so they should call the shows on prime
prime gear yeah let's call it prime gear
and seven top gear I can't do that I
can't call it prime gear if they wanted
to this thing can they call it top gear
to to to gear to
- Garrett - cantankerous that's Jeremy
Clarkson the show's getting canceled the
Amazon so our question to you for TD
prime gear is how can the show
differentiate itself from the BBC
version how they're gonna I can sure
they up the ante should I change the
format it maybe make it better yeah well
make it what would make it different or
better in some way because I have a
feeling like the exact format of Top
Gear I don't know thinking it might be
there might be some sort of copyright on
it or trademark on the format of the
show I know with like Writers Guild
stuff here if you submit you know your
Writers Guild stuff for a treatment of a
show that tends to be your intellectual
property so just what I think they're
gonna do I don't know I think they're
gonna bring in celebrities I know
they've already brought in celebrities
for Top Gear but I think they're gonna
try and up that I know they brought on
like Aaron Paul they bring on everyone
to show up their cars and talk about
their cars but I think they're Amazon's
really gonna be trying to draw like new
eyes to the show yeah the best way to do
that is celebrities I think what do you
think high-tech of course you were gonna
say high-tech space vehicles so I think
they're gonna put them in like you know
the Virgin Galactic has like their test
flights and stuff I think that they
might put them in stuff like that and
have them just try it and then explain
with it what it's like so get them a
little out of their comfort zone a
little out of their comfort zone I mean
listen they're talking about going from
a biplane to a spaceship why not just
actually stick them in a spaceship I
like this just saying or maybe put them
through like astronaut training to get
ready to be in a rocket or something
like that I think that'd be awesome top
space gear yeah cool so yeah let us know
what you think that they should add or
where they think they may go
hashtag TD prime gear but that brings us
to our a sh ly story of the day yeah it
does actually I was expecting you to
talk about this because it's virtual
reality but then the top gear story
broke so I figured I would talk about it
nokia nokia nokia like it's very
different every year it's not Nakia I've
heard it funk Nokia over it over seas
they are okay so when they got purchased
by Microsoft it wasn't the entire
company it was just the handset division
they bought the phone part of nokia and
then they said okay like you go and go
away now like Microsoft's like okay
buh-bye
so Nokia's had to kind of figure out
what they want to do next and they have
decided it is the O's oh and here it is
this is the O's oh it's a virtual
reality camera it's a capturing camera
it's a beautiful sphere I mean it looks
amazing it looks very sleek it looks
very interesting to me and it's made for
creators they had an entertainment
industry event earlier this week which
can I just really briefly say Nokia
thank you for not inviting us because
we're right here in LA and you could
have called you didn't have really sad
about invited me well I said don't bring
that a skill they said don't bring that
quesadilla with you so so they okay so
this has eight cameras that's what it
looks like right that's standard looks
cool it's got they're all synchronized
global shutter sensors eight integrated
microphones full stereoscopic 3d video
they're saying the recorded content can
be published to VR headsets that's the
goal they want you to be able to publish
directly to different VR headsets
commercial ones no pricing yet but they
said this will be available this fall so
in time for the for the vibe so they're
incredible they wanted out before all of
the retail headsets start coming to
market which I thought was a really good
strategy and it's apparently not aimed
at the consumer market so it's it this
is like prosumers or and professionals
well yeah right out of the gate when he
sort of hired a new tech it's just gonna
be for prosumers but I gotta say the
sleekness of this is is great I mean you
think about GoPro that was the first one
to kind of look right really sexy and
easy to use and so I think they're kind
of going for the same they need to know
that price I know yeah and so you need
to know this so GoPro has a six camera
rig that they're bringing to market at
some point but if you do the math on it
let's even say it's one of the less
expensive ones you're still looking at
like a couple grand like after all said
and done like if you have six cameras
and you get the $400 ones that's $24
just for the cameras the cost of the
cameras then you got to add in the cost
that the rig and all this other stuff
yeah I think this is gonna be one of
those this is gonna be a race just like
with just like what the headsets whoever
gets it whoever nails it first just like
with GoPro nailing that sort of like
crazy camera
thing yep they're gonna win small size
good job yeah though it looks really
really nice really nice it is important
however because Gope their GoPro one it
also came with like a stitching software
- yes it's I think Nokia is saying they
want to do something very similar where
you're gonna be able to literally just
like import this footage and then pup or
publish it directly after capturing it
you'll be able to publish it directly to
my headset manufacturer so for what
that's worth very interesting stuff
happening over at Nokia yeah I wonder
how much it's gonna cost who knows take
a guess I'm gonna say $14.99 yeah if
they're saying prosumer it's got to be
over I'd say I'd say $14.99 and
depending on what resolution shoots in
yeah
if you shoot some 4k I'm gonna say 1990s
yeah camera buffs let us know what you
think on that yeah I'd say $19.99 if it
shoots in 4k probably around there if
it's prosumer if it's straight-up
industry professionals only then that
cameras gonna be like also 20 more but
also camera buffs are you interested in
the 360 are you ready to dive into that
I know I am and I'm not even a camera
boy yeah I I want one like I'd like that
really taps into some creativity of the
camera buffs also for the record this is
an alcohol it's green - he's lying
trader Jeff alright let's talk about you
don't want to drink and drive for your
green teeth and but I'm gonna tell you
about some car stuff this really briefly
is a really awesome promotional idea
from Lexus but it is not gonna be coming
to a car near you at least not for now
so this is a modded car that has been
redesigned to light up and pulsate to
the heartbeat of synchronized with the
heartbeat of the driver so after the car
hits 100 miles per hour then you get to
see like so the app they have these
chest bands that measure their heart
rate and it's all synced up and so he
gets in the car and as soon as it hits a
hundred miles an hour like all of these
drivers men and women that you can see
their heart rate as it flies down the
road which is pretty honest you have to
go a hundred miles per hour I think
that's what when it starts because that
they want to see like how cool you are
under pressure like it's like okay like
how cool are you under pressure you hit
the hit 100 miles an hour and
all of a sudden we're gonna see what
your heart rates like because really if
you're driving it like 55 this is boring
heart rate you're not gonna have an
exciting heart rate so this is obviously
just to show up the Lexus because it's
not gonna be street-legal
so there it is activated boom car lights
up that's his heart rate that is your
cool as a fan of Tron that's super cool
this is if not if this is not in Fast
and the Furious eight like I just want
to make this abundantly clear this is a
huge opportunity missed by everybody
involved if it's not in Fast and Furious
8 mm-hm
so this is the one thing I'm like no
this is it's interesting how we're kind
of using biometrics in really fun
creative ways so like her heart was
racing really fast right there it's 183
beats per minute that's a lot she's she
was jacked up she was intense so yeah I
mean it just slows down and heart rate
slows down then I get out that's awesome
who's our car guy at scene that well
there's a few there's Brian Cooley Tim
Stevens there's a few of car guys yes
you know I'd love to throw one of those
guys in there that would be amazing I'd
love to see that I I just threw
motorcycle limbo at Tim Stevens cuz he
rides motorcycles and he rides like
Ducatis and stuff and it's actual like
you're on him like fast motorcycle and
they set a bar low and you just slide
underneath it it sounds terrible it
looks terrifying I would never do it but
people are really into it motorcycle
limbo look that up in the Internet
you're welcome
so yeah well we see things like this in
the future we're gonna see like wearable
tech we've seen kind of fashion stuff
tap into biometrics we saw a spider
dress we've seen the proximity that's
kind of different proximity sensors
things like that so really cool stuff
and on that note we're done with
headlines we're gonna be right back it's
Thursday we're gonna tell you what we're
into and then we're going to talk about
your user feedback so don't click away
it's tomorrow daily
welcome back to the show we've returned
you know it's Thursday and even though
this is the episode traditionally where
the rails come off of the show we still
like to talk about things that we like
so this is Intuit
kale I think what you have listed is
something that I was really I thought
you had seen but you just saw it okay
you can't make that assumption and I'll
and I'll tell you why once I get a
little further into it
besides being into blueberry green tea
from Trader Joe's I am again trying to
make sure I'm gonna make you put it out
in a paper bag next but the overlords
have seen it are fully aware of that not
drinking on the job I'm sorry I wouldn't
I wouldn't even be able to words talk
but I'm into it this week I just watched
it last night which is the Europa report
which is available on Netflix that's
what I wanted to bring it up you can go
watch this right now it is about a group
of scientists that that find out this is
based around the 2011 announcement that
there was like water yeah potentially on
on Europa mayfly which is one of the was
it Jupiter's moons so they fly all the
way out to Europa and they're there to
investigate the water and see if there's
any life in there well it's not just a
fun little documentary it's actually a
suspense movie yeah about like all the
dangers of having to go to an unknown
planet and landing in the wrong place
and things are going wrong and spoiler
people die people don't make it people
die I'm not gonna say anything beyond
that but the the suspense builds more
and more and more and more and more and
more and like I was watching him before
bed and had a hard time going to sleep
was your dad like lighting up like the
Lexus your heart was racing really fast
couldn't go to sleep it was strobing
that's fantastic if you're into cuz
there's a lot of science jargon it
doesn't like veer off to a super-duper
fiction it stays pretty accurate they
talk about radiation they talk about
just everything like oxygen it's it's
it's very realistic and and well really
good not considering yeah I didn't like
the ending but everything else was
fantastic and now here's why I say you
can't assume
I've seen it okay movie cost ten million
dollars to make it looks fantastic
very sure looks great there's great
acting ten million dollars to make made
two hundred thousand dollars yeah which
is just a shame like let's all talk
about what a shame that is because I saw
it the very first weekend it was out I
bought it we bought it I was like I got
to see this movie and I loved it it was
a year like a year ago and it was out on
like on demand that they release it all
I didn't even do a theatrical release I
think and if it was it was very limited
and you could just get it video on
demand like that was that was it and for
most places that was the only way you
could see the movie and it was so so
good and you're right there is a lot of
research scientific research that went
into this movie where the the space
travel part of it is very good and very
well done but I love sharlto copley in
this movie is fantastic dr. Copley's
he's delightful King King Stefan from
Maleficent also I don't want to give
away the ending of district 9 but he's
in district 9 let's see that anyway go
check this that's great it's again it's
on Netflix so that's I wanted to pick
something that people could access I try
and pick something that people will be
able to to grab let me know if you watch
it tweet at me let me know what you
think because last time I did
sorry it's up to Mike last time I did
humans and a bunch of people hit me up
in Belize thank God thank you so much
it's been great I didn't want to keep
doing this stuff and if you have
suggestions for me on Netflix or
television I was always looking for you
know I'm just I just gotta have
something new all the time so that's
mine I want to know what Ashley's is cuz
she always picks something good - well
it's also on Netflix so conveniently and
I know you're gonna be watching this
this weekend it's wet hot American
summer verse oh yeah that's right it's
finally come ago tomorrow tomorrow wet
hot American summer finally Netflix
decided to make a TV show based on the
hit film which is so so funny it's not
really a hit that was like a cult films
a cult film back to camp firewood this
is a prequel to the film which is
hilarious and so and it will this looks
to be just as funny if not more they all
play younger versions of themselves 14
years after the original movie aired we
I find hilarious that's watch Paul
Rudd's entrance here just dumps a
motorcycle on the ground he's like hey
so Judge John Benjamin is there I mean
there are so many stars you can see Amy
Poehler Bradley Cooper
you got Elizabeth Banks Christopher
Meloni Ginny and grovel Janeane Garofalo
and then newbies - they got Chris Pine
they've got Jon Hamm
they also Kirsten wig so this is and
it's the original director and the
original screenwriter are working on
this show so this is all of the same
people came back for this and and from
what I have seen from reviews who have
seen an advanced version of it everybody
loves it it's so so funny and it's great
and I can't wait to see it yeah and if
you're completely unfamiliar with the
show please movie is also on Netflix
watch the movie it is a cult classic so
it's one of those kind of like really
fun and Paul Rudd it's my color if you
don't already love Paul Rudd this is
your Paul read this is your Paul read
access Ken Marino this is a great Kim
Marino access point who is a very very
funny character actor just hilarious how
much do you love what hot American
summer Logan yeah that's the Logan Seal
of Approval run the graphic Logan Super
Bowl we don't have that graphic NGO
that's right so not approved in the
budget yeah all right guys so that's
what we're in - let's talk about urine -
it's not for user feedback we got a
couple of really good responses about TD
Henry so the virtual reality oculus
story studio short film Henry was
debuted what was the question and we
asked what would the plot of your VR
blockbuster be oh yeah you have to pick
a VR blockbuster then you guys came up
with some good one so will wrote in and
said another slender game with some
turtlebeach headphones out of the fear
that's playful and Corey wrote in and
said a mystery where you have to look
around and watch the whole scene to
understand the plot no Ashley likes that
idea I like the idea of having a mystery
movie where you can only unlock the
ending if you can actually solve the
puzzle that sounds so like you're
Columbo or whatever matlock bad choices
but yeah I guess
Castle can we do a new one Sherlock
Holmes Professor Layton for sure yeah
why not and you have to solve the
mystery and if you can't you just never
see the end like you get a bad ending
and they're like no you're wrong like
sorry sorry pal and then pin did right
and he wrote an email attach the
screenplay no I'm just kidding oh thank
god here we go
no no he said Hayashi go it's a little
longer than what you see on the screen
said this suggestions once again
probably too long to read on air but
it's too good not to share murder
mystery in VR be immersed in the scene
as the plot progresses the viewer can
pause the movie at any time to examine
the crime scene two modes with and
without characters present when the
movies pause the viewer can also choose
to interview any of the characters at
the scene character interview would
utilize the same tech as Cortana or Siri
except it would do it search within a
wiki for the story and filter for what
the interviewed character knows or
thinks he or she knows what are you
reading from this is the for me I like
to shorten it cuz otherwise it's just a
little little tiny wall of text that no
one can read so then he said the script
would be structured like the law and
order TV series first half procedural
second half his legal drama second half
the viewer can choose to be part of
prosecution or defense I'm gonna go
ahead and interject that this was
already done with that Rockstar game
Logan was that writer named Colin Poli
right no la noir la noir pretty much
already did this yeah so if you did la
noir and VR which would be great because
you made their faces facial Russians
yeah later basically le noir and VR I
love that that is so good but pan added
that you'd also have to go to prosecute
them yeah one different thing about
super intense but yeah thanks as always
pin alright guys time for our very last
piece user feedback is our phone Todd
refer of the day
I was thinking about the cover for bully
and for some reason I maybe I really
want to prosecute those logos jerk
children little jerk children honestly
the game in a different way than
everybody else did I always do all right
John wrote in our phone target for the
day and he says here's a picture for my
