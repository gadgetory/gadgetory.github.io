robots gen Korean barbecue this is the
place to be
I'm hanging out with David and David
come on look at all this I've heard so
much about what you guys do I guess I'm
looking at robots is that right yeah so
this is our new robotic system big thing
about this system is it's supposed to
help the service you're gonna be
ordering with them just like in any of
our of the restaurants but then the
thing is is that we're using this as a
tool to help bring out the food so the
server doesn't have to be running back
and forth and they can just spend more
time you know all right so let's just
say the food is ready and we want to get
it sent out how do we actually go about
doing this it's actually very very
simple all we have to do you know once
the food is set on each tablet are
specified tables of where each will
about those two and all you have to do
is tap on there so if you can just tap
on table 50 okay well let's see what we
got here is the Hawaiian bacon right
here lion wake in it so I'm dipping
sauce
okay well look it I want some of this
shrimp shrimp so just throw it on okay
make sure to make sure it's like within
range got some shrimp the Hawaiians sick
and we have a teriyaki pork shop you
know me okay so we just go here hit 50 G
just tough okay - so once once you tap
there I'll use few seconds tap that it
will be on its way
all right I'll give it a little love tap
all right let's go check it out we'll
see where it ends okay
all right so obviously we got this
awesome spread here um can you talk
about while we're chilling here I mean
how long does it roughly take for the
actual robot to get here uh this one is
one of the shorter tracks so this one
should only take about 30 seconds 30 40
seconds okay yeah so you can actually
hear it's honest we're right now coming
out from the kitchen it's right that
thing yeah oh man this is cool it's like
I can see it so what we just grab the
stuff off of it all right we got some
Hawaiian steak here man this is a
teriyaki pork chop oh that's that of
Hawaiian bacon bacon here's my shrimp
and it's dipping sauce that's actually
the dipping sauce olive wine yeah well
I'm just gonna eat on everything so can
you also talk about you know we saw how
we sent it out but what is someone like
the technology of all I know you're
using tablets over there um how does it
actually know exactly where to stop and
then it start it's just it just left
yeah so we actually have timers that are
set up so it's either by a timer or
there's actually putting on the little
green button once you press that it'll
be ones way back but in terms of how it
knows where to go so everything is pre
map so each robot goes on a different
track and then those okay I need to you
know walk three feet to lab you know
walk one foot here and then I'll stop
right at the table and this everything
is pre-programmed so once you press
something it should stop right in the
window and then thanks so much for your
time day we appreciate it and we gonna
grub yeah all right cool
alright David thanks so much for this
meal of course you know it's like you
have all the cool technology here but
obviously it comes down to the food
right you got you got to deliver on the
goods therefore if you know that's the
centerpiece of the experience so I'm
just gonna wrap it up
I'm not call bait her I'm great I'm
gonna be gonna hope he did it he
actually did it he actually did it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
