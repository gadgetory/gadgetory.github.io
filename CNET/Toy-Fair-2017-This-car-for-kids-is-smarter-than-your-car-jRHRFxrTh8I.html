grown-ups
this electric go-kart for kids has
built-in Wi-Fi GPS collision detection
sensors and it can be remotely disabled
by mom and dad
using an app this is the arrow made by
active motors it's a start-up out of
Silicon Valley and the company was
showing off the tech at the New York Toy
Fair the idea behind the arrow is that
when your kid is ready to graduate from
those fisher-price Power Wheels though
on something with more speed and the
arrow can go up to 12 miles an hour but
for safety parents can use the app to
monitor the car speed or set a speed
limit the app also lets you set a
geofence boundary so if your kid travels
too far the cars gonna slow down to a
crawl until your little tight gets back
in the allowed driving zone if parents
are worried about junior getting into an
accident there is a collision sensor in
the front that's gonna stop the car if
it detects an object ahead but all of
this tech does not come cheap the arrow
starts at $1000 and if you want a silver
or red body kit shell and that's going
to be another $200 there are also some
accessories like this wheel ring cover
to help the Kart drift on asphalt and
there's other accessories in the works
like cones to track how fast you take
laps so this is designed for kids ages 5
to 9 but you know what there's nothing
stopping me from doing a test drive I
gotta try it out
let's go the recommended weight limit is
130 pounds so who's to say mom can't
have a little fun - well at least until
the battery runs out a standard battery
pack gets about 30 minutes to an hour of
drive time but there is a double
capacity battery option or you could
just buy a few battery packs and swap
them out so you don't have to put the
brakes on the fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
