to tomorrow daily ski talk show in the
known universe I'm actually skeleton I'm
Jeff kanata and we hope you're ready for
some rapid-fire headlines because here
they come we've covered anti drone
technology on the show but pug bother
with all that when you can just have an
eagle take it out of the sky the dutch
national police force is doing that
exact thing working with a company
called guard from above that trains
birds to take down drones the company
thinks this is a great way to joint
drones out of the sky when they're
flying where they're not supposed to and
in the video and Eagle captures a drone
takes it to a corner and guards it the
birds natural hunting instincts make it
a feasible option for taking down drones
so long as they aren't harmed by
propellers during captures Dutch police
are also looking at technological ways
to take drones out of the sky but
honestly why bother when you could have
a fleet of eagles you know that there's
one to be won eagle that just falls in
love with the drone right yeah and then
there's gonna be another eagle that is
about to retire and then it's so old for
this yeah exactly
hey what do you do if you are running
out of roads there's too much traffic
well if you're the Swiss you go
underground this idea is called cargo
suit terrain and the idea is super
futuristic trucks drop off cargo at
weigh stations cargo gets loaded into
autonomous cargo modules that travel in
the tunnel between cities smaller
packages would travel above the cargo
modules on a kind of delivery monorail
once the cargo arrives at the proper
location they're transferred to a small
urban vehicle for delivery the build
starts with a for city connection and
would expand from there so this is still
just a concept but the idea is out there
and it's gonna cost a lot 3.4 billion is
the current price tag do you think this
is worth an underground series of
tunnels to get stuff to people having
autonomous cargo yes get out your
checkbooks everybody let's have
Underground cargo ok so those are our
two stories for today I think we need to
pick what story we're gonna deep dive
into on Thursday's show which is
hour-long for show
I vote for underground car Motel I'm
fascinated by this idea I totally think
so so tune in on Thursday we'll be
talking more about this cargo tunnel
idea yes and if you'd like to talk about
it you can hit us up on Twitter with the
hashtag hey TD yeah shout at us and if
we like what you did what you say we'll
incorporate it into our discussion on
Thursday yeah and with that said let's
check out our photogra for the day our
phone talker for the day today is Dutch
yell and I hope I pronounced that right
who took this picture with their iPhone
5s that is indeed a beautiful Mountain
