communicator an iPod a phone are you
getting it and we are calling it iPhone
well the day that the iPhone was
announced I was actually at WWDC at
Moscone Center in San Francisco and you
have to remember this is the time where
Macworld was really the true showcase
the only event we saw once a year is
Declan McCullagh hoarding for CNN from
the Macworld show floor in San Francisco
well we're here today to do is to try to
catch a glimpse of the new Apple iPhone
that you can see it's behind glass this
holy object is surrounded by eager
onlookers well I was there for working
for another company a case company and
we everyone knew that Apple was going to
release a phone I was the Apple reporter
at Bloomberg News the whole world was
waiting to see what was going to be
announced because you had to be in the
room to hear the news those things went
live webcast or audio cast there was a
lot of hype as to what it was going to
be I was rocking some type of Nokia flip
phone
my favorite phone at the time was the
sidekick my first cell phone was a
Motorola flip phone start act there was
a lot of speculation beforehand but why
Apple would even get into the phone
market the biggest thing that I remember
is just the fact that he had to re
explain to the audience like people
didn't couldn't make sense of it people
didn't know what it was and then when he
repeated himself then people started
flipping the cow right today Apple is
going to reinvent the phone and here it
is we're very excited about this you
know
I had an iPod I had a camera in my
pocket I had a flip phone so the idea of
having a device that became all of those
things was super appealing to me the
idea of being able to hop on the
internet from anywhere right from my
pocket with amazing features I was I was
most excited about the the touch screen
as silly as it sounds have your entire
music library for the most part on your
phone that was just unheard of like
before you could put maybe like 32 songs
on your phone so that is I was crazy I
convinced my wife to let me switch from
Sprint AT&amp;amp;T so that I could get an
iPhone there were massive problems with
18 T's partnership anybody who had an
early I phone you could do a lot of
things that look at this pretty device
but trying to get a phone call through
was a major challenge we still even to
this day have our same ATT unlimited
data plan 10 years later where are those
people that that hung on to that four
gigabyte model we're gonna price it at
that same $4.99 no premium whatsoever
we're gonna have an 8 gigabyte model for
just $5.99 I do have my iPhone and I
don't know where it is it's somewhere in
storage and I believe it has a cracked
screen and it's all beat up well the
funny thing about this is I have this
resting on my desk at home wow it's so
small wow this feels amazingly small
it's still beautiful it's lovely
what great design this literally changed
the game for all smart phones moving
forward and that that that in itself is
it's pretty special I never go anywhere
without my smart phone today and that I
think is Apple's biggest legacy to this
industry</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
