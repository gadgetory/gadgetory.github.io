that should be made into movies by now
you've probably heard that the Jungle
Cruise ride in Disney parks will be made
into a movie starting to wane the rock
Johnson so we got to think it what other
rides or attractions should be made into
movies to answer this question we asking
that's resident disney expert would you
carry for her help let's do this at
number five dinosaur this one is odd
because the ride has the name of a
Disney movie already but has nearly
nothing to do with that movie dinosaurs
original name was countdown to
extinction the story of the ride is
people taking time rivers back to the
past and then getting hijacked into
arriving to a time very close to when
that meteor showed up to wipe out the
most dominant life forms on Earth sounds
like a movie waiting to happen and
number four journey into imagination
with figment did you know there's a
comic book series about this already it
features the dream finder in a steampunk
kind of story and covers the origin of
the purple dragon known as figment the
movie could borrow from the comic books
and would be a period piece set in the
early 1900s and who wouldn't want to see
a purple CGI dragon and just look at
that dream finder Hugh Canadiens in my
imagination anytime at number three
Expedition Everest the story of this
ride there's a Yeti hiding in Mount
Everest of course explorers tread on his
domain this could be an awesome horror
movie or thriller with people being
picked off one by one by the Yeti is
that too dark for Disney movie what if
the big twist was that the Yeti was
secretly a fun-loving dancing disco Yeti
what if we didn't get into that moving
on and number two space mountain why
should this be a movie when it
essentially has no story that name it's
instantly recognizable it could be about
pretty much anything as long as there's
an element of space and perhaps a
mountain somewhere before we get to
number one an honorable mention goes to
it's a small world listen to the lyrics
it's a world of laughter a world of
Tears it's a world of hope in a world of
fears this movie is clearly about a
territorial dispute or an alien invasion
that makes us as humans aware
it's a small world after all like
Independence Day and now it's time for
number one take it away Bridget number
one is obviously the Enchanted Tiki Room
this classic attraction has all the
ingredients for a blockbuster for
fun-loving multicultural singing bird
friends living in a tropical hideaway
running the club with nightly
entertainment but of that rascal Pierre
gets into trouble when some Tiki magic
goes wrong you know the kids would just
eat that up and I would gladly buy all
the merchandising special thanks to
Bridget Carey for her expertise and we
all look forward to her future book on
Disney things for more top five check
