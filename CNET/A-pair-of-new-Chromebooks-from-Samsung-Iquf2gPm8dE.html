the samsung chromebook to you know the
current generation of Chromebooks a lot
of them look the same same features
costs about the same how do you stand
out from the crowd while samsung says
that it's the Chromebook 2 and the first
thing you notice they actually look
pretty different both the 11 inch and 13
inch sizes have this new design that's
kind of leathery looking and feeling
even though it's not it's got a got a
little stitch around the edge and that
really is kind of a different look than
a lot of the other low-cost Chromebooks
that we've seen inside there a couple of
changes as well they both have the
samsung exynos 5 processors slightly
different versions an upgraded one in
the 13-inch but different than the
Celeron juicy and a lot of the other
Chromebooks they've upgraded the ram 24
gigs which should be nice they still
have the same kind of small 16 gig solid
state hard drives but the whole idea of
a Chromebook is you're putting
everything on the cloud you don't need
to store a lot of stuff locally what I'm
most excited about is the fact that you
have a larger 13 inch version we've only
seen one 13 inch chrome book before now
and this guy actually has a 1920 x 1080
a full HD screen which is something I
don't think we've seen on the Chromebook
at least in this price range the 11 inch
version still has the regular 1366 x 768
screen now they're going to cost a
little bit more than the least expensive
Chromebooks out there the 11 inch this
is gonna be 319 which sounds like it's
going to be 2 99 it stores to me and 399
for the larger 13-inch one and they
should be out a little bit later in 2014
with the Samsung Chromebook to on Dan a
correct
you
