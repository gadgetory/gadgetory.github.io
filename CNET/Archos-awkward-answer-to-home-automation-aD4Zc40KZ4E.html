a review of the archos smart home
starter pack it includes this android
tablet to mini cameras to weather tags
and to movement tags you can place the
accessories around your house and pair
it to the tablet using bluetooth you can
also program the accessories to say if
this door opens then take a picture or
record video and you can also opt to
receive emails or push notifications
when an activity event occurs so let me
start with the good stuff the setup was
pretty straightforward pairing it to the
tablet was very simple and the
performance was pretty good too I never
lost connection between the devices and
the tablet and I got an alert every time
an event took place my main concern is
with the execution of this whole package
the archos tablet is really the hub of
the whole system then it claims to
function like a regular Android tablet
which it does in terms of software it
has all the components you can check
your email browse the Internet listen to
music all of that but it has this odd
stand in the back there taking a basic
archos android tablet and giving it all
of these smart home features and the
execution just feels really really
clunky and confusing because the whole
point of a tablet is its mobility right
so you can take it from room to room
maybe even take it on a trip with you
but using this tablet as the core
component that has to stay at home and
really can't leave your side table or
your coffee table is really confusing so
I just wish that archos would offer
these accessories separately for a more
entry-level option that makes a little
bit more sense that way you can use the
Android app on your tablet or phone and
access everything the way you can now
just without this odd stationary tablet
another thing I don't like is that the
app has two different connection options
one if you're on your home Wi-Fi where
the tablet is located and another if
you're on a remote connection so if
you're heading out for the day and want
to monitor what's going on in your house
on the app you have to go through a
completely different connect
process than you would when you're at
home and that just really over
complicates things thanks for watching
