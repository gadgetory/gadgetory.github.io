at Mobile World Congress here in
Barcelona and I bought one of the new
Galaxy S 9 phones with me don't worry
they know I have it and we are going to
unbox this together we're actually going
to unpack packet also because this is
how I brought it over here so come on
over we'll take a look
I actually wrapped it up in my scarf to
protect the edges from getting dinged in
my backpack and because it's a long way
from the convention center here to my
hotel so here we go we've got the galaxy
s 9 plus this is the 64 gigabyte version
and this is actually a UK edition I'll
be getting the US version later the box
is black it looks really similar in
design so far two previous galaxy models
you can see that the writing is this
sort of metallic blue that says s9 +
does that mean the phone is blue now
unfortunately it is midnight black but I
begged and pleaded for the purple
version or at least the coral blue color
or at least silver and we applied so it
will be a little bit hard to see some of
those details but we'll do the best that
we can here's the rest of the box you've
got your basic specs on the back not a
whole lot to see here anyway we're gonna
take the sleeve off just slides right
off here pop it down and you've got
again similar very similar box design it
kind of slides out through a tab on the
side and then it will unwrap let's
unwrap this and on the table it goes
okay
so now we've got the little tab if
information looks like there's a SIM
card holder in here as well so there's
our sim tool this is what we would use
to put the sim card in sorry Quick Start
Guide this is all the usual basic stuff
I'm not really excited about that
do not accept if the seal is broken okay
well we'll just keep going alright
tipping out the phone
I'm getting ahead of myself here the
phone is wrapped in plastic this is
always really satisfying seriously one
of my favorite parts it's taking off all
the plastic because I just cannot stand
it there so Oh interesting it's not
covering the edge see the sticker on the
back oh good oh good no residue there
very minimal that's kind of nice and
then I always check along the edges it
could take forever so the sticker on the
bottom it's kind of going around the
port's you can see there's still a
headset jack on this phone that's a
major selling feature for some in fact
Samsung took a Miss no opportunity to
make fun of Apple especially and other
phone makers that had skipped that jack
okay
so now we've got the phone it's
unwrapped you can see it's the s9 plus
because of the dual cameras on the back
the fingerprint sensor that's underneath
the display and then we of course have
the heartrate monitor over here there's
a new special feature not just takes
your heart rate but it can also kind of
check your blood pressure so that's new
there the exterior we have the big speed
button here on the side and no
unfortunately that cannot be mapped to
open any other apps Samsung wants that
for big speed only volume button a SIM
card holder for that SIM card tool that
will come out there power button along
the side and then the ports we talked
about so we've got a microphone down
here we've got the headset jack and
we've got the USBC port let's turn it on
startup screen pretty basic no fireworks
yet it's pretty usual graphic for Sam's
I wonder how much battery of this device
has right now getting started well while
we let that do its thing let's see what
what else is in the box so we've got the
little separator I mentioned okay I
guess this is a European charger here we
go so that's an adaptive fast charging
so this will be fast charging for the
phone it is of course wires wirelessly
chargeable as well but you'll have to
buy that charging pad after the fact
here we've got a USB connector so USBA
on one side two USB see these actually
come in handy more often than you would
think
alright further destroying the box
nothing there want the good stuff I want
the headset this is an AKG wired headset
to go with that wired headset jack
Samsung acquired the company and which
is why these better than average way
better than average headsets come with
the phone otherwise they retail for
about $100 there are little stickers on
the ends of these two and since I really
don't like stickers I'm just gonna pull
those off as well because why not
on the sound front one of the things the
s9 + and s9 come with and it's dolby
software on there that will make the
phone sound a lot better when you use
not a headset but the speaker at the top
and then a microphone at the bottom but
if you do want to plug in there you go
comes right in the box we also have a
couple two other ear tip sizes we just
had a little mini crash there but we
have to x-ray at your tip sizes in case
the ones that come on the end are too
big or too small and finally there is a
USB a 2 C cable so this is what you are
going to plug it in to your charging
brick and then plug that in the wall and
of course I like it when they're not
attached because you can use this for
any number of things
take out the cable you know stick it
into your computer charger phone that
way or just connect it to transfer files
so that is pretty much it for the
unboxing I've made a mess of things I'm
going to go and set up this phone and
then we will be back with more
comparisons live between the galaxy s 9
plus and the galaxy s 8 tune in for more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
