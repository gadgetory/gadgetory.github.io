Rosenblatt and this is the show where we
show off some of the hottest mobile apps
around I've got three top-notch Android
security apps for you to check out each
with different strengths
first off we're checking out the free
lookout which has gained a lot of
popularity and media attention thanks to
its lost phone location service if your
phone gets lost or stolen you can jump
on to lookouts website and assuming your
phone is on and has battery life and the
GPS enabled you can track your phone's
location this is a must-have feature for
phones the service has been used by
police to track stolen phones you can
also fire off a car alarm style scream
from your missing phone to let you know
where it is or to annoy whoever's stolen
it
lookout also offers contacts backup and
adds photo backup when you upgrade to
the premium version for about 30 bucks a
year look how its main feature though is
its scanning technology if the company
is working on something that calls the
app Genome Project which verifies as
safe thousands of apps across multiple
marketplaces and checks your apps as you
download them next up we've got windows
security powerhouse AVG which recently
bought its way into the Android
Marketplace by picking up Israeli firm
droid security the app does many of the
same things that lookout does and it has
more features in the free version than
look out the free AVG antivirus for
Android has a password-protected app
Locker and lost phone locator too it's
not as polished as lookouts though in
fact the apps entire interface isn't as
polished as lookouts with a main screen
that's too simple where are the rest of
the options still AVG Antivirus is back
up is more robust in the free version
that lookouts with contacts SMS system
settings and app settings backup
although even the paid upgrade doesn't
offer photo backup its premium version
is a lot cheaper though at 10 bucks for
a year lastly we've got Trend Micro's
mobile security app which takes a
completely different approach along with
the scan the company has ported its
Smart Protection Network for guarding
against phishing attacks to Android it
only works in the default browser for
now but that's a start there's no phone
locator service although there
our parental controls and call and text
message blocking for those you can use a
whitelist or a blacklist Trend Micro's
app isn't free instead of coming with a
30-day trial after what you'll have to
shell out four bucks to get protected
all three of these apps are recommended
although lookout does the best job at
the moment of offering a strong combo of
usability features and protection that's
it for this week's show and if you've
got any suggestions bang them on over to
tap that app at cnet.com I'm Seth
Rosenblatt and we'll see you next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
