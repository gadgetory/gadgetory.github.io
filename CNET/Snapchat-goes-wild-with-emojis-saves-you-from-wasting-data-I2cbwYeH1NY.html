Bridget Carey
this is your CNET update the quirky
messaging app snapchat has added new
ways to use emoji in your video and
photos and it updated the app to be less
of a data drain when you're traveling so
first up you can now stick as many emoji
icons as you want all over your photo or
video post you are now free to go a moji
crazy click the new icon on top to
select your emoji you can resize them
like usual for text or drag it up to the
trash can to delete before you can only
add emoji inside of a string of text and
now they're more like stickers separate
from text if you find snapchat to be a
huge drain on your mobile data plan
there's now a setting called travel mode
in your settings click on manage under
additional services and you can turn on
travel mode to disable it from auto
loading content when you're not on Wi-Fi
that way you can pick and choose what
you want to load instead of it trying to
read everything this is for both iOS and
Android for the next update you can
expect to see something about trophies
for about a day there was this fluke or
snapchat had this page for trophies that
you can collect almost like game
achievements I missed it but a few
screenshots taken by the next web and
Business Insider do show the future
before it was removed now if you
download the app now you won't see it
probably because it wasn't ready to be
launched yet snapchat says it has a
hundred million users a day and 65
percent of those people are posting a
video or photo on their accounts every
day comscore data backs up what we
already know that the app is very
popular with a younger demographic so
you can expect snapchat to be a big part
of the social media campaigns for the
u.s. presidential candidates because
they have to try to look cool to win the
vote of the young people yo Democratic
frontrunner Hillary Clinton announced
her snapchat account over the weekend it
has a ghostie pantsuit icon that you can
scan to see her posts like this one of
her about to talk to a crowd how
exciting her username is Hillary Clinton
as one word she's one of the latest to
join but there are plenty of other
social snappers on the Republican side
such as Senator Rand Paul who already
posted three
ads on snapchat his username is Senator
Rand Paul and New Jersey Governor Chris
Christie is on there too as Christie dot
2016 you see they're all posting videos
and photos that disappear within 24
hours but it's not easy to search and
find these candidates you have to know
their exact username on snapchat in
order to add them others with accounts
include Carly Fiorina Lindsey Graham
Martin O'Malley Rick Perry and Marco
Rubio for the generation in the 90s
reaching young voters was about going on
MTV
then came YouTube now it's snapchat and
periscope that's it for this tech news
update and there's more news for you to
snap up at cnet.com from our studios in
New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
