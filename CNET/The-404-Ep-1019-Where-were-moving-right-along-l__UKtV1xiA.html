honking nose to and like those teeth no
he I'm not gonna lie hahahaha surprised
you're going in that direction I'm
sitting okay is he supposed to be
something like a monster dizzy just I
think he's just like a troll did he talk
or did he grunt aux yeah he the things
that come out of his mouth oh don't
really go in line with what he sort of
looks like yeah I mean right like look
how terrifying this guy was a gentle
giant I remember he wasn't like tearing
anybody apart no no he didn't rip any
Muppets heads off like he seemingly
should given his terrifying stature yeah
whether he will one day he will one day
he'll kill us all uh yeah my favorite is
the dr. honeydew the only occasion
Muppet i'll try to convince these guys
before the show started he's clearly
Asian I don't think it's fair saying
he's asian Rihanna understand you can
say that not insult your own race he's
wearing a pocket protector his skin is
yellow he has no eyes but yet still
wears glasses are you sure also because
we're the pub protector yeah I've war
pocket petition for ten years of my life
he could just be like a student at MIT
yeah yeah what they're all asian the
gross majority of students the Asian
people have eyes this guy does not have
eyes I know so let's stereotype trying
to get away from that we are trying to
get away what about you Richard who's
your favorite Muppet um I like Grover
from Sesame Street great he's good guy
he's hilarious he's
stand up guy feel like you can trust him
yeah you know he was always like the one

bullets Grover's voice like is a kind of
hard to imprison I can't remember it I
can't draw it from memory right now kind
of gravely it yeah but those are good
Muppets all around all right enough
muppet talk for today getting around
yeah what you ever have a friend that
really looks like one though like really
looks like one to the point where you're
like you don't even tell them because
telling them would be such an insult
yeah it just happened you and sweetums
no I had one in college okay you know
the one I don't want to do it I'm gonna
do it on the off chance that some did he
move his neck like a muffin don't really
know yeah long eyelashes was in the band
oh okay the animal ya know Anna was a
heart of the she oh she had a lot of her
she was furry yeah at a mustache which
Muppet did she look like Susan I don't
know the name of the Muppet oh no is it
the one that looks like she always has
plastic surgery yes ah what is her
hippie later yeah I know exactly who
you're talking about gonna talk like
this yeah oh my god that's insulting
yeah what the who is that uh I forget
what her there she is uh I feel like
they're comparing her to Darrell hi
Janice Janice Janice is her name yes
she's a relatively new character but
she's always the lead singer in the band
right she had like Botox yeah lipos I
mean she she's all lips yeah she's funny
beautiful she is pretty hot all right
good Janice you guys are just disgusting
okay let's move it on uh we are moving
right along as the show title claims
talk about this this to me because I
don't know what this really means okay
we're talking about a certain
demographic on Facebook right yeah what
is it us we've talked a lot about
advertising on Facebook before of course
this website pc
pro on their base out of the UK that
this really cool feature uh running
right now that sort of talks about how
social networks have sold your privacy
online and uh I feel like whenever we
talk about advertising on Facebook we
always there's always a misconception
that Facebook sells your information uh
directly to advertisers but that's not
true they actually give advertisers the
option to sell to a specific demographic
um that they'll give based on you know
what people click on facebook so that's
interesting so you're saying got this
advertisement so annoying by the way why
do go to this PC Pro thing all those are
the words like out I hate those look I'm
clicking the X right now but anyway it
seems to work real well what is armed so
you're saying that Facebook does not
necessarily harvest your information yet
they don't sell exactly who you are
right your personality to advertisers
okay if advertisers wanna buy space on
facebook they'll be like okay well if
you want to sell you know you're like a
club do you wanna sell to like 20 to 25
year old gotcha 30 year olds whatever
they're more or less lumped into a
demographic is and then your collective
demographic is then sold right okay I
cannot I feel much better about stuff
like that yeah but this is an
interesting article is it talks about
how certain demographics may be worth
more than okay that's that's logical and
they're saying that you know targeting
single gay men in certain areas may
actually be more lucrative for companies
like they talk about a night club based
out of the UK where gay men it can are
actually worth 2.5 times more than the
general public because of the
specificity of that Democrats a lot yeah
two point five right that's a lot and
this is based on how much like how much
the worth in terms of the drinks that
gay men tend to buy at bars really and
they compare that to straight bars
apparently there's more worth there I
don't know these are just like very
specific markets that they're doing
about in the ad yeah this is kind of
interesting like I don't know if you
wanted to buy it out you can I didn't
realize you could do that yeah I didn't
know you can like shop by brand right
you know you can sort of be like well
why don't you give me 30 for 250 single
moms I'll take a little bit of
the this over there right you know but
that's what's so appealing to facebook
because i guess they're the only ones
that have such specific information
about people yeah chat rooms asking but
is the data protected from Facebook
itself what does that mean what does
that mean I data protected oh maybe like
the actual specific the specifics of the
members of a certain demographic I don't
know I don't know I'm sure they'll hold
all that in for it makes sense that they
wouldn't give everything out to all the
advertisers though cuz that's really
where Facebook's money lies yeah for
sure their treasure it's that it's their
particle yeah huh so what demographic
would you belong to I mean aside from
like thee guess now you're 30 to 40 no
that's not change demographic of
demographic in that you and all of us
are currently in is 25 to 34 okay it
goes it that's how it goes it goes okay
yes you know more about advertising than
I do what other Demel that's that's
that's a commonly sectioned off age
demographic okay and then I think it
goes 35 to 45 and then it doesn't matter
because you're not you're you're dead
after right kidding and before that
there's between demographic sure the
like there must be like sequence 3024
yeah 24 to 30 25 to 34 is like I feel
like the bread and butter for a lot of
right you know uh campaigns and whatnot
but that's what we'd all fall into male
male and male maybe yeah we all also
fall into the same tax bracket as well
probably and where we work based so we
get fed literally nothing we get no ads
fed to us yeah yeah just all credit ads
yeah absolutely so they say it's 45 to
60 and then 82 101 that's a joke yeah we
need a 101 what are they selling to them
uh called new glasses new teeth the
ability not to walk into a glass door
like that I spent like an hour watching
people walk into glass doors on YouTube
yesterday there's so many compilations I
talked to I do I every Tuesday I do
three radio hits in the studio here yeah
and the woman I talked with in Florida
Wendy summers her name is you know she's
she's kind of maybe leaning more towards
like a conserve
behavior and I you know I curbed my my
presentation right with her my demeanor
Korkut and you know she comes on she's
asked me about this poor woman and here
i am thinking like Oh Wendy's gonna be
like oh I feel terrible for me while
she's like was that not the funniest
thing I've ever heard and I'm like yeah
she's an idiot like but if it was your
grandma and you were with her at the
time I'd cry and laugh at this yeah i'm
sorry even if it was my grandma I'd
still laugh maybe one falling down
always worth it's the same reason on
America's Funniest Home Videos you left
when the baby falls off the slide right
you know she didn't die she she didn't
die hitting there's no legal permanent
scarring or injury yeah it's just fun
okay this is awesome what else is fun
Marshall amps yeah so this is cool so
Marshalls been branching off in their
product lines recently last year i
reviewed two of their headphones and
they have the Marshall majors which are
the over years and have an in-ear brand
to write this is cool recently they just
announced a marshal half stack mini
fridge mmm this is awesome evangelist
coming to every single university in the
United States for sure uh you guys all
know a mini fridges right of course like
the combination freezer refrigerator
usually find them in hotels dorm room
stuff like that my apartment your
apartment you have two of them I've one
unfortunately you have only the
refrigerator part a loafer educate
replaced with this this is cool so uh
it's designed to look like that classic
Marshall half stack amplifier that you
have a staple in like the you know live
music performance is sick uh it's
awesome the details on it pretty minor
it's just holds about 4.4 cubic feet of
beer yeah not even sure what that means
what's cubic feet of beer I don't even
know like how much beer that would be
yeah I've never done the math on cubic
beer yeah well they can hold about that
which I'm assuming is a couple six-packs
sure if cans but six packs of soda in
there yeah it's awesome hold that uh
that classic freezer on the top shelf
yeah we can probably put about like half
gallon of ice cream that's so it's not
an end not a nap no it's like one of
those false doors makes it look like
he kind of wish they could somehow
figure out a way to maybe and when I saw
this I was like oh my god this is
brilliant because how many times have
you seen a band and everyone on stage is
drinking beer right and they have no
place to put the beer top again yeah but
you can't though because the ABS vibrate
and they'll sort of like very slowly you
know go over the side we can watch this
video for a little bit if you want but I
feel like they should have some sort of
beer cooling apparatus on the top of a
marshal aunt ah you're not saying yeah
that's that I mean come on and they had
that technology to Eva's but even our
front desk guy yeah he has one of those
uh portable can coolers yeah took a USB
can cooler well what's the problem let's
figure out a way to combine Marshall
refrigerated India am page and stuff
like that I'm just saying it would also
be cool if you control the temperature
of the freezer and refrigerator using
the volume pitched out that would be
sick so I mean there's a lot more ideas
we could throw around yeah for sure
you've been to my apartment before I
have one of these half stacks
refrigerator just pathetic it's crazy
because I'm not the only one in New York
it's a very common thing it sort of is
but I mean it's for studio apartment
today exactly yeah but when I looked at
the apartment and the broker was showing
it to me she's like yeah you know it's
only a half refrigerator you can't stick
much in there but you know what it just
means that you can eat fresh you have to
eat fresh God why is that that's how
they tried to spin it yeah that's how
they the telly ration line yeah like I
could see that it's a half refrigerant
yeah I don't have to market it to me in
a way that I have to eat fresh everybody
a whole how dare this guy with the
common vernacular with the real estate
brokers in Manhattan yeah so it only
holds the freshest vegetables because
they'll go bad what you should really
say is oh hey it's a good thing it's
only a half fridge because let's be
honest you're in a place like this you
can't afford to fill up a full fridge
anyway exactly that's the reality of it
all she was like oh you know there's a
lot of great restaurants around here and
you have to eat it fresh yeah it's fine
you later even use the refrigerator eat
me and I have it she's right what's you
nail it up yeah we have a hard time like
do you have a hard time like filling it
up um I mean yeah
what's in there right now hook a lot at
home there's a lot of digiorno pizzas oh
not a frozen vegetables so disgusting I
know what are you I can't I get that too
ice cube trays you get digiorno pizza
Manhattan us a little bodega your way
with me Oh dig I get it that's
ridiculous speaking of ridiculous a
Indiana high school student has been
expelled not suspended expelled removed
permanently from the school for tweeting
a profane tweet yeah so you've been
hearing a lot about like Facebook
employers or employers checking your
Facebook sure hiring sure yeah and then
people getting in trouble for like you
know bad tweets mostly being hearing a
lot about that work recently but this is
out of Garrett high school in Indiana
this senior was about three months away
from graduating kid named austin Carol
yeah when he apparently put out this
tweet that was sort of like George
Carlin's joke on the f-word anfom eyes
these words but he's a seven dirty words
basically he's like f is one of those
effing words you can effing put anywhere
in an effin sentence and it's still
effing makes sense that was my senior
quote in a yearbook yeah but he actually
wrote out the you CK's afterward yeah uh
he claims that he sent out this tweet
from home yeah from his home computer
the school's claiming that it was done
from the school computer in the lab okay
and that was why they expelled him right
expelled him from school uh after he
sent us out three months before
graduation now it does seem am I wrong
that the tweet seems to have been sent
at two thirty in the morning to thirty
in the morning yes what was he wasn't in
school at two thirty in the morning so
what gives school maintains that the
tweets came from the IP address attached
to the computers in the lab that doesn't
make any so I don't know this sounds
like something that iced tea would need
to come in and so for her like a law and
order i I don't know and if it did come
know if it came from school that makes
expulsion it's a violation of school
rules and I'm sure so notified about
that before using the
horse manure there's no way a child
should be expelled for cursing yeah for
cursing for sending out a tweet I just
don't I had teachers in high school that
would drop f-bombs all the time didn't
you right yeah of course by the teacher
who told my journalism class yeah and
you call by his first name is that guy
it was like hey Joe go after yourself
and be like right back at you bakalar
yes whatever you know healthy
relationship but it's not that's a nice
giving take that right of all kidding
aside it wasn't like a thing where he's
like f this school at this deer run out
or like I'm gonna kill everyone yeah
back tomorrow was had no hostility
behind it yeah purely uh don't know
comedy crash yeah but you know what
though I'm gonna argue the other side
and say that expulsion doesn't
necessarily mean that he can't graduate
in three months just means that he has
to enroll in a different school outside
of the district but the amount of stress
and and crap and bureaucracies now gonna
have to deal with in red tape it's not
fair for doing that when there are kids
would change those in school like what
let's be honest let's go did you go to
I'm just saying like you know I I know
this is just language and honest opinion
we need to go back in history and see if
maybe he has you know like la history
yeah you know like doing makeup tweeting
bed of the potty mouth negative tweets
or maybe if he had gotten suspended
before one same thing when I was a
junior in high school right I was how
did it go in your high school with you
guys like get to school and there was a
little time before homeroom right you
sort of mess around in the hallway a
little bit lawyers and breakdancing okay
on like a cardboard box or something
yeah that sounds cool so I i was hanging
at one time my junior year and i was
outside of a classroom and the classroom
i was outside of when i was messing
around my friends was a was a teacher
who had very it was very conservative
strict the Strickland of ours of our
school like from back to the future
right right right so I was you know in
high school your mouth is filthy if this
affect every other word out of your
mouth eeee ssss see you know yeah it's
literally a through z so yeah I'm be
I have a potty mouth perhaps ooh still
not really uh all sudden I feel someone
grabbing on my shirt from behind it's
the teacher he's like I heard you from
within my classroom you've got some
mouth on you sorry I get in my class hmm
so I'm like all right so he's the na
literally yells at me for for what
seemed like 25 minutes yeah just telling
me how having that voice will get me
nowhere in life and then the second I
leave high school I find out everyone in
their mother curses and that's a like
you know what I mean like it was just
like what are you really trying to
accomplish seeing what are you buttwater
what like when you come down someone for
language what are you saying you're
saying that if you speak like that all
the time then you might risk not getting
a job you know that's not that's present
that's the my gosh you comfortable using
it and use it as you know like kids in
high school use the effort as filler
when they can't think of another thing
that is not the message he was conveying
there he was not saying look you're
writing will really suffer and your
vocabulary will really suffer what would
you say he was just be down to educate
rocky old man when you cuss a lot well
you know what that's what it would
that's the the the the discussion wasn't
about you know anything philosophical he
wasn't chastising a 30-year old man this
is when you were probably 16 17 which
all fine I understand we're not funky
were that is if you're in high school
yeah you know my shirt did say you know
screw you all yeah just saying though
real life is not g-rated right and bad
words are said all the time that's how
it goes the president curses all the
time you find out God bid a teacher
actually gets involved and cares about
his students it's that was not again
better that was not a caring thing that
siding with this is the little bit of an
hour I have slacker yeah he might he
basically called me a slacker so anyways
getting back to this story there was
some research done on this guy's history
and apparently he fought to wear a kilt
on Irish holidays which is not
incendiary but he has a history of going
against Authority good he was also
warned about sending questionable tweets
on school issued computers before so I
mean this wasn't his first effect if he
has a history of the sort of behavior
and they've and they've sort of said
look dude you're pushing it you know
three strikes you're out maybe something
like that okay Buddha then maybe maybe
suspend the kid for a week yeah see how
he likes that see how he likes not
having come to school for a week yes on
suspended before I was threatened with
it a lot what did you do I just I just
did I just didn't care about people who
thought they had Authority I didn't care
okay I could see that just don't care
right you know I don't know I feel like
when you reach a certain age is sort of
see through the BS right you know what I
mean I I got in trouble in high school
for selling mix cds and like popular
like Britney Spears cities or 90 degrees
you would burn them and using those
popular yeah because in high school um
this was what back in like the year 2000
not every computer came with a DVD
burner and sure me and my friends bought
an external one that right up to likes
pretty incriminating but you want to
continue this say just kidding afterward
yeah okay grab everything okay I'm just
kidding about a rare but yeah so we
would go with a list of new music that
we had out that we had downloaded off
like bizarre whatever I read chat rooms
and then we would let people choose
whatever they wanted for five dollars
right these are like you know
pre-recorded CDs right but for ten
dollars you can give us a list of 12
tracks and we'd look those up
individually and then burn them to a CD
the next day right it's very cool
nothing the school caught wind of that
and shut it down right and you got
suspended returns with suspension if you
continue selling these on campus you
know I think they just wanted to cut I
think that's one juice today we're like
look if we give you twenty percent yeah
we don't ax yeah they're like no they're
like no 40 proposed I also give me that
98 degrees I don't understand what
threatening suspension does you know in
in the way to me wart you know a
deviancy why was it like what if I keep
acting the way and then act I don't have
to come to school yeah cool sign me up
no but that I mean and that's a very one
track markers look at it cuz then if you
miss an update school you'll have to
return for another year right now I
understand just terrible it was
something like 25 days though yeah like
you had that was the cut offer for
having to repeat a grade mm-hmm let's
take a break by the way I was just
kidding about all that me I'm sure that
never happened let's take a break but
I mean let's be honest though no you
know you should always question
authority respectfully and politely sure
is the way I think the way to do it I
guess so now for you know I mean to a
degree to a degree if they're doing
something bad no violence no no no bad
stuff like that don't break the law
right and anonymize your tweets kids
don't send out quote those tweets where
the the username that just like is your
full name where was your IP slaughter do
ya come on be smart about these things
all right we'll take a break more 404
and how you can help destroy working
right after this this is the 404 mr
effers the show where we all sing songs
purina in Paestum are a pizza caso kah
you
oh hey welcome back to 404 hello hello
welcome to the 404 Clary Larry ah bother
me we we got an interesting story that
will get to right away okay it's the
conversation that comes up all the time
in my circles okay I don't know about
yours where we going with this where we
go with this well we're talking about
how closely related android phones and
condoms are there's a lot in common I
think so well first of all people feel
embarrassed buying them at the store
what is that is good though that might
not be the story the real story is that
the names the nomenclature that
companies used to name both condoms at
least according to a marketing executive
he's claiming that those two have the
same criteria for nomenclature and they
all adhere to these seven
characteristics so Android phones and
condoms must all be named with with
distinction it must be short yep
appropriate easy to sign no not short
well not like physically sure sure what
so much sure easy to spell yeah and
pronounced likable extendable and undone
and flavored know uh extendable and you
could say flavor do cuz android phones
out like the contextually speaking sure
and protectable yeah so they must be
secure and then looking through a list
of android names uh this is funny they
kind of made like a bingo chart of is it
a condom name or is it an android name
so some of them have both like for
example sensation yeah touch cruise
wildfire apparently is also a condom
name wildfires with android phone name
yeah whenever you use the word fire i'm
kind of thinking that's the furthest
thing gonna be from my crotch yeah
unless your redheaded indulge intensity
by talent eyetality is good too
oh but then there's also some android
phone names that aren't condoms names
condom names yeah maybe should be
probably things like electrified admire
can I say my favorite one yes it
transform ultra oh yeah how was that not
economy replenish replenish it was that
not a kind of factory period den indulge
makes sense rumor touch Rupert yeah
that's an android phone when was that an
android phones weird that is a weird ass
list I'll tell you that cruise control
is a condom but not an android phone
that makes sense yeah cuz wheat yeah Lee
this condom is elite it's weird I should
be more Android that I'll beat I need a
cigarette yeah good um yeah so I was
also reading this article the other day
that also has to do with Dom's and I
heard an interesting fact that might
melt your face as much as it did mine
with pina you mean with the pinay okay
with the doms mom I never heard that
ever saw it's like shortening where
anyway okay uh turns out that Magnum
condoms yeah Trajan mag I know this but
your ganar not larger correct and any
other condom right the circumference of
the circle sure is the same as every
other condom length the length of the
condom itself is exactly the same the
only difference is that the packaging is
gold right and it comes in a black box
and it's more money and it's more money
and the only thing bigger there is your
freaking ego yeah and that's it that's
that isn't that crazy yeah did you know
this Richard I did not know that magnum
condoms like traditional ease supposedly
they're bigger right for the more well
endowed man same as everyone else it's
pure marketing techniques sure is that
is nuts to me that is not very
surprising to me though it's not know
because most human beings anatomically
speaking fall into a very specific range
okay and the fine people at trojan and
whatever you know rave realize this and
they're able to accommodate right one
size fits all why would you make a
condom that's only good for the you know
whatever the higher sure I don't
no doesn't make sense I don't know it's
like putting a hula hoop on a pencil
yeah it just doesn't it just waited I'm
just met with you buddy and so people
that are really that huge and they need
something a lot i think the rubber just
stretches more to accommodate freaking
latex man it's like good to on that's
what I yeah but it's but it's it's chad
latex is latex for a reason it's a
synthetic material that's true and it
conforms to any shape and size you know
whose fault this is Ludacris Ludacris is
the official spokesperson for trojan
magnum condoms in this entire time he's
been lying to meijer yeah yeah that's
message I wasn't lying to your ass okay
that's any prejudice it just wasn't
wasn't wagging his finger at your behind
wasn't come on man yeah it's whole time
I thought it was like a rap star but
apparently I'm not imes I don't know
what to tell you all right I don't today
you want these magnums then we're not
gonna talk about that at all go to the
bodega we will talk about though real
quick little bit of gaming news I
thought was important to relay to all of
our gamer friends out there HBO GO very
huge service awesome service hitting
xbox live today I believe so you
definitely want to check that out
especially catch up what it do what i'm
going to do catch up on game of thrones
before it starts on sunday i have not
started that yet you should i don't
watch it but i heard its really heard
it's awesome are you haven't seen i have
not there's only i believe there's 10
episodes i gotta watch them all but you
know in a reasonable amount of time
before the second season really starts
to get deep right arm so there's that
and then there's an interesting
statistic coming out today saying that
the majority of people on xbox live
stream video as opposed to playing
multiplayer think about that yeah think
about how many people are on with call
of duties and all that stuff and then
think about that number being eclipsed
by those who watch streaming video
online right that blows my mind are you
that surprised though I mean yesterday
we supposed to talk about a story about
how online streaming films like on
netflix or hulu whatever have overtaken
numbers going to overtake DVD and
blu-ray
before the end of the year I don't know
that's pretty insane I mean in your
personal life you do more streaming then
no I think it's equal oh no in terms of
just movies and content sure right I'm
I'm streaming much more than I am buying
dvds and going to the theater sure
absolutely no no comparison so anyway
speaking of movies that no one's going
to see uh the Ninja Turtle saga
continues just want to touch on this
real quick we joke the other day we're
like hey you know Michael Bay's new
interpretation of a ninja turtle
shouldn't even have the nin have the
teenage or the mutant right it turns out
well guess what the new Ninja Turtles
movie due out in December of 2013
actually does not have teenage or mutant
in the title just just called ninja
turtles so guess what this isn't even
the same Bryant it's not the same
franchisee far as I'm concerned right
this has nothing to do this is just
about different turtles who happen to
have ninja abilities she just call it
really eat pizza though that's really my
main thing well it anchovies on pizza
they'll learn to love it yeah they'll
learn to love it is what I the only
thing I can understand a lot of the key
bebop and Rocksteady well I don't know
those will probably wind up being some
other sort of alien freak thing but a
caller did calling yesterday saying hey
guys don't forget kraang was an alien to
shredder that's great impression it's
terrible Oh kraang was an alien from a
planet not of our own right so it sort
of falls in line is from Dimension X
Emily Dimension X yeah same as the
neutrinos remember those do middle like
Mohawk characters yeah so hey if it
works it works yeah I think we can move
on officially until the movie comes out
in a year and a half boob all over and
we will it'll be the biggest grossing
film since avatar and we will have given
it zero stars before we hit a couple
calls man by the way that Ninja Turtles
movie isn't coming out for a while it's
gonna come out December 25th yeah that's
what I said cuz we're 13 that's that's
crazy long time this one's a long wait
that's how long it takes to make a sting
pellicer
it's got a cook in the oven aha let's
actually get the calls right now time to
show the love 86 404 scenic all right
calls from the public today sort of a
weird question not sure how genuine it
is but nevertheless you are our resident
headphone expert okay someone's got a
question that only you can answer yes
yes well for four at the question for
Justin you I'm trying to buy some
headphones over the ear headphones and
that I'm going on a trip soon like
tomorrow and I'm trying to forget what
it was about the bose 8ae to think or
the OE Tucson Eclipse edge one image
something one image one so you please
help me out we appreciate it and where
the heck is a little bit shut up first
of all you idiot I hope he's joking i
think he is let's um let's give him some
advice uh so i believe the two in a very
weird way of bright things sound like
names someone was feeding him this
information yeah i don't know where he
was getting that from but i think i am
able to translate what he's trying he's
talking about the eclipse image ones
which are an over ear headphone versus
the bose AE tues which are another over
your headphone i would go for the
klipsch image ones actually uh unless
you want a really noise cancelling when
it sounded like he is gonna be traveling
with these headphones on you want a
better sound more natural sounding a
soundscape go with the klipsch image
ones and they're also cheaper there a
buck 50 I believe the AE tues you have
to get over like 179 people of that I
still to this day yeah I mean say what
you will about the quality of their
products and talking about Bose right
they have somehow convinced and there's
similar to Apple my opinion how they've
elite eyes their brand to the point
where people just automatically
associate high quality with it but it's
nothing tangible though they claim that
there's a bose sound right no it is that
a lot holy subjective and while
would you want a both sound if the
artist is increasing for that yeah all
you want to hear uh you know box
infinite yeah here's the bose version
it's like the same reason why i don't
want to know what dr. dre wants me to
true it's true you know it's the same
reason interesting but yeah so i would
go with the klipsch image ones um thanks
for the call sir if you'd like to
participate 866 404 seen it also

about the show tomorrow and Tony getting
excited having a mom want to certain
people are you that's crazy he's quickly
becoming you know one behind fresh dick
yeah look at the Alec Baldwin yeah so
far Tom Hanks in the ain't Martin until
the August I'll go I like that so yeah
talk it up and we'll have plenty of
stuff to talk about with him tomorrow
before we get out of here one last story
I want to bring up real quick and see
what we think about this the weinstein
company it's releasing a film called
bully uh-huh have you heard about this
for a bully deals with teenage bullying
in high school and you know growing up
okay uh they have actually decided to
release this film unrated it's pretty
unprecedented uh and the same sort of
thing happened with a film called this
film is not yet rated that came out I
want to say about six seven years ago
right got the nc-17 rating the problem
with this film is that the directors and
producers and writers wanted it to come
out with a pg-13 rating but the mpaa in
their infinite wisdom declared that it
had to have an R rating just due to
language write a whole topical language
again coming out full circle but this
the language isn't part of I mean it's
part of the story about bullying because
I think about the words bullies execs
and obviously it makes sense for people
to want for the filmmakers to want to
have this have a pg-13 rating therefore
it's seen and more accessible by a whole
crop of people right if you make the
film unrated I get the impression that
anyone can go see and this is probably
not the kind of thing that kids will
want to see
anyway though well I thought it's more
like an educational thing I think it's
one of those things where you know look
when you're in the high school they show
you nasty stuff you know and when your
middle school you see terrible stuff
that would be rated R right on TV or in
a theater but it falls into that grey
natural Geographic natural geographic
area you know I mean where it's like all
that person's naked but because they're
like in Africa and they're in a tribe
it's okay do you know what I mean of
course same sort of logic should apply
for this right and this is parochial to
it's not like just showing gratuitous
violence and hundred percent movies and
things it's sort of sheds a little more
light on how ridiculous of an
organization the mpaa is and other
priorities are totally up there as out
of whack right very ironic that we're
talking about a movie called bully yeah
when it sounds like movie itself is
getting bullied by the mpaa okay you
can't write that stuff that's straight
off the dome there good job just yet no
but seriously you're 100 Sandra yeah
yeah its best it's very uh indicative of
what you know the sort of how the system
is set up and how it's just not right
right it needs to be reevaluated frankly
unfortunately though as important of a
message that this film does have to say
it's not getting a huge release in terms
of theaters okay so then it's an
independent independent but what and it
will be here in New York York I
definitely encourage you to see it the
the there hasn't been reviews
necessarily but the message is important
and you know this has become like a very
big hot topic I thing going on with the
the Rucker's trial going on there's a
lot going on in in mainstream media
right now that sort of this movie maybe
brings attention to so yeah it's
interesting maybe a little wider release
with this unrated rating your kids out
hard nowadays you remember I got bullied
when I was a kid by this one guys always
have it hard no but now they have to you
know before when we were young if you
didn't want to do with the bully you
just go home right like once you leave
school the bullying stops because it's
always in your present but now it's more
of a cyber bullying thing so now you got
to go home and read the incendiary
tweets
a facebook post wall I think it's the
facebook you don't become you unfriend
them yeah I mean you can protect
yourself yeah right I guess not with
email right but I what if there's like
texting bully's you know that just like
heck seem like mean emoticons yeah I
don't know and I look we can't put
ourselves in these kids shoes because we
are actually pretty far away separated
from them these days yes I found out the
hard way this weekend if we went to the
same high school you would have bullied
I would not I believe me every day I
never bullied anybody I had a home the
trireme backs me up when I say you are
full of it you don't know what the hell
you're talking about I had plenty of you
some lanky friends as well that all
being agent probably would have cursed
at you all the time exactly I look
ignorance of angel that was cursing down
the hallway I can't say my mouth wasn't
potty yes but look now I had your poop
command we gotta get out of here guys
ate 6644 cnet again Tony Hawk the
Birdman is back on the show tomorrow
that's gonna be so much fun you would
have grabbed my arms and be like what
are you hitting yourself still beating
yourself really that guy Richard's land
I got it done this gravity was true no
way to know that bully I did not do that
to anybody I knew bullies in school you
know you're Freddie stayed away from me
