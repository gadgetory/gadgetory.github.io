doorway devices back in October 2015 a
new smart lock of doorbell camera and
connected keypad are all designed to
give you full control of your doorway
they were supposed to hit the market in
December 2015
with the latest hit apple's homekit
smart home platform held things back in
the lock of adorable camera company says
there's light at the end of the tunnel
though and it expects to finally receive
full sign-off from Apple in a week or
two you'll be able to buy each device
individually once they ship the lock for
230 bucks the doorbell cam for 200 and
the keypad for 80 if you have all three
you'll be able to open and close your
door lock remotely monitor and
communicate with anyone at your door via
the doorbell cam and use the keypad to
give a discreet access to anyone you
want to share a code with we like the
original august smart lock when we
reviewed it back in February 2015 it
looked good it had the most unencumbered
policy around assigning digital access
keys to other smartphone owners and it
generally worked pretty well as this new
suite embraces the HOME key ecosystem it
could become a flagship product for
Apple's smart home plans we'll need to
see not only how well it works but also
how well all the various pieces
integrate with the whole kit platform
and the other smart home products in it
we hope to find out as soon as it ships
which should be early this year
