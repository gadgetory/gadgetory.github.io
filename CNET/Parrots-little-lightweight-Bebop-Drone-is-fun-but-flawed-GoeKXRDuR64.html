f-22 lens 1080p full HD video capture
and the ability to fly by smartphone or
tablet or a full fledged controller
parrots bebop drone looks like a great
starting place for anyone interested in
capturing better than average aerial
photos and video in reality it's got a
handful of potential deal-breakers to
make you put away your wallet
I'm Josh Coleman with CNET and the first
thing is likely the battery life its
batteries are rated up to 11 minutes and
while you get two of them you'll of
course have to stop your flight to land
safely and swap them out and I also
never got that much flight time out of
them the video quality is okay but
softened had some aliasing artifacts and
frequently flickered when adjusting for
light conditions video and photos are
stored to its 8 gigs of internal memory
but once it's full you either have to
transfer wirelessly to your phone or
tablet or plug into a computer and turn
it on while you transfer it's easy
enough to fly with your mobile device
but using touch alone takes practice you
can buy the be-bop bundled with parrot
sky controller which gives you physical
controls however the bundle is $900 and
at that price is competing with more
capable models from DJI and 3d robotics
among others the bebop alone is $500
which is pricey but not entirely
unreasonable given what it can do and
how small and light it is but even that
advantage has its downside in that it
has a tough time staying stable and wind
you can read the full review on cnet.com
but basically if you want something
compact that you can throw in a backpack
and have a few minutes of fun and
capture some scenic video it's a good
easy to learn option otherwise you'll
want to look elsewhere
I'm Josh Goldman and that's a quick look
at the parrot bebop drone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
