your host eric mack live from cnet's
desert planet Bureau I'd like to start
by addressing all the members of
Starfleet across the galaxy as you know
Star Trek has been boldly going where no
one has gone before for five decades now
making it pretty remarkable that the
venerable franchise has the energy to
continue going so boldly and so we've
gathered here to celebrate 50 years of
all things Trek on the show today we're
going to listen with envy about our
colleague Amanda Kooser trip to the 50th
anniversary Trek convention in vegas and
will also be beaming in kelsey adams to
share her thoughts on the evolution of
the character of lieutenant Uhura Uhura
with a dash of Trek history but first
let's check in with the entire crew for
today's voyage from the cnet Studios on
earth it is GF sparkman and Steven
Beecham and from an undisclosed location
somewhere in the galaxy we've got Bonnie
Burton and then from the Cray of
satellite in the Albuquerque system it's
Amanda Kooser how's everyone doing good
well I'm regretting I didn't dress up at
least like a Klingon at least like like
or maybe just pretend I'm a robot
that'll work right i rep Lee usually do
we usually do um Jeff you you do have
your Klingon outfit on right uh yeah but
just the lower half so so like I said at
the top there it is the the 50th
anniversary this year of Star Trek a
vaunted CBS property and Amanda you got
to go to the 50th anniversary all the
way out in Las Vegas it was your first
convention and from reading what you
wrote it seems like it was a touchstone
moment a little bit emotional huh yeah
it was a pretty momentous occasion for
me I was a Star Trek fan from way back
and as a kid I read there were such
things of Star Trek conventions and
dreamt that someday I would
one of those and to finally get to one
was yeah it was emotional I saw all the
pretty much all the surviving original
crew members and to see them up very
close on stage discussing Star Trek
topics was quite the thrill I have to
say yeah there's that there's a photo
we've got of you with George Takei you
know Sulu what was that like was that a
meet-and-greet where they were kind of
shuffling everyone through did you get a
chance to interact at all or what well
that was a fun little little thing that
happened and it was on a replica of the
original Enterprise bridge which that
alone was very thrilling but it was it
was a pretty quick move through photo
opportunity but I was that was the one
day that I wore my complete Starfleet
uniform my captain's uniform and I was I
walked in and I was heading towards him
and he looks over and he and he tells me
and his wonderfully deep booming voice
that my uniform is regulation but that
my hair was not I just about melted
right there that was fantastic for me
but I also I don't think my hair is that
much bigger than Janeway's was it
sometimes so I don't know maybe I could
get away with this in Starfleet I think
it's pretty close so what were the other
highlights for you well actually the
other fans were a big part of it the
costume contest was pretty spectacular
there are people who have made a Horta
the the creature from the original
series that eats rocks and its babies
are threatened using a mechanic's slide
so this he had to lay down on the ground
in order shuffle around in this costume
a lot of people put in many many hours
into making their Borg outfits and to
making the crystalline entity from the
next generation I mean the creativity
level and the passion that went into
these was really something to see and
they had Robert Blackmon on the costume
designers from Star Trek and they had a
tarifa girl who was Dax on deep space 9
as guest judges so that that experience
right there was pretty fantastic just
beautiful beautiful work great
creativity and so were you around for
there was there was some discussion of
the
that the best and worst Trek episodes of
all time were you were you there for
that was that happening live yes I
witnessed that which was I had my
favorites for best and worst but I can't
disagree with what they chose they went
with my favorite for the best which is
sitting on the edge of forever a bit of
a time-travel episode from the original
series still stands up it's a great one
so that that one came in for the best
episode I totally agree with that and as
far as the worst episode goes that that
sweet honor went to TV series enterprise
which didn't last as long as some of our
other Star Trek series longer than the
original but only by a season but that
series finale was it was a dog I mean
they wrapped up the entire series with
just a nightmare episode it's too bad
cuz otherwise that season was pretty
strong but so I can't disagree without
in either though I was kind of rooting
for her Spock's brain from the original
series but I can understand why I didn't
make the cut I think you and I and the
rest of us are pretty much close to the
to the same age maybe Stevens a little
younger but like for me like the
original Star Trek I know was before my
time and it you know I'm really a TNG
guy i mean that's that's the gold
standard for me are we all like coming
from that same place or no yeah i mean
when i was a kid um the Star Trek
animated series was kind of like but go
to because it was like scooby-doo in
space in a way um and it was just you
know it was like that choppy animation
and it was it was pretty bad but the
storylines were really interesting um
kind of like with a super spider man was
it 1967 that animated series which I'm
pretty sure the whole writers room was
on LSD at that point um but when i
interviewed george takei a long time ago
when I worked at Lucasfilm because he
was a clone wars character and I asked
him about what it was like to film a
character for the Clone Wars versus the
Star Trek animated series and with the
clone wars he was able to come in and
they shoot it like a radio show they do
that with Star Wars rebels as well where
the whole cast is there and they can
play off of each other
but the star wars animated series they
all came in individually I think a lot
of that had to do with some animosity it
was some of the cast members at that
point um but he said it was like a
totally different experience so when you
watch that animated series just know
that each actor was brought in
separately instead of having it be done
as a kind of a radio play but I loved
TNG I mean I probably i would say Star
Trek The Next Generation got me through
college because instead of partying I
would watch that and smoke and so I
probably graduated on time because of
that because of a card um and also I
think I wrote my first slash fiction
with the card and Riker I also had a
very interesting erotica short story I
wrote with Wesley and a gang of female
Klingons so for Wesley Crusher oh and I
interviewed a wil wheaton for cnet um
about his time on TNG for i think it
goes up tomorrow for our star trek
coverage and it was really interesting
to hear him talk about how he became
kind of he grew up on that set you know
he started as a teenager on that set the
90s and then um just by working with
such class act actors became a better
actor and he told me in the interview
which he can read tomorrow then a lot of
the cast members have since come up to
him when they are at conventions or
whatever and said that they felt like
they helped raise him which he thought
was very cool when you think about you
know all those father figures and mother
figures for real and it's funny because
the actress that played a Beverly
Crusher that was his mom on the show
actually is really really sweet in real
life and sometimes they tweeted each
other like mother and son on Twitter and
hilarious gates mcfadden yeah that's
gates mcfadden and it's interesting too
because like a lot of those actors don't
necessarily do comic cons like some of
them will do the Star Trek stuff like
Amanda went to but they don't really
know
think we lost her for a second she'll be
back so there's no I just freeze yes you
did I am of course they freeze right
when it looks like I'm doing some sort
of Shirley Temple move I'm sorry about
that uh anyway it was really fun talking
to will about his Wesley Crusher days
which is kind of weird cuz some some
fans don't really like him I've always
liked Wesley Crusher I kind of liked the
geordie Wesley Crusher storylines and
the Wesley Crusher data Geordi it was
like it was like stranger things grown
up it's like I feel like those guys
would've instead playing poker I always
wanted an episode where they were all
playing dungeons dragons I always
thought that would be fun that would be
awesome on the hall yeah anyway I'm very
prayer was Lee crusher I just wanted to
say that yeah he's basically the
character that I would have seen the TNG
universe through he's like the one no
cuz I was his age probably watching it
and he would be like the character you
empathize with mojo I was like for an
entire generation yeah i mean the cool
thing too is that you know he had some
really dorky moments as a teenager as
that character but then you also saw him
grow up and to be a responsible yet
flawed character and i really wish they
would have utilized him more towards
later years but i've always been a big
Wesley Crusher fan what about you Amanda
what was that and I do want to say a
show yeah totally cuz Whoopi Goldberg's
character that was like that fulfilled
my Star Wars Cantina moment like I loved
it anytime they had a scene in that for
is a forward right so they caught the
bar I never knew what if we were ten
forward why did it goes it's a bar I
mean come on it's not like you know
Central Perk I mean come on there was
some dream out the Regal Beagle it's not
the Regal oh man that would have been
better oh that would have been even
better anything continue so what was
your you know initial memory your early
star trek memories Amanda that you know
led you to this 50th anniversary moment
yeah well my story actually started with
my mother who would often tell me and
still does
that she would watch Star Trek reruns
while I was in the womb and then also
when she would sit in a rocking chair
with me as a baby and watch Star Trek
reruns and then some around about fourth
grade so how the timing worked out and I
think it was an after-school slot but
the reruns of the original show would
come on and it just I mean it grabbed me
right off the bat and I became a
dedicated viewer so I actually started
off with the original series at a pretty
young age as super thrilled when a next
gen came out of course just to see that
continuation on television so which I
love that series also pro Wesley Crusher
absolutely but I followed it ever since
across all the series across all the
movies across the reboots but it was
really it was Kirk Spock McCoy the
original crew that really drew me in as
a kid for sure what about you guys Jeff
and Stephen well I started um a little
before next gen uh like I wasn't like
super into it and my dad to this day
will always mock me because he was
always trying to get me he's all you
know I think you would really like this
and I'm like no no because all I
remembered from when I was a really
little kid was in end credits when they
would show that one frame of the Baylock
puppet that creepy looking alien dude
they used to scare the crap enemy when I
was little it just you know I'm like and
then uh but I would still I would go see
the movies I went to see star trek 3 for
my friend's birthday party and then I I
got like really into Star Trek just
before next generation came out so as I
was finding out all the news and stuff
and actually they're still I still have
a sticker of wil wheaton on my old
dresser it's actually still at my
parents house they were giving away
stickers in boxes of ziplock bags
because you know when you think of
tie-ins for Star Trek you think of bags
and so yeah it's it's still on there
right next to a sticker that came out
for the motion picture that I got out of
ball machine mr. Spock ah so that's
still on there so yeah and actually um
my very first convention experience was
a Star Trek convention and that was went
like only it was just after the first
season had ended of the next generation
because they were telling us all these
things about what might be happening in
the second season like oh my god
Jonathan Frakes grew a beard we're not
sure if they're gonna let her keep it on
the show or anything and it was really
interesting those were crazy times oh
yeah I don't know I don't know if anyone
can really ever exceed the I mean with
all apologies to William Shatner because
he is what he is and he's fantastic in
his own right but like the gravitas of
you know Shakespearean trained Patrick
Stewart at the helm of a starship I
don't know if it ever gets better than
that am I crazy I you know Shatner did
Shakespeare too yeah why didn't he was
the Shakespearean actor right he's like
he has that delivery you know yeah he uh
let's see could be wrong no I know he
has done it at some point and then I'm
pretty sure he did it before he did Star
Trek cuz I mean like you know you can
find him doing pretty much anything like
after Star Trek got canceled by doing
Shakespeare on talk shows and stuff like
that but he did that and he was in a
pilot Alexander the Great I think with
Adam West I think yeah yeah how
did I miss that that sounds incredible
yeah 1964 wow it's like the ultimate
super group yeah for real right yeah I
should also mention um I've neglected
the chat room if you do want to join in
and share your star trek memories
comments/criticisms whatever with us the
chat room is live on youtube or just go
to youtube.com slash seen it and we're
also on livestream.com / cnet sliced the
grave cast chat rooms go in there and
also actually a really easy way to get
my attention is to tweet at krave right
now if you got if you want to chime in
on the discussion so we should probably
eat fast for
forward at warp speed to the present you
know a lot of Star Trek stuff happening
this year and beginning of next year
Star Trek beyond is out now and Star
Trek discovery is coming at the
beginning of next year maybe to the end
of this year amande are you excited
about both of those have you seen i'm
assuming seems beyond already right oh
oh yeah i dressed up and went to beyond
looking like this I really enjoyed it
and I fan of the reboots I'm an
old-school Star Trek fan but when I know
not all of them like the reboot series
but I have very much enjoyed it all the
way along but I do think this was by far
the strongest entry in the series kind
of RiRi reinvigorated the sort of heart
of Star Trek that that we like from the
original series and a lot of fans like
so I thought that was a very very good
one and but the the TV series coming up
is should be very interesting from my
understanding it's going to take place
after the original series so after the
original five-year mission so we may be
getting some more uniforms like this I
don't know there's a lot of unknowns
about it but just the fact that we're
getting back to an episodic Star Trek
series i think is a great opportunity
for fan excitement coming up here it
could be very good and I hope it is so
it's not a prequel or a sequel it's like
an in-between cool I guess that's my
system so after original series prior to
next generation but I mean that that
gives you some space time you know
that's what there's a fair amount of
time within that that they could be
setting it so we'll see I've also read
that it'll take place 10 years before
the original series so like more like
like Enterprise is what now cuz I mean
10 years before the original series
isn't really that would be more like
cebu hearing it slide in between
enterprise in original series that's
interesting oh what it actually is you
did some reporting from Las Vegas Amanda
on some of the the takes that the older
actors had on some of the newer poor
trails right a little bit they did
discuss that a little bit um actually uh
that was not one of the big hot topics a
lot of people kind of wanted to hear
about the filming experiences of the
actors but George Takei was said it was
a you know pretty much a rip-roaring
great space adventure so um he may have
had some issues with how they portray
Sulu but he liked the film overall I I
guess that's what I was thinking of um
well you know our own beloved Kelsey
Adams who was not able to join us live
today she actually pre-recorded so that
we could teleport her through space and
time her own take on we're a little bit
Star Trek history and we're one of the
characters from the original cast
imprint in particular has has taken and
the twists and turns of that character
has taken over the decades do you have
that Stephen yeah yeah okay here we go
happy Star Trek 50th I just saw Star
Trek beyond the third reboot movie and
it was cute but they still have no idea
what to do with lieutenant Uhura now
originally who was supposed to be a
really positive figure she was a
professional woman a top-ranking officer
African American actress in 1966 on TV
that was a big deal but a lot of people
then and now have looked at this crew
and said well all the men have glamor
jobs and you made the black woman answer
the phone is hailing frequencies open
captain really enough saw do update a
character there are different approaches
and there's for example long tradition
of a licensed Star Trek fiction such as
this books by known authors with often
creepy covers from before Photoshop and
it's kind of like fan fiction but with
more limits and fewer teenage
polyamorous wolves so what they tried to
do is say what would she be like to a
real person what is a communications
officer she must know a million
languages she's obviously a diplomat or
she fixes the translator she must be an
engineer and they really built her out
now for the reboot that just kind of
threw all that out and I think honestly
the problem was originally hua is so
ladylike gentle you know she's not a
sci-fi tough chick so they redid it um
modern hua is very brave and she fights
and stuff but she spends the first two
movies just nagging her boyfriend about
his emotions while they're in the middle
of a crisis it's not very professional
and then in the third movie they cut out
the nagging but she's that doesn't leave
anything but girlfriend like in big
group scenes she's just standing there
like she doesn't know what she's
supposed to do even in a crisis that
literally revolves around the word
frequencies she doesn't solve it other
people do so i know that i'm sure that
co-writer and fellow nerd simon pegg did
not forget that she's a communications
officer but maybe he thinks that means
social media like perfectly valid job
that gets no respect I don't know the
point is reboot ahora is not original
hoorah and that's fine but you do have
to come up with someone for her to be
and when you're thinking about who she
is what do we know about her she's a
Starfleet officer that's your life so
riders when you're figuring out of here
before you ask yourself who she's dating
ask yourself what her job is here's a
hint queen is already taken bravo Bravo
I love that I love that I honestly like
I think she also needs to do more rants
yes that was amazing and I agree with
her one hundred percent like there's a
great scene and um started the
cumberbatch Star Trek was it Star Trek
darkness into darkness yeah there's a
great scene wen hua uh says oh yeah I
just learned Klingon like she's rusty on
her Klingon and the first time she is to
like interact with Klingons right when
they're about to kill all of them and
she's supposed to speak and perfect
Klingon as to not offend these Klingons
that are about to kill them on their
away missions when they're trying to
capture Benedict Cumberbatch character
of Khan and I was like that's what Star
Trek needs more of those reboots they
need to show how detrimental would be if
she screwed up her job and they also
need to show that she never screws up
her job like she is really good at what
she does and like if you think about
having to know Klingon perfectly so you
don't get killed it's kind of like
they're just as picky with their
languages French are so that's like you
don't like practice French for the first
time in France at a French restaurant
unless you want a waiter to spit in your
food so this is a lot less deadly than
spitting in food but this is I mean I
mean if you're speaking in French to a
French waiter
that's that's what you get but if you're
if you do into a Klingon I feel like
you've become the food like I feel like
you would you would not only gets like
Klingons don't bother spitting on people
they just kill them so if you offend a
Klingon or they torture them or their
torch them or I think they just jet
jettison them out into space for fun
like I'm sure it's a sport um you just
don't screw up Klingon and that was one
of the things that made me really
respect ahura in the new reboots but
then I totally agree with Kelsey they
kind of just turned her into a nagging
girlfriend and she deserves better than
that cool any other hot cakes what do
you think Amanda no I think Kelsey's ran
is great and and this has kind of been a
problem throughout star trek with
especially when you're looking at the
original series characters with anybody
whose not named Kirk McKoy or Spock they
often yeah they often kind of get short
shrift in these things but it is
unfortunate especially I think with a
her that they have kind of I mean she's
she's like all right she's our lady in
there and I would really love to see a
bigger role for her so hopefully they'll
be doing another film maybe they'll
actually be able to write a little more
smartly I hope they will listen to
kelsey's rant because I should give them
some good ideas as far as what
directions to go in i'm gonna email it
to them too bad robot right I won't
believe it in in next generation they
did a really good job with female
characters I mean you had a secure for
Worf the head of security was female you
had a lot of female engineers you had a
lot of I mean yeah the counselor the
camp counselor Deanna Troi is a female
and that's predominantly always a female
character but are that kind of character
same with like a doctor type character
though I always like Beverly Crusher I
thought she should have been given more
storylines cuz she seemed she had a lot
more Moxie to offer than they really did
that just the mother daughter of mother
dr. role and also there were just so
many great characters that came in and
out of the show like Deanna Troi his mom
was probably one of my favorite female
character
in sci-fi only because I particularly
liked any character that annoyed picard
so that would be ziana Troy's mom and of
course q so and then there was a female
q um later on in the series where there
was a woman that was even more powerful
than the Time Lord or time traveler q so
I I think next generation and also
Voyager um had really good strong female
characters and it's it's if you haven't
watched those shows if you're new to
Star Trek or you don't really watch any
of anything past you know the Shatner
years you should give those a try
because there's some really really great
characters and I mean Jeri Ryan playing
seven of nine again is one of my
favorite female characters in sci-fi
that really kind of taught the humans
how to be human I am so glad you brought
up Q because those were like easily my
favorite TNG episodes did any of those
make the top ten list I tamantha like I
don't yeah it was weird because like I
was looking for more TNG stuff and I I
know that they made the bad list but
there should be some more for positive
yeah but by the way 1k atoms in the
chatroom says a fine it's a good point
about the Klingon see ya I mean honestly
like I'm always afraid when I try to
speak different languages in front of
the people that speak them natively
because I know some Russian obviously
Spanish you have to know spanish in
California or pretty much anywhere the
United States Thank You mr. Trump hello
um sorry didn't mean to trump eyes but
you know when you're speaking a language
that's not your first language not only
are you worried about messing it up
you're worried about offending people
but you know the worst that can happen
if you offend someone in their native
language is they'll correct you or maybe
roll their eyes at you Klingons will
disembowel you so like I really do think
who deserves some points for mastering
the rosetta stone that is Klingon and
that is not an easy language to learn
they offered it at my college as
elective yeah and I tried to take it cuz
I was like oh this will be easy it's
Klingon and so I tried to take it in
college and I was like oh my god i'ma
get graded on this and I'm really bad at
Klingon so I switched I switched her
Russian note the collagen older didn't
you yeah um well what do we know about
um discovery uh I mean is there any
chance of a of a female lead in that one
yeah isn't their attention Amanda did
you write the story you know lead yeah
yeah I'm they're being pretty vague
about it but what I've heard is that
there will be a female lead but it may
not necessarily be the captain so that
once again we don't even know what
perspective it may maybe this is not
gonna be focused on the bridge crew
maybe it's the people down the Galia who
knows I want to find out you know there
was when i interviewed well wheaton
about this cuz i asked him what he would
be most excited about the new TV series
and we'll brought up a really cool idea
that probably is not gonna happen but
now i want it to that he wants the new
Star Trek series to be like American
Horror Story or it's a different each
seasons a different story but it's the
same cast but they're playing different
characters or have it be like true
detective where each seasons a different
location so it's not always on you know
a ship or it's not always on the space
station or it's not always on one planet
but each time they change it up it's
still the same show but the seasons it
changes the locale so I I thought that
would be interesting but I don't know
how experimental they're gonna get
because it is Star Trek so there's
certain things you have to stick with in
order to keep the majority of the fans
from you know coming at you with torches
I think that'd be great if there were
more cereal element too because that's
what made the first batch of movies in
the 80s I think so popular is because no
people were used to the episodic you
know here's what happens in its wrapped
up in 45 minutes every week but then
with the movies you had this kind of
ongoing saga that was like really
brought it to another level so it would
be great to see that like
on the you know the the television scale
where it's an ongoing serial season I
would love that I mean I honestly would
love to see Starfleet Academy be the
spot where it takes place because we got
a little bit of that in the prequel or
in the movies the reboot of what that
looked like and what it looked like to
be in a class with a bunch of cadets
that are from all different species and
races and um abilities and so I kinda
had hoped that they would do show like
that but maybe they're afraid it'll be
to CW like they're worried there were to
be like the Star Trek Diaries like
they're worried it's gonna like that'll
be too young but I would love to see
anything in the Starfleet Academy I'm
good I got to go ad CW to the urban
dictionary as an adjective right now uh
so kelsey says there were three
next-generation episodes in the top ten
chain of command yesterday's enterprise
and the inner light but we don't think
any of them are q episodes no they're
not but good to know good just good to
see Picard well represented in that top
10 for sure so any other you know to
wrap it up on any any reflections on a
life lived in Star Trek fandom or where
the franchise is headed from here
cricket oh yeah I would say that I'm
excited for the future of Star Trek I
think I mean I I grew up more in the
world of Star Wars and that's where most
of my career has been spent and that's
why I know more about than Star Trek
though I am try sci-fi not try curious
so I like dr. Hugh and Star Wars and
Star Trek equally so I think you're
allowed to like them equally that Star
Wars versus Star Trek thing even though
we have it all over cnet I don't
necessarily think it's that big a deal
depending on I guess when you talk to
you but for me I like both so I just
want to see more experimentation done
with Star Trek I feel like we have so
many great TV shows like Battlestar
Galactica and other sci-fi like dark
matter and you have all these different
sci-fi realms of entertainment that I
think Star Trek didn't have when even
the next
generation was out so I really want them
to experiment like I would love to see a
super like gritty Star Trek series on
showtime or something where they're
allowed to curse you know or they're
allowed to have sex like actual sex and
have it be more adult but at the same
time keep the same Roddenberry mythos
alive in the run Barry feel to it um but
I'm excited for this new series i just
hope fans give it a chance because i
know with Star Wars fans they they've
had to like reluctantly give up their
prequel pain and like a move on and I
don't think Star Trek has that same
level of pain unless you really really
hated the reboots but I think it's in a
really exciting time to be a Star Trek
fan so I want to see a lot more stuff
and I would love to see um you know even
a CW show that Star Trek based I mean I
know I've made fun of CW but I watch a
lot of CW and I could totally see
something on on there um that's geared
towards teens and I think that would be
an interesting take but I'm excited I'm
excited for the new show and I watch the
new movies and I the most recent one i
really liked but again i don't go into
it with the glasses of I'm a huge Star
Trek fan and I'm breaking everything
apart piece by piece and dissecting it I
go into everything Star Trek is just
like this is fun and this is exciting
and I love sci-fi and these characters
are cold to me so I'm excited what do
you guys think back there in the studio
you've been quiet give us a talk Trek
horse mm-hmm I'm looking forward to it
um I saw the newest movie like a couple
weeks ago and I really liked it it um
felt more Star Trek II to me than the
other two did and I mean I enjoyed the
other two but this one was I know I just
the stuff that I was worried about in
the trailer didn't seem as out of place
as it seemed in the trailer so that was
nice um and there was a lot more like
character stuff that I really liked and
I'm looking really forward to the
because it will just be kind of
interesting to have some new Star Trek
anything um cuz it's pizza been a while
yeah I'll definitely give it a shot I'll
definitely give it a shot you know I'm
way in the game of thrones if they can
make something that says coolest game of
thrones I would be awesome oh yeah but
yeah I saw the first two movies I
haven't seen that the latest movie but I
definitely want to go see it and that I
have to blame that on my two young
children that don't let me go out at
night but um but yeah I'm very excited
about it it's gonna be it's gonna be
cool I mean I would have to echo what
Bonnie said which I think with the
entire Star Trek franchise at the risk
of kind of being sacrilegious here
they're the earnestness has always been
almost done to death and I would really
like to see something a little more
gritty a little more edgy like you know
you're saying Stephen worth it were in
the era of of Game of Thrones and yeah
100 on the CW I mean it could be a
little edgy or a little grittier little
you know a little get a little dirtier
you know I don't like the movies were
kind of doing that you know like they're
a little darker that the latest movies
like they felt a little darker like you
know seeing people getting tortured and
it's you know it's like is interesting I
thought it was cool it's true I think
that and I think it's the right
direction to take it in and it's
probably not surprising that JJ Abrams
took it in that direction but I think
that you know I'd love to see it
continue that way yeah so let's give the
final word to to Amanda to the captain
hey you're working with them what's in
your captain's log well uh discovery I
I'm super excited about this new show
coming up I did double check and Jeb is
absolutely right this will be set prior
to the original series so that means
that technology is not quite as advanced
should be more advanced than we saw an
enterprise at least but which kind of
makes things a little more exciting you
know more things can go wrong when you
don't have as fancy a tools available to
you the fact that it is looks like it's
not going to be centered on the captain
and having a female lead I think we
could be looking forward to a sassier
version Star Trek which as we're saying
you know television has changed a lot
we've got things like Game of Thrones
Battlestar Galactica was an excellent
example of what you can do with a
grittier sci-fi
television series concept if they can
take some of that sort of feel and build
it into the star trek universe and as
body said not lose sight of that rod
very heart I think we're going to be in
for a real treat and I have very high
hopes for the new series so that's
really what I'm looking forward to in
the Star Trek universe right now and
right there with you and it will be on
CBS and the months coming for a lot more
