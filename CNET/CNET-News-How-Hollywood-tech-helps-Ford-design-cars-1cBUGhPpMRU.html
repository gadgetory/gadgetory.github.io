this headgear I'm inside a virtual ford
fusion right now this is the virtual
reality technology that engineers use to
decide where they want to put every knob
on a car before it's made and we're here
to find out more about what you said
janiers get out of it comes down to the
accuracy of tracking so today we're just
tracking your head and we're tracking
hands but we also do full body tracking
as well the real leaps and bounds have
been jumping on the backs of you know
the gaming industry's and hollywood
whose elevated this technology to a
really high level the see movies like
rise of the planet of the apes or avatar
and all those characters are you know
animated through the motions of real
humans that is a extremely powerful tool
we're no longer drawing it frame by
frame and we just use the same
technology that allows us to immerse our
designers our stylists are engineers in
future model product two or three years
before we actually have any physical
parts viewing the product from the
perspective the customer the passenger
allows them to make choices that they
would otherwise have a hard time making
on a computer screen virtual reality to
the actual ford fusion this is what the
virtual reality helped today when you're
talking about human factors which is a
branch of ergonomics the thing that
makes your apple phone so intuitive the
process of the flow you go through to
navigate know if you want to change your
right to setting or some setting you
usually don't need to look at emmanuel
so we invest a lot of time and effort
into human factors so products like our
myford touch you know our touchscreen
system it's an intuitive interface that
people can kind of flow through can they
reach this dial is this you know they're
all evaluated to make sure our customers
are sitting and getting the experience
that makes them feel comfortable we want
people to love it for its design not
just the form and function of having a
car
so this kind of technology facilitates
that because we can sit in the product
before you know freezing that design and
making parts all right it's time to roll
out of here miss Tina com I'm Bridget
you oh no I have no legs oh my god</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
