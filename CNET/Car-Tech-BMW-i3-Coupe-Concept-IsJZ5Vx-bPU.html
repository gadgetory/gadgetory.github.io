has a brand more kind of at odds with
electric cars than BMW I mean they're so
strongly known for something else for
the gas engine world the turbocharged
world the track engineered vehicle the
ultimate driving machine those are the
attributes we don't associate with
electric cars we think of them as green
and wimpy and kind of super digital
high-tech so for this company to make a
shift to the iSeries is gonna be a big
one coming in late 2013 early 2014 but
this is probably not the one you're
going to buy when they hit the market
more than likely the i3 would be the
electric BMW it's gonna fit your budget
here it is in a concept coupe version
we've seen a four-door before and that
by the way is what will be coming out
first
in late 2013 not too far away but this
coupes taking us into a little sexier
direction of what is clearly a city car
all electric now it's a BMW so it's
rear-wheel drive this was part of their
DNA 170 horse on an 84 foot-pounds of
torque the other thing you'll notice
about this car you can't see it's the
aluminum underpinnings of it the chassis
but underneath here and you can see in
the door jambs and such a lot of
carbon-fiber infuse in these plastic
panels so this is a car that is very
light and very rigid throughout one of
the benefits is one that is very near
and dear to my heart
thin pillars you know how pillars have
been getting like this big lately
because of crash were all over standards
this lightweight very strong material
means you can finally Finley's out and
get a nice greenhouse again let's take a
look inside now look at this cabin very
spacious flat floor between those two
front seats because the entire
lithium-ion battery pack lives in the
belly of the vehicle
BMW says that's a unique benefit they've
got because these eye vehicles were
designed from the ground up to be either
electric or hybrid electric they didn't
have to shoehorn all that apparatus into
an existing platform also notice too
generous screens a six point five in
front of the driver and an eight point
eight big widescreen over there which
BMW is known for in the middle
everything here basically is handled via
LCD screen you got a few controllers and
of course the latest sort of envisioning
of their iDrive controller there in the
middle range on this car is being
guesstimated around 100 miles that's
like every other compact electric car
coming out right
so that's pretty straightforward
interesting wildcard could be charging
time we don't know yet what that will be
and what BMW might have up their sleeve
for a fast charge strategy there's only
so much you can do within the laws of
physics but car makers are beginning to
get a little better at bending them at
least these ice series cars are more
than just a technological shift for BMW
but this company known so much for
traditional engineering the ultimate
driving machine gas engine cars this is
a big philosophical shift as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
