welcome to the Apple bite for everything
good and bad inside the world of Apple
and boy do we have a lot of iPhone
goodies to jump into now you all know it
started over the weekend when Apple
accidentally pushed their firmware for
their home pod speaker ahead of its
launch in December and sure it revealed
new things about the home pod which
we'll get to
but the firmware that Apple released was
for iOS 11 0.022 full patches ahead of
what's been released to the public it
was a treasure trove of iPhone 8 details
straight from the source that Gayle her
Rambo and Steven trounce Smith dug deep
into now the biggest leak you've seen it
everywhere the apparent confirmation of
what the next iPhone will look like that
aligns exactly with the rumors and
renders we've seen with a minimal bezel
design and the top area is sticking out
around the camera and sensors the icon
also confirms the lack of a physical
home button on the front the first time
ever for an iPhone and thanks home pod
firmware and guess what the hits keep
coming the firmware includes multiple
references to infrared face detection
within the biometric kit framework
that's where touch ID information is
usually stored and it confirms the next
phone well at least partially rely on
facial recognition
the biometric it also references face
detect and different conditions like
being too close or too far away from the
camera infrared sensors on the front of
the iPhone will also be used to capture
images for authentication
instead of using visible light through a
traditional camera wow that's a lot of
info but wait there's more trounce myth
kept on digging into the home pod
firmware and says there is nothing to
suggest any type of under display touch
ID functionality on the iPhone 8
squashing the idea for all you dreamers
that it will come this year that
discovery supports what rumor mills have
been saying about the iPhone moving
towards a facial recognition system and
if you don't like the idea of that
blocked out area on the top of the phone
crown Smith and developer Jeffrey
Grossman have found new references to a
new split visual option for the status
bar which means utilities like Wi-Fi
Bluetooth your cell signal and battery
could be displayed on either side of the
camera area giving us the smooth
streamlined status bar at the top of the
phone that we all
want now Smith also says the status Mar
seems a lot more complex and powerful in
design and could even have some
interactive features you want more oh
yeah you'll get more without a home
button the iPhone could also support a
tap to wake feature a feature found in
Windows Lumia phones where you double
tap on the screen to wake them crown
Smith also found the home button looks
like it's being referenced as the home
indicator with the virtual area that may
be for hidden full screen apps and
videos plus there's evidence in the OS
that the iPhone will bring an even
higher resolution screen at 11:25 by
2436 for a functional section of the
screen that measures at 5.15 inches
giving it a 521 pixel per inch density
now the other portion would be for the
virtual home area we just talked about
and would make up the remainder of the
rumored 5.8 inch screen in total whoo
that's a lot of meat and potatoes
everybody and remember years ago it was
Tim Cook who said Apple would be
doubling down on secrecy on products but
the reality is that it was Apple Apple
and no one else that's revealed the most
concrete details about the iPhone 8 to
date see the Cupertino kids can't be
happy about that
and you know what that gets that's a bad
apple but it's kind of good for me
because we just had a whole lot of show
to give to Apple by nation
all right the iPhone wasn't the only
thing we learned about remember the home
pod yes the firmware also revealed new
details about the home pot we mentioned
it will run iOS hence the iPhone leaks
but according to the firmware posted
online it won't support third-party apps
or extensions which means we probably
shouldn't expect to support any other
music services other than Apple music on
launch but come on they've got to
realize that's just stupid so hopefully
that changes now the firmware also
revealed that top center surface area of
the home pod isn't just a big LED but
appears to be an LED matrix and if
that's the case it could show off basic
things like temperature time or weather
icons things you'll only see if you're
standing you know directly above it in
staring down on it now developer Avery
McNally discovered some of the new home
pod UI sounds and posted them for
everyone to hear like
this one for an alarm oh that was
Pleasant or this one for a timer hey MA
the ribs are ready and this dope one
called WOC audio Pasco tone Oh do it
again man here play that again
oh yeah I'm taking that all right
clearly uh I need to go outside a little
more now the home pot is scheduled for a
release sometime in December for 349
okay Apple is up after they announce
their earnings results for the third
fiscal quarter of 2017 which is the
second quarter of the calendar year
Apple posted revenue of forty five point
four billion dollars and a net quarterly
profit of eight point seven billion now
Apple iPhone sales were up 41 million
units compared to last year's quarter
Mac sales were up with four point two
nine million sold and the curse of the
iPad has ended after thirteen straight
quarters of declining sales now iPads
jumped up fifteen percent to eleven
point four two million units sold and
you can think my best friend the iPad
pro and the low-cost iPad for that also
Apple watch sales jumped up 50 percent
and is the number one selling SmartWatch
in the world but they still won't report
units sold come on Apple just man up
show us the numbers unless you know
you're having performance issues Apple
services business which includes the App
Store Apple pay Apple music and iCloud
storage and more at an all-time high of
7.3 billion dollars in revenue making it
the size of a fortune 100 company and if
you want to know how much cash Apple is
sitting on right now they told us two
hundred sixty one point five billion
dollars cash that's a whole lot of legs
now there's also some fun tidbits from
the earnings call Tim Cook said Apple
has increased production capacity for
the air pods who are still on a six-week
wait time but they still aren't able to
meet the strong level of demand I think
a blockbuster music video might have had
something to do with that why'd you take
the headphones
there's so many things I can't - oh now
cook also addressed Apple is working on
its own autonomous system for cars he
said we do have a large project going
and we're making a big investment in
this autonomous systems can be used in a
variety of ways a vehicle is only one
but there are many other different areas
of it and I don't want to go any further
with that okay Tim just you know
sprinkling a little few crumbs for us to
pick up there like south bay light
alright he also continued to push for a
Ark it calling augmented reality big and
profound for Apple and the early demos
kept getting better with everything from
this mind-blowing take on aha eighties
music video take on me using a Ark it
and then we saw this demo of a virtual
robot commando in the streets pretty
cool stuff
alright that's gonna do it for this
week's show you can email us at the
Apple bite at cnet.com or tweet me at
Brian Tong we didn't even get to talk
about the fast and furious style iPhone
heist from a moving truck so just have
to listen to our Apple byte extra
crunchy podcast for that thanks so much
for watching we'll catch y'all next time
for another bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
