welcome to tomorrow daily the best geek
talk show in the known universe I hope
you enjoyed jeff cannata hosting the
show yesterday he's gonna be back again
this week but for now let's hit the
headlines minecraft is literally a world
full of infinite possibilities and a
pair of researchers are using that to
their advantage to teach kids
biochemistry mark Lorch and Joel Mills
recently launched mall craft that's
short for molecules in Minecraft and
it's a server dedicated to educating
kids about molecular structures and how
they form proteins in an interview on
vices motherboard the creators explained
that they used to use PowerPoint
presentations to teach kids but they
actually realized they could grab kids
attention much better through Minecraft
ha imagine that getting kids attention
through video games much easier than
PowerPoint presentation the way the
server works is there are large models
of molecules scattered around the world
and a scavenger hunt guides players
around teaching them about each
structure through clues and other
objects going forward lore channels hope
to add more and more complex levels to
the server and the University of Hull
has a website with information on how to
access the server itself also this would
look super cool if you experienced it
through hololens right amazing alright
so yesterday Jeff talked about MIT and
their living bioscan and today I'm going
to talk about MIT and their take home
bio lab we've all had dreams of genetic
engineering from the comfort of our own
home haven't we okay well maybe we
haven't but MIT Media Lab is hoping to
make that dream come true for the people
who have had that dream with amino there
at home bio lab for growing cells in a
controlled environment it's not unlike
the mole craft server actually in that
its founder wanted to create a fun easy
way for people to experience synthetic
biology it's a countertop bioreactor
that allows users to run amino apps
which combined DNA programs and growth
liquids it automates more difficult
processes and helps people learn by
doing if you want to run a different app
you can as amino allows users to run a
cleaning cycle between programs making
it easy to change up your experiment by
democratizing scientific processes
usually confined to professional labs
MIT hopes amino will help pave the way
for anyone to help problem solve using
synthetic
biology when it's relevant this is
actually a crowdfunding campaign over on
IndieGoGo but they're already funded
beyond their goal and there aren't too
many first edition runs left in the
campaign itself so I figured I'd mention
it just in case a lab or a school or you
wanted to get in on it it's up to you
guys let me know if you get well no cuz
it looks so awesome alright everybody
who is of legal drinking age in your
country get out your favorite liquor and
if you're not a legal drinking age get
out your favorite juice because there's
a robot bartender that's going to make a
custom shot based on your personality
social shot is a project featuring a
mobile cart with a robot bartender on
board five ingredients representing
personality traits hang up on top of the
cart those are openness
conscientiousness extraversion
agreeableness and neuroticism here's
where it gets weird if that wasn't weird
enough already a user can log into their
facebook profile via a terminal that is
right there on the cart and then the
terminal collects data from that
person's facebook profile and determines
their personality through an algorithm
that analyzes the user's likes after all
that data gets crunched the robotic
barkeep puts together those five
different ingredients into a custom shot
based on your very own personality fun
unless you're totally one hundred
percent neurotic in which case it's all
going to be one ingredient three solid
liquor and honestly if this team finds
their way to vegas for CES I am totally
right now officially inviting them to
our show so that we can test out social
shots on tomorrow daily cuz honestly it
seems like it'd be pretty fun oh hey
guys it's Tuesday let's check out what's
gonna empty our wallets this week
this week's new releases of course again
some great video games coming out call
of duty black ops 3 is available this
week obviously the continuation of one
of the best-selling video games of all

man games will enjoy it and then on the
other side of video gaming from shooting
