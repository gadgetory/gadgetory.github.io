and to put it in plain English these
movies have sucked okay we had one
excellent one like 10 or so years ago
but since then they've gotten
progressively worse culminating in this
sandwich last year Jimmy Fox was way too
campy Peter Parker's parents no one
gives a crap and to put the main focus
on the romance was a huge mistake so
while Sony's been busy devaluating one
of the best superheroes in the world
marvel studios and disney have been on a
roll and its movies have only gotten
better and just like the comics all of
its characters exist in the same
universe which is why you'll see Bruce
Banner in an iron man movie or Black
Widow show up in a Captain America film
it's all one big ongoing story and each
movie ties into the next so the news
that Marvel and Sony have struck a deal
to have spider-man folded into the
marvel cinematic universe and that the
next spider-man movie would be
co-produced by marvel filled me with
such unbridled Glee that I could not
stop repeating holy for the next five
minutes after I read it we could soon
see spider-man fighting alongside the
Avengers and maybe even see some of them
show up in his future films it's a huge
victory for geeks like myself who have
wanted a comics accurate version of the
character for years in a movie that will
potentially get back to the core of why
spider-man is so uncool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
