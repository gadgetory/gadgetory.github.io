their location and checking into places
on their phone but when you're at a
convention or a theme park sharing your
exact spot with friends and family
can be really useful I'm here at CES
2013 at the Las Vegas Convention Center
and I thought it would be a perfect time
to show you how to keep track of friends
now Apple has its own app called find my
friends and it's a great app but the
only problem with this is that it's only
good for iOS devices and I'm guessing
that not all your friends have iPhones
so the better option is an oldie but a
goodie Google Latitude reason being I OS
and Android users can use it now I'm
sure you're already familiar with this
app but today I'll show you some best
practices for sharing your location with
Google Latitude to get started download
and install the app on your iOS or
Android device when you launch it you'll
have to login with your Google account
then the first thing you'll want to do
is start adding friends so go ahead and
hit the add friend button I'll do that
here on my Android and you can either
select them from your contact or enter
their email address just make sure to
enter a gmail address so I've already
gone ahead and added a few friends that
I'm tracking here at CES but the first
thing you'll want to do is adjust
privacy settings specific to those
contacts so for example I'll select
Chris and hit manage sharing here you'll
have three options you can select share
best available location which means that
Google Maps will try to provide them
with the most specific location possible
or share only city level location
that'll give them an approximate idea of
where you are or you can say hide from
front so for example if you're having a
night out on the town and you don't want
your colleagues to know where you are
you can select that option so in this
case I'll select share best available
location
once you have all of your friends set up
head back to the map now if all your
friends have granted access to their
location you'll see them on your map so
you can zoom in scroll around find out
where they are and you'll notice that
each avatar has a square around it a
blue square with an arrow means that
they're reporting their exact location
and they've reported it pretty recently
a grey square means that they haven't
reported their location in quite some
time if their avatar has a circle around
it it means that Google is trying to
find out where they are and if their
avatar has a blue or grey square around
it without a little arrow it means that
they are sharing their location with you
but only at city level so now you're
tracking all your friends you can tap on
their face and you'll get a couple
options one of them is to get directions
to where they are so hit directions maps
will launch and you can get the exact
route to where they are so now that you
know how to make the most of Google
Latitude hopefully you'll have a better
way to track your friends when you're at
crazy places like CES if you have any
questions along the way hit me up on
