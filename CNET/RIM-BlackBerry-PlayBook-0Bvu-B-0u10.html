taking a first look at the blackberry
playbook from rim this is a 7 inch
tablet priced at $499 for a 16 gigabyte
version $599 for 32 gigabytes and $6.99
for 64 gigabytes this version here only
connects to the internet over Wi-Fi or a
tethered connection to your smart phone
but a 4G model is coming out later this
year the screen quality is nice there's
a pair of stereo speakers on the sides
here a 3 megapixel camera up top and a 5
megapixel camera on the back that can
also record video at 1080p
on the bottom you get connections for an
optional charging dock a microUSB port
for charging and syncing an HDMI port
that can also crank out smooth 1080p
video the top of the PlayBook is a sour
note for me there's a headphone jack and
a pair of stereo mics that's fine but
the power button if you can see it is
this little teeny tiny thing made for
baby fingers it's also the button you'll
need to use for waking the screen out of
sleep mode so you'll have to contend
with it every day we thought a case
might help but for us it actually made
the situation worse as for the tiny
volume and play/pause controls next to
it they do work but I'm not sure why
they're even up here or why I dedicated
play pause button is even necessary if
you can get past the tedious little
button the real centerpiece of this
whole thing is the OS this is a brand
new piece of software built by RIM from
the ground up it's fast it's fluid it
can multitask and juggle apps like a
maniac and if Apple and Google aren't
scared yet they probably should be a
favorite part of the whole system is the
web browser which fully supports Adobe
Flash and presents webpages just as they
would look on your desktop that means
flash video flash games and for better
for worse flash ads but as great as it
is the browser is trapped inside a
tablet that is half the size of the iPad
not to mention the 10 inch honeycomb
tablets that are due out this year some
may find the small size an advantage but
when it comes to full scale webpages and
document editing those tasks really
deserve a larger screen so that's the
BlackBerry PlayBook from rim a powerful
tablet at a good price and one of the
best 7-inch tablets we've seen even
though I wish it were bigger for
