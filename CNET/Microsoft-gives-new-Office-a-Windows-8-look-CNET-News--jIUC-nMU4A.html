the most vibrant exciting new version of
windows in years we complement it with
the most vibrant exciting new release of
office in years I've got PowerPoint up
and running here the first thing you'll
notice it's a very sleek a very clean
beautiful user experience I can use my
fingers to navigate as I'm on this touch
base device so i can just go ahead and
tap and go through my different slides
that are here maybe i'll drop into the
slide sorter mode i can do things as you
would expect like pinch and zoom so i
can zoom out or i can zoom into my
presentations so let me give you a look
at what the OneNote application will
look like if I want to enter content
there's a bunch of different ways to do
that of course i can use mouse and
keyboard but we also of course enable
the pen and stylist so i can go ahead
and write anywhere I want to over my
notes if I say hey you know this 930 is
wrong I'll just cross that out so let's
get together at ten o'clock my
handwriting is terrible here a little
nervous I can circle things that I think
are important i could annotate on the
map itself if we want to meet down here
at those particular points i can do
those sorts of things you get the idea
now like the rest of the office
applications sharepoint has a new user
interface as well much cleaner simpler a
design that's easy and intuitive for
people to get access to the tools that
they need now we share point in social
you can follow you can keep track of
anything all kinds of different content
over on the right here you can see the
listing of the people i'm following the
documents i'm following the sites i'm
following the tags i'm following i can
go ahead and just click and go into all
the documents and see the ones that i'm
looking at sharepoint will also suggest
documents that i should be following
based on the documents themselves and
the things that i have followed in the
past i want to show you an experience in
excel one of the ways that we're trying
to make every user in Excel a power user
the scenario I want to go through here
is a relatively common one for people
that are taking content from the web and
wanting to do some analysis on it this
is a spreadsheet it's got content that
in this middle column here this B column
you can see all the fields are
concatenate
together this is something that happens
you copy from the browser and you put it
into something like Excel and it's not
quite in the right format that you may
want it to be we have a new feature in
Excel that can help break apart that
content so you can go and do analysis on
it now historically people would
literally rekey that content or if they
were more advanced they might write
macros to go ahead and do that i want to
show you with a new feature called flash
feel how simple it can be in the new
Excel I'm going to go and pull out a
field let's say I want to pull out the
names of people I'll just go type john
and i'll type jenny and watch as i hit
enter that'll fill that entire column
all the way down with with that name
i'll show it to you one more time here
i'll type in advertising i'll pick a
different word and then events and again
fill that all the way down and notice
excels pretty smart here it gets that
digital marketing two words it smartly
pulls that out into the right column now
for the last demo i want to touch on one
final experience that i think is
particularly exciting as we think about
windows 8 as we think about a new class
of devices in office I want to go ahead
and join a meeting that's in progress
all its adlink meeting that's here I'll
go ahead and start that and this is
going to start in high definition
multi-party video conference just in one
click here Brian you there I'm there how
are you correct Brown you sound great
i'm going to go ahead and start my video
now let's say we've got this video
started i want to add somebody let's go
down the list here and we'll go ahead
and add sanji i can just drag and drop
her with my finger that's all it takes
and i can go ahead and add sandhya to
the meeting itself she'll pop up but a
quick second there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
