$10,000 Apple product in my hands I'm
talking about the Apple watch the
addition this is the goal the 18 karat
gold hey guys it's Vanessa and Arianna
from Siena to give you a closer look at
how the Apple watch works this one that
I'm holding here is the 38 millimeter
Editions made for smaller wrists but
there's also a 42 millimeter addition on
the side you'll see a home button and
the dial which you can use to scroll
within the watch so you can't lock the
screen with your finger the back is made
of the same material in this case the 18
karat gold and you'll find the heart
rate sensors and this leather watch
strap with a very easy to clasp the
buckle at the end the first screen
you'll see shows you the time and some
other information that you can customize
with the watch faces from the home
screen by tapping choose the Mickey
Mouse one that seemed to be so popular
to see the apps you press on the button
on the side here you'll see your apt
tray we're going to go into the music
app and you can scroll between albums
using this dial on the side which is
actually a lot more practical than
putting your finger all over the screen
just to look at your music below the
digital crown you'll find another button
pulls up a list of your favorite
contacts once I select a contact I have
the option to call message or do some
fun stuff like draw a picture send my
heart rate the other way to navigate is
by sliding up and pulling up this
carousel of information including your
heart rate
the Apple watch will be available
starting April 24th in stores I'm
