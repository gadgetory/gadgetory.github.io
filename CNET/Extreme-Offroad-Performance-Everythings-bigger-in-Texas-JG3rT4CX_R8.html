owner of extreme offered performance out
of katy texas basically we're a full
automotive customizing shop our
specialty is custom trucks you know we
do all things cars trucks SUVs ATVs all
that but our main specialty is big bad
truck so basically you come in with a
truck whatever make it maybe you have
this idea of this modification you're
interested in doing we help you do that
so we make your you know your dream or
your idea become a reality whether it's
something you already know you want or
something we help you design and build
that's what we're about we're extreme
and we build some of the wildest show
trucks and vehicles on the market and
you know in the show seen their daily
drivers I have guys that bring them to
like like parking garages and they have
to park outside because the truck so big
it won't fit in there you know there's
really no limit its its limit its it's
your imagination is you know we can take
it as far as we can from very very basic
to very very you know crazy and unique
just depending on its all depends on
what you want to do and your budget to
do it for example someone comes in wants
to build a full one of a kind show truck
best of the best we do full custom
suspension paintwork motor work interior
car audio custom lighting and we just
basically transform it from being a
stock vehicle to something that looks
nothing like anybody else has on the
road you know we've done chevy truck for
somebody before that's twin turbo and
full built you know 427 you know ls7
motor and thousand plus horsepower on it
you know in the united states trucks are
very very prominent among all the
manufacturers but more so down in the
south in texas i mean everybody uses
chucks for work or fun or you know going
hunting or going to the ranch
off-roading pulling their boat pulling
trailers hauling the family around
picking up stuff and you know they're
just all so they're a big nice car to
drive and people and you know enjoy
having them and you know the things you
can do to them are
limitless really with how crazy you want
to get with them especially in Texas
from what we know i mean the truck scene
is very very prominent just as much or
more than any of the sports car scene i
mean most most people that own us you
know sports car also own a truck so most
of them have a truck in everybody who
wants to modify their car also wants to
modify their truck the truck scene is
it's kind of funny it's you know who's
got the biggest and best stuff you see
it more like the car shows that's where
we see it the most you see guys with my
truck is bigger and I've got the baddest
paint job on it you know it's funny it's
really competitive biggest brightest
loudest you know everything's bigger in
Texas the bigger the better it's fun to
see everybody's look on their face you
know when they see the vehicle for the
first time or they get really excited
they ask us a lot of questions and I
think the best part is when you deliver
a finished product to the customer and
they're just blown away that's kind of
what it's all about I mean you work so
hard building these and creating this
stuff every day it's very rewarding and
you know very fun at the end of it to
see it traveling to a show or see it to
show up on a magazine cover you know see
somebody's excitement when they find see
the finished product of how excited they
are to you know what they've create you
know what we've helped them create what
it's become it's it's real enjoyable
some of these full full projects where
we basically take a brand-new truck
strip everything off of it you know
powder coat and paint you know all the
axles in the frame suspension do the
paint jobs interior I mean they average
Lee take two to three months to build
working on them every single day there's
just that much detail on that much you
know that many parts and them from
outside and in that you have to touch on
them so it's just very time-consuming
that was a truck that you know I built
for me personally for the SEMA Show a
few years ago and then an NFL player
ended up buying it from us that he
really liked it and he saw it on the
cover magazine and he wanted it but I
try to make everything unique in its own
way like um you know all out of my big
show cars you know similar to that one
they have custom paint jobs and custom
colors so i'll make a theme will do
different color schemes or what have you
in the artwork i always try to put
something personal and they're like
whether it's you know my initials or you
know how now when there's one of my dogs
airbrushed in there in the background
just some some little personal piece
incorporating it incorporated into it
that makes it unique from you know what
everyone else has and i can be like look
this is something that's mine personal
that i put in there it's a full
kelderman air ride system it's fully
automated probe press of a button you
can go from a six-inch live to a 10-inch
lift to a 14 inch lift it's got three
settings on there it's one of the top of
the line suspensions on the market right
now a lot of guys like it because you
press that button and drop down the lift
and you can actually park it in your
garage that kind of stuff it's it's
convenient and at the same time you can
show off whenever you want to you know
we've done a full paint job it's got the
road armor front and rear bumpers it's
got our bp's grill on there you know
we've done all the interior it's got
Rockford Fosgate sound system in there
and then we've got of course you know
the bigger wheels and tires 40 inch toyo
open country mud terrain tires and it's
got the fuel off road wheels on there in
there I think they're 22 by 14 so it's
pretty wide wheel and tire combination
to which gives it that aggressive stance
so the white and pink jeep we you know
we went to SEMA last year we saw a
couple different people doing some white
and pink themes and you know we said you
know we need to do something like that
and just kind of put our own touch on it
Austin decided he wants to build
something nice for his wife and that
thing has been a real eye-catcher you
know it stops everybody's wife it stops
our customers it stops you know
everybody because they look at it and
you see a white and pink jeep you're
like what is this man it's the Barbie
mobile you know but it's fully decked
out I mean I I I wouldn't mind driving
it every day you know it's even though
it's got the pink on there it's it's
it's a really nice Jeep for all the
suspension and the work that we put into
it I mean it's it's very well rounded
and good built its got like a bedazzled
box in there it's got the two kicker
Wolfers in there and like the full
interior we did like some nice leather
kit and we hydro dipped all the panels
in like a pink zebra we also did that
under the hood it's you know it's a
little flashy but I mean that's what we
did we built it you know to break next
to stop people and they hey what is that
I've never seen something like that
before so I think it does the job yeah I
mean we've made so many crazy ones but
you know one of my favorites I always
try to outdo myself each time you know
the ones that I personally do for myself
and like I said a lot of times they're
always built for the SEMA Show or for a
magazine or something like that I try to
you know do something different every
time but get better and better at it and
use newer newer stuff each time for
example one of the ones I did last year
for the SEMA Show was a Dodge that I
built 2500 and it was on a 16 inch lift
and it was all Lamborghini orange
underneath and crazy you know clown
paint job on the side and full interior
custom sound system and it was one of
the most most time-consuming detail
builds that we've ever done in it I mean
it that truck the popularity and the
exposure that trucks gotten is just
unreal i mean it's every day it's
popping up on something I mean it's just
I spent a lot of time and a lot of
attention to detail you know making sure
every aspect of the thing was just
perfect and you know every everything on
it had detail touched on it and you know
that's that's the end result is just to
make it something that everybody is just
crazy about at the end of the day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
