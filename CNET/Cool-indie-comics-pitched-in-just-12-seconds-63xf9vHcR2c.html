comic book adventures of spider-man
Batman and that lots but what about all
those lesser-known comic book heroes
we've come to MCM London Comic Con to
give authors of indie comics 12 seconds
to pitch their creations check it out
so tell me what is your comic book and
why is it cool go
it's called pride in my appearance and
it's a fantasy story about two girls
start going to boat together
that was only seven seconds anything
else to add it's got hairy armpits in it
so tell us what is your comic and why is
it cool go my comic is called Almere and
it's cool because it's about a nation of
people with supernatural powers that
tries to change the world in their own
specific way well that was exactly 11
seconds well done thank you I do try
what is your comic and why is it called
go my name is Elliott that my comic is
hundred-meter garden and it's about four
friends who move into a South London
flats and there's something quite
sinister going on but we don't know an
awful lot about it yet that's 12 second
so what's the comic and why is it cool
go jabba crow and it's a watercolour
comic and completing hand-drawn 50 years
all the 12 cities are forced to go to
war for the amusement of the gods the
Badger king must scheme his way out of
prison and that's just 12 seconds that's
Michael did you say badger king I said
badger king can we get a shot of the
badger king
so what's your comic and why is it cool
go and it's about a young girl who's
finds herself trapped within a world
inside the mirror and she has to find a
way out before it's too late
that was just under 11 seconds so what
is this comic and why is it cool go
mom it's called fetish man it's about
alternative human sexuality it's a
superhero code fetish man who fails to
fight crime because he's in a very
restrictive outfit he pulls over a lot
that was only 10 seconds well done great
insight glad I could help
what is this comic and why is it called
go and it's a diesel punk comic it's
about a war between two nations and
about the super soldiers that they make
and a young girl who runs away from her
village comes back and has to fight
alongside it that's two seconds go it's
called car and it's relentless balls to
the wall fantasy Punk with goblins and
robots and punches and it was
kick-started in October of last year and
this is the launch so what is this comic
and why is it cool go
it's called rents to the dead and it's a
zombie comedy sort of clerks meets short
of the dead it's only eight seconds very
concise my comic is friendly fruit it's
about a banana and a strawberry are best
friends and they gonna ventures together
when they run out of cookies in the
house and that's about it really
this is the story of the moon the moon
drops out the sky early hours of every
morning puts on a suit takes out a gun
fights ridiculous crime he's been doing
now for 2,000 years ever since a fox
drunken Celtic ceremony in 12 ad it was
