inside a smaller iPhone 5s body better
processor better camera tinier size now
if you had a larger screen phone you
might find it hard to go back like me
but other people might have already had
an iPhone 5s how does it feel it's kind
of a personal decision so we give it to
a lot of different people to use it
Steen do tiny when I move my thumb
across I can get down to the phone
button so it's easy for me to navigate
screen it feels a lot like the iPhone 5s
I have a 4s still so I guess
comparatively anything's gonna feel a
little bit lighter and smaller sits my
hand oh girl for me it's all about the
the one-handed being able to navigate
with my phone it feels a little more
dense like I like the reason why one of
the reasons why I like the 4s is because
of the density of it like this one I can
feel it in there
it's a little heavier than my phone but
that gives me some security like I'm
gonna lose it like it's not really there
but that's how phones are supposed to be
they're supposed to peaceful I'm
watching media then yeah I would want a
bigger screen when I open up Safari I
would love a little bit bigger of a
screen I've gotten used to the six plus
screen size so much so that I rarely use
my iPad now this feels a little long
like if there's a little out of range
even my hands are like that small it's
fine
neither here nor there it's
a lot smaller than the phone I have now
there are a couple of subtle differences
between the SE the 6s and the 6s plus
better battery life more stabilized
camera and price increase but for the
most part the differences here are all
about size I definitely go the plus
that's fine
go I'm turning my back on my phone if I
had to choose between these three I'll
probably choose this one this is what's
way too big for me like I I don't want
it I want I always want to have a hand
for you I feel like with these you
always have to have two hands on the
phone it's just a little too big for me
so this is the winner</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
