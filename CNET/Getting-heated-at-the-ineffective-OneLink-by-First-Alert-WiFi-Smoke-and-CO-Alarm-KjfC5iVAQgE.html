alarm to be fast right fire safety isn't
something that needs to be prompt if you
feel that way then you should absolutely
go ahead and buy the one link by First
Alert Wi-Fi smoke and co alarm the thing
is the smoke alarm itself isn't bad the
hardware here is fine First Alert has a
long pedigree of doing this and that
shows it's very responsive on all of our
smoke tests the alarm was going off in
sync or earlier than the other smoke
alarms we were testing it against but
you're not paying a hundred and twenty
dollars for this thing in order to get a
smoking carbon monoxide detector you can
get those for thirty dollars for forty
dollars you can even get ones that talk
for that much the reason you're paying
the premium is for the smarts and the
smarts on this thing just aren't there
yet ninety seconds this thing takes 90
seconds to deliver a push notification
really all you can do with voice
commands is ask it if the smoke alarm or
carbon monoxide alarm has detected
anything if it has I'd hope you'd get a
push notification so why would you need
a voice alert to do the same thing the
other smart feature I was excited about
is that it works with the dumb hardwired
smoke alarms in your house so in other
words in theory you only need to replace
one smarten all the rest of them except
like with the normal push alerts it
takes forever for that to happen so look
the hardware here works and once the app
gets a few updates this could actually
be a pretty good device but right now
it's really not it can detect smoke it
can detect carbon monoxide but so can
machines that cost half the price</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
