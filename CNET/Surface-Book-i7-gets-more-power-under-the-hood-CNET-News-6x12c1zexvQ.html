most powerful surface book yet by far it
has over two times more graphics than
the highest-end surface books queue on
market today so we're doubling the
performance it essentially has three
times more than that of them the highest
end MacBook Pro 13 so just to put it in
context it pushes the full 1.9 teraflops
but we didn't just update the processor
on this product we made two fundamental
moves improvements all essential to the
details the first thing I really need to
point out is this isn't just picking up
a processor and dropping it in I mean
that's not what we're talking about we
had to make full thermal redesigns of
the product but one of the critical
dimensions of the product happens to be
the envelope the design we talk about
how people love the versatility and
that's why the customer satisfaction is
so high but all that versatility don't
forget always comes as something you
want to be proud to hold something that
you believe is beautiful something you
want to show other people that's just
the truth and product and so we double
the performance we redesigned the entire
thermal system from the inside we add
essentially a second fan but we able to
move air faster than ever before with a
set of hyperbolic cooling fins in the
back of the product so therefore we can
pump up that performance for you and
give you everything you need here's the
other thing we did fairly simple we put
more batteries in the product
we gave you 16 hours of battery-life 16
now surface book is pound for pound
without any doubt the most performant
laptop on market without any doubt there
is no other product nothing that has
that level of battery that level of
competition that many pixels in that
like that like form factor nothing it
really is the ultimate laptop I hope you
like it I hope you like it we really
think you will you can pre-order it
today no doubt get out there and
pre-order it you're gonna get this
product in November and it's for the
people really pushing performance this
is it this is the top and product that
we want if you want the top end go after
it but here's the deal
not everybody needs all that performance
they just want that performance and
versatility there's a surface out there
for every single person I'm sure of it
don't forget that and what the creators
update coming and when you see these
products continuously getting better
moving faster helping you drive hard or
bringing everything there is to surface
at the table if you haven't tried a
surface
please go get your hands on one get out
there and get one they start at $8.99 on
surface pro and then you can get into
surface book for $14.99</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
