spinning from all the tech in cars today
they often ask me what's coming next
that's what I get them a long look and
decide if they can handle the truth I
think you can I'm Bryan Cooley with my
top five future car tech innovations not
a bunch of sci-fi but this is tech that
is the next revolution and just about to
go big I'm gonna rank these roughly in
order of eminence
number five bio monitoring from the Ford
AOS concept we saw recently they can
tell if you're having a health crisis to
possible new federal regulations that
might require passive alcohol detectors
in all new cars our vehicles are getting
their virtual hands all over us toward
the goal of safer driving but you know
one day it's going to tell you you're
fattening ass is killing its fuel
economy and then the next big car tech
trend begins be hickey aside number four
parcel autonomy that means partial
self-driving the road to self-driving
cars goes through the valley of semi
self-driving cars first today already
well equipped Volvo's and infinities can
roughly 70% drive themselves under many
conditions but Cadillac is going to
press the matter soon with something it
calls super cruise control automating
the accelerator the brakes steering lane
maintenance and adaptive cruise control
there's not much left for you to do
except remain liable if the whole thing
chokes number 3 LCD instrument panels
let's face it dial gauges in the dash
today are about as up-to-date as later
hosen in the boardroom Jags and Land
Rovers were among the first mainstream
cars to go all LCD with their
instruments but out of the reach of most
of us price-wise but today when I stroll
the car shows and I see the Chevy Sparky
V or the new Cadillac CTS with gauge
las' instruments the race is on to dial
out the dials number two is apps now
cars with connected apps were exotic
literally just twelve months ago now it
actually causes doubting murmurs
car-show when a new model is introduced
without them kia soul Ford Fiestas Prius
C they names spell app and not in
rarified air this is becoming standard
equipment but the number one next big
car tech innovation is natural voice
command that's right
one day voice commanding cars will
actually work car makers seem to know
their systems are pretty lame compared
to smartphones and they're making big
strides not just because they love you
by the way but also because they want to
keep the feds off their back and great
voice command will help manage
distraction take a look at BMWs iDrive
4.2 using an amazing version of Dragon
Drive or Chevy and Honda first with an
Apple Siri button on the steering wheel
all of this gets real close to just
plain talking to your car without that
weird stilted grammar you have to look
up in the owners manual the more natural
the conversation the lower the cognitive
distraction I make this one number one
because it makes almost everything else
in the car better and safer stay on top
of high-tech cars and modern driving
with the only show that's devoted to
strictly that CNET on cars at CNET on
cars.com i'm brian coulis thanks for
watching
