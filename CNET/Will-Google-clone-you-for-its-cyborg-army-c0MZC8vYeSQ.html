to the buzz report the show about the
tech news that everyone is talking about
this week Google really knows who you
are the iphone 4s is like an app that
prints money and the bestest xbox ever
coming soon but first is the getch of
the week the gadget of the week is the
droid razr maxx arriving in verizon
stores this week the razr maxx is pretty
much the same as the old droid razr and
by old i mean the one that came out like
three months ago but the razr maxx has a
bigger battery but it's not actually
physically bigger it's just a new
battery that lasts way longer but the
phone is still almost exactly the same
as the one that you already paid 300
bucks for three months ago but seriously
you didn't want all day battery life and
20 hours of talk time with your other
razor anyway that's just like a special
thing that only some people want right
no everyone wants that man this phone
kind of pisses me off the battery thing
is cool though it actually really is
cool maybe all phones could have that
someday anyway now for the news google
introduced new privacy changes this week
that unify all the company's various
services so Google can now share
information about you across all of its
sites and services so gmail ads will
know about your YouTube videos picasa
ads will know about your search history
maybe the ads in your phones Google Maps
app could be based on your recent
check-ins on google+ the policy will not
include information from google chrome
books or wallet however you can't opt
out of any of these changes you're
sharing everything across every Google
site now and that's just the deal soho
you know internet freaked out I admit my
first thought was what's the big deal
this actually sounds like the kind of
unified integrated business strategy
that Google has needed for years I mean
what a good idea but since the people at
Google are such robots they got all
nerdgasm II about the cool stuff that
they could do once they know everything
about you and they put it in a blog post
so obviously everyone freaked right the
hell out including members of Congress
listen Google I know that you're
planning to make a digital cyborg copy
of me and your secret headquarters any
day now
fine it's only probably half as skeevy
is everything that Facebook is doing but
maybe just try to keep it on the
down-low PR wise like just tell me and
everyone that it's for streamlining and
efficiency and then stop talking also
don't let my cyborg copy kill me that
would not be cool interestingly Google
actually missed its quarterly earnings
expectations this week for the first
time and who knows how long not so with
Apple however holy Hannah they printed
money this quarter 46 billion dollars in
revenue and 13 billion dollars was pure
profit all pretty much thanks to iphone
4s the revenue blew away even apples
expectations in fact they even sold a
record high number of max this quarter
5.2 million that explains why my
facebook feed right now is suddenly full
of people asking hey who here bought
Apple at a hundred bucks want to buy me
a yacht I did not in case you were
wondering stupid ethics moving on if
weird things were happening with your
gadgets or TV the power and you're
building stuff like that don't worry
it's just death from above the biggest
solar storm in eight years pummeled
earth this week causing aurora borealis
across Canada Britain even as far south
as Oregon the storm was said to be even
stronger than originally predicted in
fact flights near both poles had to be
rerouted for two days as a result of
satellite and radio interference also my
ATM card would not work yesterday and
I'm convinced that's why I'm just saying
all right some quick headlines from the
tech news this past week new rumors
suggest a new Xbox coming in fall 2013
the xbox 720 will reportedly be six
times more powerful than the current
xbox and twenty percent more powerful
than the upcoming wii u sadly the
manners of all those foul mouth
misogynist homophobic juveniles on xbox
live will be zero percent improved at
long last the co-ceos of research in
motion stepped down this past weekend
the news went public right in the middle
of the extremely close playoff game
between the New York Giants and the San
Francisco 49ers entering that most of
the tech media was otherwise occupied
and yeah at this point I cared all
exactly enough to retweet the news about
half an hour later good luck new guy
anonymous says it's targeting facebook
again the loose consortium of the
planets hackers said Facebook is going
down on january 28 my sources tell me
that's unlikely mainly because even
though anonymous managed to take out the
CIA the Justice Department and the FBI
websites with their op mega upload hack
this week Facebook is a whole different
ball game compete Facebook is big and
that's a buzz report for this week
everyone I'm Mollywood and thank you for
