4 madness on the streets of New York
City motorola shows off the droid x the
xbox 360 goes on a diet and our
definitive first look at the new iphone
it's all coming up right now
hey everyone I'm Hollywood and welcome
to the cnet tech review the show where
we run down the hottest videos of the
week tell you which ones are good which
ones are bad and offer some tech wisdom
in the form of the bottom line let's get
started with the good it seems like just
weeks ago we were standing here talking
about the announcement of Apple's iPhone
4 and now finally after two whole weeks
it's here CNET's Maggie Reardon was on
hand Thursday morning in New York when
the iphone 4 went on sale hi I'm Maggie
ridden with cnet com and i'm here at the
apple store on Fifth Avenue where the
fourth generation iphone is about to go
on sale even though there were some
hiccups earlier this month with
pre-orders it doesn't seem to have
dampen enthusiasm in fact people have
been camped out for days waiting for the
new phone as you can see there are
hundreds of people the line is wrapped
around the block what has brought you
out on this hot day standing in line
waiting for the iphone why iphone 4
because all the iphones are the greatest
and i flew away from chicago just to be
in New York cuz I never been in New York
and I want an iphone in New York so here
I am if you buy a song on iTunes it goes
straight to your phone I don't gotta
sync up multitasking and folders
everything do you realize some of these
things you could have gotten just with
the upgrade to your 3gs yeah I know how
many iPhones are you getting well two
will come into my house as we speak and
I'm online for the third one which
features are you most excited about with
the new iphone 4 new style the shape of
it to practice a little bit lighter and
the fact that it's 4g well did you know
that's actually not 4g it's it's just
the fourth generation dude does that
change your mind no I still like the
fact that it's a different look see some
when you're talking to over the phone
kind of late with the Jetsons
is about sound a growing after cell
phone of the way for every year I'm
really excited about the video chatting
feature because my dad's in Atlanta he's
getting one today too so we'll be able
to talk to each other I'm just looking
to be cool and it's really hard at my
age but I'll try he tried to pre-order
your act on what happened it was very
hectic you again error messages I guess
we know the different kosas we're just
trying to preorder oil at the same time
we tried to pre-order and just the
system failure and so you know we
decided that we would come down meet
people enjoy the festivities actually
seen it has been the place where I have
brokered most of my information about
technology as well as the iphone i'm in
the apple store in a steady stream of
customers are coming in to get their new
phones unlike years past the activation
process has been going pretty smoothly
customers are in and out about 20 to 25
minutes what are your first impression
it's amazing it's really fast and it
works really efficiently in what's your
favorite feature now that you have it in
your hands I think the camera actually
you just got your phone you're here with
your friend um and you're going to try
out the facetime adeline let's see how
it goes goes Chris what's your phone
number your friend doesn't have AT&amp;amp;T
service in the Apple Store not the
problem AT&amp;amp;T sucks they can have it on
verizon it'd be awesome to me for me
really good but a teensy is hard well I
don't get service in my house can you
believe that in my house so far folks
you've been playing around with the
phone are very happy with the exception
of a few glitches trying to get its new
feature store I'm just wondering what
Apple's going to do
next year maybe they'll just bring it to
verizon I'm Maggie Riordan with CNN com
so which do you think was more of a
hassle waiting in line for however many
hours are trying to get through the
pre-order process either way there's got
to be an easier way to buy a phone and
in other really tiny computer that makes
phone calls news Motorola has stepped up
its game with a new droid in fact they
held a big party for the sole purpose of
unveiling the droid x to our very own
Bonnie cha and like a few other people
hi everyone I'm Bonnie tuck senior
editor at cnet com and I'm here with
your first look at the motorola droid x
for verizon this is the carrier's newest
droid device and i'm gonna walk you
through the design really quick on front
you've got a 4.3 inch wvga capacitive
touchscreen looks really gorgeous it's
running a revised version of motoblur so
it's not quite like the cliq or anything
like that it's a very subdued which I
like a lot better below the screen
you've got four hard buttons you got the
menu button the HOME key back and search
on the side here we've got the microUSB
port as well as an hdmi port so you will
be able to hook it up to an HDTV and
watch video as well as your photos
speaking of photos it has an 8 megapixel
camera and can record 720p video so it's
HD video there is no front-facing camera
but Motorola has said that they will
come out with other devices with front
facing cameras later on here on the left
side there's a volume rocker and also a
dedicated camera key and finally on top
we've got a power button and a 3.5
millimeter headphone jack now as far as
software like I said it's running
motoblur it's gonna launch with android
2.1 but android 2.2 froyo will be coming
to the droid x as well as the droid
later this summer and this will also
bring the flash 10 capabilities for the
other things on here all the wireless
oxygens 3g bluetooth gps as well as
Wi-Fi and you can use the joy 2x as a
mobile hotspot for up to five devices
but that will run you in additional
twenty dollars a month on top of the $30
data plan just FYI multimedia is going
to be huge on this so they are launching
with a dedicated blockbuster app a lot
like the hd2 so you can rent and buy
movies from the phone it'll also have V
CAST video as well as NFL mobile and all
other verizon services the droid x will
be available starting to buy 15 for 1 99
99 with a two-year contract and after a
hundred dollar mail-in rebate and it'll
also be available other retail outlets
I'm Bonnie Tom this has been your first
look at the motorola droid x for verizon
that is a good-looking phone but see
Bonnie just reminded me that I am still
waiting for my Froyo why can't it just
be here already come on moving on during
Microsoft's Xbox 360 keynote at e3 last
week it was announced that everyone in
attendance would receive one of the
brand new slimmer xboxes brian Tong was
there and his 360 showed up in the mail
on Monday so now here's his first look
Brian song here with cnet com and this
is a first look at the new xbox 360 250
gig model so let's take a look at some
of its cosmetics it's now sporting a
piano black finish that's really a
fingerprint magnet it has more of an
edgy design with sharp lines and vents
but this is clearly a more male gear
design now this new 360 is packed with a
250 gig hard drive and built-in Wi-Fi
with 802 11 n microsoft says it's a
whisper quiet and it's definitely
quieter compared to the previous 360
model which is a good thing for Xbox
errs now on the front side the buttons
on the 360 are all touch sensitive now
there are no physical buttons here so
two powered up just press your finger on
the silver button and it fires up to
open up the game disc tray you just
swipe your finger over this little notch
and you'll also be able to find two USB
ports here on the front on the side the
hard drive is different so it won't be
interchangeable with your old one all
you have to do is pop this side plate
off and then just pull this tab to pop
out the 250 gig drive
you have the xbox transfer cable you can
use it to move your game saves and files
over from your old xbox to this new one
but if you don't there will be one
available for 1999 now if we flip it to
the back you'll see your connection for
power optical audio the standard a/v
connection for the 360 composite or
component cables and HDMI this port here
is an auxiliary connection specifically
for Microsoft's Kinect previous models
will have to plug in the connect with
USB and then have a separate cable
running to power and you'll find your
Ethernet and three additional
connections giving the 360 a total of
five now when you compare the new xbox
side by side with the previous model
Microsoft has cut off some of the fat
with the design it actually can fit
inside of the original 360 and they've
trimmed down the sides of the power
supply as well the new xbox 360 retails
for 299 and his new redesign packs more
value into the system for the same price
i'm brian Tong for cnet com with their
first look at the xbox 360 250 gig model
we also found out this week that the
xbox will no longer suffer from the
dreaded red ring of death because they
took out the little red LEDs yeah it's
kind of like the way taxi drivers cover
up their check engine light with a piece
of paper they do that as we learned last
week one of the major highlights from e3
was microsoft kinect for xbox which
allows players to put down their
controllers and just jump around like
total goof balls so here's Jeff Bakalar
with his hands off first look
hey what's going on everyone on Jeff
Bakalar for sina com we've got a first
look here with Microsoft Kinect
Microsoft's motion control system that
they unveiled at e3 2010 had some first
hands-on with two games connect joyride
and I also got to play kinect adventures
there's a little bit of a learning curve
with all the new motion control there's
no physical control involves you're
gonna have to learn how to sort of play
the game without anything in your hands
it's a lot of fun you're going to get a
good workout because you're moving
around a lot and we played a few games I
was a big fan of Kinect Adventures had
me in a raft and I was jumping around to
collect pins there's a lot of fun you
really have to move around a lot it's
not just your hands you have to move
your entire body around really good time
also got the check out connect Joyride
which is a racing game where you use
both your hands to control the car
you're driving and body motion to create
boosts and to perform tricks while your
cars in the air had a lot of fun with
that too so that's our first look at
Microsoft Kinect you could try it out
for yourself when it comes out November
fourth for the xbox 360 I'm Jeff Bakalar
for cnet com thanks for watching
hi I'm Scott sign and it's the first
look at officemax 2011 preview now Mac
users might want an experience with
office that matches a little more of
what you can get out of office for
windows and the good news is that later
this year officemax looks like it's
gonna be promising an experience that's
a lot like office for windows and gives
a few new wrinkles and features that we
haven't seen before notably outlook and
one of the advantages of outlook should
be that the database file is actually
going to be saved as a bunch of files
instead of one large one what that means
it's easier spotlight searching and in
addition should work better with time
machine now on the Microsoft Word side a
cool thing is that it works a lot more
seamlessly with Microsoft's web apps now
Apple has a lot of great software but
one thing they're not so fantastic with
us working in the cloud one nice thing
about word on office mac 2011 is that it
works seamlessly with microsoft's web
apps allowing you to save to its its
cloud environment and also pull
documents off from light editing to
actually bring it down in a word for
more full-featured editing we'll find
out a lot more as we get closer you
should expect it later this year and it
should be a nice surprise for anybody
who's looking to really turn their Mac
into a full office machine I'm Scott
Stein and this has been a first look at
officemax 2011 preview so Jeff gets to
play xbox and Scott has to talk about
office for mac sorry Scott you got host
still on the fence trying to decide if
it's time to upgrade to an iphone 4 well
if you've got an iphone 3g or 3gs or
even a newer ipod touch you too can
start using some of the iphone 4s
features right now in fact here are some
tips from brian Tong for you to enjoy
while your update is downloading
many of you have loaded your iphone or
ipod touch with the latest iOS four and
you're playing around with all the new
features like multitasking and folders
but there are a lot of hidden gems you
might not know about in the settings
with the latest OS you now have the
ability to turn off your cell phone data
usage while still using the phone just
for calls and text messages all you have
to do is go into your settings then
general and then network and you'll see
the cellular data option and this is a
big deal for people who want to save
data now I'm messaging on my phone a lot
and there's a couple new features here
as well go to your messages settings and
then you can turn on the character count
function if you're on a tight text
message plan you'll be able to tell if
you're about to go over the character
limit and avoid an extra message from
being sent you also have the ability to
search through your messages so if you
don't see it just pull down to reveal
the search bar type in a word and voila
there are your messages with that word
in them and while we're talking about
search when using the universal search
in iOS four when you type in a word you
now have the ability to search the web
or Wikipedia for that term now let's
shift over to photos your pictures can
be organized into albums but if you sync
your iphone with apples iphoto your
pictures can also be organized by faces
and places and it's just kind of fun to
see where your pictures have been taken
on a map moving it around and looking at
all of them and to any pictures in your
camera roll that you decide to email
right after you hit the send button
you'll see a prompt that lets you choose
the size of the picture that you can
send off i'm brian Tong for cnet com and
there's still more iOS secrets we have
for you and you might even find some for
yourself so use them wisely
i know brian has a few more tricks up
his sleeve but it is time for a break
we'll be back with more iOS four secrets
and a lot more right after this
welcome back to the cnet tech review
your weekly digest of all things good
and bad from cnet TV before we get to
that which is bad here's another batch
of secrets to help you get the most out
of iOS four hey guys i'm brian Tong from
cnet com and i'm back with more little
secrets you might not know about that
are hidden inside of iOS four now i know
this may not be the sexiest one but
anyone with an iphone 3gs third gen ipod
touch or the new iphone can now take
advantage of iOS force data protection
feature that enhances the built-in
hardware encryption all you have to do
is go to your settings then general and
passcode and create one once you do that
scroll down to the bottom and you should
see data protection is enabled and you
are good to go now folders is a big deal
for iOS four fans but a fun little trick
is that you can now bring folders down
into the dock as well and access them
from there in the mail app the new
threaded emails is a favorite feature of
mine but you might not like it so in
your settings go to mail contacts and
calendars and you can toggle on or off
the organized by thread option once
inside the actual mail app you'll also
see that contact pictures will display
within the email in the corner which is
a nice little touch now we all play
music on our iphones and ipod touches
and you can now create and edit your own
playlists directly in the music app and
they will sink back to your computer the
next time you connect it this is another
killer feature and if you're also
searching for songs by album there's a
whole new layout with artwork and
additional information now if you're the
type of person who thinks lyrics or
podcasts information just gets in the
way you can turn them off in your
settings by going to iPod and switching
off the lyrics and podcast info option
I'm Brian song for cnet com with another
batch of iOS four tips for you use them
wisely
I think I'm gonna stick with my on the
go 17 playlist I love that one oh hey
this screen changed I guess it's time
for the bad so many phones play HD video
these days it's shocking but are you
worried that your portable device does
too much well if you get yourself a cool
TV video player that will never be a
problem again hey I'm Tom Bell for CNN
com and today we're taking a first look
at the kula TV this is a touchscreen
portable TV priced at one hundred ninety
nine dollars that streams video over a
Wi-Fi internet connection you get access
to over four hundred channels from all
over the world and all the content is
free the premise is pretty neat but the
execution needs some help design-wise
you get a 4.3 inch screen with decent
viewing angles but it's a little dim and
there's no way to adjust the brightness
on the top yeah buttons for volume and
power and a fold-out antenna that one
seems a little odd for a Wi-Fi device to
doesn't help much with reception and
three uses a fragile plastic design you
may as well glue this thing down and
pretend it isn't there on the back
there's a speaker and a reset switch and
on the side is a headphone jack microSD
slot USB port and a socket for the
included power adapter which you'll need
for charging the internal battery you
also get two gigabytes of internal
memory which you can use to load up
photos music or videos though the sound
quality isn't great and videos lack any
kind of control for pause skipper rewind
as far as the interface goes they kept
things simple with only four options on
the main menu streaming TV stored media
clock and settings the settings page
really only has one useful option for
configuring the Wi-Fi connection but it
works and it gives you a little keyboard
for inputting passwords we wish that
same keyboard would have made its way to
the TV section though as a way for
searching through all the stations for
something worth watching instead
stations are listed by language location
or category which can make for a lot of
trial and error for example to look up a
local California station I can select
USA but then all the stage
for alaska arizona california and other
states get lumped together once you
select the station it will buffer and
play after a few seconds but video
quality is unpredictable and sometimes
choppy to the point of being unwatchable
even when signal strength is good our
experience overall was disappointing the
same price and ipod touch includes more
features better design and arguably
offers just as much free video content
when you factor in podcasts and video
apps you also have the option to buy and
directly download premium TV content on
an ipod touch which is something that
the cool TV doesn't offer so that's the
cool of TV from sun Gail you like the
idea of taking the world's free
streaming TV content and putting it in
your pocket but for this price the
hardware and the UI just doesn't cut it
Christina calm I'm Donnell bell so yeah
good idea bad execution sorry kula and
that brings us to this week's bottom
line so far this week we've seen people
online waiting for the iphone people
buying the iphone tips for using the
iphone well i think the time has come to
pass judgment on the iphone 4 so here's
kent german to do just that hi I'm Kent
German senior editor here at cnet com
today with say a first look at the Apple
iPhone 4 this of course is Apple's
newest iPhone has a lot of new features
has a redesign first we're gonna take it
out of box though just pop it off the
top their annual there it is so from the
start you see this is a very different
iPhone and design take it off the lid
there and inside you have a course a
small instruction sheet you get the
small wall plug that we've seen a normal
USB cable and the standard iphone
earbuds so pretty standard as far as the
box goes now will the iphone 3g and 3gs
merely were tweaks of that original
iphones design this is a lot different
it's flat on both the front and the back
so the nice thing is is it doesn't well
but when you put it on the table anymore
we can pair at the iphone 3g that we
have here you'll see that it is a bit
thinner it's actually a 25-percent
thinner apple says this is a thinnest
smartphone around that certainly may be
true for now but you know the thin
iphone the thin smartphone race changes
constantly so i don't think we'll hold
that title for long it does have
glass on the front and on the back I do
notice the back of particular tracks a
lot of smudges and fingerprints that we
didn't see on the previous phone so you
want to watch that you see a metal band
and circling the entire phone it
actually is a new antenna as well you do
see a couple of notches on the top on
the side but its Apple didn't say that
this would improve call quality they
didn't actually promise that perhaps
this redesign is an effort to make those
things better some of the other changes
to see is there's a new noise
cancellation microphone here right on
the top that's next to the 3.5 mm at
headset jack and the power switch here
on the side the sim tray which used to
be on the top is moved to the side of
course that is a micro-sim slot the
volume rocker has been redesigned it's
now split volume buttons a small change
but I like it actually the silence
button has been read them just a little
bit about you to barely notice it and
down here in the bottom you see that
same 30 pin connector jack the speaker
and the microphone and of course the
home button is completely the same the
phone is four point eight ounces so it
actually is the same way as the original
iphone the iphone 3g and iphone 3gs were
just a little bit lighter you don't
really notice it it definitely is
smaller though and I Lotus how mediately
taken out of the box it is a bit narrow
and measured across the front face and I
already told you that it is thinner I do
think that when i look at it alone it
certainly looks small and of course you
particularly notice it when you put the
phone side-by-side a couple other
changes in design you see that there's a
camera right here that is a VGA camera
you can use that for self portraits or
for the facetime video calling feature
it is 5 megapixel it also records HD
video the iphone 4s and the first
handset to offer this feature but it
certainly works well we recorded some
quick videos and they looked really
great there's still no white balance or
brightness or color tones or anything
like that but kind of used to seeing
that from Apple but never really taken
the camera and add a lot of
customization with it but I think what
these updated certainly makes a camera
pretty good along with the new camera
you will know a couple tweaks to the
interface there is the control for the
flash you also see a small control for
switching between the front and rear
cameras so everything is really
accessible in front so it's pretty cool
the facetime feature is Apple's new
video calling feature that's of course
the video chat service that you can use
with another iphone 4 person and be able
to chat over the air it do you need to
be on Wi-Fi to use it just for the time
being they say through the end of this
year the video can be a little pixelated
it can be a little jerky I think it
works pretty well though and it's
certainly fun
I just can't imagine it lasting much
past the novelty stage yeah the other
restriction is don't get too close also
we need to talk about that display of
course this is apples Retina display and
the reason they call that is they think
they say that it's resolution is beyond
what's perceivable by the human eye
there's been some debate about whether
that's really true but I can say that
the display is absolutely stunning you
can't see any pixels at all colors are
fantastic text looks great websites
photos videos everything I was looking
at was really really great when you put
it next to you really need to get zoom
in to see it but you do see a definite
difference there Apple certainly stepped
up the display and made something that's
really competitive so glad to see that
the iphone four does have a new
processor and from the start I can tell
you that it was completely faster doing
anything opening apps going between
menus especially that camera shutter
actually that was really really quick
but this phone is certainly faster than
what we've seen before as I said the
iphone four does have a bigger battery
of course we haven't had done a full
battery drain yet but interest in the
brief testing I've done it seems like
it's doing it well with the multi task
and we saw with iOS four there of course
is the concern that that will put a
drain on the battery faster I've the way
Apple Design multi-tasking they say that
its nascent going to do that and I
haven't found anything yet but it's
always nice to see a bigger battery so
certainly welcome those of course the
feature wise to the iphone 4 brings a
lot of things and with the added iOS
four it brings even more I won't get
into the iOS four changes here but if
you want to learn more about the iOS
four changes i did a first look at the
Iowas for so you can check that out on
the whole this is the biggest upgrade to
the iphone since the iphone 3g I think
we've took them independently if you
took the iphone 4 you took the AOS for
you took those independently they be
great but we need to add them together
you really come with a compelling sleek
and really nice device of course there
are so many great smart phones out there
so not going to say that it's the best
is to do that to do that would really
ignore so many smartphones and how fast
the technology world develops if you're
an iPhone fan and if you like what Apple
has designed as a smartphone experience
this is a great phone i'm kent german
and this is the apple iphone 4
the bottom line this week get a bumper I
know they don't look that cool but they
could help prevent scratches and we're
already hearing some reports of signal
loss when your hand comes into contact
with the external antennas oops and
that's our show for this week everyone
tune in next week when we'll have a car
tech prizefight mashup between the
nissan leaf and the chevy volt until
then don't be afraid to check out more
great seen that video like kent's full
review of iOS four at Cena TV com see
you next time and thank you for watching
