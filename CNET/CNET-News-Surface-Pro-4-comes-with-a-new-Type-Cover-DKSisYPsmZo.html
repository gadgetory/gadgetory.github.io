this is the lightest thinnest type cover
we have ever shipped the thing people
say about Tiger that they love is how
light and thin it is and how sturdy it
is this product got lighter and thinner
and more sturdy but I want to talk about
the key set we've put in a pro key set
on this product what you'll see is what
we went from this tight key set design
where we have now filled out the entire
key set for your hands don't worry
though this product works perfectly with
your surface pro 3 perfectly so if you
have that one and I see a bunch of using
pro 3 which by the way like your super
inspiring me right now so fun you can
use this product as for you but for
surface pro fro our users who haven't
used it yet or coming on and you're
going to love it the key set is
beautiful the key switch has a 1.3
millimeter travel it's it really is it's
19 millimeters right now between key
sets it's what we call the pitch it
feels so soft on your hands when you
type best part we then took the trackpad
we made forty percent larger that was a
big deal forty percent it feels
beautiful it uses the full power of
Windows 10 and really comes to life what
do you guys think of the new type cover
