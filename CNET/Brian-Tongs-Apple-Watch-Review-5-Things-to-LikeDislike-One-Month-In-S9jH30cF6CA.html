that thing I like uh-huh that's right
what's up guys on my wrist
I've had this Apple watch for about
three to four weeks and this is really
my realtalk review to you the Fab Five
things of what I like about it and what
I don't like about it so let's start off
with number one right now I love how it
looks I was only gonna buy the stainless
steel edition with this cool snazzy
strap yeah I put down a lot of cold hard
cash for it but if I'm gonna wear this
everyday it has to be something that I
like how it looks this is definitely one
of the top things that I love about it
now number two it's these things that I
like to call moments of WoW using it
while you're traveling use it as a
boarding pass for your plane ticket
opening your hotel room with certain
hotels or even paying with things it's
things that you've never experienced
before and I think that really makes
this a special device I don't know if
it's necessary but it does make it
pretty cool now number three what I like
about it also is digital touch it sounds
corny but I do send like a heartbeat to
my boo we like write messages and
drawings to each other it really
personalizes this watch it makes it
different than any other one that's out
there right now so yeah that's one of
the things that I also like about it and
the number four everyone's gonna kind of
like this about the watch is getting
messages text messages being able to see
them from your wrist I don't respond to
them but being able to have them right
there is really cool and then number
five if I had to think about a fifth one
I can't like I'm not gonna force this
right I do like four things about it but
there's not too many things that I'm
really raving about and that's what this
is all about
so let's now jump over to things I don't
like number one app load times when you
open some of these apps like Yelp or
ESPN or others it might take three
seconds five seconds eight seconds to
load by the time you're done you're
wondering why didn't I actually just go
to my phone and that leads me to number
two a lot of the times you have an app
like uber you call for an uber car and
then you're wondering where it is well
you end up pulling your phone out and
going to the screen with Yelp I look for
restaurants I go to my big screen so a
lot of times you end up really using
your phone screen more than you do with
this I know it's a lightweight device
but it does
really give you enough information to do
the things that you want the third thing
that I'm not so hot about is
notifications I personally pretty much
have turned off every single
notification other than messages this
watch tells you to like stand up it'll
get you things from all your different
apps but it's just too much it's
intrusive and that's one of things I
don't like about it
number four fitness features on this
just aren't that helpful now what I mean
by that it measures your heart rate but
then even if I'm not really doing much
my heart rate is all over the place it
tells you to stand up every hour that
can be annoying if you're watching a
movie and overall if you're someone who
works out all the time goes to the gym I
play basketball a lot the fitness
features on this won't help you if
you're someone that's really casual that
doesn't really do much I think you'll
like to fitness features but for me it's
just not something that I use and
finally number five the novelty of this
thing just wears off over time so let's
say all those moments of wow I talked
about after week two after week three
after week four you just stop using
those features as much I only use this
thing to check the time look at my
messages once in a while and then pay
for things once in a while so you know
there you have it I like how this looks
I over all like to watch more than I
thought it would but really it's gonna
be up to developers Apple and androids
platform to really figure out do we even
need one of these things right now the
answer is probably not</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
