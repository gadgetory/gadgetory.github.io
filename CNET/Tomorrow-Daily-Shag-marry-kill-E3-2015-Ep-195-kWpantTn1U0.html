let's not even pretend this is going to
be a normal episode nor is it going to
be normal coverage of e3 because look
we've already seen and heard best of e3
we've already seen who won and all that
stuff that's true and that's also not
our style anyway that's so true what I
think we should do today is a game I'm
scared a game of marry shag kill oh I
like James devices at e3 1 i'm gonna
pick some you're gonna pick some and
we're gonna bring in a special guest yes
ok ok so you ready to get started uh
yeah let's do this ok all right kale do
you want to kick things off since this
was your idea I've really I've really
thought a lot about this this is the way
i think is marry shag kill so alright
starting off i'm just going straight up
Mary Bethesda just get a full company
they would treat me right all the way
through every single night we it would
just everything would be perfect peachy
keen they're giving me what I want give
me more than what I want out of the
relationship can't be like it's long
lasting obviously they're cool with
making sequels you know that fallout is
going to give me a lot that's a long
relationship just right there obviously
dishonored something I didn't know that
I wanted but they gave it to me because
they know that I needed it all right
it's jack it's just a great relationship
me and Bethesda and they and and they
let me do what I want it's an RPG world
that they offer me so I get what I want
out of it so I feel like me and Bethesda
we we were meant for each other so I
think I would marry Bethesda des des
plus kale anonymous forever my Mary my
Mary is Bethesda Maryland pick one
specific game I'm marrying Bethesda okay
so who's your Mary oh my Mary because it
makes me feel warm on the inside and I
feel like it makes me a happy person as
Yoshi's woolly world Yoshi you cannot
marry Yoshi's woolly world yo cheese
willie woo that's so cute oh my gosh
when you play it you just wanna
cuddle it up at night and Mariya and
live with it forever I don't think you
know what marriages is ideal today I'm
sorry which one of us is married Touche
I die there's the I'm not gonna be no
comment there yep no count it there
alright Yoshi's woolly world it's it's
so adorable its own I treats me right I
haven't even heard anybody bring up
Yoshi's woolly world until this moment
right now well now what's happening and
I'm telling you it makes me feel so warm
and squishy on the inside and that's it
feels like it's a sustainable burn it's
a long lasting love I feel Yoshi's
woolly world is the game for me alright
fair enough you marry a dinosaur got it
merry little area yarn ok so moving on
to share we're gonna shack ok I can't
say the other word nope we're good was a
pretty much trying so hard not to say I
know we really are so for me it would
have to be Morpheus Sony's Morpheus
headsets I like it their new VR headset
it's coming yeah it's coming out early
next year yeah yeah next year first half
an actress happen next year and the
reason is because look I tried it on and
I you know I I went at it I went at it
right away dead but I knew that wouldn't
last long I would I knew that I'd have
to either move to another game ok more
like that at some point I'd have to stop
playing it but for that time that I was
playing it I was in it I was immersed I
just was trying all different types of
things it was amazing and I was very
experimental it was very experimental
something I never done before and I like
and I was doing moves I'd never tried
and playing a game in a way I never done
before so yeah definitely definitely
shag Morpheus you done now get return
alright so my shag is a game that I
can't stop talking about his cup head
cut that is my game I love it but here's
the thing it feels like it's going to be
like a quick relationship like it's
gonna I'm going to play it for a very
intense short period of time and then
I'm gonna leave it behind for other
things ooh like I feel like yeah I feel
like it's going to be more of like just
kind of that like really intense burn
really quick and then all of a sudden
it's just going to burn out and then I'm
going to find other games I'm
I think I'm gonna find it is really sad
but it's heartless it's hardly okay cold
but you know it's the truth it's the
truth I feel like I'm gonna play that
game it's going to be short and sweet
and fun but also like mineral slice see
you later time producing whatever you're
gonna buy a cup head shirt and wear it
around so nobody ever shagged someone
and then wears a t-shirt with their face
on it so I so usually alright so let's
move on to kill all right oh boy this is
a tough one this is tough so kill kill
wasn't tough for me just dance I just
did just die how about that why don't
you yeah it's I was it was either that I
was either gonna pick just dance cuz
like how like there's still more of
those those don't stop I think they're
just making them without anybody
actually they might be right I think
might be right i was going to kill
unraveled was it is that the one the
little yarn one i was gonna kill that
one guy someone i wanted to kill creek
because i am so tired of hearing about
how adorable that was that yarn game
because it's every was a guy so adorable
and i don't think that many people are
gonna like pick it up and like really
get into it they'll be like oh that kid
oh i forgot that game came out and even
know about it but for the press comments
are like also adorable people want to
kill that but I'm gonna kill just dance
I'm sorry Usher and jason derulo Jason
to really he worked so hard at that
Ubisoft press conference try it all
buddy get paid like a million dollars
okay I'm sure your kill go okay this is
gonna be a controversial call here but I
think we just have to do away with gears
who are you guys I think gears award for
let's just what it's it's done it's over
with it was fun people's bread and
butter is fun while it lasted but
chainsaw I'm ready for sub that is their
bread and butter and chainsaws I'm ready
for something else I'd like I like that
franchise but I just feel like I'm like
ok well don't-- are we are we really
like is that are we were still going
with it like I feel like that train I
even even even though it's Papa left it
behind at this point right the fear is
I'm sorry cliff cliff be it doesn't feel
like the same it's not the same as it
was and it feels like we just need to
let it die and start something new and
amazing that's me I'd like just kill it
just take it away okay let's just get
rid of it all right that's my that's my
it's not as edgy as killing unraveled
I'm sorry
I totally horrible your anything back
corner you are the crew let's just cut
it in half to cut the yarn in half I'd
say that'll make just dance watch what
we do oh no that's quickly I like that

whatever this is whatever this is Tamar
daily
welcome back to the show we've returned
and we have gamespot's very own Danny
O'Dwyer what's going on here my hand got
sick such a shame yeah a little bit
second with a horse the third day of e3
or the fifth release a little bit you
guys will have to excuse my friend he's
just a little horse I'm also like
ridiculously on bronze this whole
situation here hey where do you work
again yeah okay your heirs car that's
right you seem pretty chipper for being
on your fifth day c3 it's like this what
we live for years like the biggest
weekend of video games yeah i mean this
year was a paternity pretty great
actually so how do you want whined oh
god it's so boring i go to my hotel room
and you notes for the next day oh thanks
room service just want me to tell you i
just go into big k ho let's go to all
the sales parties yeah yeah like yeah
he's really yeah yeah no i'm a home
right notes so i can ask sean murray
about no man's sky and then i get up the
next morning and do it let's hear ya
that's what you want to do it's fun
stuff we wait all year to do this you
might as well do it properly there we go
all right you're right you're right so
okay speaking of doing it right hmm uh
daddy shag marry kill okay that's AG way
I finally got a good one can we get one
first one in almost a whole year of the
show right so Mary so we want to know
what game or device or just anything
company from from me Mary Mary oh okay
I'm gonna go marriage is all about sort
of long-term commitment I did not
getting boring after like you know years
and months of the same every nice okay
so I think maybe no man's sky just for
the variety Joyce I got to play it last
night I found my first planet planet was
kind of thing but the idea that another
planet out there is in more interesting
whether the crazier creatures is what
I'm kind of interested in so like right
there was one stage I got on a ship and
it just he was like pulling into the
wider universe and I kind of sucked at
and there was just all these stars and I
could pick from any one of them and made
me really realize how insignificant
human life isn't the grand scheme of
things you know got a little bit wow
that way for a little bit that's the
kind of marriage you want yes I've been
philosophical this is a this is a
marriage of serious thought different
marriages made variety as well so I
could pick whatever planet I wanted and
I found when I was going on that's all
right then I what I wanted to do is get
to the next one so don't know what I'm
really talking about is
like a polygamous marriage sounds like a
polygamy read between all the planets a
no man's sky yes yeah that's a great
word also a lot of people didn't get to
try that out so it's really good to hear
that it has that sort of longevity in
the you want to you want to keep going
that sucks you in so cool all right so
let's get to the dirty bucks me like a
good marriage and speaking of sucking
you in so shaggy so shag what are you
which witch what thing at e3 all night
for ya oh wait a minute come on I'm
gonna marry that oh really like treat
his wife like that you know and she's
gone when he did the fall I for is going
off on the weekend stepping out Pocoyo
sabotage why did it fallout 4 didn't
answer my texts all right okay so tell
us a little bit what why you chose just
just to shag I'm such a fan of fallout I
just I think it's cuz I just want it
right now it's like the fact that it's
coming at it like three or four months
Cyrus need yeah i've already spent 130
dollars on the world's dumbest looking
on Apple watch and as I saw it it was in
the show for it oh yeah um yeah I just I
just want to know I'm like fervor
inferred and I think that was a really
good job what they did was just hold
onto it and then say hey guess what
here's like a bunch of information about
it's probably everything you'd want to
know and we're gonna release it this
year so I'm just kind of like salivating
2015's greatest games and the fact that
for life or is dropping in there that
puts it into like like incredible years
of games right super memorable but ya
know it's that's definitely good choice
yeah that that sort of reaction you had
when when they announced fallout 4
definitely like smoke a cigarette that
that's definitely good red analogy for
shag yeah so now we come to sums got
died so what are you gonna kill this
year did you guys see the metroid prime
federation force see this thing oh ok so
like fans are looking for yeah right so
this year we get like the Last Guardian
we got a final fantasy remake we got and
the Shenmue even turned up so people
have been waiting for a core Metroid
front game for forever and then they
release this game Metroid Prime
Federation
force which is essentially some sort of
co-op shooter none of the characters no
nothing like nothing seemingly anything
to do at Metro except it was first
person parts where it's like a co-op
shooter on the 3ds and also this is a
soccer minigame what again I saw the
trailer and I thought somebody had like
taking some weird 3ds game an extremely
gay yeah yeah we propose the logo looks
like a good topic there's like a there
is ecce like a 15,000 person like poll
that's already been written same counts
whoa yeah that's crazy i'm a good
actually sign that oh my you're gonna
say i may go play that just so bad i
actually make no plays pacy talk all
right right that's just that's way over
the edge okay cool that is a good kill
yeah because I'm value especially since
you know as she was saying that we
that's exactly what we wanted I don't
intend Oh Metroid total I want but they
were like soccer Metroid you asked for
it you got it what's that you wanted an
indie game that remotely kind of
resembles maybe in some way Metroid will
just slap a Metroid name on it it's fine
i will do that crazy well actually we're
sorry you couldn't be a part of the
relationship with fallout 4 this year
that we're sharing together but you know
maybe let me tell you that just a drunk
man can I just make this very clear
fallout 4 for me is like a really long
toxic relationship that I know I
shouldn't be in if I'd say radioactive
you might you might in fact say rate
irradiated it is a toxic boyfriend that
you cannot help but keep going back to
and that's gonna be me in November
because all I'm yeah look how we're both
like that you know I shouldn't and I
know it's bad for me and I know I'm
gonna let all my other responsibilities
just go by the way said my friends are
all gonna go away we've all been there
ladies we've all been there but you're
just gonna keep going back that's gonna
be fallout 4 for me the best love
