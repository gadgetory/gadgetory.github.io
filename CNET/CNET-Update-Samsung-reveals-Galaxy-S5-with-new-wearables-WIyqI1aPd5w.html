of mobile news to cover in under three
minutes I'm Richard Carey and this is
your cnet update the next wave of smart
phones and gadgets are on display at
Mobile World Congress going on now in
Barcelona and that's where Samsung
unveiled the new Galaxy s5 it's
Samsung's top-of-the-line smartphone
which isn't too much different than the
current galaxy s4 but this upgraded
model has the latest version of Android
and it gets a fingerprint scanner on the
home button similar to its nemesis the
iphone 5s this is for unlocking a phone
with your print instead of a password on
the back there's a heart rate monitor
next to the camera flash you just press
your finger on the sensor and it reads
your pulse and it ties that data into
the s health app which also tracks your
exercise and cast away your fears of
water damage because the s5 is said to
withstand a dunk in three feet of water
for up to 30 minutes these new tricks
are the headlines the outside didn't
change too much it's about the same size
it does come in a few new colors the
back is dotted with these little dimples
samsung also introduced a fitness wrist
band called the gear fit it does more
than just count steps it also has a
heart rate sensor on the inside and
it'll buzz to nudge you to keep going if
you're starting to slow down in a
workout the glass on top is curved
slightly and it does show the time there
are new versions of samsung Smart Watch
there's the gear neo and the gear to
this time it's not android-powered it's
Tizen and that's Samsung's own operating
system but it does do the same things
the neo is the cheaper model without a
camera and the gear too has an IR
blaster to use it as a TV remote the
camera and microphone have been moved
from the wrist strap to the body the
battery is supposed to be better lasting
about two days before it needs a
recharge but it will only work when
paired with some of Samsung's Galaxy
phones and tablets all these new Samsung
products will be available on april
eleventh but samsung was not the only
one showing off wearable tech sony
revealed that it's smart band will go on
sale next
month in March and attracts more than
just your fitness and sleep using Sony's
lifelog app it creates this digital
diary of your activities like the games
that you've played and the music that
you've listened to it even tells you how
much time you're spending on Facebook
and sony smartwatch 2 will soon have a
garment app to show directions on your
wrist wrist bands are hot the Chinese
phone maker Huawei showed off a fitness
tracking band that can also be used as a
Bluetooth headset and HTC said it'll
have a SmartWatch of its own ready by
Christmas that's your tech news update
