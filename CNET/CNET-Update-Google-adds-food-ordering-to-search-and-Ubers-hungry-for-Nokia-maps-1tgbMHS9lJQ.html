curiosity and your stomach I'm Bridget
Carey this is your cnet update the next
time you search for a restaurant on
Google you'll also be able to order food
right from the search results google
searches made on mobile phones include a
link to place an order for nearby
restaurants and that takes you to a
delivery service like seamless grub hub
or eat 24 so why is Google doing this
because it sees Yelp as competition it
doesn't want you going to Yelp to search
for a place to eat instead of google
along with search google is also a
leader in maps and many tech companies
rely on Google's maps including the ride
service uber but it seems ebers trying
to steer away from its dependency on
Google and wants to buy nokia's here
maps the New York Times says sources
saying uber put down a three billion
dollar bid to buy nokia's here maps but
automakers like BMW audie and
mercedes-benz may also be in a bidding
war over Nokia's maps as more services
tie into location tech companies see
mapping becoming increasingly important
and as you may know uber wants to create
a fleet of driverless cars that future
world would require a good mapping
system we may know who wins the bidding
war by the end of the month meanwhile
ubers main car service competition lift
is trying to gain more passengers with a
new verizon partnership the lift app
will come pre-loaded on all verizon
android phones another area changing
quickly is online video it appears that
Spotify a music streaming company wants
to add web video to its business The
Wall Street Journal reports Spotify is
talking to companies that specialize in
distributing video for youtube we may
learn more about that at an event
Spotify as holding for media in New York
on May twentieth so yes Spotify is going
after a piece of YouTube and so is
reddit the site announced its making
original video to become a larger force
in media for starters you'll see videos
for ask me anything Q&amp;amp;A s with all this
news of streaming let's take a moment to
remember the 2.1 million people in the
US who cannot enjoy any of this because
they're still using AOL dial-up
to get online through a phone line yes
that means this sound still part of life
for more than 2 million people and many
of those people are paying twenty
dollars a month for it hey we'll share
the numbers in its quarterly earnings
report in most cases people are sticking
with dial-up because either they don't
want to change or it's hard or expensive
to give broadband where they live and
what makes it so sad is that websites
are gunked up with junk like tracking
ads and auto playing videos so dial-up
customers probably can't load most
website pages before it times out today
most rod band speeds are about 200 times
faster than dial-up that your tech news
update you can head over to cnet.com for
more from our studios in New York I'm
