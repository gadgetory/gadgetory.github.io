a new mobile game for iOS and Android
called Ghostbusters World it puts you on
a quest to catch ghosts around your
neighborhood
oh sure you've played Pokemon go before
but this adds a new dimension to the
concept you think you got what it takes
to bust some augmented reality
apparitions do you know your proton pack
from a PKE meter do you know a particle
thrower from a boson caster your
ectoplasm from an ecto cooler well
before you suit up listen up here are
five tips to becoming a Ghostbusters
World Game Master
you know seeing ghosts in the real world
with mental reality it's really great
but AR use it a lot of battery life so
if you're gonna go exploring
supernatural phenomenon in your
neighborhood bring a battery pack
Ghostbusters game uses AR which will
chew up a little bit more of your
battery life now if you want to save on
your battery you can turn off AR now it
might not be as fun but it probably
lasts a little bit longer out there some
of these ghosts get pretty feisty in a
fight that makes battles a two-hand job
one finger will be holding down your
particle thrower beam while the other
needs to be ready to tap the right spot
to counter the ghost attack
you'll also need to hit a button to
throw the trap when ready
and once you four stranded ghosts in
your captive stream you can raise them
off the ground to see the slammed button
appear press it in time and you'll get
them nice and woozy for a few seconds
when it's stunned it's easier to contain
the ghost over a trap battles can get
pretty involved
let's ain't your grandmother's pokemons
go all right
this chick is toast
back off man I'm a scientist there's a
tutorial mode but it's a doozy I could
take up to an hour but don't worry you
can skip that go back to the Help
section and find out what you missed but
if you skip it you can miss some bonuses
so just buckle up and enjoy the guided
ride and then there's turn-based
fighting that also eats up some time it
takes place in the goose dimension
that's right
ghost dimension battles because normal
weapons don't work in the ghost mansion
so you need to have your captured ghosts
fight for you in these team battles
which is a whole other layer to the game
generally you don't see that kind of
behavior in a major appliance if you're
feeling impatient you could set your
ghosts to auto fight in a battle and
there are elemental matchups in battle
so a fire ghost would do more damage to
an earth ghost and water would do more
damage to fire there's a whole system to
learn and wait until you get to hatch
ecto spheres in sight o converters can
we just call them ghosts thanks I mean
clearly this is Pokemon go right to get
ahead you'll have to do tasks to upgrade
your weapons and your ghosts you need
the tools and the talents to find
power-ups first off in the map there are
dimensional doors that offer power-ups
but those are based on points of
interest from Google if you don't live
in a busy urban area you can make your
own remote gate and set it up near your
home or school and work to collect
rewards frequently you can't move the
gate once you install it so don't screw
it up battles will level up your
captured ghosts but you can also give
them a boost with pke crystals and if
you've already captured a ghost or if
you run out of traps you can also get
some crystals by destabilizing ghosts
instead of trapping them so you can just
blast them out of this plane of
existence
you'll also need to research equipment
upgrades you'll need more than your
standard blaster you know I just
occurred to me we haven't had a
completely successful test of this
equipment I blame myself
so do I
there are more than a hundred and fifty
ghosts there from both the old and new
movies as well as the animated series
and the comic books reference books like
Tobin's spirit guide are also in the app
which clues you in to the history and
lore have you busted all the ghosts in
your area don't worry you can use the
ghost tracker to find more or use ecto
goggles overall this is more involved
than Pokemon
it's more skill-based but if you're a
Ghostbusters hand you'll have some fun
