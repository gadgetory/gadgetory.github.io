I'm Alfred Inge and I'm friend of the
show David Katz Mayer so today we wanted
to focus on a new crop of smart sound
bars coming out including the $400 so
nose beam the $300 pulk command bar and
there's also the soon to arrive Roku TV
wireless speakers for $200 now we
already got the price points here but
David maybe you could give us like a lay
of the land to understand a little bit
more about what these sound bars offer
is it a good deal what do you think so
the first two are actual real smart
sound bars meaning to have Alexa built
in you can say hey Alexa play blah blah
blah and it will just like a regular
echo speaker and of course it sounds a
lot better so the appeal there is to
have a really good sounding you know bar
that works with your TV but also accepts
Alexa voice commands for music and for a
lot of other things so you can do pretty
much anything you can Alexa wise with
these sound bars that you could with any
other Alexa speak and those two you're
talking about are the Sonos beam and the
pulk command bar now let's get also to
the Roku one which seems it's cheaper
but it also seems a little bit more
limited very limited so it's not
technically a smart sound bar at all
it's designed to work only with Roku TVs
not even Roku streaming sticks but just
the actual television with Roku boot own
that's built in they're super popular we
really like these TVs and of course like
all TVs they have crappy sound so it's
great you can add these speakers to them
it's a simple solution they're Wireless
they're stereo most sound bars are a bar
these you can actually get some stereo
separation from but since they only work
with Roku TVs and they're 200 bucks
they're very limited I think Roku really
missed a trick by not just putting a
standard optical input on these things
to make them competitive with other
sound bars and work with any TV so do
these sound bars work like the fire TV
cube does where you can also change
channels and like adjust like just stuff
on your TV with it or is it a little bit
different yeah so the sound bar is the
the Sonos beam and the pole command bar
designed mainly to be sound bars so
they're not going to control your other
stuff like the Amazon fire TV key which
is another a device that selects a power
that it works with home entertainment
stuff the Sonos beam is really cool
because again son√≠s is a really popular
multi-room system it in the future to
work with Google assistant and it also
works with
Apple AirPlay right now which is really
cool if you have Apple on your phone and
you want to you know play your music
multi-room with the system the Polka man
bar those sounds better it's cheaper so
it's our pick for people that you know
aren't into the Apple or CentOS universe
and still want good sound and Alexa so
this Google home assistant integration
that you're talking about that's just
gonna come in and update right like I
don't have to buy the Google home
assistant version nope the the Sonos
also knows products is starting to the
Sunnis won and now the sun's beam will
get Google assistant they say sometime
this year which is a unique feature I
mean if you know like Alexa and you're
in Google's multiverse you can wait
around for this update which will add
you know hey Google functionality these
speakers the other limitation about the
roku speakers that i also wanted to get
to was the fact that it doesn't have
alexa built in directly into the
speakers itself from what i understand
the voice commands you do from a mic in
the remote right yes to a certain extent
is that preferable because you get less
false positives or so you actually get
the voice commands directly and yeah i
mean they'll spin it you know that way
but really that features been around for
years on other devices including the $20
on prime day amazon firetv stick you can
talk into that remote to your heart's
content
the far-field voice recognition of not
having to pick up a remote of say the
word Alexa out loud is the real feature
that is missing from this roku device
the ultimate of laziness absolutely
gonna have to pick up the room after
nowhere you don't even have to own one
you don't even have to yeah but it's
interesting we hear that the Sonos one
kind of doesn't actually went out quite
to the pulk so you know you save a
hundred bucks yeah it's it's about sound
quality and features and again Sonos is
great for those but we'd like the sound
of the pulp better a lot because it has
a wireless subwoofer included and it's
cheaper so it's pretty cool nice alright
if you want to read more about these
stories check us out on SEANET I'm Ben
Fox Ruben I'm alfred Aang and David
Koepp my a friend of the show thanks
everybody for listening
bbbbb
check us out at Cena backslash file
backslash Alfred - being really great
stories
it just put out a really cool story
is this really gonna be a thing now what
do you what are you really gonna just
start the ghosting the entire chat like
that yeah I would like to commend friend
of the show David Katz Meyer for time
yeah we made time whether like four
minutes well you know Bryan does my
voice overs for the for the reviews and
I always have to slow down cuz you know
it's it's it's actually relaxing with
Bryan recording it you know cuz he's
chill in there but you know when I when
I get amped up and I've got a couple of
those peppermint candies in the in the
cafeteria I'm just like dude it's it's a
four-minute podcast so do you still have
those Girl Scout cookies dude that's
like January yeah I know but still do
you still have yes and they're still
perfectly thank you technology I just
remembered s'mores ones if you have a
hankering you don't finish off the
s'mores I completely house those in like
two hours less the ones that I had home
I finished almost immediately and then I
forgot about the ones at my desk so I'm
gonna guys a question
yes anyway let's get to some questions
sure why don't we let's start off with a
nice generic broad scope question from
Alex and Mitchell and I'm getting into
some more specifics because cats get
ready I hope you brought like a snack or
something cuz they're gonna be here
awhile
yeah those cookies man Alex Mitchell
asks what's the sweet spot for soundbars
without Google assistant or any
assistant any rough number what's the
price point that you think is a safe
place to be shopping for price if you
don't want smart capabilities in one
1995
yeah you broke your phone that is the
Vizio sound bar I can't member the name
is like SB 312 SW something like that
the SW stands for subwoofer spectacular
price to performance ratio I mean
that sets the gold standard sir editor's
choice right now for budget soundbars
and it will make your TV and music sound
hundred times better than anything
coming out of your TV speakers and it's
just a great overall value nice so I
found out of the loop on sound bars for
a while now just because I don't spend
money on anything but what makes us
sound bar better than like just actual
speakers not actual speakers using or
for me I'm also super cheap you
mentioned this a little bit on there you
just use the speakers in your TV
yeah these beakers suck yeah I mean I
might as well listen to your phone
speaker and blast it super loud there's
something wrong with that no you can you
can bop around the kitchen too you know
Taylor and and it sounds okay on your
sound speed on your speaker yeah but
like for my TV now when I need it for
like better quality I'll just plug it
into like some Bluetooth speakers that I
have that have an aux port right right
right so what makes what like what's the
difference with a sound bar well so a
Bluetooth speaker with an aux port will
sound better than TV speakers as you
said so the step up is real good sound
no you know it's all just a matter
degrees and you know for a hundred
twenty bucks you're getting room filling
sound and a you know real bass cuz it's
got a subwoofer and and especially for
music you can tell but even when you're
watching a movie or a TV show you can
hear this you know rumbling or whatever
I mean there's a lot of things about
Home Entertainment where the sound is
really more important than the video in
a lot of ways it really adds immersion
some of these guys have you know
built-in surround effects and things
like that or you can add optional rear
speakers if you want to go crazy but
that vizio is kind of a baseline for
what I would consider good sound you
know again you can plug in anything you
want and you can get some equivalent of
it but I think it's maybe when you a
little bit more you know loose with the
old wallet it's worth considering
especially be watch a lot of TV nice I'd
be less cheap if I just got paid more
here so alright we'll put into that yeah
I mean Rogers watching this show so yes
when he's not like packing things in a
crazy he's going to come into the chat
you'll still be cheap no matter how much
money you make I believe that is the
truest statement ever spoken on this
show hey let's take a question from
Eugene or Ella Sony versus Samsung which
do you prefer in which context
intolerance instead of Samsung I think
he gave TVs I'm guessing he means TVs
okay first of all totally you can't
answer that because it depends on the
television and what you're gonna spend
right now on CNET I believe the Sony TV
is ranked slightly higher than the
latest Samsung TV I reviewed so that's
one answer but the Samsung does a better
picture quality so I could go on and on
and on and on they're both pretty good
one big difference is that Samsung Smart
TV system I think actually works better
than the Google powered system built
into Sony's right now they're using
Android TV and it's pretty pokey you can
get Google assistant by talking into
your remote control again on these Sony
TVs but the Samsung system is just
smooth polished works very well and is
very slick on the latest model so if
that matters to you but picture quality
price to performance that kind of stuff
it all depends on the models so no
answer is that that's what you're saying
I am NOT gonna commit to either ass okay
Bryan is mad about that no I expected
something a little more defining from
you as you stand strong by your Roku TV
right but there's so many different
prices though I it's it's really hard
just okay so what do you like better
Mercedes or BMW and there's plenty
people who are like for me sorry we
don't care we can I so anyway it
with TVs it's the same exact issue you
have a lot of good manufacturers
actually fewer than they used to be and
there's different price points and
different performance if you talk about
price for the money neither those guys
are very good Vizio and TCL ruled the
roost right now for giving you the best
picture quality for the money
samsung has the best style Sony has some
really good
about their picture quality as well so
yeah it all depends on the model my
favorite Sony TV right now is the X 900
F which is a very well priced high
performance television you know and
Sony's there they're continually coming
out with good TVs and Samsung obviously
has a 40% worldwide market share so they
dominate all TV so you know they have a
million different brands and different
models out there
they can be less a you know affordable
for the same quality than a lot of guys
out there but they also make some really
good high-end TVs so that's a
long-winded answer let's take the
objectivity out of it stopped being a
reviewer for a second what do you buy as
a consumer in your home to advocate
David Kazmaier as a TV yes it's gonna be
tomorrow I would buy an LG OLED and why
because that's like well over 2 grand
yes okay well because just because I'm
rich because I'm fricking loaded first
of all second of all I already own an
amazingly good television from ten years
ago a Panasonic Plasma that I'm very
happy with and if I mean again it's all
personal if I was gonna upgrade tomorrow
if I was the upgrade tomorrow I would
buy the LG because I don't want to go
down in picture quality and that's my
life is you know looking at pictures and
you know I'd be super annoyed to have
frankly any TV that's lower quality than
my Panasonic not saying that all these
TVs out there that aren't LG OLED czar
lower quality but if I was gonna spend
my own money I just go in go all-in and
I'd wait till Black Friday right after
Black Friday well let's go around the
horn real quick then for me personally
it's about the profile I'm a not as much
of a picture snob as some may be but I
like to have my devices in my home very
integrated very seamless very re
recessed so that's why when they get the
gimmicky paper roll out TV we saw at CES
I was just like oh my god that I want
because I want as few cables as few
borders and bezels as possible I just
want it to be one seamless kind of
future house so that's that's where I'm
at if I got a giant race I'd go get a
rolly TV but that I'm not even going on
and and you'd be three years in the
future yeah exactly what about you guys
i i've been i
the TCL 65 or 55 inch roku TV which
David keeps telling me you should
absolutely get this twosome
you also have very high ratings for the
integrated Roku streaming capabilities
yeah you know you didn't have very nice
things to say specifically about like
Android TV but roku seems to do a lot
better so I'm probably going to buy that
sometime around the holidays because I
definitely need a TV upgrade but yes 65
that's an awesome TV for a grand and
again you know less than half the price
of the of the OLED and really really
really good picture it's our current
overall best pick right now I actually
saw it was like somewhere close to 600
actually for the 55 yeah I felt really
oh I'm getting my inches wrong right
right yeah the 65 inch I mean
don't buy a 55 inch TV Ben come on
you're at you're a grown man get
yourself a decent size TV if you can't
sleep comfortably on it is it really a
TV exactly it has to scare you if you
can envision the creatures coming out of
the TV to attend your live I think 65
inch TV would actually be larger than me
there you go what's your answer I would
just take your old TVs that you're
replacing have three new TVs let's take
some more questions from sir enjoy I
want to know each one of your thoughts
if you would consider a sound bora sound
bar for a a piece of theater or b
command &amp;amp; Conquer sound versus smart huh
I'm not really sure what that means I
don't know a throwback video game
reference it might be I mean I remember
command &amp;amp; Conquer I think he might be
making a joke about the command the poke
command bars named potentially or maybe
he does that was like an auto-fill guy
on his phone it says command &amp;amp; Conquer
automatically nobody watches this on
their phones Club yeah I I would
probably be on the market for that like
Dumber Vizio 1 because that's a really
good price point if I was going to get a
sound bar but again I'm probably as
cheap as alfred so if i have some money
to spend
it's probably upgrading my TV and then
I'd eventually get to a soundbar some of
these other ideas sound really good but
at the same time my house is overloaded
with echo speakers already so the idea
of adding even more echo speakers it
gets to a point of redundancy that's not
really necessary and confusing you know
when there's seven different speakers
that they're already there already is
one in my living room so like why would
I pick why would I like a purchase to do
that yeah and and those that they were
good with like a fire TV stick or
whatever at a command stuff and you can
do voice commands and things like that
so you don't need to get like the
integrated thing yeah get the Sonos just
because it's uh it'll have like the home
assistant coming to it and my house is a
is a Google house is a Google household
okay yeah it says it on the doormat it's
good they need your money now yeah thank
you
I actually made a Kickstarter I'm
probably gonna make that now that
GoFundMe yeah David what's your thoughts
on the poke magnify mini isn't one of
the best in the lower budget end yeah we
really like that speaker so that is it's
funny because I think they're gonna
lower the price now the command bars out
that thing is now 250 which you know
it's on the command bar is only $50 more
and includes a subwoofer but the magnify
mania is a little guy and it's got
chromecast built in so if you're like
Alfred and you have a Google home this
thing will work with chromecast audio
devices to have like multi room music
throughout your house controlled on your
phone which works really well so we
would still really like that speaker
doesn't sound as good as the as the pull
command bar again no subwoofer and a
smaller size but it's still a great Buy
and I I would be really surprised they
didn't drop the price on that thing it's
it's too expensive 250 I see $1.99 or
maybe 150 on there so all these smart
sound bars are they like would they not
work if you didn't have Wi-Fi like to do
their primary function so if my wife I
went out like would it still be able to
play music from my TV if it was like
plugged into it that's a big negatory
yeah you need Wi-Fi to play oh no no
sorry I'm just to play music from your
tea yeah yeah well your TV needs why
fighting to get oh my god
what a feat what if you put a tape in
the VCR there you go no like these
things don't have yellow inputs okay
can't connect because I got I got a a
Google home like alarm clock like a few
months ago really and when my Wi-Fi goes
out it can't display the time due and
it's like you definitely don't need the
internet for that like that's a noxious
we so so yeah that like the Polka man
bar has HDMI in it so if your TV's
outputting an audio signal independent
of Y v and yeah it'll work it's the same
thing with the Sonos beam as well they
all have a physical connection except
for the Roku speakers which are just
wireless but it's not Wi-Fi from your
router it's a Wi-Fi connection from the
TV to the speaker's that'll still was a
Bluetooth or a Wi-Fi no they use Wi-Fi
their remotes are Wi-Fi too so I mean
it's six of one half dozen the other
works the same way but they've
considered Wi-Fi a little more that's
extremely high ratings yeah so but it
again it doesn't depend on your home's
Wi-Fi it's just a local ad hoc network
between the speaker and the TV isn't
Wireless supposed to make things easier
this seems like we're going a little
backwards on this well it has a lot to
do with the fact that like Wi-Fi is just
being utilized in so many new types of
devices that if your Wi-Fi goes out as
Alfred is saying more of your stuff
stops working which can be pretty
frustrating find that like it can't use
Google home when the Wi-Fi is out that
makes sense
but like for to not be able to like show
me the time you know what that's absurd
like there's no reason why it should do
that it's a silly goose and for the
record I give zero condiment to anybody
the best advice I can give you don't
ever give out for the aux cable what are
you talking about yeah it's a silly
goose it's not obvious I'm done with
this week hey a few more questions
before you wrap it up code or to code or
Antonio I'm sorry if I put your names
why isn't anybody talking about the
burnin and the LG OLED models nobody's
being honest a consumer
well cold-read fee Cadore antonio
Ghidorah Tonio dread butcher
we actually have an extensive article on
OLED TV burnin I'll tell you why I would
spend my $2,000 on it it's because I
don't leave a static logo on the screen
for 48 hours or you know two weeks why
well you know if I did it would be that
logo right back there yeah if I had any
logo to leave on the screen to be 359
logo which burned into an OLED would
probably pretty fetching David Katz my
friend of the show but the issue there
is that OLED TVs do have more of a
propensity if you have static image on
the screen for a long time to burn in
meaning have that image not be removable
- regardless of what you watch then an
LCD based TV so I'm willing to take that
risk because the picture quality is that
much better and from anecdotal and
everything that I know about the
technology and including some tests that
know the publication did that are really
good it seems like you got it really
fricking destroy these you got to do it
on purpose
you got it or let's say okay here my
father-in-law Fox News it's in the lower
left hand corner all day all night right
I he bought an OLED TV so we'll see he's
a real life test case that has but he
watches a lot of other stuff too so my
point is if you're like the local bar
for example you have ESPN playing
constantly or the TVs downstairs here
seen it you know what those probably
shouldn't be LEDs but that's not a
normal consumer use and you know Vernon
is not covered by warranty there's
plenty of things if you go to youtube
and look there's people maybe you know
looking right now there are a lot of
videos of people with burned and stuff
for I don't know how they got there and
again it's not cover by warranty so it
is a risk and it's more of a risk with
an OLED TV than an LCD TV all that said
it's a small risk as so far and the TVs
have been around for a while at first so
LEDs were like twenty thirteen day or
more they got more potential for burnin
than the newer ones the newer ones have
some really cool anti burnin technology
like screen savers
you can actually run like these wipes
for you know overnight or for a week if
you want that they try to get rid of it
so you know all of that is another thing
to consider is phones samsung in
particular has had OLED screens for
years and they are very rarely get
burnin we have last year with the Google
pixel to that the pixel to excel that
guy had some burnin issues on the OLED
screen and that was basically a new LG
OLED technology and you know it looks
like they you know had some real
problems with it with a phone and that's
just it was the the notification bar the
numbers are the little buttons on the
bottom that stuff is static and it stays
on the screen for a long time
so you know but Samsung phones generally
don't have that and then there are
plenty of people who have reported
burnin on their phones so you know it is
more of an issue with OLED than with LCD
even apple with the iPhone 10
acknowledges that burnin is more of an
issue and they even mention it as
something not covered by warranty that
that can happen with the you know
certain use cases so again long answer
but I'm not too worried about it I was
even gonna ask about the use case but
you went right down in that road before
I could even get there because by nature
using a phone the screens going to be
less Sadek there's a lot more going on
changing constantly checking different
apps then a TV when you are watching a
lot of the same things over and over
again the watermarks etc well except the
clock is a notification bar so that's
becoming less common with these edge to
edge screens and going fullscreen and
some of the bars go away a lot of the
time depending on what app you're using
yep yep yeah it's it's it is all about
the static image again if I when I buy
an OLED TV I'm gonna I'm gonna be just
as careful that wasn't my plasma meaning
I'm not gonna leave it on for weeks but
I play hella video games all the time
with HUDs and things like that I watch a
crap ton of sports with scores that are
on for hours at a time in the same part
of the screen that stuff is not gonna
hurt your TV as long as you don't leave
it on again for a really long time a
really really bright can exacerbate it a
little bit but at the end of the day
it's about these static images and and
limit
and I think that's a normal thing that
people are kind of used to with screen
savers and things like that already
almost out of time like I said everybody
wants to talk to cats I want to give a
special mention to Joe Johnson in the
chat who says you look like The Three
Stooges dumb dumber and dumbest and I
just want to say that my feelings are
severely hurt that I was left out of
this what am I the Shemp of this
organization not cool sir enjoy says you
covered so no she covered poke no love
for Samsung the H WMS 650 and the H WM s
750 sound bars are incredible I'd say
the best in the market David have you
tried the Sony sound bars no that there
is a think we reviewed their first Atmos
on bar the high-end Samsung I'm not sure
the model number but we really liked it
you know again it just depends on the
model a lot of Samsung sound bars look
really cool because they're designed to
go with their TVs which already look
really cool so that's a big factor too
so yeah I'm sorry Noah
one more question before we call it a
day this is more of a theater
theoretical question something more
philosophical which sound bar would be
used best in a case of self-defense hmm
I'm gonna have to go with the magnify
mini looks like basically it's a fat
little Club you can really chemically so
nose beam is that thing isn't happy it's
a baseball yeah you could really like
you could poke somebody with it that's
true well you know you have got or you
could take out a you could take out a
zombie what about the subwoofer if you
just draw out how is that not a part of
your reviews when when we're like to
look at gadgets like in a self defense
situation like we give this a 0 out of 5
in the event of zombie apocalypse how
easily could this kill at least 5
zombies rushing at you it depends on how
good you are with a bow you know it I I
feel like we can do that nice video with
that and then treat it like really
really seriously yeah exactly that's
like not no joke in the dystopian future
that we all live in currently oh yeah I
would I would I would club somebody with
any of them actually I mean if you don't
have a club near your television a sound
bar is a great substitute you pull
or the television a bigger the better
you could take this Samsung your Bowie
you're both so filled with Ray the
poster TV and roll it up hmm and then
use that a little floppy I say hold on
like you know old school 65 inch plasma
just like I just stated Roku sticks here
invader I'm like they're like daggers
I'm pretty sure our bosses aren't gonna
love the new platform of Cena's which
device is best to bludgeon with we don't
have a weapons review so I should sleep
in laptops Dan just show me these
they're like blades basically just like
writing the jugular with them taking a
weird turn that's the end of the week
and on that note we are out of time but
there's so many great questions
