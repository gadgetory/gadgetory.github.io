back over the year with a soft rosy view
of all the great moments in tech that
have pushed us forward but that's not
what I do
I'm Donald Bell and here are some of the
texts most embarrassing moments of 2014
starting off at number 5 Google barge
remember when we found out that Google
is building a top-secret project in the
San Francisco Bay it was exciting
were they building an apocalypse proof
data center or a floating showroom of
Google tech nobody knew and nobody will
because the project reported to be
budgeted at tens of millions of dollars
was determined to be a safety hazard and
number four Sachin Adela's advice for
women in technology seeking a pay raise
his bright idea for closing the gender
gap keep quiet ladies and trust the
system that created the inequality to
begin with it's not really about asking
for the raise but knowing and having
faith that the system will actually give
you the right raises as you go along to
make matters worse he was speaking to an
audience at the Grace Hopper celebration
for women in computing he later
apologized but it was hard to hear him
with that shoe in his mouth
speaking of Microsoft at number three
the unbundling of connect 2.0 from Xbox
one in 2013 Microsoft swore up and down
that they wouldn't even entertain the
idea of unbundling their new Kinect
sensor from the Xbox one it was an
essential part of their system and their
vision for the future of entertainment
in the meantime the lower-priced sony
ps4 was kicking their butt in June
Microsoft screamed uncle and started
selling a Kinect less bundle for $100
less at number two Apple's iCloud
security breach you know the one that
leaked all the nude celebrity photos
that we all secretly tried to look for
and actually to tie for second place I'm
going to throw an apples bright idea to
shove that u2 album onto everyone's
iPhone Apple even had to create a help
page to show people how to remove their
gift and that brings us to number one my
vote for the most embarrassing moment in
tech for 2014
the Amazon fire phone rarely do we get
to see a giant company like Amazon
launch a flagship product with such a
deafening thud originally priced at $200
on contract Amazon heard the crickets
and eventually dropped the price down to
99 cents yet I still haven't seen one in
real life as of October Amazon is
sitting on around 87 million dollars
worth of unsold fire flops so there you
go five moments from 2014 that the tech
world would rather you just forget for
an even longer list check out Roger
Chang's list of text biggest flops and
gaffes in 2014 over on CNET thanks for
watching i'm donald bell and have a
happy new year</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
