MX 200 solar state drive from Crewe so
this is a dry that you use to replace
your regular hard drive such as this
laptop drive right here or this desktop
drive right here now standard because I
take the 2.5 inch design and over here
it has SATA port to connect to the host
the DRI support SATA 3
cigarette per second but also works with
older SATA standards there's only 7
millimeter thick but it also comes with
this spacer right here for you to add
just a bit more of thickness to it to
make it match perfectly with the
standard hard drive so the question is
why do you want to replace your hard
drive with an SSD and that's because
among other things SSD are so much
faster and can boost performance of old
computer like five year or 10 years old
which otherwise you might just want to
throw away and compared to regular hard
drive the MX 200 here is not just so
much faster you also come with many
features to keep the data store safe now
one of them is a technology called brain
we save data in multiple storage
components just I will drop that phones
everywhere you know that means if one
component fail you can always retrieve
data from others on top of that each
start component has four layer of
exclusive data defense that means the
chand a bit filling is very low - now
the mx2 harder here also has very high
endurance rating which is the amount of
data you can write to it before it
becomes unreliable this 500 drive right
here can handle 160 terabyte and that
means if you write 40 gigabyte to it per
day and every day it will take you 11
years to rake it not even I don't know
right that must have data to any Drive
per day and this one terabyte drive here
can handle double down on 320 terabyte
now on top of that the driver also have
a feature to make it use very little
power it support hardware encryption and
many other cool things and performance
why this one is also very very good in
my testing its offer the sustained
real-world copy speed of more than 4
megabyte per second which is the best
I've seen in other tests such as
application performance and random
access it also did quite well though not
the best I've seen but at the suggested
price of $140 $250 and four hundred and
seventy dollars for 250 gigabyte 500 in
bar and one terabyte the drive here is
still a great buy from on the drive here
check out my full review as cnet.com Eno
is a great solid-state drive with very
high endurance chances are when this one
run out of life we have people living on
Mars not me they love me too much
I just cannot go and that's because I'm
dumb knowing this has been the first
look at the MX 200 so the state drive
