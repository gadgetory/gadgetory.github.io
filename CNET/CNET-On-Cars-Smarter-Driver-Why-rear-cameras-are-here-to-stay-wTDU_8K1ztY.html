the u.s. finally has a law that says all
new cars have to have one of those a
backup camera here's how it's gonna work
the camera must show an area at least
ten feet wide and 20 feet back the image
has to linger on the screen for four to
eight seconds after you shift back out
of reverse that screen may be in - or it
could just be a portion of your
rear-view mirror in a car that doesn't
have a dash LCD by May 2016 10 percent
of all new cars must have cameras by May
2017 40 percent and by May 2018 all of
them but even without this law the feds
predict some 73% of new cars would have
cameras in them voluntarily by 2018 so
we're talking about working the last 27%
or so with this regulation now the cost
if a vehicle just needs this little
camera installed and already has a
screen somewhere to show it on it adds
maybe 40 bucks to the price of a car if
the vehicle also needs a screen
installed and the camera it's more like
a hundred and forty dollars ballpark now
if you watch many of our videos you know
that an increasing number of cars have
these cameras in already standard and
many offer them optionally so we're
talking about moving the margin to full
compliance by 2018 210 people died in
backover accidents each year but these
cams are only expected to save maybe a
third of those lives
a recent visibility study by the IIHS
shows the unparalleled coverage of a
camera compared to any of your three
mirrors or a glance over the shoulder or
those beeping bumper sensors the camera
handily beats them all generally
speaking little cars like this on defit
have less of a need for rear cameras
than big cars like a big truck or SUV
but there are exceptions
the IIHS found that a Hyundai
nada had 42% more of a blind spot where
you could totally lose an infant that a
Ford f-150 pickup so there are some
weird anomalies out there I think every
car can use a rear camera and it's not
overkill even a little car at this Honda
Fit you've always got a backseat you've
got a bumper you've got a rear transom
piece of sheet metal you can't see
through that stuff Superman so there's
always a significant place where
especially little kids and pets can get
lost like that I don't think rear cams
are a luxury anymore the future rearview
mirrors that are actually rear camera
displays such as what Nissan's
developing that virtually erases the
pillars rear seats and even backseat
passengers from your view bottom line it
really pays to double check what's
behind you before you backup and that
there's a rear camera in your next car
coming up variable valve timing it's a
big deal and we demystify it when CNET
on cars rolls on
when McLaren re-entered the road car
game in 2009 everybody got a little bit
excited because McLaren had come along
and said bring it to that effects
they've launched to fix the 650s you
know I think this car is about I think
this is a big carbon-fiber extended in
the middle finger straits at Ferrari
find more from the ex car team of seen
at UK at cnet.com slash
welcome back to see net on cars coming
to you from our home at the marine Club
House of cars de witte AK just north of
the Golden Gate Bridge you know one of
the most ubiquitous revolutions under
the hood in the last few years has been
variable valve timing just about every
car maker brags about it but Elmo's
never tell you what it does or how it
does it that's our job and a great car
tech 101
first a quick lesson in engine valves
and what they do on this big ol cutaway
for its Shelby motor you can see them
clearly the intake valves open to let
the air and gas into the cylinder the
exhaust valves open later to let the
burned air and gas out of the cylinder
and into the exhaust valves are operated
by camshafts you see these guys up here
they turn with the engine and these
off-center lobes that are mounted on
them push the valves open or not as they
turn around these are dual overhead cams
there's one cam four exhaust valves a
separate one for intake valves also
notice this engine has four valves per
cylinder like many do these days you've
got more area to let the engine breathe
in and out but here's the problem a
strictly mechanical system operates the
same way at all rpms and all engine
loads that's not ideal for mpg
horsepower or emissions you want to vary
this behavior at different points of the
engines rev range that's why we have
variable valve timing and it changes
three parameters valve timing at what
points in the engines rotation do the
valves open and close valve duration how
long the valve stays open
once it is and valve lift how far a
valve moves off its seat when it opens
so varying all those valve events as
they're called allows this engine and
most importantly it's electronic control
unit can constantly make a call to get
the most power the best mpg and the
lowest emissions all at once now I could
do an hour on why that works but here
just a couple simple examples if you
leave this exhaust valve open longer on
one stroke you get all the exhaust blown
out of there that leaves a fully open
and clean cylinder to take in the
maximum gas and air on the next gulp and
that could give you more power on the
other hand if you close that exhaust
valve a little sooner you leave some
exhaust in here that fills part of the
cylinder and therefore you take in less
air and fuel the next time that kind of
creates a virtually smaller engine for a
moment that could give you better mpg
now the mechanisms that allow these
valves to change their behavior are
almost as numerous as there are
manufacturers of engines here just a few
examples first of all some cars have
multiple sets of lobes on their
camshafts and different lobes of
different shapes are used at different
points in the engines operation here's
another example some
times you will change the relationship
between the rotation of the crank and
the rotation of the camshafts
so they aren't always locked one-to-one
another technology is what's called an
eccentric cam drive so the engines
turning at a certain rpm but eccentric
drives here on the ends of the cams
allow them to accelerate and decelerate
their rotation that gives you a degree
of control as well now who invented all
this variable valve timing stuff
interestingly Fiat is often given credit
as having the first mainstream
production-ready system dating back to a
1969 patent application but today you
know it as MultiAir we saw it recently
in the new Jeep Cherokee now owned by
Fiat of course it's their version of
changing valve events using hydraulic
pressure out of the oil systems the most
famous kind of valve timing yes valve
timing can be famous is Honda's VTEC the
source of one of the biggest memes ever
on the Internet
and just about every car maker has their
own brand of variable valve timing and
they push it hard which is weird
considering how few car buyers have any
idea what it is but now at least you've
got a pretty good idea of how this one
technology has dramatically improved how
engines raise mpg increase horsepower
and lower emissions it's one of the
great revolutions and engineering in
cars in the last few days</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
