here just happening this week on scene
at scrap are making music just got even
easier with the sleek looking wearable
metronome from german-based sound Renner
limited the sound brenner pulse is a
vibrating wearable metronome that will
silently vibrate the tempo of the song
keeping the entire band in time with the
beats per minute the metronome connects
with a smartphone app and is
programmable for learning tapping tempos
and can be synced across multiple sound
brenner pulse devices using multi-link
mode so the entire band can be feeling
the same tempo during a performance
music students can set reminders to
practice and take on musical challenges
and the app will monitor your progress
over time notifying you of your best
performances the sound renner pulse
allows you to change the LED colors and
is equipped with one of the best
vibration motors in the world I got to
feel that one the sound brenner pulse is
currently raising funds on IndieGoGo and
could be yours for an early bird pledge
of $115 make yourself at home guys
you're going to be here a while nASA
released a video of astronaut scott
Kelly along with fellow Russian
cosmonauts as they boarded the
International Space Station for their
year-long experiment aboard the orbiting
space lab scott kelly and mikhail
kornienko will be hanging around the ISS
for a full year to study the effects of
long-term space travel on the human body
the experiment is part of a larger study
by NASA who is ramping up preparations
for manned missions to the planet Mars
I believe a good measure of success is
whether or not your likeness has been
made out of chocolate in Benedict
Cumberbatch has just reached that status
and honor according to a recent poll
conducted by UK TV asking who is
Britain's dishes TV dramatic actor
Benedict Cumberbatch nearly beat out
David Tennant the tenth doctor and
doctor who in Sean Bean AKA Ned Stark
from Game of Thrones now the ladies can
literally eat up mr. Cumberbatch it
looks delicious festo is building a
small fleet of robotic autonomous
insects that have the ability to work
together on a common task otherwise
known as swarm intelligence the festo
Bionic ants are beautifully designed and
come equipped with stereo cameras for
eyes a gripper mechanism for the mouth
an optical mouse sensor underneath for
tracking the ants position actuators for
the legs to 7.2 volt batteries that last
about 40 minutes on a single charge and
a pair of antenna for self independent
charging according to the festo website
like their natural role models the
bionic ants work together under clear
rules to communicate with each other and
coordinate both their actions and
movements each AF makes its decisions
autonomously but in doing so is always
subordinate to the common objective and
therefore place its part towards solving
the task in hand festo also announced
their beautiful e-motion butterflies
that are so light they look like they're
floating through the air the butterflies
require a very complex infrared camera
system for tracking the ultralight
aircraft's flight within a given area if

festo autonomous insects read more of
