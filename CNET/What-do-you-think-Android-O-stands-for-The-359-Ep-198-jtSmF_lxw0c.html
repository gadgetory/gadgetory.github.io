energy this morning than I did yesterday
it's time for Dodger I liked your injury
from yesterday it was more genuine like
hey I do i do already sensual on the 359
episode 198 with Ben Fox Rubin Roger
Cheng and Joanie salesmen hello everyone
198 wow we're so close so close send in
your punch Roger videos yes punch Roger
hashtag punch Raj we need punch Roger
videos we hear that we're gonna get some
right all right there in process
possibly yeah yeah we don't know there
have been threats we but before that we
got to talk about stuff yes we've got
we've got lots of stuff to talk about
we've got android oh we've got the
latest version of google's mobile
operating system it's some details it's
not out yet you just deserve T's what
its gonna look like we're gonna be a
little bit more information on the
developer conference later this month
but we got a first look at what it looks
like well we'll ask whether time it fits
even you know relevant yeah we're gonna
be talking about uber CEO sticking
around this is bliss from Arianna
Huffington one of the board members
confirmed yesterday he's uncle Travis
isn't going anywhere nope yeah and
lastly Jones back to talk about South by
and VR and music the the latest twist
list been to VR is maybe this is what
people will get interested in I don't
make sense to me talking sense not a
good idea of living in a music video as
opposed to watching one so I'm down
we'll see as always if you have any
questions leave them in the comments
section Brian will pick out the best and
we will answer them in three minutes and
59 seconds I'm already tallying all the
great Oh name suggestions for Android Oh
keep them coming guys all right here we
go in three two
welcome to the 359 when we talk about
the top tech news of the day and I'll
crap want to throw in I'm Roger Cheng
I'm Ben Fox Rubin &amp;amp; I'm Joanie salzman
get ready for android oh google tease a
few details of the next version of this
mobile operating system promising perks
like battery life longer battery life
and picture and picture for phones and
tablets all cool stuff aside but what I
really want to know is what do you think
o stands for been Joan oh god that's it
that's a pretty good guys I guess yeah I
I don't think it's gonna be Oreo I know
it's always supposed to be like a candy
or a sweet or whatever oreo is a
trademark name like why would it be Oreo
that's true yeah I would now that would
be my vote I'd like just mostly because
I'm a hankering for cookies right now
right well you could go without meal
cookie if you wanted what if I flipped
the script and made it something healthy
like wow orange I don't know what's how
it's sweet organic quinoa we're gonna k
I can only imagine working with bring
out I was like the android version of
organic quinoa but literally little
rounds okay hold it I'm pretty
interested in these features can we
bring it back to the future talk about
the tech ok so the picture-in-picture
stuff sounds really great especially for
phablets because you know tablets not as
sexy or as interesting as they used to
be but if you've got a bigger phone like
this probably wouldn't work for you know
a smaller phone but for my phone or for
like a larger phone this could be really
help dad look at the g6 upcoming Galaxy
S aight i mean they're both expected to
have very large displays larger displays
and picture and picture would be perfect
for stuff like and even with small
phones if you're watching a video on a
commercial comes up and you don't want
you want to check your email while
you're watching a TV show yeah that way
you can let that 30 seconds go by while
doing something else yeah makes a lot of
sense to me now you made interesting
point right because of the fragmentation
of Android you not a lot of people are
can get the latest version of Android
like even at this point right nougat is
right now the latest version that's out
there and I think it's only two
two-point-eight percent of Android users
are on nougat already heard a number
yeah so how many people are actually
gonna use oh right who really knows but
I guess as the years go on people will
continue to use it and I like some of
these features so hopefully the adoption
will
increase because those features are
better yeah look as always the only way
to guarantee you'll get the latest
version of Android is to buy a pixel
phone or on the old Nexus phones because
that gives you sort of that kind of
direct line to google and those updates
mmm all right next up uber CEO Travis
kalmyk he is here to stay a board member
uber board member Arianna Huffington
confirmed that he's sticking around
despite dealing with numerous
controversies of the last few months is
this a smart move now know that I mean
on the one side people say that he's a
founder right yes I mean founder led
companies that's that means a lot to a
company that's why there are all these
protections in facebook to make sure
that my that Mark Zuckerberg is never
ever ever ever ever going to lose any
any any any control over um but on the
downside i mean travis has a lot of
stink on him yeah if it was a public
company I feel like he would have been
gone already but it's not so yeah yeah
so all right lastly that music and VR
was one of the key themes at South by
Southwest Joan what did you see the show
that really wowed you there are a lot of
fun experimentations letting people have
a little interactivity with music music
has been a common thread in VR since
it's early days there's you know like
live 30 to 60 degree concert sure yeah
um and music is a universal language you
know you don't any someone in China can
understand a song just as easily someone
in you know South that's the point I
like text because music videos don't
really require like storytelling but
yeah like an actual applause so that's
actually a lot easier more accessible
for people it can be a little bit more
fuzzy cloudy you don't have to tell a
story that grips people you just have to
have really cool images and it allows
for experimentation which is great and
so some of the cool things that I got to
try were all I mean it was really fun to
play a rock band style game in VR where
you have two drumsticks and you're
hitting like these gummy bears that are
coming at you with music it was really
fun it was did you actually were like
were you good at it when you were yeah I
think I was pretty good that's like some
streaks once you get I mean I only did
it like two times three times by the
third um I had some pretty epic streaks
going all right and it's fun it's fun
and there was another one where you
to create there some objects in a room
and you throw these objects into a
fountain and that each object is
associated with a sound and that creates
a melody at the end of the experience so
I mean one of the best tests of
interaction and experiences if you want
to do it again and I wanted to do it
again once I oh there you go I mean that
hopefully answers the core dilemma of VR
is not enough content right all right
last all right no that's it actually for
more of these stories check us out see
that on Roger Cheng I'm Ben Fox Rubin
I'm Joanie salzman thanks for listening
all right let's start going down the
line of own aims oh boy on a bit of a
sloppy show today but that's okay yeah
it's all my fault as usual first and
foremost you brought up the Oreo
trademark and Sony in the chat pointed
out that so was KitKat yeah that's true
yeah an i was trying to remember which
like I remember there was one brand that
was used but we have the smartest
viewers we do thank you very much for
that but otherwise we've got orange soda
orange julius Julius would be awesome
Omega Omega mega oh la la wait wait what
I really like mega treat is that I don't
know it just sounds I mean I'd sound
their break in the whole like food mole
de all right exit olive oval oh oh
hashtag punch Roger oh wait that
something else oh god is the thing oh my
Apple no that would never have a oatmeal
yo mele origins in that one yeah uh
orangutang mmm I like this one Oh pies
uh yeah we got a good list going on oh
and also jelly bean they pointed out
jelly bean was also technically
trademark rights jelly beans the
trademark isn't it there's a compaq
there's a brand jelly bean so so i think
it was jelly belly whatever is it jelly
belly jelly right it is jelly belly yeah
okay either way it is true about Kit Kat
though and i feel like the table and i'm
sure what who makes what is this gonna
miss Coe yeah I'm sure Nabisco would be
thrilled
free i have that free advertising I
imagine little android guy made of Oreo
I think that makes probably the most
sense I mean it's like a short punchy
name so Android Oreo if it were that
makes a lot more sense than Android
olive oh good associates max yeah max
everybody android obesity full of oh
you've eaten Android a through m what
I'm going with 20 now you're definitely
yeah android obesity yeah that's better
works i'm down to though that takes the
cake yeah but I'm bum thank you good
night everybody thanks I want to hear
more about this VR yeah yeah I'm looked
really cool we had the kind of skin that
but yeah it was super fun um yeah so I
there was this game it's called
playthings so if you want to try that
out if you have room skill VR you can
download play things on stream and
there's a secret rhythm game mode that
you can use I don't know how secret it
is defined but it's kind of like a proto
version of what they were showing at
South by but it's like um you know in
keeping with Oreos and junk food it will
play a song and um like towards you will
be these like gummy bears or cheese
burgers or hotdogs or something and they
are like three like visually there at
three different levels and you have
drumsticks in your hand and so they come
on the beat and so you have to like go
like this yeah um that's really fun I
mean it's the same kind of fun that like
you and it immediately when i first read
that part because of the food theme i
thought when you said drum sticks like
bike yeah in general trinket yeah
actually suggests that jar is kind of
cool he's hungry today right yeah i know
that was really cool to when we get to
create music is a cool idea and then um
i like the the first one we looked at
with the tilt brush because you know
I've experimented with that tilt brush a
little bit with our girlfriends rhett
and Link on good mythical right so tilt
brush people don't know is a google
program for VR that it's basically like
a VR sculpture painting thing where you
hold controllers and you can paint in
the
air with different brushes and uh it's
analogous to Microsoft's paint from back
in the day like it yeah it's a one act
like everyone has tried when they tried
they are like it's that sort of like the
good demo app when you go in every one
they really live with oculus they always
want you to use tilt brush there's a
sort of example what VR can do and so
what toast which has been doing is
they've been adding some tools like
audio reactive brushes that will like
pulse I'm on a beat and then they've
added a timeline feature so that you can
create images three-dimensional
360-degree around you images in tilt
brush and then have them like storyboard
based like not story but you're like
traveling on like a linear path at a
certain speed and so like it feels like
you're driving so in this video we were
like in a car with this like trippy neon
psychedelic creature where whose head
would like switch to like a horse head
and then like a pixie head and then a
skull with a tongue sing yeah it's set I
mean that makes it sound like I'm
nightmare but it was really cool like is
this horrifying or photos really but
it's also a really good song so um yeah
and then like on we have up on the
screen that there's another one where
you get to like spray like these bubbly
sparkly kittens in the air to a really
cool song that one's called chocolate by
tired and these are weird yeah but
that's a thing like they can be weird
cuz music videos can be like totally
bizarre this is because nobody does
psychotropic drugs when they listen to
music no that's never happened before
the thing that I like about this concept
in general is and you mentioned this in
your story is is that music videos have
a lot going for them related to VR like
they're short yep they're emotional they
don't need a narrative and as you also
said in the podcast like there's also
like universal language like yeah you
know they can be used broadly so to me
this sounds like could make a lot of
sense as far as getting a lot of people
to at least try VAR like they don't have
to be like VR enthusiasts but you at
least like experience a music video once
with it maybe you're more likely to try
VR again and another yeah but the point
that you ended with the idea that you'd
want to try some of the stuff again
that's I think the key thing right
people right now they are still kind of
gimmicky these kind of 360 videos or
whatever like you tried it's kind of
cool and you like put
never think about it again but there was
like a continuous stream of like it was
your source of music like a YouTube has
become like yeah that could be a thing
but we are thing with video games like
you know it's you could play a video
game for like well over an hour yeah but
with VR music like you could just you
know listen to something for five
minutes and like that's just an
interesting experience if you go on with
you definitely less of commitment and I
feel like it's there's a broader
audience with music gaming kind of hit
sixer I mean there are hardcore gamers
will buy these VR sets that's fine but
they're looking for more than that right
yeah music is definitely more of a
populist appeal yeah nobility and
opening the door for a lot of other
things like Assad who's hoping for sex
in VR well that's already yeah yeah I
mean sure that dykes we don't need a way
yeah that was the first thing you should
have mentioned that a lot always a
dimension not a lot Sooners the BR porn
is definitely in a way to get Weibo he
talks about that like a year ago though
so if way to avoid a pun saying this
yeah this is a way for getting people to
start using VR for sure for them to get
into it I'm gonna say something worse
than I avoided that and we have
officially embarrassed our listener
Assad yes right though he's right and
Antoine is griping about us being an
unprofessional show this is the first
time you're watching a show Anton come
on there come back again no polish on
the show come back again will continue
to be if you want the Polish brush and
get the podcast that I spend hours
editing yeah right mostly editing me so
yeah I like what you did today we're
like almost on episode 200 and you're
like and last stop no way you can tell
I'm sorry to mail it all in right at
least you got like the intra right this
time I was so funny every time you do
the intro it's wrong it's it's terrible
at this point I look I'm the mental
hiccup in my head like when I do the
intro something stops in my brain is I
got you screwed up now wondrously today
how long somebody unlearn something so
with such a great effect so sorry
Antoine we couldn't resist picking on
you enjoy your day off come back come
back again speaking of unprofessionalism
yeah before we wrap it up we got to make
one more plug we want your videos we
want you to punch Roger Cheng in the
face hashtag pun i I'm so disappointed
that i haven't seen Christian come back
like I know he's me know he's left us
now that he's created this I know he's
really strong comeback and he's walked
away it's pretty smart actually now he's
impact on all of our lives he's a hungry
59 myth now I almost wish he doesn't
come back because it would it would kind
of diminish the whole experience to be
like hey I'm bad guys loose punch Roger
my god it showed up by it's too late
it's cool a Christian showed up I just
invite him to come on the show and do it
live it to like a punching yeah okay
yeah do a picture of me so anyways if
you haven't been following along we have
a habitual comment or name Christian who
is started the hashtag punch I want to
punch Roger Cheng in the face so we
decided to celebrate this it's our
mantra now we want you to go into the
description of this video get the link
download the picture of Roger and then
show us how you would punch Roger in the
face make an animation print it out put
it on a punching bag and even however
and seriously that picture of me is
totally punchable it's yes I wanted I
just add that picture of me not a famine
and I me yeah I like my face to like my
face so anyways make a video simonton we
have a deadline now my getting close yes
it's friday my email is in the
description as well send us the videos
are gonna feature them on the 200th
episode is the big celebration yeah and
just one day one day monday is a big
episode 200 it's really not anything
that special swedes just something on
this long no i don't know how not very
much a sample and certainly not getting
any better now that we're not getting
more professional I'm sure before we
wrap it up anshu has a good question he
wants you guys to tell him if he should
upgrade to an essay if he's got the s7
edge any thoughts on that um I think
we'll have more answers when the phone
actually gets released next week yeah we
unfortunately don't really have
that much pre-emptive info I would say
though if you're on a program like like
t-mobile or sprint offers you know
annual upgrades I think that's fine but
if you're if you're actually like
looking to pay for this thing I don't
know if upgrading to a new phone after
one year's really worth it that would
that's just like especially genomics and
not because I know anything about this
phone I done seen and he also already
has the edge and the rumor is that this
is also is going to be have a similar
form factor go to the edge I said form
factor take that the use case he's gonna
Jerry will have a whole lot more
information on it and make a week yeah
we'll definitely have more more
information work with and will be able
to give you a better guidance on that I
would just say generally like if you
just bought your phone last year it's
like unless you've got money to burn
it's really not worth it upgrade unless
you're on yeah unless you're me who
needs to have the newest phone every
time like I'm almost seriously debating
the red phone i right i found your mom
yesterday I'm cute I'm not gonna that's
that stupid he's lying I'm not gonna do
it although I look at Scott shows a clue
that's very red listen I'll get you some
paint will take care of this book with
all right if you liked anything you saw
