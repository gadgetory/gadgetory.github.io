actually crazy about I mean it conjures
up images of the old Palm Pilot the
Apple Newton a credit card terminal you
last used Steve Jobs famously railed
against styli a few years ago as really
bad human machine interface we use a
stylus No
who wants a stylus in recent years
smartphones and tablets have totally
captivated us and largely because
they're touched no training no accessory
no gadget it's intuitive if you're 2
years old you know how to use a touch
device now some mobile devices that do
use a stylus have soldiered along and
largely a supporting role but there's
evidence now that perhaps the stylus may
move up to a full co-star if you will
alongside the touchscreen based on three
emerging and refining criteria first
there's greater precision your finger
necessarily is kind of a blunt
instrument it ends in a broad blunt tip
and it can't help but do much more than
have these sort of vague specific
actions on a screen the problem is we
would like to do more fine inputs
especially for drawing and writing for
example now there are some apps out
there that have stylus input that lets
you select a thin line but it's a menu
selection it's a conscious action that's
clunky interface with a stylus
today the precision is so good for
example the current Microsoft Surface
pro claims to be accurate within 1/2
millimeter of where you intend to tap
98% of the time that you do tap that's
almost imperceptibly off then there's
position and pressure if a stylus was
nothing more than another way to poke
and stab at things like your finger does
you might not take the trouble to buy
one keep from losing it charging it and
that sort of thing but in fact the
modern styli are developing a lot of
nuance based on the pressure with which
you use them creating thick or thin
lines as well as the angle at which you
hold it look at the new Apple pencil on
iPad pro its actual inclination angle
makes it create a different input on the
screen not just how hard you press it
finally there's lower latency
Microsoft's been doing a lot of
interesting research around this as they
develop surface pro showing clearly this
dramatic lag between the tip of your
stylus and how long it takes for that to
show up on the screen if there is not an
immediate reaction to the stylus your
brain your eye and your hand muscles
notice it now we're seeing on devices
like iPad Pro and surface pro that there
is almost no latency between the
movement of the stylus and the
indication of that mark on the screen it
feels more like a real pen and pencil
which have zero latency over recent
years of course mobile devices have
stolen a ton of share away from desktops
and laptops with their keyboards mice
and track pads the next shift in our
behavior of input to machines may very
much come from styli and touch sensitive
mobiles it may also mean you need to
brush up on your handwriting and drawing
skills know what's next at CNET comms
