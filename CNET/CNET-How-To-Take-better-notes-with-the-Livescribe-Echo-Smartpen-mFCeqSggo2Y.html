offer their solutions for note-taking
but the truth is nothing beats
handwritten notes so if you're one of
those pen and paper kind of people
there's a solution that combines all the
great things about analog notes with all
the wonders of technology the Echo
smartpen is about to make your notes a
whole lot better here's how it works
when you take notes using the echo and
this special notebook paper the pen
makes a digital copy of the notes which
you can upload to a computer later plus
it records anything you hear or say
while you write first I'll tap record
here then as I'm writing the smart pen
records everything I'm saying as I write
when I'm done I'll hit stop and now if I
tap that text that I just wrote whatever
was being said at the time will be
played back then as I'm writing the
smart pen records everything I'm saying
as I write this is amazing for students
who write notes during long lectures or
when you're just jotting down notes
during a meeting so later on you can
play back your notes and jot any other
info you might have missed
now I also mention that the smart pen
digitizes your notes when you connect
the pen to your computer and launch the
Livescribe software the notes and
associated audio will be uploaded open
up a page and you'll see your notes just
as you wrote them and if you were
recording audio with those notes
clicking on a word will play back the
synced audio it's still undecided about
another campaign he was avoiding such
offers in this software you can also
extract just the audio by heading to the
audio tab all your recordings are listed
here which you can move to your desktop
if you want in the left sidebar is a
list of all the cloud services you can
sync your notes with so if I use
Evernote I can right click a note and
select send page to then this window
pops up where I can choose a file either
with or without the audio then I'll hit
continue and the page will be sent to my
Evernote account which I can view
anywhere later on including on my phone
so those are just the basics of the echo
smartpen but now that you know how it
works let me show you a few tricks for
taking great notes with this magical pen
you can make a study sheet by first
writing out all the terms you need to
know then record the definitions for
each by tapping record tapping the word
sing the definition then hitting stop
here's one example near-field
communication then when you're studying
the terms you can get the answer by
playing it back here's a little tip that
not a lot of smartphone owners know
about if you're playing back audio
either by searching for word on the pen
or by tapping the notes written to it
any note you take during playback will
also be associated with that audio so
check it out so I'll tap this text here
and as it's playing back I can take more
notes no white house
I'll hit stop and when I tap those new
notes that audio will play back from the
original recording and finally if you're
out and about without a notebook and
want to use your pen as an audio
recorder you can do that by long
pressing the power button make your
recording don't forget the milk and the
file will be saved don't forget the milk
now that you've gotten a little taste of
just how useful the Echo smartpen can be
