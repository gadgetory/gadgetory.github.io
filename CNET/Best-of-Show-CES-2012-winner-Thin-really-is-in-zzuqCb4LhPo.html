joined by tim Alessi the director of new
product development for LG graduations
Tim on the award for the en 9600 how do
you feel thank you ty oh it's awesome so
it can be recognized for an achievement
in a in a show as large as this to be
able to be named that's not only best TV
but best product and show is really an
outstanding accomplishment so what is
brought us here how long is this TV
being in development all ed has been
around for a while but the real
breakthrough this year is to be able to
get it to this 55 inch screen size make
it relevant for the home theater crowd
not just kind of a niche product so
that's that's why we're really you know
showcasing it this week so what's
magical about the 55 inches a lot of 55
inch TV is being shown this year why
that size in particular well it was just
a good place to start I mean we can
certainly go higher in screen sizes but
you know as a first entry into the
market with 0 LED we thought 55 was was
a pretty good spot ok I'm look special
about this technology in particular well
I mean as you know it's it's a totally
new display technology which emits its
own light so that means it can have that
pure perfect black level it's very
energy-efficient the color gamut is
wider than a standard display so you're
going to get natural colors and the
technique that we use with the 4th white
pixel really adds to the brightness
without distorting any of the color so
it's just kind of the perfect package of
everything and we're going to see this
in the third quarter is that right yes
the target ship date is sometimes during
the second half I think probably around
third quarter but we want to get it out
as quickly as possible based on the
response here and this is going to be
more targeted at a enthusiast crab would
that be right as the first of its kind
yeah I think that looks that's where the
main appeal will be I mean it's
certainly pricing hasn't been set yet
but it'll certainly carry a premium over
existing technology but even price aside
I think the performance is really what
that real hardcore home theater in
this is looking for and when are we
going to see OLED become a mainstream
technology well it's it's tough to say
when it will become mainstream obviously
this is the first big screen so we'll
see how the market accepts it and how
economies of scale work as far as
getting the pricing right but you know
it'll be it'll be a few years before it
really gets into the mainstream okay now
presume you've seen the Samsung early at
their stand so how do you think it
compares against yours well you know LED
just as a technology is far and away
better than anything else out there so
it looks good but we think we have an
advantage number one it seems like we
have a little more finished product the
design is more finalized and you know it
actually has a model number so then I
think we're a little bit closer to
launch and that forth quad pixel
technology with the white I think really
is going to give us a little bit of a
picture quality edge as well oh great
okay thanks Tim for your time and
congratulations again I question thank
you okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
