your first look at the Philips Flex
Bluetooth speaker so with all the
Bluetooth speakers that you can buy on
store shelves these days it seems like
every model has some kind of unique
feature that helps it stand out from the
crowd for example you got the JBL clip
that has a built-in carabiner and the
sole Republic that has threads on the
bottom for mounting it to almost
anything which brings us to the Philips
flex a budget bluetooth speaker that has
an impressive 12 hour battery life and
an ace up its sleeve you can pull it
apart on the top and bottom to expose
the radiator which supposedly gives the
sound better audio quality and we'll get
to that more in a minute in terms of the
design the speaker is really lightweight
and wrapped in silicone which helps it
withstand the elements unlike some of
Philips other speakers though this one's
not fully waterproof but it can take a
few drops of water let's call it
water-resistant there's two buttons on
the side that help you pair it to any
bluetooth-enabled device you can also
hook it up to a three-and-a-half
millimeter auxiliary cable to this port
on the other side and the speaker takes
a microUSB cable to recharge the 12 hour
battery the hockey puck style design is
meant to sit on its back with the
speaker firing up into the air but you
can also stand it up on its side or use
the lanyard hole to hang it from a
backpack or belt loop it comes in two
colors right now this blue green
combination and another black-and-white
model but the company tells us that we
can expect to see more colors coming
soon so let's get to the sound quality
despite what the marketing materials
claim expanding the speaker doesn't
really do much to improve the sound
which isn't so great to begin with
there's only a 2 watt speaker inside so
we weren't expecting too much especially
when you've got competing models like an
Amazon B TV 2 that has a 3 watt speaker
and actually cost 10 bucks less i
sampled a bunch of different music
through the philips flex and wasn't very
impressed with the sound quality it
tends to distort at moderately loud
volumes and there's a definite absence
of bass and mid-range frequencies there
I get that Philips is trying to keep
costs low here but if you're looking to
expand your dollar the furthest and get
better audio quality I actually
recommend bypassing this model and
checking out either the JBL clip the
logitech ex
100 or even the Amazon btv - all of
those are the same price or cheaper and
they all sound much better than the Flex
you can read more details in my full
review on SEANET but that's going to do
it for me I'm Justin you this has been a
review of the Philips flex bluetooth
speaker thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
