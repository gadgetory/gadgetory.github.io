look at dell inspiron
11 this is a brand new 11 inch ultra
portable laptop from Dell and rather
than competing with some of the more
high-end 11 inch systems that we've seen
recently this is really more of a direct
competition with low-cost tablets and
phablet it starts at 349 for an AMT
version you can pay a little bit more
and get an Intel version and Dell says
you'll also be able to get Intel's new
Haswell chips in there which could lead
to a very powerful 11 inch system indeed
even though they're going to keep the
cost pretty down the interior is very
matte black it's got the large touchpad
you've seen more expensive Dell systems
so it really seems like a good mix of
sort of low cost system that looks a
little bit more upscale than it actually
is they claim that battery life is gonna
be very along because it has actually a
larger battery of 50 watt hour battery
compared to what you get in some of the
other super-tiny systems out there so
we're very interesting to see how this
matches up with some of the low-cost
Intel Atom based hybrids and tablets and
low-end laptops that we've seen recently
with this comes out later in the year
I'm Dan Ackerman and that is the Dell
Inspiron 11</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
