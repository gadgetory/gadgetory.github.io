of scaling not one but two automotive
mountains number one get folks used to a
completely new kind of car number two
get them warmed up to a completely new
brand of car where do you do that send
them down to the car dealer people hate
going to the car dealers
instead you intercept them where they
already are here at the mall and when
they go inside they get introduced to a
car that does things almost completely
differently than what they're used to
now here's the model a says you'll see
it on the freeway but this is not the
most interesting part of the story to me
over here is naked versions this is this
mattress size thing I'm kneeling on is
the battery a huge amount of lithium-ion
cells put together in a way that is
carefully cooled carefully monitored and
delivering a lot of power forty sixty or
eighty five kilowatt hours are the
capacity ranges here depending which
model you buy now what happens after
those electrons flow out of here is also
part of the secret sauce they go into
this big canister shaped thing which is
called an inverter an inverter converts
the DC the direct current that is stored
in that battery into the AC the
alternating current which this motor
wants that motor then spins through this
one speed gearbox you don't shift
anything this is a reduction gear it
turns the very high rpms of this motor
into more usable rpms out to the axles
and the road wheels the way this battery
and inverter are designed is a key part
of what Tesla is doing power and range
is a complicated business on a Tesla the
base power train Model S has 362
horsepower 325 foot-pounds of torque
gets to 60 in six and a half seconds the
performance cars have four hundred and
sixteen horsepower and 443 foot-pounds
of torque and they do 60 in 4.4 seconds
they're seriously fast the major
difference between the two is the
throughput of the inverter which sits
between the battery and the motor range
on either car is governed by the battery
size the 40 kilowatt hour battery gets
you about a hundred and sixty miles at
best for ten thousand more you can get
the 60 kilowatt hour battery 230 miles
optimal and for ten thousand on top of
that the 85 kilowatt battery 300 miles
under a best-case
now the Model S is a three row seven
passenger car it's kind of a sedan UV
front row two seats little less Headroom
and I'd like coming back into the second
row you've got basically a sporty bench
three more people there then work your
way back here to me in the rear
compartment
this car is optioned up with the dual
rear facing seats but notice these are
like little kid racing seats with
five-point harnesses okay first of all
this is what you've heard about the
giant 17-inch central LCD that is the
heart of this cars cabin across the top
you've got a static ribbon very much
like you have on a lot of mobile devices
if I go to media I get my media choices
they show up down here
am/fm HD radio XM satellite you've also
got two supported streaming services now
tune in and slacker it's all software
they can add many more but right now
those are your choices on streaming
notice how everything here is popping
into a contextually relevant screen as I
hit it for example here are my tone
controls and the kind of data and
interface you get here you just don't
see in any other car notice the nav
that's Google Maps it's also where your
navigation takes place although I should
point out an important distinction the
mapping is Google Maps the navigation
technology is garment this is not yet
using Google turn-by-turn navigation now
Tesla promises voice to destination in
2013 for now you can just enter stuff on
the screen even when the cars moving a
cheeky approach but they hope you'll
have the passenger do it actually that
also applies even more unusually to the
web browser first of all it's unusual to
get a big web browser in a car unusual
hell it's unheard of and to have this
thing work while the car is moving is
also very Silicon Valley camera is
interesting another one of these places
where Tesla's kind of breaking
Convention here's my rear camera I'm not
in Reverse and if I start driving this
camera can stay on another interesting
wrinkle you could have a standard def
camera or in this case we have the high
def camera look at that resolution what
they have in resolution they do not have
in around
view cameras or multiple angle rear view
cameras now more broadly here in the
cabin what's it like to sit in a Model S
obviously it's a very modern feeling
because you're not showered with a lot
of buttons the screen takes that of
course I also know this interesting
thing here Tesla doesn't make every
single part of their car they've gone to
the Mercedes parts bin to get things
like the cruise control the turn signals
and wipers and the gearshift selector up
here if you got to go buy buy from the
best now wireless keys are nothing new
in this day and age even fancy ones but
this one goes to the level of cute to
unlock or lock the car you press on the
roof to unlock or lock the front trunk
or front you press on it same thing goes
for the rear now driving a Model S is
first and foremost a matter of driving
an electric car so everything you know
about cars goes out the window but what
I can tell you that this car does a
little differently than others is it
feels quick and quiet which to me is a
way of saying it feels lightweight it
also is exceptionally quiet I don't hear
any of the motor or gear whine that I've
heard in other electric cars not at low
speed not in high speed not under
braking
and not under full acceleration you
never get used to that about electric
cars either at least not yet now I don't
have the car long enough to give you any
real-world experience with charge and
discharge behavior based on my driving
and any of that I basically had a day
and change with the vehicle so we'll get
our full review and really dig into that
later this is really a finished car and
that's kind of the highest compliment
you can give a company that wasn't
making cars at all a handful of years
ago okay the bottom line on the Tesla
Model S about 51,000 with destination
charge now I know what you're saying
wait a minute
Puppis cars began closer to 60 well I'm
- thing out the $7,500 US federal tax
credit which most everybody is going to
qualify for unless you're dead poor and
if you are you probably not buying one
of these
now the pricing also goes up 10,000 more
for the mid-size battery and 10,000 more
for the big boy battery and yes like
popcorn at the movies your best value is
to buy the big one
now we had the performance car that's
15,000
more which brings you of course the
high-performance inverter it's got a big
battery much better performance adaptive
air suspension and a way fancier
interior you also get a look at the tech
package 3750 puts navigation in that big
screen that is not standard but nothing
will influence people's purchase
consideration of this electric vehicle
as much as their conception of all
electric vehicles that's the big mindset
that people are really trying to get
their heads around and Tesla has only so
much control over that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
