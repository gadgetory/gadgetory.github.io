sudden your car doesn't feel right
maybe it's pulling something is
vibrating there it's making a weird
noise congratulations you just hit a
pothole and it's gonna cost you that's
because your car was designed for the
kinds of roads you see in car
commercials while we increasingly drive
on the kinds of roads you see in
Mogadishu Transportation Research Group
trip estimates that 27% of our major
urban roads are in poor condition and
just 31% in good shape and their top
five metros with lousy roads are all in
areas that don't have hard winters so
there goes that excuse trip also
estimates it in the worst area la Long
Beach Santa Ana motorists average over
800 dollars annually in road condition
related car maintenance and across the
country the average is almost $400 now
bear in mind trip is backed by road
builders among others who want the
government to spend more on road work
but all it takes is one trip to most
countries in Western Europe to realize
how bad the roads are in the US today's
low-profile tires take a beating on
potholes and they in turn don't do much
to cushion the rim of that alloy wheel
ok some practical strategy look ahead at
the road this should go without saying
but I can't tell you how many people
drive right through a huge pothole and
are surprised don't tailgate that kills
your visibility of potholes directly
ahead brake before a pothole not in it
doing that just puts more stress on your
tire wheel and suspension drive straight
through a pothole turning too late to
avoid it means you're turning in the
middle of it and that further exposes
your tires sidewall and the face of your
wheel
and Michelin offers a pothole resistant
tire in some markets but talk to your
tire shop they see everything come in
off the road and they'll know which tire
is that the tougher sidewall than others
most importantly it pays to double check
if there's a pothole ahead and avoid it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
