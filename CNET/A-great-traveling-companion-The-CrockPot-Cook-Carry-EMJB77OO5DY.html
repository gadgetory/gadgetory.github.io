we're gonna be talking about the crock
pot cooking Carrie programmable slow
cooker well I know that crock pot has
become kind of a ubiquitous term for
slow cookers this is the brand that
started it all you may or may not be
surprised to see a $59 price tag on this
particular appliance especially if
you've been shopping around your local
discount warehouse store where you can
pick up a slow cooker for as low as
twenty dollars fifty nine dollars while
certainly not steep or at the top of the
price scale is definitely not what we
would call a bargain basement slow
cooker but the cooking Gary is imbued
with a lot of features that in my
opinion make it worth your money
particularly the fact that it's designed
to be portable it's all well and good to
have a slow cooker that sits on your
counter and makes your dinner while
you're at work but this one is
particularly useful in that you can cook
your dinner while you're at work but
take it to your potluck afterwards this
works particularly well because of these
locks that you see on the lid and
there's a rubber seal underneath the lid
itself that when these two work together
they create a seal that will prevent the
contents of your slow cooker from
splashing out all over the trunk of your
car
another thing that's worth noting in
terms of portability and the importance
of temperature is this dial down here
which tells you the relative temperature
of the contents of your slow cooker
Department of Public Health regulates
that all food that's being held at warm
should be a hundred and thirty-five
degrees Fahrenheit and that dial while
it doesn't give you an exact temperature
range in terms of degrees definitely
gives you an idea of whether or not you
need to plug it in immediately or if you
can let it sit for a while other nice
additions that make it extremely
portable are prongs on the back of the
slow cooker that make it so that you can
wrap the cord for easy storage and easy
transport so well it's certainly not the
cheapest slow cooker on the market right
now it's definitely a good value
particularly when you add in all of
those features that crock-pot has added
to the mix they're seen at I'm Katy
