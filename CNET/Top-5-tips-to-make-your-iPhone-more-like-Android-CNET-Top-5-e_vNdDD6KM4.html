to be way more like Android you've got
lots of options here are the top five
tips to make your iPhone more like
Android we're going to do something
unusual for number five we're going to
look at your tips I asked you guys on
Twitter how you customize an iPhone to
be more like Android the overwhelming
response was by an Android I can't wait
to see what you say
when we do a top five ways to make
Android more like iOS at number four
change your keyboard Apple opened itself
up to third-party keyboards a function
Android has had for a really long time
arguably Google's G board keyboard for
iOS is better than Google's Android
keyboard
G board has Google search built right
into the keyboard microsoft word flow
and swift key are also really good
options number three Google all the
things even though their competitors
Google puts out some of the best apps
for Apple's iOS Chrome can sync up with
your desktop version Google Photos
provides an alternative to iCloud photo
backup the Google Search app is a must
if you want information from Google now
and of course Google Maps is still
awesome at number two get to know
widgets one of my favorite things on
Android is the quick settings menu so
why not try to recreate it
this is launcher Pro customized to give
me Android like shortcuts to things like
Wi-Fi and hotspot settings
unlike Android Apple doesn't let you put
widgets wherever you want however lots
of apps support getting your information
at a glance by transit outlook and
Amazon and the number one way to make
your iPhone more like Android is
jailbreak that thing iOS is so locked
down Android does not have this problem
a jailbroken iPhone can install apps
from non apple app stores and with a lot
of functionality to an iPhone you can
change the default Maps app to Google
customize the control center and have
iOS respond to gestures with something
like activator be aware jailbreaking
will void your warranty if you
ring I have both in Android and an iOS
device for more top fives check out
