and Google launched the pixel 2 both are
fantastic phones with different pros and
cons both the iPhone and pixel 2 are
water-resistant which is great for extra
protection but they also don't have
headphone jacks and you'll need to use
wireless headphones or a dongle to
listen to music while neither phones
have a mind-blowing design the iPhone 8
looks generally sleeker with its all
glass back but the pixel 2 has a
slightly larger display with a higher
resolution it also doesn't exhibit any
of the reported screen issues found in
the larger pixel 2 XL
due to its different screen technology
both phones take fantastic photos and
use a single lens rear camera with
optical image stabilization they can
capture slow-motion video and fun giphy
photos too but the pixel 2 can take
dramatic bouquet style portrait photos
on both cameras they don't always come
out perfect but it works pretty well and
it's an enjoyable feature to have the
iPhone 8 has an a 11 Bionic processor
from Apple while the pixel 2 has a
snapdragon 835 chipset from Qualcomm we
ran benchmark tests including antutu 3d
mark and Geekbench in every test the
iPhone 8 consistently beat the pixel -
that doesn't mean the pixel - is a
slouch at all
but when it comes to the numbers the
iPhone 8 wins it during our battery
tests for continuous video playback on
airplane mode the iPhone 8 lasted 14
hours and 12 minutes
it also has wireless charging in the
same test the pixel tube didn't last as
long clocking in 13 hours and 28 minutes
a large part of what phone you buy
depends on what ecosystem you're
comfortable with Apple's iPhone 8 runs
iOS 11 and has a digital voice assistant
Siri iOS also features syncing iMessages
across devices and Apple pay the pixel -
runs Android Orio with Google assistant
ok Google what do fruit bats eat it also
has google lens which cause up
information about the world around you
using the camera and
lenz will roll out to other Android
phones later if you're already not
deeply integrated in the Apple OS
ecosystem I personally go with a pixel
to true its processor isn't as powerful
as iPhone 8 on paper and it's battery
doesn't last as long but I prefer the
pixels sharper screen and camera
features it also starts out at about $50
less than the iPhone 8 so you could keep
more dough in your wallet too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
