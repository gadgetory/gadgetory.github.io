I'm here at GE zoo micro Factory in
Louisville Kentucky called first build
and I'm with the prototype of their new
micro kitchen the idea behind the micro
kitchen is packing everything you need
into one six foot long kitchen module so
in here we have a sink with a
retractable faucet a capacitive touch
faucet a cutting board a dishwasher a
fridge a freezer a induction cooktop
advantium microwave and a regular old
oven all in one mono block the concept
here is really cool they're looking to
tailor this to the ever-growing number
of Millennials and baby boomers who are
moving into the city and want the same
level of premium kitchen but need it in
a smaller space for their apartments
that said this much compacted premium is
gonna cost as the estimated retail for
this thing right now is fifteen thousand
dollars but you can start to see the
justification for the cost when you pull
it apart the advantium microwave all on
its own is going to be a couple of
thousand dollars the induction cooktop
is new technology that directly heats
your pans and keeps the rest of the
surface cooler not to mention as it's
all one smooth glass surface you can
cook as many things as you can fit on
there so right now they actually have
touch screens controlling everything
here and hopefully at some point they'll
add Wi-Fi capability as well which means
you can control it from your phone
that's gonna all depend upon the input
they get from the community that they're
going to be using to help them finish
this product my concerns here are that
those who can afford this might be able
to still afford apartments where they
can fit a full-sized fridge or a full
sized oven the reduced space might not
let you keep your week's worth of food
also this is still a prototype and
getting high powered heating and cooling
appliances right next to each other is
going to be a very tricky challenge so
the micro kitchen is going to be a work
in progress for a while
but they very first versions you can buy
you'll be able to buy in quarter four of
this year 2014 with the micro kitchen at
GES first build for CNET
