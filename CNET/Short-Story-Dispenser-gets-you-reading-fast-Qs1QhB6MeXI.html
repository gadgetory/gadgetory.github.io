ever been bored have you ever had
nothing to do for minutes on end short
editions of publishing house in France
and again it's stories shared more
widely they came up with this neat idea
of putting dispensers in public places
like airports hospitals restaurants the
filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola was so
impressed with one he brought one back
over to the US and installed in his cafe
zoetrope what's neat about this is
there's over 85,000 different stories
you can get by pushing one of these
buttons and they're printed on a piece
of paper about the size of a receipt
paper but there are papers thick has a
nice feel to it you read the story and
like most people I found myself sharing
the story with someone next to me and
it's kind of a little more fun than
looking at my phone or scorns the social
media the short rate dispenser is not
designed for consumers is for businesses
and governments to install like public
places right now there you have a few of
them in the US and they're hoping to
roll out more in 2018 if you can't see
one in person check out their website we
could actually read the stories there so
this is Patrick with CNET at unveiled at
CES 2018</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
