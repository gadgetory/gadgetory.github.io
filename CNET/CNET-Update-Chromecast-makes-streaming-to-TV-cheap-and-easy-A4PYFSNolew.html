cheap to stream video to your television
I'm Bridget Carey and this is your CNET
update Google has come up with a device
that lets you stream online media to any
HDTV for just $35 say hello to the
chromecast it's a small stick you plug
into the HDMI port on the back of any TV
you connect it to your home Wi-Fi and
with a tap of a button you take the
video or music that's playing on your
phone or your tablet or even your
computer and you beam it to your TV it
works with Android devices as well as
iPhones and iPads and it works with
Chrome web browser for Windows and Mac
computers apps for Netflix and YouTube
have a chrome cast button programmed in
and you can also stream videos and music
from Google Play your device becomes
your remote for controlling playback and
volume you can even multitask on your
device without interrupting the video
that's playing on your TV
it also can show anything from the web
on your TV because it can mirror what's
on your Chrome web browser
another cool perk is that any device in
your home can become a remote control
for what's currently playing on the TV
regardless of which device started
playing the video so if your sister
launches something from our iPhone you
can take over later from your Android
tablet and soon there will be more apps
that work with Chrome cast including
Pandora the price makes this an amazing
product for $35 it works with the
computers you already have in your home
you can't beat that price and no other
TV streaming product is this versatile
for example Apple TV can do some of
these things but it's limited to Apple
products and it costs $100 oh and
another perk if you weren't sold already
it comes with three months of free
netflix but that's not the only Google
news the company also unveiled a
brand-new version of the Nexus 7 tablet
which goes on sale Tuesday this
refreshed version of the popular
seven-inch tablet has a full HD screen
and a rear 5 megapixel camera but it
costs a little more than last year's
model starting at 230 dollars
and along with a new tablet comes
a new version of Android Android 4.3
operating system is a small upgrade to
jellybean it includes multi-user
restricted profiles it's good for
families that share a tablet and want to
limit their kids access to apps and
prevent in-app purchases all Android
users can also check out a new games app
called Google Play games
it shows what games your friends are
playing and Google Play will have a
section just for textbooks instead of
paying full price students can rent a
textbook for six months at an 80 percent
discount that your tech news update you
