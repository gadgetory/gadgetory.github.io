continuing with our vacuum coverage
today we're gonna look at the Panasonic
MC UL 49 jet force bagless upright
vacuum this vacuum retails for one
hundred and forty eight dollars and is
found exclusively at Walmart so you can
find similar Panasonic models on their
website and on other third-party sites
this vacuum definitely breaks the mold
in terms of appearance and how it works
and it took some getting used to
especially with this self adjusting
height feature that it has unfortunately
even though it's a budget-friendly
vacuum with that one hundred and forty
eight dollar price point it doesn't have
the kind of performance that even makes
it worth that money it did perform well
on our sand and sawdust tests on
hardwood and picked up 100% of the
debris but it never came in the top tier
with any other debris type no matter the
flooring surface so performance is
definitely a bit lacking with this
vacuum it does have some features I like
such as this retractable cord but you
can also find that on their Eureka a
s110 for a I do like this dusting brush
tool that's fully adjustable and can
move on different angles but its partner
the turbo tool for pets unfortunately it
was highly highly ineffective and didn't
really pick up any of the pet hair on
any of the upholstered surfaces we
tested it on if you're looking for a
budget-friendly sub $200 vacuum you'd be
better off looking at the hundred and
$79 bissell power glide deluxe pet
vacuum or at the Hoover Windtunnel three
high-performance bagless upright which
is also priced at a hundred and seventy
nine dollars I understand the need for a
budget-friendly vacuum I'm on a budget
myself but when you're looking at it
appliance that's probably gonna be in
your home for about a decade you don't
want to skimp on that extra thirty or
forty dollars just to save a dime first
