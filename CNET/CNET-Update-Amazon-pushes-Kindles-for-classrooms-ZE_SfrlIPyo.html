I'm Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update digital books may not be
replacing paper books in schools anytime
soon but Amazon is paving the way with a
new online tool called whisper cast it
lists schools and businesses manage a
fleet of Kindle accounts teachers and
bosses can push out certain books and
documents to everyone in a designated
group and everyone doesn't need to own a
Kindle they just need some sort of
Kindle app amazon also lets schools by
Kindles and bulk and set custom profiles
that can block facebook disable
purchasing or put limits on web browsing
and if you didn't have enough tablet

made its own android tablet called the
insignia flex it will be out in november
for somewhere around two hundred and
fifty dollars that's according to a
report from reuters it's in the small
tablet price range but it has a 9.7 inch
screen so this is where you cheap but we
don't know how it will perform all we
know is that it'll have a dual core 1
gigahertz processor running android 4.0
retailers all want to make their own
tablets these days you got amazon barnes

users will want to visit it on a daily
basis a new TV service called Aereo is
working on something that could shake up
television as you know it by letting you
watch live TV on the web Aereo streams
channels from broadcast TV which are all
those trails that you can get for free
if you had a digital
and now just added the ability to watch
channels from any web browser it also
works on Apple devices and the Roku box
Aereo charges fees if you want to record
a show starting at a dollar for a day
pass or eight dollars a month only New
Yorkers can test this out now it's still
a really young service but if the
concept is successful it could hurt the
broadcast TV business by making it
easier for folks to cut the cord that's
