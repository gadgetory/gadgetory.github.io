almost every modern car but with older
models that's not always the case here
are the three best ways to add bluetooth
to any car short of buying a brand new
head unit the easiest and most common
way to add bluetooth to a vehicle's
radio is by using a Bluetooth receiver
pair your phone to the Bluetooth
receiver and any audio you stream from
your phone will be sent to the receiver
which then plugs into the 3.5 millimeter
input jack or the auxiliary in in your
vehicle this is typically found around
the center controls or sometimes inside
the center console switch the audio
source on the radio to aux in and you
should hear your music because every car
is different bluetooth receivers come in
a few different configurations sambar
12-volt or USB powered and others are
battery operated if you have an auxilary
import that's near the 12 volt socket or
USB port it's best to go with the former
if not the cords may not reach and
you'll need a 3.5 millimeter extension
cord or a battery operated Bluetooth
receiver which you will also need to
keep charged if your car or radio
doesn't have an auxilary input you'll be
better off with an FM transmitter
effectively the FM transmitters of today
are also bluetooth receivers but instead
of sending the audio to the stereo
through an auxiliary cable it broadcasts
it over an open FM radio frequency you
then tune your stereos FM tuner to the
correct frequency and you should hear
the music being streamed from your phone
a big boon for the FM transmitter is the
lack of wires but depending on which one
you buy you might also suffer the
occasional audio dropout or static if
you don't mind not being able to stream
your music through your car's stereo and
you just want to make hands-free calls
you can opt for a dedicated Bluetooth
speakerphone however in a lot of cases
these are more expensive than the other
two options they clip to the Sun Visor
above the driver and pair to your phone
like any other Bluetooth speaker when
you answer a call both the audio and
microphone input are handled by the
visor mounted speakerphone for more tips
and tricks and other how to's be sure to
