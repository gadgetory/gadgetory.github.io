Newton's mpge explains and our top five
car tech trends to watch in 2015 it's
time to check the tech EC cars
differently and under the hood but also
check the tech and are known for telling
it like it is ugly is included at no
extra cost
the good the bad the bottom line this is
CNN on cars
welcome to CNET on cars the show all
about high tech cars and modern driving
i'm brian kool-aid i can tell you right
now no car we've had in this year has
generated so many slack jaws and
requests to take a picture of it as the
BMW i8 an amazing sculpted body gullwing
doors and underneath all that carbon
fiber and a powerplant they've never
played with before this is a car we have
to drive let's get out their checks
attack
when BMW said they were gonna start with
a clean sheet for their eyes series of
cars they weren't kidding about this one
when you attack a corner and get on an
attorney it's just fun
the i8 looks drives and moves itself
like almost nothing else on the road the
i8 is BMWs first plug-in hybrid but as
you can see they didn't exactly go after
the Prius
this car has concept car looks now it's
also impressive as the construction
technologies used here aluminum and
plastic panels or what you see but you
don't see is a carbon-fiber reinforced
plastic passenger cell or what they call
in racing a tub makes the car incredibly
strong but also exceptionally light and
that's critical and you've only got a
three cylinder gas engine and a smallish
electric motor efficiency is important
here in the age of performance inside
it's a 2+2 nominally the +2 parts a
little optimistic as you can see now the
first thing that grabs you about the
cabin of the i8 is not some amazing
futuristic interface notice most of this
switch gear is physical standard BMW
stuff you do have an instrument panel
that's all LCD and of course you've got
your eye drive screen right here but
what does grab you is the very spacious
futurism of this it's low slung you sit
low the dash is low it feels very wide
it's a distinctive experience a lot of
cameras on this car you've got a rear
camera of course there's also a front
camera and it can be stitched together
with mirrors to give you an overview
camera over here is the button that's an
interesting way of enabling or disabling
kind of the perimeter curtain of driver
safety tech collision avoidance and you
can set exactly what systems are turned
on into what sensitivity media sources
on this car are pretty much what you see
in other BMWs with the ability to have a
hard drive storage space external
devices plug in through the USB and aux
you've also got a snap-in 4g adapter
available here we don't have that on our
car but notice a couple things in this
vehicle a M stands for mourning and CD e
stands for what you had to lick
eight to buy this car because it does
not get AM radio and it has no optical
disc slot
now that's futurism whether you like it
or not now when you're in navigation
mode this is a little different other
BMWs it talks to the powertrain to best
put it in the right mode of electric gas
or combination thereof to get the best
efficiency out of your drive not just
the best time in short its distance okay
drive controls we know this sort of
spatula shapeshifter on BMWs before it
with the sport gate to the left
start/stop button below that a Z drive
to force it into electric if it has
sufficient battery no sport or Sport+
you merely have comfort as your standard
eco as your reduced or retarded
performance when the shifters in sport
the whole car goes into sport mode and
that's reflected in the gauges as you
can see up under its carbon fiber and
aluminum nickers is a one and a half
liter turbo three cylinder gas engine in
the best that drives the rear wheels
only through a six-speed Automatic out
front is an electric motor and that does
the front wheels only through a
two-speed gearbox the two ends are only
connected by a software add it all up
and it spells all-wheel drive but in a
very unusual way total horsepower is 362
420 pound-feet of torque or on tap that
gets you to 60 in 4.2 seconds under the
right conditions you have 22 miles of
pure electric driving per charge and
that charge takes about two hours on a
240 outlet all said your mpg is 28 and
your mpg E in electric mode is 76 in the
green car world those with these tepid
numbers were it not for this car's
performance
some people have driven this car come
away a little disappointed I understand
that it's prowess I thought it was gonna
be a New Age GT and in that respect it's
fantastic the car handles sy low and
flat as it feels inside to here if they
develop a exhaust it's not at all wimpy
like you'd expect from a highly
electrified vehicle they've tuned it
demon counteract that impression ride
quality is great at all these matters to
me cuz we're gonna buy a car you gotta
live with it and the shifts super quick
the only odd note I've found in this car
is around town when you're not really
into it it'll sometimes fall in its face
as it tries to decide between what
blended mode of power it wants to be in
or if it should be an electric only and
sometimes you'll get this kind of weird
indecision I'm not a big fan of cars on
steroids so bear that in mind if you are
this may not be enough for you but I
find it's athletic without being brutal
that's my kind of car and it's still fun
not sterile okay the i8 is a hundred and
thirty seven thousand dollars worth of
tomorrow mpg is good for a car this fast
but people who buy these cars aren't
pinching pennies and while that
performance is exceptional as I pointed
out it doesn't come across as brutal or
extreme so what's missing that market
instead it balances both and lets you
own a piece of a very impressive
automakers future vision and big best
check out our full review with all the
interesting details on the i8 over at
car cnet.com and while you're there you
may as well check out our coverage on
it's interesting but different little
brother the battery electric I three
conventional wisdom holds that elderly
drivers are dangerous because they can't
see well here well or react real well
but what if that's not the entire story
in a moment the new old driver trend
lines and how technology is making a
difference
the rate of involvement in fatal
accidents by elderly drivers has been
plummeting since the late 90s so there
remains a pretty big difference between
a driver in their 70s the green trend
line and one in their 80s the great
trend line but since 1997 overall it's
been the older drivers who had the
biggest drops in fatal crashes per
driver and per mile driven a new study
by the triple-a finds that about 34
percent of elderly drivers have ever
talked on their phone while driving
compare that to 82% of people 25 to 39
older drivers tend to wear seatbelts
drive sober drive less and less at night
now to be sure older drivers are
involved in a lot more fatal accidents
with a pronounced spike beginning at
about 70 years old but they're not blind
to that more than three-quarters of
elderly drivers believe they should be
subject to driver health screenings and
be required to renew their licenses in
person and technology will help more in
the future
boomers in their mid 50s and mid 60s now
are buying the most new cars per capita
replacing 35 to 44 year olds according
to a recent study by the University of
Michigan that means new technologies
that focus on blind spot lane departure
and collision warning are likely to be
snapped up by the drivers who can
benefit from them the most nice when it
works out that way
it pays to double check if you or a
senior driver you know has a car with
these collision avoidance technology
welcome back to see net on cars coming
to you from our home at the Mount Tam
Motor Club just north of the Golden Gate
Bridge now you recall that BMW i8 we
just saw had both an mpg and an MPG
rating that's a new rating that showed
up in 2010 first applied to the Nissan
Leaf all electric and to the Chevy Volt
plug-in hybrid now since then a lot of
other cars have hit the market that have
an mpge rating and yet a number of folks
who drive them don't really know what it
means
sounds like we need a car tech 101 now
of course we all recognize the mpg in
MPGe that's the easy part
but that little lowercase e at the end
that's actually surprisingly powerful
let's break down the acronym first of
all mpg E stands for miles per gallon of
gasoline equivalent now the equivalent
part is what we're talking about energy
in a gallon of gas as opposed to the
volume of a gallon of gas which is what
mpg basically refers to here's how they
work that out numerically the EPA says
that a gallon of gas has 115,000 BTUs or
British thermal units of potential
energy in it and that they say is
equivalent to 30 3.7 kilowatt hours of
stored electricity kilowatt hours is
typically how you measure the capacity
of a battery now the math isn't simple
as you can imagine and this is part of
how they actually pull that equation
together but let's take a look at how
the cars that use mpg are sorted out a
battery electric car can have mpge
like a Nissan Leaf or a Tesla Model S
all you do is plug them in that's their
only source of power then you've got
plug-in hybrids those are vehicles that
have a gas engine and a bigger battery
and can still run in a blended or
separate modes you've also got hydrogen
fuel cell car which is also electric but
using a different source to generate the
volts what you won't find an MPG rating
on is a conventional hybrid because the
epa is just deemed those to be too
conventional
now if you look at the stickers it's an
interesting story here's a battery
electric car all that has is an MP ge
number cuz it doesn't run in any other
mode there's no gas involved go to a
plug-in hybrid and it gets very bit
here's your MPGe on the left which shows
the pure electric running on the right
here's the blended system number that
shows the fact that it also can run on
gas that's your mpg number what I also
want you to notice is what's in the fine
print on these new stickers look
underneath either the mpg or the MPGe
and you now find a european-style
gallons per hundred miles or over here
kilowatt hours in hundred miles this is
not just semantics if you do this you
can avoid what's called the mpg illusion
which basically says that if you measure
a car that improves from 10 to let's say
15 mpg that is not the same as a car
that improves from let's say 50 to 55
you might think those are equivalent
gains in fact the lower number
improvement is vastly more significant
than the higher number improvement of
the car that started at 50 but if you
measure in energy per hundred miles it's
linear the distortion is taken out
mathematically and of course the gas
engine car doesn't get MPGe at all
you'll see your traditional number there
on the sticker still because all it does
is run on gas in a moment the top five
car technologies I'm watching in 2015
we've even seen that on cars returns
since 1999 the Audi TT has been a
mainstay on roads all over the planet
now Audi's on to the third generation
after a difficult but ultimately very
successful second album they've got to
get this one right else people go
elsewhere for their sports car kicks buy

welcome back to CNN on cars I'm Brian
Coulee time for that part of the show we
answer one of your emails this time it
comes from Paul T well as a question
about fuel additives he says I was
curious if it's a good idea to use fuel
additives they say it could increase
mileage and at the same time cleans the
intake valves and cylinders I'd really
appreciate it if you guys can bring up
this short topic on your show it's
actually not such a short topic Paul if
you wanted to really get into it with
car buffs this can go on for days and
come to blows but here's my thinking on
it first of all I find it very hard to
believe that the world's refineries and
automakers with their armies of
engineers somehow are leaving some MPG
on the table that additives makers are
the only ones who have the secret code -
doesn't really wash with me there's
another way to look at the EPA
Environmental Protection Agency here in
the US does not test fuel additives they
register them if you find one of these
it somehow proclaims it's got sort of an
EPA endorsement not the case they simply
register them but make no indication
whether they work or not now there are
also devices you can add to your car
that go on the fuel line in the air
intake some of them go in the ignition
that supposedly say they're going to
improve your efficiency some of them
dramatically they did a test on those a
few years ago and the EPA found that
most of them did nothing a few of the
major MPG worse and a very few improved
it vary slightly depending on your drive
style so just think about the technology
and sophistication in your modern car
the way that it's built the way it's
monitored the way it's
computer-controlled
and decide if you think it's likely that
a 5 or $10 bottle of some fuel additive
you dump in the tank is gonna uncover
mpg that your car maker couldn't get to
now this of course is our last episode
of 2014 so around this time of year
we're thinking a lot about what we
should be covering next year a lot of
that of course comes from your emails
but also our scanning of the landscape
of automotive technology so here is an
early sample of what I think is gonna
dominate the car tech headlines in the
year ahead my top 5 car tech technology
is to watch
yeah this is one of those videos I know
I'll regret the minute I do it because
there are so many important technologies
breaking out in cars in the year ahead
the choosing just 5 is kind of a fool's
errand so I volunteered here are the
five technologies to watch takeoff in
2015 number five fuel cell cars now
these are not gonna be big volume by any
stretch but they will be big headlines
Toyota just put their Mirai fuel cell
car into limited production and Honda is
gonna be hyping up the intro of its new
one in 2016 consumers are no longer
blown away by the idea of a battery
electric car interesting owning one
seems to have hit a natural and rather
low plateau at least until we get a
battery breakthrough that replaces the
hours with minutes in the meantime
hydrogen fuel cell offers a tantalizing
look at the future
number four integrated connectivity I
mean 3G or 4G built into the car it's
gonna be a big story in 2015 some car
makers will do it kind of the lame way
and use it primarily to create a hot
spot in the vehicle as GM largely does
and it is gonna do in big volume but
others will tie it more directly into
the car's dashboard services and apps
the way out II and Hyundai are doing it
makes a car more like your phone who's
not gonna be into that number three dash
cams now I couldn't be wrong and this
may remain famously our Russian thing
but the interest I've heard from you in
the past year in dash cams along with
the fact that we finally have some big
names entering the game along with the
fact that our roads only seem to be more
and more of a lawless hell every year
adds up to more than a hunch number 2
driver assist things like blind spot
lane departure and forward collision
tech are nothing new but next year we'll
see two big trends around them to help
save you from your own lousy driving one
affordable cars will get these
technologies much more commonly because
keeping safety tech on just the high-end
cars it's kind of a bad message from car
makers and we'll see them swing to being
mostly active technologies not so much
passive warnings that's part of the
march toward autonomous cars before I
get you to number one safer airbags may
be a big innovation next year this
Takata airbag recall is a fiasco that is
still blossoming as we end
20:14 but otto leave of sweden recently
won awards for a new kind of airbag
inflator that uses hydrogen instead of
what is basically a little rocket motor
like other airbags do you see problems
with humidity and that kind of inflator
or what caused many of these Takata
airbags to blow so wildly and create a
recall they can't even make enough parts
to repair our number one tech to watch
next year has to be apps still fairly
rare in 2014 but look at Volvo which is
going to start installing a suite of
them in every car starting with their
mid 2015 onward by the end of next year
it'll seem like an auto mission to find
a new vehicle that doesn't have some
built in services like Pandora Yelp or
live search for destination also 2015 is
the year that many car makers now say
they will actually put apple carplay and
android auto into production making up
for all those blown promises of doing it
in 2014
luckily pioneer and alpine beat them to
it in the aftermarket thanks for
watching hope you enjoyed this episode
thanks for being with us in fact thanks
for being with us all 2014 this is our
final episode of the year we're back
with you top of 2015 with big stories
from CES and the Detroit Auto Show in
