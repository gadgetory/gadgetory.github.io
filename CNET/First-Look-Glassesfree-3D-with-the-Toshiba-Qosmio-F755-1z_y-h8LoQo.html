the toshiba qosmio f 755 3d this is
actually a flight ly updated version of
the original f 755 3d that we looked at
about halfway through 2011 what made
that laptop and this one special is that
they have auto stereoscopic 3d screens
that means you can watch a 3d movie
without having to wear those cumbersome
active shutter 3d glasses the way it
works is the laptop uses its webcam to
keep an eye on your face and use the
special eye tracking software to adjust
the different levels of the stereoscopic
image so that it always stays kind of
instinct for you the downside of course
is that it really only works for one
person at a time because it has to track
your eye movements and of course the
original version only worked with 3d
blu-rays and a couple of downloadable
videos did not work with video games
which seemed like a fairly big omission
the reason why we're excited to check
this out again is because this new
version thanks to some updated drivers
from nvidia actually does work with 3d
video games and well we loaded up a
whole bunch of games tried it out worked
about as well as any system with nvidia
3d vision does unfortunately the catcher
is and you knew there had to be one
there's a really underpowered GPU in
here it's fine for regular casual gaming
but once you move into 3d mode it just
doesn't have the horsepower it's an
nvidia GT 540m and it just can't play
game smoothly in 3d mode because it
requires that the games come up at the
full 1920 x 1080 resolution which you
normally wouldn't deal with a mid-level
graphics card if you're just doing
casual mainstream gaming now turn the
three day off in 2d it actually plays
games just fine but turn that 3d on
because you're stuck at higher
resolution even though it knocks it down
to 1366 x 768 in 3d mode because it's
doubling so much of the information and
it's just too choppy to play we tried
Skyrim we tried battlefield 3 a portal
actually worked okay in our review we've
got some more frames per second
breakdowns of how different games work
in 2d and 3d mode one of the things I'm
pleased about with this update though is
the blu-ray performance is actually
better on the
original you put a disc in and you go
and get a sandwich to come back and it
still wouldn't be loaded up this time
the the custom toshiba player used to
watch the blu-ray movies in 3d it's
still a little bit sluggish but it's
actually a lot better and it stayed in
3d mode the entire time we didn't have
to mess around with a lot to get it to
work so if you're just a huge fan of 3d
everything and you want to watch 3d
blu-ray movies without glasses on it's
actually kind of fun if more games would
work on the system it would be a lot
more fun because I think 3d gaming on a
PC is actually a lot more flexible than
let's say 3d gaming on a console but
until they get a more powerful GPU in
here this is still</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
