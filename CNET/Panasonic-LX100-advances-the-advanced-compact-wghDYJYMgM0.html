compact was a great camera to finish off
2014 with really good photo and video
quality a great set of features and
class-leading performance this is
probably one of my favorite compact
cameras ever it's large 4/3 sensor
delivers great photo quality for the
price and its 4k video looks
significantly better than plain old HD
it doesn't have the broadest tonal range
I've ever seen and there's not a lot of
recoverable detail and shadows and
highlights but you can get sharp JPEG
photos up through ISO 1600 and if you
shoot RAW you can get usable ones
through ISO 6400 depending upon the
scene and if you're not picky the rest
of the range looks ok scaled down its 4k
videos also worth the price premium it
doesn't have the supporting features
that a lot of videographers would have
liked such as a mic input but the
quality is the best I've seen in this
class and with the 4k photo feature you
can pull decent 8 megapixel stills as
long as the video doesn't have really
fast action which makes is a great
alternative to burst shooting it's also
pretty fast with the best continuous
shooting in its class and reasonably
zippy autofocus and processing and with
one glaring exception the feature set is
quite comprehensive it's got a fast 24
to 75 millimeter zoom lens with a
maximum aperture range of F 1.7 to F 2.8
there's a small but very nice electronic
viewfinder and it also has in camera
features such as the ability to create
stop-motion animations using its fixed
focus 11 frame per second or 40 frame
per second burst modes and I really do
like the design it's got a nice grip
which is more than I can say for some
competitors and it feels
well-constructed their manual dials for
shutter speed aperture and exposure
compensation plus a programmable control
ring and three programmable buttons the
bundled flash fits into the hot shoe
it's not perfect I really miss having a
tilting or articulating LCD the camera
really needs to come with a lens hood
and the buttons feel a little too flat
plus if you like to work on a tripod a
plate will obstruct the battery and SD
compartment overall though it's a great
package it's not cheap but as the price
drops over time it'll be a great buy for
some people I'm Laurie grinning from C
net and this is the panasonic lumix DMC
