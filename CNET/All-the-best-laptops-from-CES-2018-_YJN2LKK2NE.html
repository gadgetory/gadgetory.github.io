live coverage of CES 2018 I'm Dan
Ackerman here with my pal Xiomara blanco
and josh goldman to talk about the best
laptops that they've uncovered at this
year's show we are going to dive right
in because we have a gigantic selection
here of some of the some of the cool
things that we've seen and I'm actually
going to start off with what I think is
probably one of the most impressive
things here and that's something that
Xiomara went to go see and write about
and this is the Acer Swift 7 and tell me
Xiomara what is it's a big claim to fame
well this is really popular because it's
technically right now the world's
thinnest computer and that is a big
trend with laptops if you didn't know
they really like to make them really
skinny just like supermodels but it has
a bigger screen than last year's model
and with Acer we're not used to seeing
things like that they're usually very
middle-of-the-road
very affordable as we do a lot of gaming
laptops this is like a nice surprise and
everyone's been really impressed with it
it's been one of the things that people
just keep talking about here especially
because yeah look at that
and last year's model had a 13 inch
screen this one has a 14 inch screen I
think it's got LTE built in as well you
got the fingerprint reader I do feel
like at this point we're shaving just
like you know percentages of a
millimeter off it's not really like it
8.9 millimeters versus nine point nine
millimeters it's not a huge difference
but it's nice to have sort of those
bragging rights I'm looking for lighter
though also I feel like this is not it's
not the lightest laptop out there it
actually feels you're just rather if it
feels right a little bit heavier than
you think it would looking at it cuz
it's so small yeah well and it's also
all metal so I mean obviously it's gonna
add some weight to it but yeah it
definitely feels solid right I don't
know how how it could not feel solid
this thing so yeah though it's a nice I
haven't seen it in person part it's
gonna be expensive isn't it yeah I
believe it starts at 899 and it has 7th
generation Intel Core processors not the
latest so that's one knock against it
hmm and I think the super I think it
goes way up to I think I thought 1699
for at least one of the models yeah now
we had a blackout yesterday first time
I've ever seen that I've seen a lot of
things at CES we saw rain I've seen snow
one year but I never saw blackout before
and when you have that you probably went
really long but if you have a laptop
with like really long battery life you
might be in a good position because you
can survive longer than everyone else if
their laptops cop out at five hours six
hours eight hours what if you had a
laptop that ran for 20 hours that is the
promise of this new generation of
laptops with Qualcomm Snapdragon
processors inside which is basically the
same chip you find in a lot of mobile
phones and they say that they'll run a
really long time because they're super
efficient so this is the Lenovo mix 630
it's one of the first you know two or
three or four of these systems and it's
done in the the Novo mix you know tablet
you know surface like tablets with a
keyboard that clips on in a cool
kickstand style they claim 20 hours
obviously it's always on LTE because
that's the entire point of these
Snapdragon systems it really is taking
the best stuff from phones and and
putting it into into laptops one thing I
did like about this especially is you
clip it out of the little kickstand
thing so you've got your tablet part
right here you haven't seen these
tablets here but I like the clip-on
keyboard that unlike shall we say some
other brands it comes with it you don't
have to buy it separately right but the
kickstand on it look at that that's like
really solid it's got a big hinge right
here right in the middle and you just
kind of slide it on let's see we can do
it in one in one attempt magnetically it
snaps right on there and then this has
enacted back here and like that so I
thought that was pretty cool the one
weird thing about these Snapdragon
systems is you know what an operating
system they all come with by default
anybody anybody Windows 10 - yeah
exactly so what is what is Windows 10 is
since that stripped-down version that
can only install apps from the official
Microsoft app store and it means that F
stores kind of a mess it is Chrome you
can't get out the web browsers you can't
get like real Photoshop
you probably can't I don't know if
Spotify is in the mic if it's if it's in
the Microsoft Store then no but there's
a workaround you can actually upgrade to
Windows 10 Pro for free just by clicking
a couple of buttons for some contractual
reason they feel like they need to put
Windows 10 ass on all of these but they
they go nod wink you know just just go
upgrade it later but they can't promise
that the Snapdragon processor will
support every bit of software out there
that's why they that's why they restrict
and that's the thing that concerns me is
for the vendor sake so we've got that
one and there was one from HP right that
came out when they announced our answers
they've talked about battery life
haven't mentioned anything really about
performance this is basically a phone
inside a phone brain inside a laptop and
I think as we pushed towards people
wanting more and more the one thing
people complain about still is battery
life even we're spoiled now eight hours
nine hours years ago that was not
imaginable now that now it's not enough
12 hours is grade twenty once twenty
becomes the norm you know that's it
that's one of the reasons why I think we
see bigger 14 inch screens 15 inch
screens in these super thin laptops
because they can make the bodies wider
and that's more battery you can fill up
more of the chassis with battery and
that's one way they do it but I'm super
interested to see what these actually do
performance wise we would have to take
them out of windows 10s mode to even
test them to install our testing apps so
so it's a it's it's a little
Schrodinger's cat you can't observe it
without changing it by installing a
Windows 10 Pro instead of that so that's
probably I hope that's not the only
Schrodinger's cat from someone who's
made this week at CES but lenovo has
another cool system that josh suggested
we bring here and that's this guy right
here here you go
that's the ESP expert card one is it the
carpet of the yoga see if it bends all
the way back no there we go so that
means it's harder every one all the way
back into the yoga but you do get that
180 degrees so you can lay it flat to
everybody can gather around and look at
presentations or something
but it is very thin lenovo says it is
the lightest 14 inch business system
okay so that they added three things I
thought were super interesting number
one they have an HDR screen right which
not a lot of laptops have so it's the
first Dolby vision HDR certified yet we
asked them they had a laptop or two with
an OLED screen a couple years ago and
relooked awesome we love those but they
didn't really get picked up anywhere I
guess maybe it's hard to get the screens
and we looked at that was like is that
an OLED screen because it was super
bright they said no it's the it's the
it's the HDR that's making it look that
way so they're getting rid of the OLED
and replacing it basically with the HDR
school right they also said that OLED
screen was only 300 nits the big one of
the big selling points on this one and
the yoga is that it's 500 nits so super
bright use that out outside even with
the glossy screen and shouldn't be a
problem so number two they're adding
everybody's favorite smart home
assistant to a bunch of these system
they put in 360 degree far-field mics so
you can shout out alexa commands at it
from wherever you are in the room so
you're traveling and you want to turn on
your lights at home I guess you could do
that I mean I do the weather all the
time I do I do turn on my lights and do
conversions when we write about
something and we have to go like it's
this much in dollars now what is it in
pounds and I literally shout out the
conversions and I get them back from
from from Alexa from the lake oh I have
I have in my office
sorry to interrupt is this little thing
right here it has a they call it what a
camera they branded the shutter like a
little slider so instead of putting a
sticker over your webcam you can just
switch this over and you don't have to
worry about the FBI looking at you while
you browse YouTube
and I think that just let's just really
meet one less accessory you have to buy
now do you put a post-it note on your
webcam or cover it in some other way
I'm informal survey going up a lot of
people now what do you use I use a
variety of things because I was always
have to take it off so I always have to
find a new sticker to put back on it but
I just got one of those cool little CNET
ones to put on my computer now you do
that on all the computers you use just
your main one just my major print
profile red jaw see you cover your
webcam yeah I just have a little piece
of masking yeah I so interesting I just
don't I just can't be bothered don't do
it I talked to some security guys we're
gonna do a story in see that magazine in
the spring about kind of security for
paranoia or for paranoid people and like
what should you actually do and I really
got conflicting views from different
experts on whether you should do that
some people said yes and other people
said you're not a target don't worry
about it unless you're like a nuclear
scientist or something
you're you're probably okay and also as
pointed out that besides this camera
you've got the microphone and camera in
your phone that you carry around with
you all the time it's probably easier to
hack into than a webcam on a laptop but
well so maybe someday we'll see those
shutters on phones and oh that's a good
idea
but I do like because business laptops
for a long time you could buy models
without webcams on them because they
because for security they wanted that so
it's cool to have this I haven't seen
the physical thing built into a laptop
before but years ago some company sent
me a little clip on version like a
little elongated shutter that you can
bet that you could stick on and then
order a slider thing so there you go
it's got a LexA it's got a shutter and
it's got that HDR screen that fooled me
into thinking it was OLED for a second
now one of our favorite laptops go back
a couple years is the Dell XPS 13 it
really kicked off that minimal bezel
look where they kind of shaved down the
the border surrounding the screen but
it's been a little while and that design
is maybe got a little a little thick a
little clunky so they actually
redesigned it for this year this is I
think when I saw it in person I'm like
this is one of the cooler looking
laptops here it's the new XPS 13 and you
get it white and rose gold on the back
and a few other color options I think
it's a long-overdue redesign of
something that was super awesome went
three years ago when it first came out
but they kind of got eclipsed by other
thinner designs so I'm pleased to see
there's not a ton of internal upgrades
other than new processors but I'm super
pleased to see new colors and a thinner
design on that right so in that lenovo
being of 14 inch it's this what it's a
lightest this is supposed to be for 13.3
inch screen this is the smallest in the
world a branded oh right because pretty
low when they squeeze it down this way a
bunch now how do you feel Xiomara about
the infamous nose cam I'm not a big fan
I don't know anyone who likes to take
selfies from below or who looks good
besides like Rihanna
it's a weird decision I don't know I'm
not a big fan because you can't put it
up here there's no room for the webcam
so a bunch of these super thin laptops
we call them the nose cam and they're
right down there and for Skype calls or
whatever using your webcam for it it's
not always a flattering look unless you
what that Vincent Price sort of under
lit you know Halloween look right there
so the when you're typing if you're
typing while you're doing it your hands
are just gigantic in the camera's hands
but every guy every laptop that has
those super thin bezel and has the same
problem I don't know what the other
solution is unless you have like a
clip-on on the top or something where
you make this top part thicker but
televisions
televisions have super thin bezels all
around now it took a while for laptops
to catch up I feel like you can't really
you can't really go backwards on that
maybe they need a notch just like that
yes that's right right in the middle of
the screen imagine imagine the outcry
over that if you not your your Windows
10 system but I think that's super cool
and I like white laptops I just think
it's everything is gray and silver and
dark grey whenever somebody has a
different color yes I think they used a
layered glass fiber for that and they've
treated it so yeah yeah they've treated
it so it doesn't yellow mhm I know that
was a bit conservative in past they'd
have like white surfaces yeah yeah this
is treated HP vector the new the new one
that came out late last year also is
available in white with a really nice
white right i factored about heating
rose gold white lap yeah yes the other
new thing from jowl is this guy right
here which is the XPS 15 two in one and
they've had XPS 15 s before same you
know super thin bezel here but this is
now one of those guys that flips all the
way around it becomes a tablet like that
but it's a big tablet as something who
uses a lot of tablets would you use one
like this gigantic no I would not I
guess like it's useful when you're
watching and I do the kiosk
sometimes I go look at this write it
down yeah that's why I called the kiosk
mode I don't know what everyone else
called it that's what I call it Oh once
again you have the knows camera here but
this is this is notable for one super
big reason it's one of the first two
things that we've seen with a new combo
chip inside a new Intel chip I think
they call it KB Lake G and it's an Intel
processor with an AMD GPU together on
the same chip it's like a team of rivals
thing these two companies working
together usually bitter rivals now
they've got a combination thing that's
supposed to be you know very efficient
you know doesn't hurt your battery life
but gives you really good discrete
graphics power without having to have a
separate GPU that would I guess
presumably come from Nvidia so this is
the first one that I ever saw with this
new chip there's one other we have here
that has that we'll talk about that in a
second
what I like about this is that if you
could I like the larger ones for that
even though it's awkward to use as a
tablet I like it so that you can put it
down like this on a desk and then set up
a keyboard and mouse in front of it
you've got the keyboard out of your way
that's a lap so yeah so you just
bluetooth you drop it on your desk and
yeah like a little bit like exchanging
game to a desktop getting a keyboard out
of the way so you it's not really far
away for me if you want to use the
touchscreen like I'm really interested
to test one of these for gaming and see
what kind of you know game scores they
they give out with that with that AMD's
GPU and it we haven't had a chance to do
that yet but if you can get decent
gaming performance its up being super
thin like this without having to pay
extra for a regular full-size GPU right
that's potentially very cool
but deal it's not the only guys doing
this did you know that because right
next to it just in cousins if you will
right here is the HP Spectre x-360 15
inch frankly very similar but it
actually has a cool difference well
number one they put the touchpad look at
this off on the side well the Dell one
is centered I don't know which I like
better you see this touchpad is off
center because it's lined up with the
yeah with the spacebar and on this
15-inch it's exactly in the middle
that's a good question I never think
about that until I see it and then I go
I think I might like the middle better I
don't know but I like having the number
pad so that's do use a number pad a lot
no I don't but I like having it I feel
uncomfortable I don't have it anyway
this has also got the Andy until combo
but you can also get it if you don't
want that just with a regular NVIDIA MX
150 we've got a pretty pretty decent you
know a man stream graphics chip so you
have a bunch of options with this which
I also like instead of just having that
one Intel AMD chip you can go in Vidya
and frankly for casual gaming that's
perfectly fine and I love the gold
accents I think they've just done a
spectacular job really cool very modern
this Spectre x-360 the 13-inch one that
I know Laurie loves a lot and the
regular Spectre clamshell it's not a two
and one that I love a lot and I actually
use all the time I think they just done
a spectacular job with designed end of
2017 beginning of 2018 it's I think it's
tough to find sharper looking laptops
than what than what HP is doing right
now I think I mean they said that they
were going after MacBook Pro users I
don't know if there's any MacBook Pro
users out there who would be willing to
switch to Windows but I mean it's a
really nice system yeah yeah we always
say that this guy and frankly the the
non before we had the two of on the
regular Dell XPS 15 was the other kind
of MacBook Pro alike that people liked a
lot and frankly the designs were very
similar we always pointed people in that
direction I'm gonna say probably a lot
but maybe not too
and these guys are probably pretty
similar if you get the Nvidia I think
it's probably more expensive in this
rather rather than the Intel AMD combo
but these things are gigantic
we've got a much smaller one right next
to it that is the Samsung notebook 9 pen
really nice laptops too and they've had
the notebook we tested the notebook 9
Pro and a couple different ones last
year this guy combines elements from a
few of them and add some new stuff it's
a new they happen something I don't
think they've had something called a
notebook 9 pen before how why do you
think it's called that look at that
right up there in the front the pop out
the pop out stylus and that is actually
the regular S Pen that you get with
Samsung phones they're they're
cross-compatible so it's basically the
same stylist you get with a with a note
phone and they had that didn't have a
tablet that was like that a Windows
tablet that you reviewed last year but
the stylus was different it was bigger
and didn't have a little place to hide
that's that's what I like most of having
a place to actually put the stylus on
the on the surface products and
Microsoft that you can usually
magnetically attach them to the side but
it's pretty rare you get a little little
holster for it right there and of course
it's a you know hybrid flips around I
think it's super light actually too
looks like it's got the IR cameras for
windows below sign in how do you do that
at all I'm just what I'm testing to make
sure it works but I don't have it on my
personal so that does the windows hello
facial recognition login and I just turn
it on by default and I never you know
turned it off and frankly it's fantastic
I just sit there if I'm like not paying
attention I click on it to like turn it
on and I turn away and talk to somebody
then I turn back around it's still
looking for me but as soon as I look at
it it's actually really fast yeah face
ideas really fast too but you know you
can get something that's pretty much the
same for Windows and you've had that
long before you had face ID on it on an
iPhone so I actually vote for facial
login for Windows I think it works great
looking at your camera
right oh my gosh it's Microsoft or get
the fingerprint you know you can't
before I use the fingerprint reader on
the MacBook Pro also I think I think
that works really well too and you know
it's super fast because nobody should
have their computer even at home without
a password on it these days I think
we've all heard that yes just like your
phone needs to be locked out in your
laptop needs to be locked down too so we
got one more over here on the list to
look at this is an another this is the
Isuzu Zenbook 14 and the Sousa always
has a ton of stuff here at CES and you
thought this was the this was the
coolest thing that they had yeah I
really like the Zenbook 14 flip it has a
360 degree hinge just like some of the
rest of these but I just really like a
CSS design they have this like circular
brush they also have it in a gold which
looks really nice but it's just a solid
convertible it comes with the Asus
stylus and it's a touchscreen full-size
keyboard fingerprint reader knocking for
that but I'll give it credit for
something else you see a little sticker
right here there's an NVIDIA GeForce
sticker on it because you can get this
with the NVIDIA MX 150 which again seems
to be the go-to mainstream graphics card
for people and again I've used to play
games and stuff I think it works great
if you want to go you know crazy you'll
get a laptop with a within the video you
know 10 60 or 1070 you can even get the
1080 and super thin laptops now but
those get very very expensive for
mainstream I think that I think that's
great and it also has the latest
generation into the 8th gen which
actually gives you a pretty big
performance bump in a couple of systems
that we've that we've tested with it
yeah I mean these are all eighth gens
right they one thing we haven't seen
here since we have all these year I
didn't see a ton of big new gaming
laptops here I saw some gaming desert
apps that were cool very stylish stuff
not really well there was the one gaming
laptop you saw I guess we talked about
it even though we don't have it here the
one prototype for me it wasn't even a
gaming laptop razor had their prototype
this year last year they had the three
screen laptop right this year they had
what they call Project Linda which is
basically the razor blade stealth but
there's a big hole where the touchpad is
and you take your razor phone if you're
one of the people who bought the razor
phone right which is actually it's
supposed to be a really good phone and
you drop it in there and that becomes
your touchpad and the second screen the
laptop is basically just a dock for it
it's a prototype it'll probably never
actually come out but I thought it was
kind of cool and of course it's got all
the you know multi-million color your
razor lights inside so people always
like seeing their prototypes I'm a
little disappointed we didn't see more
specific gaming stuff here but I did see
one gaming thing that was cool
Nvidia does a lot of game streaming they
have a great game streaming service
I think it's called GeForce now and we
saw them demo that you can get I think a
beta client on Windows and on Mac now
also where basically the games are being
played in a cloud somewhere on a
powerful system and you're just
streaming it to your whether it's a they
have the HP the little stream I think
it's called the super cheap like $200 HP
laptop that we actually like a lot from
being a cheap laptop and and people were
playing you know full PC games on it and
it'll actually look really good no I
know there was another thing Laurie I
think wrote about it was I hate cold was
it shadow or something like that oh was
it all the different cultures and stuff
no no it was it was another cloud
computing thing where you could you
basically rent a gaming system in the
cloud that's definitely a future we
tried streaming there was a couple of
companies that did that they all went
out of business but that was years ago
now you may not have to buy a gaming
laptop you can just get one of these
supercool things like the world's
thinnest a swift 7 and and just get a
subscription to a cloud gaming service
and play games on it that way I guess
that's the that's our collection of cool
laptops here for CES 2018 we survived
the blackout we survived the rain and we
managed to get all these cool systems
here to show everybody and talk about so
uh Thank You Xiomara Thank You Josh
thank you and I that we'll be back here
and 365 days doing it again next year
there you have it best laptops of 2018</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
