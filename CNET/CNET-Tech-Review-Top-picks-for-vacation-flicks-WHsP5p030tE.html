battle of the mini camcorders and a
brand-new prizefight how to play xbox
games on your imac our coast delivers an
Android tablet and our top five picks
for Father's Day gift it's all coming up
right now
hey everyone I'm Hollywood welcome to
the cnet tech review the show where we
bring you the good the bad and the
bottom line and tech videos from the
week let's kick things off with the good
with Memorial Day behind us it's time to
start getting ready for your summer
vacation and of course your vacation
videos if you're in the market for a new
mini camcorder to take on your trip let
brian Tong help you pick the right one
in this week's prize fight what's up
prized by fans i'm brian Tong and video
cameras come in all shapes and sizes so
we're facing up to that fit in your
pocket it's a throwdown showdown between
the second generation flip minohd HD and
kodak zi8 we're bringing in see that's
finest from the NYC to judge this battle
executive editor David Carr noite senior
editor Joshua Goldman and yours truly
will do the honors that will take all
three judges scores and average them out
to the nearest tenth each round the
final prize fight score will be an
average of all rounds using the same
decimal system let's get physical first
round of sexiness the flip mino HD is
the most compact camcorder to date and
we like it's classy metal finish smooth
lines and it's almost buttonless design
this guy screams sexy now the kodak zi8
and not so much it's not ugly but it's
bulkier and not his pocket friendly I
like its large 2.5 inch LCD the dark
color design is nice but there's plenty
of room to improve its form factor the
middle HD takes this round with the 4.3
and the zi8 gets a 3.3 next round is
audio and video quality audio quality is
going to be about the same and codec
gives you the option to connect an
external mic but there were differences
in the video quality both camera shoots
720p video but kodak kicks it up a notch
with 1080p and 720p shooting at 60
frames per second for ultra smooth video
flip has been the benchmark for video
quality and we found that it had
slightly warmer and fuller colors and it
also performed better adjusting to
different light conditions both can
were shining this round but codec just
gets the edge with the 4.3 and foot
video gets a 4 so after averaging two
rounds the minnow HD leaves by four
tenths of a point there's play more
battle to go next round is featured
flips line of cameras are really known
for their simplicity and not further
features the minnow HD has built-in
memory you won't need a cable to charge
it since it charges through USB and all
you really need is just the camera but
geeks like me might want a little more
if you want a little extra something
kodak zi8 brings unique features like an
expandable memory slot for the storage
size of your choice a macro mode to
switch focus on really close objects and
the ability to connect an external mic +
HDMI and composite video outputs the zi8
hits hard with the 4.7 and the middle HD
gets a three-round for software both
cameras come with built-in software to
share your videos but not all things are
created equal flip brings its flipshare
app that is compatible with both PCs and
Macs it boasts a cleaner interface and
more publishing features like trading
video greeting cards your own private
flip channel and online publishing to
Facebook YouTube and others i also found
editing clips to be a lot easier with
flipshare codex media impression
software is only pc compatible but you
can easily drag and drop files onto the
mac to edit them in a different program
it has basic editing and a moviemaker
feature plus publishing options from the
expected online services flip takes the
cake here with the perfect 5 and Kodak
gets up for so after averaging four
rounds we are tied at 4.1 points a piece
the final round its size and all is
value
the flip mino HD is a great pocket
camcorder but for two hundred and twenty
nine dollars retail price you would
think they could at least throw in an
hdmi cable well you won't get one here
and you feel like you might not be
getting a bang for every buck the kodak
zi8 starts at $179 retail price and
you're getting everything you can think
of in this package with all of its
shooting modes an expandable memory slot
for up to 32 gigs plus an HDMI and
composite video cable included codex
shines in the final round and gets a 4.7
and flip gets a 4 so after averaging
five rounds out and going into the final
round type the kodak zi8 pulled out of
this neck-and-neck battle 4.2 to 4.1 and
is your prize 5 winner both of these are
great pocket camcorders and with a
prizefight this close the real winner is
you I'm Brian Tom thanks to watch it
will catch you guys next time for
another prize five
thanks Brian I do feel like a winner so
those two cameras are both excellent
choices but if you're looking for
something a little more rugged for your
summer adventures take a look at kodak
playsport here's price by Judge Joshua
Goldman with a first look hi I'm Josh
Goldman senior editor for see no reviews
and this is a look at the kodak
playsport mini camcorder the place board
also known as the zx3 captures video of
resolutions up to 1080p at 30 frames per
second can do it underwater to depths of
nearly 10 feet it's also dust resistant
and slightly more durable than the
average pocket video camera the play
sport also has an LCD glare shield that
improves viewing of the small two inch
screen in bright outdoor conditions in
order to keep the body compact and limit
opportunities for water damage this
model doesn't have the built-in USB
connector that's common to this type of
camcorder instead you have to use the
included USB cable next to USB port
there's a mini HDMI port for connecting
to an HDTV and an AV jack cables for
both are included too what's not
included is memory there's only 20 megs
of internal storage so you'll need to
supply an sdhc card to record to the
shooting features might not be as robust
as other models from Kodak but the play
sport does have four capture modes
including 720p at 30 and 60 frames per
second and electronic image
stabilization the integrated sharing
software is simple it works well to the
1080p video quality is generally
excellent with great color and sharpness
for its class however if you're doing a
lot of panning or you're shooting
fast-moving subjects you want to switch
to the 60 frame per second 720p setting
to avoid a lot of judder in your clips
the results are softer than 1080p but
much smoother pocket video cameras can't
compete with a full-fledged HD camcorder
but for its price and size this is a
fine choice I'm Josh Goldman that's the
kodak playsport see i just bought a
kiddie pool last week so the place for
it would actually be perfect for my
house because let me tell you if you've
got a camera around a kid in a pool it's
going to get wet turning our attention
to Apple I no big surprise the apple
worldwide developers conference is just
around the corner and the Apple rumor
mill is running full steam ahead now
remember this is the event where we
usually hear about new iPhones and other
updates but in this episode of apple
byte brian Tong seems to have other
things on his mind so Brian what you got
going here oh hey what's going on check
this out so I have these magnets and
they're like apps so I'm arranging the
apps the way I'd want them to be cool
man don't you have work to do no I'm on
my lunch break now if I move the app
store down here I have an entire line of
them so I'll tell you what why don't you
keep working on this okay I'll be over
here talking to some girls right good
job girls
what's up Brian song here and welcome to
the apple pie for all the good and bad
inside the world of Apple now I can
promise you I will not be making out
with any Apple products this week so
let's get to the show Apple is
officially no longer the underdog
earlier this week Apple past microsoft
in market capitalization for the first
time in their storied history it's been
going back and forth now but at the time
of the show apple's market cap is around
two hundred and twenty six billion
dollars just edgy Microsoft and it also
makes them the second largest US company
by market cap behind exxon mobil's 282
billion dollar value the big a now is
really the big a and unfortunately
they've been acting like it a lot more
and more now an iPhone news according to
the boy genius report AT&amp;amp;T has confirmed
to its employees that the next-gen
iphone will be available to purchase in
June and they emphasize it will not be
late June so start saving if you haven't
already because any US customers even
thinking of killing their AT&amp;amp;T contract
for their 3gs might want to think again
after ATT recently upped their early
termination fee from $175 to 325 dollars
that hurts daddy now in a recent digit
times article it claims Apple has been
working on multiple versions of the next
iPhone the leaked iphone we all know
about was known as the n90 but according
to them Apple has been working on
another product code named n91 the more
closely resembles the iphone 3gs in case
there were any issues or delays with the
new casing display resolution digital
camera and other modifications and in
another downer for verizon iphone
hopefuls because we keep piling them on
digit times claims pegatron will build
the cdma-based iphone but it will not
enter mass production until at least the
second half of this year if not 2011
2011 add some more you're talking about
2012 in yeah it just keeps getting worse
for you guys all right let's take a look
at the app of the week
now the app of the week is the wired
magazine app for the iPad I've been
hyping this thing up and showing you
snippets but this lives up to the hype
it was delayed and rebuilt in
objective-c after apple banned any flash
based apps or software converters but
the partnership between wired an adobe
has given us the best digital magazine
we've ever seen now there are fully
interactive animations there's also
panels that you can change depending on
what you select and there's multimedia
clips integrated into the experience now
the best part about this magazine app is
that the text is always readable and the
page layout rearranges itself if you're
reading in portrait or landscape mode
many other magazines on the iPad our PDF
based and that page format is natively
different from an iPad so you'll have to
press an option to read the text
separately which takes away from
enjoying the article but not on this one
the wired magazine is truly made for the
iPads dimensions it's 499 per issue and
I'll be the first submit that's really
pricey but wired says they will offer a
subscription option in the fall and this
is really an achievement for digital
magazines and as you can tell I like it
a lot alright moving on to some quick
bites Apple's back to school deal has
returned so if you're looking to get a
macbook macbook pro or an imac you can
get up to two hundred dollars off the
computer and an eight gig ipod touch for
free when you buy them together and it's
perfect timing with the latest upgrades
to the laptop line now we compared
VMware and parallels in a past episode
for running windows on your mac and the
big knock on VMware was it sluggishness
but they've released an update which
claims to give you thirty five percent
faster app performance and 3d graphics
with five times the speed and also if
you were curious about those magnets we
showed off in the beginning of the show
they're called the app magnets and you
can get them from jailbreak collective
calm it's a set of 18 for 1299 and each
of these epoxy tiles are reminders of
the icons on your phone and guess what I
have one set to give away so all you
guys have to do is send me an email to
the apple bite at cnet com tell me your
favorite ice cream and I'll pick a
winner
and I'm sure there are people trying to
find a way to still carry their iPads
around with them well it looks like I
clothing has a solution for you with the
IT and I dress now these high-end models
showcase how this will change your life
but in the fashion world they just call
that a very large pocket in the wrong
place and I couldn't even find a bad
apple that looked worse than that shirt
to throw out here alright that's going
to do for this week's show i'm brian
Tong thanks for watching and we'll see
you guys next week for another bite of
the Apple so I'm going to take this one
I'm gonna move it what are you gonna do
with this one that one's do you want to
know I'm gonna take this one slide
ladies love bead Tong I think it's his
animal magnetism or it could be the
slide and if you can't get enough of our
Apple coverage be sure to check out our
WWDC preview playing right now at cnet
TV and of course come back on Monday
June seventh when we'll be bringing you
all the big announcements from the show
now while you jot that down in your
calendars let's take a break but stick
around we'll keep a rolling with the
good stuff in just a minute
welcome back guys I'm Molly wood and
this is the cnet tech review and some
weeks there's just more good than bad so
let's keep the happy train rolling now
one thing people like about Apple's
products is that they tend to work
pretty great right out of the box but
that doesn't mean there isn't room for
improvement especially by adding
accessories here are Nicole lien rich
brown with a couple of nifty add-ons for
your iphone and iMac and nicole lee
associate editor for cnet.com and this
is a first look at the sound I d510
bluetooth headset as you can see here it
is a very simple-looking bluetooth
headset a very slim and stylish of all
blackberry minimalist appeal on the
frontier is a multifunction button right
here above it is a small little LED
indicator you don't get a physical
volume rocker with the headset but you
do get a touch sensor volume control you
can adjust the volume by starting your
finger up and down the front of the
headset on the side here is the power
toggle on the backyard is the earpiece
with some ideas real comfort ear loop
the Sun I d510 comes with an array of
different earloop sizes for a more
customized fit the ear you can also be
adjusted to fit either the left or right
ear one of the most interesting things
about the sound I d510 is that it is the
first bluetooth headset with its own
iphone app the iphone app is called
airprint and is available free for
download from the itunes app store we
have the ear print iphone app you can
adjust a variety of things on your sound
I d510 headset you can adjust the
personal sound level because you can
adjust the incoming audio quality you
can also find out how loud the
surrounding noises you can also adjust
the noise reduction demo to just find
out how much noise you're cancelling
there's also an environmental salmo that
amplifies the sound around you when the
headset is not in use this is our very
handy find my headset locator function
in the app so that if you lose your
headset somewhere in the house for
example you can just press this button
and then your headset will continue
beeping to let you know whether hip it
is you can also find out the battery
status of your headset with this app
this sound I d510 is around one hundred
and thirty dollars I'm Nicole Lee and
this has been the first look at the
sound I d510 bluetooth headset hi I'm
rich brown senior editor for cnet com
today we're going to take a look at the
connects XD so in the back of the imac
you'll find a mini displayport adapter
you can use that to output video from
the imac to another display but unique
to the 27-inch model is it's also an
input now out of the box you can connect
say macbook pro to the imac with a
standard mini displayport cable going
both directions the problem though is
that it doesn't have the ability to
convert an HDMI signal technically you
can do that though because it's a
digital port and that's where the
connects XD comes in so this is pretty
straightforward little device costs
about one hundred fifty dollars so yeah
kind of to be serious about turning your
imac into a kind of a home entertainment
hub but it's got an HDMI port here mini
DisplayPort Jack there a little power
cable input there there's no software
that comes with it there's just a little
basic order of operations you need to
follow in order to make sure the signal
goes through and it's really pretty
straightforward and we've had success
with the playstation 3 xbox 360 you just
see here we'll show you in a minute
we've tried blu-ray players as well as
cable boxes and HD camcorders the only
problem we have is with a with an hdmi
switch we tried a couple devices and the
cable box couldn't reconcile the signal
through the switch through the adapter
into the imac we think there's probably
a signal authentication issue the other
limitation has to do with the imax
display it's only encoded to support
certain resolutions coming into the
system solu 2560 x 1440 which is its
native display which you'll see right
here and then it goes down to 720p and
480p so that means a couple things first
it means you need to set your video
source to input the 720p so that means
you may need to connect say your game
console to another display first in
order to drop the resolution setting
down so that I might actually display
when you connect it from the standpoint
of display quality it's actually not
that big a deal games and TV signal for
example both look great and they don't
really that look that much different
than what you'd see in full 1080p I one
complaint is actually with the blu-ray
quality it's a little bit muddy than
definitely not as clear as a 1080p
signaling you might be used
as we said getting the connects XD
started is pretty simple you plug in the
hdmi port then you go to the power then
finally you bring the mini DisplayPort
jack from the device into the imac as
you can see the signal switch is over
automatically and we've got our xbox
screen up here and it plays games just
fine there's no actual crosstalk between
the imac and xbox so you can't say
record gameplay and that's probably a
good idea as far as copy-protection goes
there are a few commands you can do
though with Mac keyboard you can do
volume as well as screen brightness
still and you can hit command f2 to
switch between the different signals the
connects XD is not the only device that
will go from mini displayport to hdmi
into the imac there are a couple others
out of the market we know of a few
forthcoming as well but this is one of
the first and its price is roughly the
same as the others goes for about 150
bucks sorry much brown this is the
connects XD there's something about
playing my xbox on my imac that just
seems wrong and i like it although why
couldn't apple just add an hdmi port why
and with that enough mrs. nice gal let's
move on to what's bad this week
now with the rise of netbooks tablets
smartphones stand alone mp3 and video
players are becoming a thing of the past
so what does media player maker archos
do come out with a tablet of their own
and Donald Bell gives it a first look
hey I'm Donald bow for cnet.com and
today we're taking a first look at the
Arco seven home tablet as the name
implies this is a tablet computer with a
7-inch screen it runs Android OS 1.5 and
comes with 8 gigabytes of internal
memory and costs a shockingly low 199
dollars now arcos had to make some
concessions to get the price down the
resistive touchscreen is sluggish lacks
multi-touch and has a bad viewing angle
when you tilt it down the internal
memory is meagre there's no bluetooth or
GPS no camera or compass and unlike
previous arcos tablets there's no dock
connection on the bottom for video
output or DVR accessories instead you
get a micro USB port for data transfer a
power and hold switch up at the top a
microSD card slot headphone output and
the socket for the included power
adapter at full charge you can expect
around 44 hours of music playback or
seven hours of video there's also a pair
of internal speakers on the front and a
plastic kickstand on the back the OS is
completely Android including the media
players you can surf the web check your
email or even read a book there's also
an integrated app store put together by
our coast where you can download
compatible apps it's unfortunate that
not all apps for Android are compatible
with the archos seven due to the
limitations of the hardware but there
are still plenty of apps to play around
with gripes aside if you're looking for
an Android alternative to the ipad or
ipod touch the archos seven gets you
there on a 7-inch screen for only one
hundred ninety nine dollars the
experience isn't dazzling but the price
is right so there you go that's the
archos seven home tablet for cnet com
I'm Donald up
oh poor our coasts I'm not sure if this
is just a glorified PvP or a puny tablet
wanna be but either way I'm gonna have
to pass and now the moment you've been
