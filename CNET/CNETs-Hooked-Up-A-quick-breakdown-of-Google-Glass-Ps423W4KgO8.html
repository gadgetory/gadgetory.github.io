and in my hands yep i have google glass
this really has the whole tech world
buzzing we wanted to really break down
what this is now the first thing is not
everyone can get a pair of these you had
to be part of Google's Explorer program
and they cost fifteen hundred dollars
they don't come cheap but what this is
really for is for developers you know
people that are trying to come up with
new apps and ways to use the actual
google glass and what you see here is
this is a frame here it's not actually a
pair of glasses it's a thin titanium and
sturdy frame and what it does it has
this piece of glass right here this is
where an image is projected or kind of
the heads up display for what you have
here so let me show you how these work
I'm going to put these glasses on in keV
I make these little good check it out
all right but the first thing you have
to do is first of all you can either tap
the side or do a little head Bob and it
activates the screen you can see it turn
on and I'm going to start by saying ok
glass okay let's give this a shot ok
glass I have a variety of options and
here i'm going to say record a video and
you'll see my screen change and now you
guys can see what i see i have Michael
and Jay here hey boys say what's up wave
hi there you go right now you can also
do a lot of other things with this you
can use them for map directions you can
actually Google items names people are
places and it does require a data
connection so that means you're gonna
have to have a phone tethered to this
over Bluetooth or even over Wi-Fi so my
first impressions of glass I mean these
things are amazing this is really the
future and we've never seen anything
like this but wearing them is a little
socially awkward yo Jay what's up bro
you're gonna kick it later tonight man
Jay but really this is the future and
you know it can only get better for
