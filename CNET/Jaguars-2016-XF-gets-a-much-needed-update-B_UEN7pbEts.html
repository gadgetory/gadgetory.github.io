feel a bit long in the tooth Jaguar hits
us with a new one this is the 2016
Jaguar XF on the floor at the 2015 new
york auto show now the new XF pretty
much looks like the old model the design
hasn't changed that much but it's a
little bit longer the overhangs are
shorter and everything's a bit tighter
under the hood the excess pretty much
only gets one engine option in the
United States a 3 liter supercharged v6
available in either 340 horsepower or
380 the only difference is the tune it's
going to be made it with an 8-speed
automatic transmission now one of the
places the XF needed the most help was
in the tech department and this one's
going to get a huge update their offer
standard with an 8-inch infotainment
display this one actually has an upgrade
you get to a big ten point four inch
Jaguar in touch pro system that's going
to get a huge overhaul in performance
and interface and looks like it's got to
fix a lot of the issues we had with the
previous model as for our safety tech
we've got a whole overhaul there with a
bunch of new features including a new
head up display the 2016 Jaguar XF hits
dealerships sometime later this year
we'll have more detail about pricing and
such as we get closer to that date I'm
antuan goodwin on the floor at the 2015
new york auto show taking a look at the
2016 Jaguar XF
