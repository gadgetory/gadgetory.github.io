draining problem I'm Bridget Carey this
is your scene at update if you think
your iPhone battery is dying too fast
Facebook could be the reason the social
network is acknowledging that it's
iPhone app is causing battery drain
issues a number of Facebook users have
spoken out about the app draining
battery by running in the background
when it shouldn't the new iOS 9 software
shows you how much battery life apps are
using and you can see how much Facebook
is eating up when use on the screen and
in the background but it shouldn't be
using juice in the background if you
have background app refresh turned off
but it is Facebook has released a
statement that it's looking into this
and hoping to have a fix in place soon
and in other software Behaving Badly
news if you have Windows 7 or 8 it's
very easy to install windows 10 even if
you didn't want to and Microsoft is
calling this an accident
the omission comes from a report from
ARS technica the update to Windows 10 is
listed as an optional upgrade but it's
selected with a checkmark by default so
if you're not paying attention and you
click OK to update too fast it could
start the upgrade it's not supposed to
be checked off and Microsoft said it's
changing that but it's hard to stay mad
at Microsoft when you hear about how
much easier they just made video calls
Skype now lets you send a video chat
invite to anyone with just a link and
they can jump into your call without
needing to create a Skype account or
download the software on skype you just
click the plus new to get a hyperlink to
the chat to send to someone you can
paste it wherever in an email on
facebook on Twitter whatsapp that person
joins as a guest from their computer
using Skype for web and it works for the
US and UK and there's more changes
coming to our communication later this
year you won't need to have your phone
with you to receive phone calls if
someone calls or text your primary phone
number you can get the message on your
tablet or your smart watch even if your
phone is disconnected from the network
one phone number can be tied across
multiple devices ATT Sprint and t-mobile
announced this technology is coming soon
18t calls it numbers sync this means if
you go for a run with a SmartWatch you
won't need your phone with you to get
messages
and you can make calls from your watch
with that phone number but here's the
twist to it all that tablet or smart
watch needs to have its own 3G or 4G
cellular connection most smartwatches do
not but some are starting to like the
latest LG watch urbane right now those
devices are assigned a separate phone
number but you don't want a separate
phone number for a watch AT&amp;amp;T has said
numbersync capable devices are coming
later this year but no word if this is
going to be an extra cost to your bill
t-mobile and Sprint did not say when its
customers are gonna get this technology
that's it for this tech news update and
there's more as cnet.com from our
studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
