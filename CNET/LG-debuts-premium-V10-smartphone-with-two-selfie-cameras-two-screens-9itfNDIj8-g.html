with the company's newest smartphone the
LG v10 this is a premium smartphone with
a metal sides and textured back what's
unique about this phone is there's dual
selfie cameras there's a wide-angle lens
for group shots and a normal lens for a
traditional selfie next to that there's
also a second screen when the main
screen is turned on the second screen
will show your most recent apps so it
allows you to quickly jump in between
two different apps when you're in an app
like the camera for example you'll have
access to additional settings on the
second screen other than that this is
very similar to the LG g4 it's got a
bigger display it's 5.7 inches which is
quad HD on the back it also has a
fingerprint scanner built into the home
button
it's powered by a hexa core Qualcomm
Snapdragon 808 processor has four
gigabytes of RAM and only comes in 64
gigabytes of storage which is nice
because lots of phones out there like
the iPhone only has 16 gigabytes of
storage as a base model on the back is a
16 megapixel rear camera which allows
you to customize things like ISO
exposure it also lets you do that while
in video mode which is really a nice
touch it runs android 5.1.1 lollipop so
it's not the latest marshmallow build
but it's going to be updated within the
next few months or early next year
there's a microSD card slot for
expandable storage pricing isn't set but
we'll see the LG v10 sometime in
November until then I'm Dan grazhina and
that was a first look at LG's newest
premium smartphone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
