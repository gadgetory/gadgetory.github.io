first dual core after Tegra 3 the
world's first quad core and then we
double the performance of that with
Tegra 4 what's next for us well we
decided to do was we do it's decided to
make Tegra k1 the world's first 192 core
processor 192 CUDA cores all
programmable by the computer by the m5
programs all fully programmable all
massively parallel and this is the first
GPU the reason why we decided to call it
Tegra k1 is because this is the first
GPU that took a vast jump from the
previous generation
it's almost inappropriate call a Tegra 5
because it's simply not linear we
decided to call a Tegra k1 we decided to
call it Tegra k1 because it's based on
the Kepler architecture as many of you
know Kepler is the most successful GPU
architecture that we have ever created
and it's the most important GPU
architecture the industry had ever known
from a hundred and ninety two cores all
the way to thirty six million cores
running our nation's fastest
supercomputer let me explain some of the
technology behind it
so first of all in order to capture the
human face our skin is a living thing
light penetrates through our outer
layers goes into the skin bounces around
inside and then scatters and it comes
out picking up some of the tone of the
color of your blood and as a result when
you look at them it looks alive of
course there's a lot of pores your eyes
are the windows to the soul and so
obviously the eyes have to look alive in
this particular case we use a technology
called ray tracing the Ray trace the
eyes that's why the eye crystal looks
like it's
like it's alive and of course all of the
shadows are being rendered so
beautifully you see no triangles no
faceting whatsoever triangles have
disappeared the lighting system is so
sophisticated we can pick up the little
sheen of the oil of his face this is
what this is what a state-of-the-art
mobile application mobile game looks
today in fact this is an applic business
a game that's featured on Tegra 4 and
saw Integra Zone it's a fantastic game
and they're doing incredibly well
however this is what last generation
graphics looks like let's show them what
next-generation graphics look like
now let's just kind of take this in a
little bit this particular image notice
the trash can you see no triangles
whatsoever all the faceting is gone the
detail is so exquisite that when the
light shines on it it looks perfectly
smooth all the shadows are soft it seems
like light is coming from all over it's
being lit the scene is being lit in
darkness there isn't one particular
light that's showing up somewhere but
light is bouncing all over the walls
using this technology called global
illumination where everything in the
scene is a light source so this is by a
company called frozen byte it's a it's a
custom game they've made this is a first
for mobile it's a really fun game it's
kind of like a platformer of two and a
half D but the cool thing is you have
three characters so you can have your
warrior guy you can switch to have a
wizard and he can now remember this is a
mobile device that's been blown up to
this to the size of a theater okay so
this is a mobile device that's been
blowing through the size of a theater
look at the exquisite detail and so
they've used Nvidia physics actually in
this so you interact and a lot of the
puzzles are based on physics and you
have to sort of figure out different
ways and we'll see that just up here so
if everyone inside now past the the
beautiful sort of Egyptian statues so
here we have a puzzle this one's fairly
straightforward and I have played it a
couple times so you can choose which
character you want so I can try and
reflect this beam and you know it the
way the lighting follows the beam around
this oh yeah oh that's hot yeah so I
think I'm actually gonna use the wizard
here and I'm gonna grab this this box
and hit the special key and I should
open the door
we go now while you do while he's doing
that look at the how the lighting is
changing the environment everything's
all lit so beautifully it's all dynamic
like it's a beautiful game the artwork
and this is this have you compared Tegra
k1 to a couple of other well-known
platforms in the world one of them is
the PlayStation 3 and one of them is the
Xbox 360 both of them are last
generation graphics capabilities called
ex9 Tegra k1 is based on dx11 but if you
look at the horsepower just a raw
horsepower alone the GPU has more
horsepower than both Xbox 360 and
PlayStation 3 and the CPU is far in a
way more powerful than both the Xbox 360
and the PlayStation 3 and all of that is
made possible because mobile technology
now available in just a few watts and so
what you're going to have is essentially
the visual richness of next generation
capability but the horsepower of a game
console right in your palms really
really amazing so I'm super excited to
introduce check we're k12 you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
