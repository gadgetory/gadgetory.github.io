the Cuisinart PowerEdge 1,000 watt
blenders now this is the most expensive
and powerful blender that Cuisinart
offers and the reason for that is right
in the name the 1000 watts that it
offers is more than any other blender
they've got it's a very nice number can
give you a lot of powerful results in
addition to the high wattage you're
getting this nice sturdy diecast metal
base you're getting the preset buttons
here you're getting this backlit LCD
screen that counts up as you blend I
like that feature quite a bit and
overall it's a fine blender it does the
job it blends and that's great however
this is not the only blender that we
tested and sad to say it's not the best
blender that we tested we tested the
Breville hemisphere control blender
which is also $199
along with the ninja Ultima which is
also $199 same price point on all three
of those this one was the least
satisfying in terms of the results let's
take a look at this almond butter test
that we did we filled each blender with
almonds and then we grounded up into
flour and almost all the blenders could
handle this first step to get flour
accept the fuser knife you see a lot of
chunky almonds a lot of whole almonds
you got almonds caught in the corners
here it just didn't blend as well as
we'd like and even after we mixed it up
and shook things up we couldn't get that
fine consistency that we wanted from
almond flour the next step grinding the
flour into almond butter the Cuisinart
couldn't handle at all we couldn't get
it to release the oils and make that
nice buttery smooth texture the ninja
could the high-end Blendtec and Vitamix
models could that the Cuisinart could
not so those thousand watts didn't do
the job and it came to butter one point
of note the $40 hamilton beach smoothie
smart blender outperformed the Cuisinart
despite being a fifth of the cost when
it came to the nut butter it didn't make
the nut butter but it didn't make almond
flour that was very satisfying and
smooth and consistency
way better than the Cuisinart to be
honest that said you'll still be able to
make a lot of great things with this
blender we made pesto we made whipped
cream we made all sorts of things in our
tests and it was able to do the job it
makes good smoothies too so all the
staples of blending you'll be able to
accomplish with this blender however
because it didn't perform quite as well
as you would have liked and there are
other models at the same price that did
markedly better I say
check those out instead and if you want
a Cuisinart blender maybe don't spring
for this one and go from one of the less
expensive models for seeing that I'm
right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
