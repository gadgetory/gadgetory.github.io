doesn't take up a whole city block by
itself you have two options Marantz and
Marantz the companies in our receivers
are a little over three inches tall get
a packed with features and can still
outperform rivals the NL 1607 it's the
top-of-the-line unit and boasts almost
everything you could want including
Dolby Atmos and DTS X Bluetooth Wi-Fi
streaming with Spotify connect and even
legacy video connections while it does
like the build quality of the more
expensive SI units the ni uses plastic
instead of metal on the front it still
looks every bit a Marantz component if
you have a 4k TV you'll be pleased to
know the NR 1607 boasted generous 8 HDMI
inputs all compatible with hdcp 2.2 and
high dynamic range the marantz AVR 2016
remote app is comprehensive and can be
used to control streaming sources as
well but the regular one is also
friendly and easy to use
we appreciate the receiver comes with a
full-color on-screen menu as well
performance is what you'd expect from a
Marantz full blooded home theater sound
and excellent music playback the added
height dimension also helps immerse you
in Dolby Atmos titles the only drawbacks
are that it won't rock a house party
both because it only has 50 watts per
channel and because it lacks the multi
room music capabilities of its rivals
but if you're looking for a discreet
receiver and have a budget of $700
Marantz is an elegant performer that
should suit most living rooms</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
