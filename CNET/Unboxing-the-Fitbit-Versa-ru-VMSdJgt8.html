that goes right up against the Apple
watch and other fitness trackers that
are out there and I've got one right
here this is like a promotional package
is that the actual box let's open it up
and see what's inside all right well
here's the retail packaging we've got
Fitbit Versa in black this does not have
contactless payments for that you have
to give a special edition that's a
little bit more and has a woven band and
this band in the box so this is the
standard package and we also have some
accessories we've got a Fitbit Versa
leather band in brown and we've got a
metal mesh strap in black this is kind
of like the milanese band for Apple
watch that's adjustable and we've got a
lot of confetti so let's open up the
Fitbit I'm terrible at opening up why
did I not bring it to lay there we go
pull that open and slide it kind of
similar packaging to other fit bits and
that's slide open box open up a little
magnetic door and here is the watch all
set up in its own little little plastic
ring so pull it out delicately remove
the plastic covering here it's really
compact it's it's a nice small
SmartWatch for comparison I've got a 42
millimeter Apple watch here kind of hold
them side-by-side
now again you might get a 38 millimeter
to compare against this for the best
comparison but the verse is definitely
smaller it's definitely thinner it's a
less bulky profile of course you have to
do a whole set up process if I press
this button here let's see what happens
nothing happens nothing at all we have
to charge it okay let's open up this box
and see what else is in there sometimes
Watchers are already have a little bit
of a battery charge when you take them
out not the fit fit so in here
instructions there is another band so in
case
you're a different wrist size and it's
adjustable anyhow it's a standard watch
band even has a little will catch there
so you can attach it and here's the
charger let's see what type of charger
because fitbit's have many different
chargers so I'm actually curious I did
not so say I didn't see this before
my first time seeing it it's a
completely different charger interesting
it's a last Fitbit the ioniq had a long
charger that you kind of magnetically
stuck on the end it was small but it
could fall off easily there's a cradle
which I like but it's a little bit
bigger to carry with you but it should
be a lot easier to charge you you
actually press that it's my first time
using this and it's kind of like an
alligator clip that's pretty interesting
so you do that and it expands then you
drop it in then I've never seen this
before this like a completely different
charging design and then it holds it
that's pretty smart because then the
watch will not come out at all of the
charger so that's the that's the charger
what else is in here safety instructions
limited warranty wait is there something
in here they used to have a little PC
dongle that came with fitbit's but I
don't see that in here so maybe it just
pairs via bluetooth and does it that way
basic instructions to get you on your
feet fast and that is the Fitbit Versa
pretty simple and let's take a look at
the accessories so let's start with the
metal mesh band I'm gonna put all this
stuff aside here the basic box stuff I'm
such a messy on box here beside okay
good
put that over there Fitbit verse a metal
mesh band I believe this one is about a
hundred dollars generally the bands that
cost a little bit less than the Apple
watch something significantly less than
the Apple watch accessories they're
about thirty to a hundred dollars for
these so it's not terrible and open up
this does not slide open this
Scot figures out watchband boxes is like
a puzzle box okay okay that's not as
elegant to open okay so here it is
encased inside it's a lot of packaging
for a band if I may if I may say so why
is there a whole rest of the box just
for that just for that band it might
seem a little bit violent pull it out
like that okay there we go that is the
band and it is not magnetic I don't
think I think it's a oh there we go
where you pop it open and adjust it so I
don't know how to let me see how I undo
that again
just do that okay something like that so
that's the metal mesh band and again if
you want to attach it it's not not too
bad I'm gonna tape this off
and it's kind of like a standard more
standard watchstrap
so it doesn't look quite as proprietary
pop that off pop this on line up the
pins I found this a little hard at the
at the Fitbit event too so it takes a
little bit of pushing yeah there it goes
I kind of have to push in a little bit
more than some of the others it's like
the as you can see this band does not
open up all the way flat so it kind of
sticks in a certain place so that means
in order to get the band to go in there
you have to push it in a little bit so
if you get one of these know that and
the same thing here I'm finding you have
to just be a little bit patient it's a
very long release pin on the on the band
this is the I need glasses look looking
over my tops of my glasses and there we
go okay whoo looks nice though I like
the look of that so I'm gonna try it on
with the with this mesh strap it's not
no that's not bad so you click it into
place so it's not quite as seamless as
like the magnetic melon a strap on Apple
watch but it's fine it looks nice it's a
nice yeah I like that design a lot so
the leather bands are pretty nicely
constructed is this one whore we in
leather I believe it is yes it is whore
ween leather so if you're a leather
aficionado that means something it's
it's a it's nice quality so and it looks
like a nice kind of classic watch strap
it has a has a nice knit on it over by
the buckle and it should I imagine this
is gonna age really well and have like a
nice nice look to it if you wear it for
a while so here is the leather and
come out this is probably my favorite
band to wear except for the fact that if
you wear leather bands you can't go in
the shower swim with it and I love the
fact that the Fitbit Versa is 50 meter
water-resistant so I probably wouldn't
wear a leather band very much or even
maybe get one but I love the look of it
let's pop that in see if I get used to
this now strap strap attachments with
your host Scott Stein I don't know I'm
just coming up with excuses here but
it's a hard ban to attach my can't I
can't do it
TBD on that leather band that that one
is a little bit difficult so maybe keep
that in mind but that's the Fitbit Versa
unboxed and this is gonna be available
soon and it we're gonna be doing a lot
of testing with this will wear it around
will turn it on will charge it I'm Scott
Stein thanks for bearing with me as i
unbox the Fitbit versa</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
