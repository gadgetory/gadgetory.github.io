right in um here a few that I downloaded
recently we've got I just show this one
a moment ago but I'll show it again
samples from the show night writer they
I've had to recreate them yeah it's a
guy who did something with them so
here's purposes you're spending go
Fandango actually pushes movie tickets
to the watch which is a cool idea right
now I don't have it set up so I just
have an image from office space and a
quote but you can't there are no like
menus or anything right now but you
could if I wanted that eventually is how
would I do that I think you're buying
from your phone and then it sends the
ticket to your watch so you can't do it
from the watch I know I haven't set it
up yet so that was a bad demo um let's
take a look at Amazon
Amazon's is pretty neat it uses the
dictation diapers I got some other extra
thing with diapers sorry yeah type
tattooin diapers now Xbox one
so oh there we go there we go
get Xbox one Assassin's Creed unity buy
before and now oh it's always asking
doesn't speak Spanish I could buy it now
with one click I can be very very
careful I'm just gonna add it to my
wishlist not hit don't leave but though
no no no no nah I don't wait how do I
cancel that um
no right um now I've canceled at a
moment by the Xbox
anyway you got idea how that worked um
oh my god wait why did you buy an xbox
seamless just allows you to reorder
things I don't have this tied to my
account yet but if I did I could reorder
as easily as I just work an Xbox one I
just ordered Xbox one okay I'll see you

Xbox one order okay hi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
