color-changing smart bulb it's also the
newest big name connected LED on the
market like the lifx bulbs that came
before it each wife x+ bulb has a
built-in Wi-Fi radio you'll connect it
directly to your home network without
needing to plug in a hub or a bridge to
your router from there you'll be able to
control the bulbs and change their color
from your phone from anywhere with an
internet connection it's more or less
the same smart bulb that lifx is put out
before but now there's a new night
vision feature each wife x plus bulb
packs a dedicated set of infrared diodes
when you turn the bulb off in the app
those diodes come on and put out
infrared light you can't see that light
but your night vision cameras can the
idea is that life x plus will help those
night-vision cameras see in the dark and
when I tested it out at the sea net
smart apartment it worked really well in
this shot you can see that the life x
plus is basically lighting up that back
wall and extending the range of our
night-vision camera so one problem with
that feature is that it makes this bulb
less efficient than the life x bulbs
that came before it
like those bulbs it's an 11 watt LED
that puts out about as much brightness
as a 75 watt incandescent which is
really good
but those infrared diodes are drawing
power even when the bulb is off in the
app that'll add at least a couple of
dollars to your yearly energy bill life
x plus bulbs cost 80 bucks a pop which
is $20 more than the standard life fix
bulbs that don't include that night
vision feature if you use night vision
cameras I think they're definitely worth
considering but if not there's really no
reason to spend the extra money the new
third gen bulbs are a little bit
brighter than before but not
dramatically so and you also don't need
to upgrade to get compatibility with
smart things if logitech alexa nest all
the old bulbs can do all of that still
kudos to lifx for coming up with a
clever unique feature and for getting
the patent on that feature that more
than anything might help ensure a bright
future for this bulb if connected
night-vision cameras continue to grow in
popularity</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
