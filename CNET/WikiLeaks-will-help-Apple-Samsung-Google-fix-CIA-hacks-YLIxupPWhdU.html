to big tech companies like Apple Google
and Samsung on march seven the site
released thousands of alleged CIA
documents in an archive called vault 7
that described hacking tools to break
into smart phones TVs and computers two
days later wikiLeaks founder Julian
Assange said he wants to help companies
fix vulnerabilities before WikiLeaks
releases any more details from the
alleged CIA files we have decided to
work with them give them some exclusive
access to the additional technical
details we have so that fixes can be
developed and pushed out so people can
be secured cnet is currently unable to
verify the authenticity of the documents
the CIA did not confirm or deny if the
documents were real but in a statement
said quote it is CIA's job to be
innovative cutting-edge and the first
line of defense in protecting this
country from enemies abroad the American
public should be deeply troubled by any
WikiLeaks disclosure designed to damage
the intelligence community's ability to
protect America end quote Assange said
that it would take a few days to fix
some of the smaller issues but others
that targeted connected devices were
much more complex and for some systems
like Android with many manufacturers
there is no automatic update to the
system so people have to manually try
and pull something in so that means the
only people are people aware of it can
fix the problem both Apple and Google
previously issued statements saying that
they had already fixed many of the
issues outlined in the documents with
the latest ios and android updates
Samsung and Microsoft are looking into
the claims for more on the WikiLeaks
claims as they develop stay tuned to
