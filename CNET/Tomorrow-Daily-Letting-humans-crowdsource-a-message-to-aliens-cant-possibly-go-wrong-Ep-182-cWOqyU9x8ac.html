out fabric from liquid a phone that only
makes phone calls and learn how you can
help send a message out to alien life
yay sera daily
greetings citizens of the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the besties
talk shows the universe I am Ashley
skala genovese always kill anonymous
you're looking so why so blue let's hit
the headlines feels just like I have
enough can I really briefly just let
everybody know that before we start
today's all three of today's stories are
crowdfunding stories so this is almost
like a full episode of back at her
hackett but they were all such cool
stories that we wanted to talk about it
anyway okay go ahead I'll take the
negative angle on that and say that none
of this may happen so true Europe if
you're a pessimist take Kayla's point we
uh to start my story okay we are hopeful
people we believe that there is until
the intelligent life out there somewhere
and we would love to give them a message
about who we are and what we do and we
have done this before by setting out
little you know little probes and
whatnot with the Voyager that we set
back in like the 1970s yeah I saw these
so right now so they had copies of these
gold records 77 yeah and they had the
gold records and has like music and some
some images and like what a human looks
like in very basic basic basic stuff
yeah well we also set one out I would
say back in two thousand six that was of
course the new horizons pro another Pro
called the new horizons well that was
out in 2005 and things have kind of
changed since then so what I'd like to
tell you about this story is this is a
campaign a crowdsource funding campaign
to update that message and let the
people create a message I like to
intelligent life so that's what they're
trying to do is we want to send a brand
new message that we all come up with
together many of us okay so that if
anybody if any intelligent life finds it
regardless of when that might be it
would be from now and not a bunch of
years ago yeah and it's an updated thing
so currently this the new horizon probe
is is nearing Pluto okay why it's really
far yeah it's really far out there but
we want to send some new information but
they we want to kick start this because
not a nasa project yeah so that's NS not
yet it's uh it's on a Fiat physica which
is a crowdfunding site for physics
project so who knew I did not know that
existence basically they want five
hundred thousand dollars to build a
website and develop new techniques to
program a message designed to be
recognized decoded and understood by
beings in the far future so basically to
break this down they want to set we can
send about 150 megabytes of data okay
how much is which which is actually just
as much information as one of the golden
records okay so it's about 100 pictures
and an hour of audio so there you go
through trying to show presentation so
we want to send that out there um yeah
so well it's not an officially NASA
approved okay that's why they need the
money a NASA has been like yeah that
sounds cool guys you know neo um so
courage hopefully we get the money and
enough people show support they'll be
able to do that sort of beam out yeah
that Dad of God that cell phone bill is
gonna be real expensive yeah yeah it's
verizon's like whoo so $500,000 is how
much they want they're currently at
13,000 oh yeah they're not that close
but there's two months left on the
campaign on the website again is Fiat
physica Fiat physica I guess there's a
yes crowdfunding website just for
physics physics I'm gonna start trolling
that site every day for new fun stuff to
give money I thought you weren't going
for the negative no I'm just guy i'm
just gonna start trolling i just gonna
lurk every day just look at all the cool
physics projects that i want to fund so
so uh the project again is called which
i didn't actually mention is one earth
message 11 earth message it's all we all
come together and it's gonna be from
people all around the globe and
different the little trailer shows
people speaking in different languages
you get one hour of audio so i'm sure
with some music that we see this stuff
like that 150 megabytes me know video
memes we're gonna send some memes i hope
we don't send memes just success let's
just let's just send troll face can we
only that success kid like that so wish
that more as a success or a rickroll oh
man could we just rickrolled early or or
let's get even more mini darude
sandstorm perfect we're in anyway um
yeah so there you go it's it that's
that's a really good idea I like instead
of just something that NASA came up with
having us it's not a committee nothing
together as a people but if we're to
have to spend some money to do it yeah a
little bit because I'm sure I'm sure
that website where everyone's gonna
submit their ideas and stuff like
they're gonna have to figure out okay
well what's the majority want to send
and like okay well that's the thing we
have to send like what's important to
the people it's going to take a little
bit so if you can do it if your hand is
hovering over your keyboard to type in
and go check this out yourself again
it's called one earth message and it's
on fiat physica but that brings us to
our drug that's not the day oh yes of
course are another day and that is what
part of human life would you want to
send out into space now we're assuming
that there's no limitations right so
there's don't worry about like a hundred
feet ago yeah don't worry what would you
want to send out one the human human
race out into space sending out and then
somebody imagine 8mon they find it and
they're like welfare and then they look
at it and that's what's the thing you're
sending letters represent humanity what
is for you and it's TD message as the
hashtag that you can use um gosh what
would I send I feel like I would send am
I am I to inspired by the by the end of
madmen and I would send that I'd like to
buy a world of coke ad now I would you
ascend a commercial oh god no I would
send well that's very like indicative of
a lot of the globe uh I'll be right back
after these messages I feel like I would
send I know it's old but I feel like I
would send I feel like had some like et
I'd be like look guys we're like
friendly to alien like I said a movie
were friendly to aliens like I'd sent a
movie where we were friendly to aliens I
would not send Mars Attacks like oh not
send war of the worlds like don't send
those like that's because you're telling
them to come conquer us and murder us
all like sort of a thing words like
we're cool with aliens guys it's all
good yeah that's what I would send okay
um I'm gonna my answer is I would this
is so weird I want to send Elon Musk and
just send like him out if he could just
like live forever just like some sort of
an a hologram yeah or just just so they
can see like someone that's hopeful
someone who has lots of ideas who
understand
it's what's going on I has dreams in the
future understands the fears that the
desires that has hope it and has ID it
like again has ideas to show wonderful
welcome yo what well that's and that was
going to be my second thing is if I
can't send a human I would just send all
of the like the tapes of Walt Disney
talking about like how he experiences
nature how he experiences like it
technics of space and where he wants him
unfortunately that's dated its data but
it's still I think that I think the core
concept is there so I think it works
because I mean even if it's dated the
thing is is by the time they get to us
we're gonna be date we're probably dead
so it's like we're gonna be dated anyway
whatever we send out there is probably
gonna be dated by the time somebody else
like discovers it and shows up if
they're out there so I think that's I
liked that third answer grand theft auto
5 also a great choice ok so on that note
I have to tell you a little bit about
this next story which is very weird um
it's not exciting as Grantham's out of 5
but yeah so much but I mean what is yeah
exactly what is this is called electro
loom and I I thought this was very kind
of crazy because it's um it's not really
like anything we've seen before this
creates fabric from scratch using a
process called electrospinning okay so
what we're seeing in this video is
they're going to put this mold in it's
like a metal mold you put it into the
electro luminous is an alpha prototypes
is a very early prototype of this device
and what it does is it takes these
liquids and they spray it onto the mold
and in using this process called
electrospinning and then they have an
electrical field that cures them into
this fabric like material so this is
electrospinning right here so see
they're spraying out that liquid in very
small amounts almost like making cotton
candy yeah that's what it reminded me of
and there's the guy wearing the shirt
that's the shirt they make huh and it
looks like soft pliable fabric it
doesn't look like you know some of that
stuff like the guy who made the wine
dress it looked like gross fruit
roll-ups right this looks like actual
fabric once it's dry what's the material
again so this is a this is a fat a blend
I think it's like a cotton polymer a cot
cotton polyester blend but in a liquid
form
and so they're saying they're also gonna
work on silk and acrylic fabrics like to
be able to make things that are like
silk and like acrylic yeah I like this
idea um here's the weird thing about
this it's on Kickstarter right now and
they aren't asking for a lot of money
they're only asking for fifty thousand
dollars which seems up front like a scam
like to me I was like oh 50,000 but then
I saw what they were doing really what
you're doing is you're being a beta
tester as in like an alpha electro loom
where you give them feedback to make the
finished product much later so get a
shirt okay so you can get a few things
so um they have different levels of
backing if you do 100 bucks you get a
tank top or a skirt and you'll give them
feedback on like the material and how it
feels and how it fits for all hundred
dollars 100 bucks I think 30 bucks will
give you a sample of the fabric so you
can only see like what the fabric is
like uh and then the the machine itself
you saw which was huge it's a it's not a
small desktop 3d printer like that thing
is ginormous yeah it's huge is forty
five hundred dollars and it's an alpha
version of the electroluminescent sizes
based on like a small medium large kind
of thing and I just find this super
interesting apparently they are just
about there they only need about seven
thousand dollars more they're like last
I checked I think they're about 43,000
so there're I mean they're getting there
and it's an alpha version of the
hardware they're kind of doing like a
beta have a beta testing or alpha
testing thing with this and I just
really like this concept right and it
could help a lot of you know
manufacturing in the future if they can
find a way to do this served quickly in
a few years like I can't imagine what
that would be like I have so many
questions about this I'm only gonna ask
like a cuter just right now here we go
find that I would love to because I have
questions about like exactly how durable
is it is as durable as an actual t-shirt
let's email them and let's let's see if
we can go visit yes okay uh printed
images are going to be the next thing
that people want people plain t-shirts I
mean like split could you argue that
maybe they would find a way to put dye
inside some of those
where they could make those designs hey
it didn't look like a perfect you know I
did look like they're focusing on making
my shirt so lame printing would you
screen prints on top of that or would it
be bad you could you and like so the
shaping like could you make it I'm sure
you could make other types of shapes oh
yeah I have a lot of questions none of
them are skeptical but what's cool
they're just like I want to know the
possibilities yeah audra dollars is a
lot for a tank top it is a lot for a
tank top but but really again it's like
we basically you're paying for beta test
you're supporting us we help us figure
out how to do this like which is
professionally yeah I like that they're
up front about it yeah I play broken
video games on Steam Mary trip hey like
fifty dollars for that is so true um
that's dumb it is really dumb you guys
don't do that uh can I tell you about
light phone lastly like we had talked
about a little bit about light phone so
yeah um I know that like you like to go
you like being outside like you hiking I
love being or no I our person yet what
this is is it is a phone that is the
size it's like the size of a credit card
and it's about five millimeters thick
what in your wallet no that's a phone
okay and all it does is make calls
that's it that's not it was a clock
there's a clock on it as well but here's
this is the concept of this so let's say
that you are going to an event where
maybe you can't take a phone you can't
take a camera phone let's say you want
to go out camping and you want to you
you kind of want to have a phone just in
case of an emergency obviously but you
also don't want to be distracted by
having your phone it and the temptation
of wanting to like play games on your
phone and check your phone all the time
for facebook and everything was very
noble to yes so this is sort of the
concept behind light phone now it can
hold a sim card so if there's a sim card
for service so you don't need to have
your phone with you there are other
things like this but they require you to
be near your actual phone can swap it
piggy backs off of your your phone
service oh so that's their goal is to
get you to take disconnect to disconnect
just enough to enjoy your life yes
disconnect everything except for phone
calls like if you need if you've got to
make a phone call or if you need to take
an incoming phone call you can actually
set in an app you can actually set your
phone to forward okay
phone they want two hundred thousand
dollars people are really into this they
have a over 150,000 right now and at
ships next year a year from now Macek
may 2016 is their goal I I know too many
people that text I can't do this ivory
everybody I know text nobody calls me
and if even it was emergency people
would still rather text my people
surround attacks Jesse I think um I
think if I was going somewhere where i
would be worried that my phone would die
and i would need a like a backup phone
like just for emergencies phone calls
like things like that i feel like i
might invest in it it'd be a good
vacation phone cuz you can just drop it
you went on a hike on an African safari
like something like that would be really
cool so do this right this has a lot of
hurt like I said travel I just don't
think I made it yet yeah like it's just
not a place I don't need it in my
everyday life but I would like to have
it if I traveled abroad it would be a
great Thank You Cal Tech yeah it's
really neat so it's a cool burner for
all your drug dealers out there it is
not because none of you deal or do drugs
stay clean kids alright we are gonna
take a quick break but before we do that
we have play this which is seen that in
gamespot editors telling you guys what
games they're playing so check this out
and we'll be back right after the break
so I'm playing the witcher 3 wild hunt
and I continue to play the witcher 3
wild hunt and then I'm gonna play some
more the witcher 3 wild hunt pretty much
in every waking free second i have i'm
trying to play snake bird because it is
wildly entertaining for just the simple
gameplay that is one of my favorite
games last year was Wolfenstein the new
order and now it's got a standalone dlc
bit Wolfenstein the old blood you can
download it for xbox one ps4 or PC so
I'm playing bravely second the game is
about a fantasy world in which you are
rescuing a damsel in distress and
fighting monsters in an attempt to save
the world you're a snake you're a bird
you're eating fruit you're solving
puzzles and it is fun and hard as hell
and it's more of the like awesome
fast-paced brash gun shooting fun times
of the new order and i'll have it a
blast it's only available in japan right
now so you have to import it or buy it
so we're here and by the accompanying
japanese 3ds because v3 ds's region lock
so it's a little tough to get but i
would say it's worth it if you can read
japanese it's also not in english that's
a weird pick and then maybe some witcher
3 wild hunt and honestly don't even
bother checking in with me next week
because I'll probably be playing the
witcher 3 wild hunt
welcome back to the show welcome back we
were church I obviously kale is ready to
tell us what he's into and so am I so
this is into it I keep hearing dinosaur
roaring noises what are you playing I'm
sure it has obviously dinosaurs related
okay sir sorry I'm gonna close that down
so on this week this week and I meet
hopefully only this week I'm into
Jurassic Jurassic world the game okay
this is one of those freemium games
right all right but but I the only
reason I've been hooked on this one at
both of those dinosaurs is because
there's a lot to do but like even before
you even have to think about paying
first of all you get to raise dinosaurs
train them and then it's kind of like
when you battle it's kind of like
hearthstone Oh in which each turn you
get an extra point to play I so it's
it's not just like a Turk attack it's
about strategically I'm gonna save a
move this time I'm gonna use defense
this time to attack to defense and also
it's like Pokemon because you see on the
screen here an herbivore is not stronger
than a carnivore but an herbivore is
stronger against a flying one and flying
ones better against aquatic so you have
to you can switch them in and out for
rock scissors cash so not only do you
have to do this but you also can breed
the dinosaurs you can also you also
manage the park how can you manage you
manage where to put decorations for the
park which raises this the the stats you
feed them to level them up there's so
much to do Chris Pratt and there's
terrible story telling oh it's chris
pratt being like why y'all stuck up
pretty lady I'll take care of those
dinosaurs skip skip skip skip skip skip
but then there's like there's even so
then there's the micro transactions I
haven't even gotten to those points
every three hours you get to open a pack
for free and like plot the looks
the way to buy more I haven't had to
okay there you can go through this game
without doing it okay so you could play
it without buying yes and you're gonna
play other people online as i was
telling ashley this morning was like I
totally stomp some fool this morning
because I woke up and I was just like
good do my management and then I played
tired and I destroyed this guy I took a
stupid Triceratops down anyway so then
then there's a little bonus there if
there's Jurassic Park toys stores you
can buy those and they come with an irq
oh like little physical toys yeah you
can buy an actual to our codes and yeah
and then it's a bonus you can scan and
you can play as the dinosaur in the game
so that's really there's a lot of work
they put into their freedom just Oh what
it's not just a park manager or just a
fighting thing right it's like its CEO
discovery park management like you know
the little sip farmville and like all
that stuff like all those games are the
simpsons that simpsons tapped out like I
thought it would be that like when you
said you were playing drastic world the
game I'm like okay so it's like park
management and that's that that's the
thing that's the thing about is I was
never hooked by any of those but this is
all of them okay so this is clash of
clans real and this is simply tap out
because you get to build things and then
like the coins but and then you you have
to like you know like I'm gonna make it
in its Pokemon in the gym on its it's
everything so sorry it's really cool and
it's dinosaurs and it's free which I
like free is always good and it's free
so I I hate freemium games but this
one's been a lot of fun so that is the
life that's my into it let me know of
you if you try it give it give it a few
hours cuz it's like a lot of stuff to
learn so that's what i'm interested in
battle you will go down you will be
crushed will kill you uh speaking of
things that will kill us i have gone
back to my cigarettes i'm in a cigarette
no this is actually thanks i will kill
you i have been playing ghosts and
goblins i've gone back to my retro roots
i bought it so long ago on the Wii U on
Virtual Console and I finally like have
just picked it up and started playing at
the other day and I got so mad like this
game is so hard and it is infuriating I
mean and when you were a kid you know
those really sharp edged NES controllers
we're dangerous projectile weapons when
you played
this game because you just wanted to
like stab somebody it's so hard
sometimes and yeah and that's the only
thing you can't ever get fire like when
you get fire you might as well just kill
yourself like you might as well just
jump into a pit because fire is
worthless in this game I think one of
the important things to know is if you
haven't played a game like this if you
played a game like shovel Knight it's
kind of like that it's like that this is
where a hundred times hard yeah yeah
yeah it's way easier now like
platformers and these sort of
side-scrolling 2d adventure games are so
much easier in a lot of ways then they
were like there's no well these these
days these games were made to eat up
your quarters also they're their pains
originally not an addicting so seeing
that look at the fire at this guy's this
guy's got fire I found this playthrough
those are the worst you know fire is the
worst he's brilliant because look at he
doesn't stay and fight the first red
devil which I always do are you supposed
to not I feel like a fool because this
guy is like now I'll just keep going
that red devils got some sass though
he's got a little dance going on look at
that dance and do the Harlem shake look
at him go look at him dance go read them
ago amazing so I have been places so
they forgot how much I enjoyed it and
hated it I'll same time like this is a
terrible thing to say about a game but
yeah I hate this game with everything in
my being but i also just love it because
it's such a like it reminds me of being
a kid it reminds you of any kid so
that's what I've been doing I've been
playing tuba playing ghosts and goblins
out of all the games that could be
playing right now which are three the
photo 5 which were 13 Mario Kart the
updated mario kart DLC cheerz no I just
go go play some ghosts and goblins and
get it really mad look it's actually
kind of a quiet time between now and III
it is a little bit you know things
coming after some retro Watchers threes
like the only thing coming out and in
between now and and but for whatever
reason that was the i don't know why i
just i opened up my wii u and i was like
i'm play clothes goblins i just like
tapped on it and i can't stop now it's
like I'm now I want to beat the whole
game which I've never done are you sure
shot if you beat it if I do which will
probably be when Kayla and I are 130
years old and I need to upload my
consciousness into a computer to beat it
you're leaving comments on this video
somehow anywhere just be like good luck
Ashley jerk
no I'm telling myself that anyway so
that was a really good catches cat-like
reflexes okay so that's what i've been
playing that's what I'm into we got to
talk about user feedback it's really
good this week so let's hit it ask you
guys yesterday about Spotify are you
switching have you not switched up
playing that dial game you're addicted I
said we didn't do drugs on the show and
that game is like a drug your dinosaurs
are my drunk buddy summer that's your
new kesha song has your dentist I'm so
my dress she has a song called darkness
everyone perfect will do that too um
okay so ask you guys about Spotify are
you using it with the new video features
podcasting with all this stuff I am very
interested in this because the youtube
you have like almost no dislikes yeah
now wait really said we're excited so I
don't know what's here Matt wrote in and
said I actually just switched from
Spotify to google+ music for
subscription because of the digital
Locker aspect new features are
interesting though so somebody just left
somebody's like Matt I'm not into it in
the locker um they have a digital Locker
there's the whole thing with google+
music they have a whole bunch of
features that are not I mean I think
there's some that are really similar
spot if i don't use google+ music so i'm
not one hundred percent sure um be king
29 cent on the fence currently on the
three-month trial but so far it's okay
but not sure I need the video feature so
that's what i'm saying is nobody needs
it but if they can slowly get you to use
it more and more I'm telling you and
then Jason Rodin said already a paid
subscriber doubt the video service will
come to Canada anytime soon I do like
the addition of podcast that's one thing
we didn't really talk josh says because
I thought it made sense alrighty videos
only here in the US and I think maybe
maybe in like those five countries like
Germany UK the ones that you mentioned I
think videos only in those countries and
then the Spotify run is global so that
got launched globally but only the video
some because of licensing was only in a
select number of countries here's what
they need they need to do a go you go
ahead no wait you know what they need
they need to like stream some sort of
concert on there exclusively yeah that's
like pretty AC only on Spotify yeah that
would be awesome like our heart rate
they shed their own festival they could
do the Spotify festival by easy but fast
yes fest you could totally do spot
festival itself basketball right there's
more two more John no that was amazing
John wrote in and said just subscribe
today hard to ignore that trial offer so
many of my friends are on it and the new
features look very cool so I mean a
total like scattershot of opinions on
this literally everybody's all over the
shop and then very lastly which is
another opinion about this like
everybody had a different opinion Tilly
wrote in and said I'd like them to make
their old features work better first to
be honest I'm actually with Tilly
because they're still they still need to
fix their social aspects yeah there's
not enough connectivity of being able to
share your music it just has that weird
thing on the other side but which is
cool cuz all sometimes person of my
friends music see what they're listening
to or laugh at them for it but there
needs to be like a personality kind of
like a bit like a social media is sort
of Instagram feed almost where you have
like you know your friends and that's
what's gonna get people to stay and
that's gonna get people to like have
like watch videos on there they need to
get people to stay honest day yeah that
that's sort of like time yeah keeping
people like time in Spotify what they
need to keep so I'm not saying by my
opinion i'm not saying that it is the
wave of the future but it's a high five
to Spotify for for giving their all and
I don't know if you heard some other
news that was announced I think
yesterday was that Spotify is now
partnering with Starbucks yeah they are
going to let you help play music inside
the starbucks that you're inside up so
yeah which is cool you can like vote
down songs and potentially suggest songs
there's not like they are gonna play
yeah you know animals are you martin
garrix or whatever or turn down for what
yeah both with a drop you won't be
hearing that inside us Starbuck but you
couple that with with also the uber
thing where you can play your own music
and I was really like extending their
tendrils out as far as they can like
this I like that they're trying so many
things it is cool it is really cool and
on can I just say I'm a tangent like I
would love to hear a new Richard Cheese
album where he sings turned down for
what like so sad that he's retired like
that's such a bummer I just Logan would
you go to
a festa Phi gonna have solutely yeah
yeah it's a great idea that's 25 guys
Spotify you can have that for free
that's your and then and then even sent
us invites and then even if they just
like they have festa Phi but and they
don't stream it with the video service
but they have the the sets or whatever
on Spotify and they could even do
something like um where you have like a
space where like um Austin has the
Austin City Limits or they have like
different artists come in throughout the
year and they just play in that space
and then they you could have that type
of space to where it's like you have
festa fire we have this huge festival
and it's big thing and then throughout
the year whatever artist you couldn't
get to come to festivai because of
scheduling or whatever you'd have them
come into your own like little like
miniature sets yeah you know that video
up it's so good time saying is this is a
huge positioning yeah if they can pull
it off namo they have a lot they can do
but they have to do it all it's got all
come together it's got all cut you gotta
think they got a tied up with a little
bow but for right now it's kind of all
like pieces of things real quick and
Logan you tried it out right yeah what
do you think needs work it does it was a
huge a huge but I didn't do the running
thing but I made do it tonight okay we
had to let me know what running with the
iphone 6 plus is like cuz i know what
it's like me I don't like it yeah you're
gonna your leg is gonna be heavier I
think this legs gonna be strong super
strong right thing um okay last thing
