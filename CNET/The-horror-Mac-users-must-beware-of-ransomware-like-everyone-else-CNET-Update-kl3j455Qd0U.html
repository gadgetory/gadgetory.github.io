are under attack from ransomware I'm
Bridget Carey this is your CNET update
it was only a matter of time but now Mac
computer users need to watch out for a
pretty serious malware attack that's
designed to hold the computer for ransom
locking up files and programs until the
owner pays up to the bad guys Mac's tend
to have a reputation for being safer
than PCs because you don't hear about
the big threats hitting Mac but with
Mac's becoming more popular the threats
are changing and you can't assume
everything is safe security researchers
discovered what they believe is the
first ever ransomware attack for Apple
devices and it's being spread through
torrenting software now most people use
torrents to download illegal pirated
media so if you don't pay for your
content you may get more than you
bargained for downloader beware and
times are changing for an app that had
everyone buzzing a year ago the app
meerkat jump-started the trend of
live-streaming video on your phone and
sharing it easily with everyone on your
social network but now a year later
meerkat is giving up on live streaming
instead it's launching something called
a video social network things began to
go downhill from meerkat when Twitter
blocked streams from being easily shared
and then Twitter launched his own
version called periscope which is now
more popular Facebook even has its own
live video broadcast tool we'll just
have to wait and see what new form
meerkat will take as it evolves and
another app that evolved to stay alive
is the people app remember back in
October people call this as the Yelp for
people the internet cried out in horror
as a network for reviewing people where
you can't control what is said about you
would be the worst thing ever and
promote online abuse and bullying and
destroyed lives well the app finally
launched for iOS but the creators made a
few adjustments for now you have to sign
up for someone to post a review about
you and you have to approve everything
that's posted to your profile so why
even bother writing negative reviews
well one of the creator's told the
Calgary Herald that there will be a paid
feature coming soon called the truth
license
paid accounts can see every review even
the hidden ones it's like LinkedIn
recommendations but the paid users will
see the reviews you didn't want anyone
to see that is assuming you even want to
join this thing and a quick update on a
story in our last show Amazon removes
some encryption from the fire operating
system which is on Kindle tablets making
Kindles less secure but after much
outcry Amazon announced it will add
encryption back in an update in the next
few months so we'll keep you posted
that's it for this tech news update and
you can head to cnet.com for more from
our studios in New York I'm Bridget
