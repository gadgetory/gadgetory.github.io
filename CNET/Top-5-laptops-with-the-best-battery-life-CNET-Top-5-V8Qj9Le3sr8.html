best battery life I'm a big fan of
current laptops they're thinner faster
and lighter than in years past
best of all laptops lasts so much longer
than they used to every laptop on this
list can survive a standard eight-hour
workday so let's get to it at number
five the LG Graham the 13-inch 2017
model of the LG Graham survived 11 hours
and 30 minutes on a single charge it
weighs about two pounds and uses a nano
carbon magnesium material for its body
one oddball thing about the Graham might
be its placement of the webcam on the
bottom hinge for potentially less than
flattering shots at number four is the
HP EliteBook X 360 this laptop lasted 11
hours and 34 minutes in our tests the HP
EliteBook X big 60 weighs under three
pounds it also has a 360-degree hinge
and since it's a business laptop has
lots of ports like USB a USB C and HDMI
out and number three the Apple MacBook
Pro now which MacBook Pro is this this
is the 13-inch model introduced in 2016
and without a touch bar if you get that
configuration you should see a battery
life of 11 hours and 36 minutes you'll
get two USB C Forks and something called
a headphone jack and number two is the
Microsoft Surface book this is the model
from 2016 with the performance base it
clocked in 11 hours and 49 minutes
before needing another charge plus this
is a two-in-one that detaches for a full
tablet mode there's also a stylus mode
for all of us who like writing and
sketching not using a trackpad and the
champion of all laptops when it comes to
battery life is the Acer Chromebook R 13
this is a two-in-one Chromebook with a
360 degree hinge that lets you use it as
a tablet it's got an aluminum lid so
it's got a premium feel with a retail
price of around $400 oh and that battery
life the Acer Chromebook r-13 blasts for
13 hours and 2 minutes if you're
thinking I as I'm not buying a
Chromebook what changes on this list if
you get rid of that Chromebook then the
new number 5 would be the
non-touchscreen 13 inch version of the
Dell XPS
sixteen got 10 hours and 36 minutes of
up time to find out even more options
check out cnet.com on Maya's apt I'll
see you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
