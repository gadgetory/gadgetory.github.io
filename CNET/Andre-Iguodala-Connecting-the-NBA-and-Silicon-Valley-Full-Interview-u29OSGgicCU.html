talk to you about this your involvement
in Silicon Valley just some fun things
about tech mhm and we're not gonna go
too far back but I'm just curious you
know from from early on you had a chance
you know you're a free agent like what
what is it that brought you I know the
basketball is part of it but there's a
lot of other elements like what really
is kind of one of those hooks that got
you out here well it's very rare that
you know as a basketball player you can
fulfill all your wants on and off the
court as far as what she's looking for
in the franchise and organization and
you know most the time you look for LA
and you look for New York and those are
the two big markets that can attract a
lot of the players very rare or I don't
know if that ever at all has a player
decided to come to the Bay Area where
there's been a lot of positive energy
going on the basketball court an
opportunity to try to win a championship
and have the interest off the court you
know with Silicon Valley being right
next door and all the things that are
involved in the Bay Area so it was just
a perfect timing you know it makes you
know you tell non-believers like is
there's a higher being there that puts
everything together that aligns itself
for you and I feel like it's been a true
blessing and just trying to make most of
the moment so the next step is kind of
like you're here and I mean you're kind
of like the you know it sounds silly but
and be ambassador and like technology
you bridge these two worlds you know
we're not when you're at games I mean
I'm a season ticket holder you know I
know there's a lot of like Silicon
Valley is watching the games right up
close you know did you actually start
some of your networking that way by like
seeing them there or you know how did
you start inserting yourself cuz you're
really the first person that really did
this stuff well it was interesting I saw
a few sitting courtside as an opponent
you know you see all certain figures it
was like wow just reading about him
earlier and you know my business partner
and myself had been you know trying to
dab into the tech area a little bit
before I got here so you know get the
articles and srinivasan figures and you
know who led miss sector in that sector
so
I think it was against our plate for
Denver Nuggets I'll start seeing some
people core size so from there is just
getting here and trying to establish
myself on the court you know that's the
most important part of this whole thing
you know for us to have success on a
basketball court so once we did that you
know trying to make the rounds trying to
meet the right people and fortunate
enough to meet some people good and bad
you know you meet the wrong people but
it teaches you a lesson you meet the
right people and you try to listen to
their advice and take what they have to
say close to heart and work as hard as
possible at that and try to build on it
no I mean because you you you you are
now in kind of the investment VC world
but you came from out of it do you look
for different things when you're
investing in companies or you know look
what are types of things that you
actually look for personally me
personally what I've learned is where
the company could be in ten years could
that company be able to have a massive
growth or scale scale is the important
work that my business partner myself use
you know how can the company scale we
understand of the same in fashion where
you start off in a niche market and you
start you know way up here and you only
make a four select few and you make
everybody kind of want it and make it
hard to get but what are you be able to
take that company and you know make it
something that everyone can access and
be a part of in fashion you kind of have
sub brands and you take a perfect
example would be Facebook and Facebook
was only for a select few individuals
and never be the Harvard students
correct and what they were able to from
there was just making it only available
to college students you had to have a
college email and it was kind of like
everybody had to happen and start slowly
start rolling it out to everybody and
boom you know they're disrupting
different outlets and different sectors
all over place neither Simon's like
their media company or their
a marketing company you know what
everybody needs is you have to have
Facebook in order to you know get your
vision or get your product or get your
whatever it is your brand out there to
the masses my mom and dad have a
Facebook there you go right right about
scale right right right College Harvard
mom and dad you're a good pop right on
there like watching all those tasty food
videos yes stuff like that yes yes I can
tell your eyes like it's so funny
because I'm really on Facebook because
most of my facebook is what I keep in
contact with everybody went to high
school with and family that uh I don't
get to see as much you know that's kind
of how I keep in contact with them but
the whole timeline is full of tasty and
things that we're going back home so
it's kind of funny do you got any other
guilty pleasures on Facebook like you
know just the videos that will just get
you trapped in there the tasty ones
pretty much there do it cuz I'll sit
there and watch me like how did I get
here you know it's kind of funny
the food's terrible as well like that's
the crazy part like I eat very clean so
there's a lot of things that I cut out
and everything I watched I'm like okay
that's great that's terrible that's a
lot of sugar that's terrible that's a
lot of milk that's a terrible cream on
top of that is terrible and then you
roll it up into a bunch of meat and some
more cheese but there's no vegetables
but that looks delicious yeah there's
some interesting things that go on the
cut wouldn't be there if you ate that
stuff exactly talking about you know is
there time I'll just technology and
stuff are there things like exciting
tech for you or trends that you're
you're you like right now to see
personally whether it's you know
wearables a anything what's kind of
what's kind of peaking your interest
right now I think AI is is really just
starting to get some watering as if this
is a plant and then it's trying to get
watered and it's trying to grow and
they're trying to figure it out I've
been to some
interesting companies I saw some
artificial some AI stuff us all so mixed
reality that was amazing down in Florida
that's a hololens stuff not the hololens
on magically Oh magic leap was amazing
like you've seen in a person I don't
know if I'm allowed okay it's like it's
like going to play at the Augusta played
a matches it's like you're not allowed
to say but you can't say you've been
doing but I've read that you so I've
never been there okay
according to the rule cornea exactly
what uh magically was off saw some
incredible things and then I met some
great people there and they want to do
some things in sports but I don't know
how you even think of doing something
like that like you just and then the
actual device is so small the one that's
gonna come to market it's almost like
every pair of sunglasses on how about
this can you I know you're not given
because they've shown a lot of demo
videos on yes but maybe can you describe
one of the experiences that you had like
you know did you put your hand out and
something appeared on it earlier so
there was so many things like when you
put your hand on there the character
would come on your hand and supposedly
you can feel it I felt something but I
could have swirled with something else
happening like your mind your mind's
playing tricks on you but this little
character could basically be your your
Siri you know go turn on the lights you
know you control everything from your
smartphone but this will be you control
everything from your eyes you know and
even if you move your eyes things that
move with it and you know you can shoot
something turn off the lights turn off
the turn up the heat go turn off the
oven turn it on preheated you know it's
also smart home yeah at the same time
you know I could throw a 80 inch screen
TV on the wall let's see the TV yeah you
know and at the same time you could you
can homeschool your kids but when their
have their that imaginably point they
could be in class by the kids and see
the other kids and then see the teacher
and the teacher to see them and it's
this whole this is a disruption of life
you know you say Texas destruction this
has to be disruptive and how can you
make something more efficient but this
is
I mean you can change impact lives all
over the world and you know bringing
people closer together because what we
learned there from mobile phones is that
it's taking away kind of the social
aspect everything because you just on
your phone and you're not really
interacting with people but this could
bring that back together I saw your eyes
literally like as you're talking about
mine yeah there's so many things this
it's a Star Wars thing that I can I can
there's the same well there's like a
c-3po type thing that is crazy
they show only like literally there's
like maybe two seconds of it online but
that is crazy okay
and I I'm not a Star Wars fan but I was
crazy that was pretty cool
now maybe my favorite part now the MBA
very tech savvy you know as a league I'm
not sure if you've seen this but they've
partnered with next VR they're showing
some of their games in virtual reality
what is your take just about bringing
virtual reality and the NBA together
like what are your thoughts on that a
couple years ago at the tech summit
don't all-star break for the league they
kind of rolled that out and I was there
to see it
so you know you can subscribe season
tickets could be a season ticket holder
through next VR and then it's as if
you're sitting courtside and you can
watch the game I think you still want to
have the social aspect of it where you
can interact with other people as well
so if someone's you know the go State
Warriors fans in Miami and you have one
in Vancouver you know they can sit next
to each other and they can interact I
think that would be really great you
know and I think that's something I
imagine we kind of just trying to figure
out as well I'm sure other companies are
too so I think as long as you keep the
social aspect of it and fans are
enjoying a game and it could be
something really special
okay um I know that because I'm a I'm a
fan I'm a season ticket holder whatever
right now I'm one of those guys I know
you don't really like the nickname
Iggy that much so I got I got a new
nickname for you want me here you want
to hear it not only no not really
here we go get ready check this out all
right and we know your initials are AI
whatever artificial intelligence is
pretty hot right right I know you like
nicknames I kind of speak to your game
what if we called AI Andre until it
well I don't know oh wait I would like
it because it's kind of uh trying to
compliment your status on the compliment
but I don't want to come off as arrogant
so I would never say that about you you
can't do it you shall be like hey guys
I'm andrée intelligence you hope that
someone like me to be like I got this
hot new nickname yeah I think I would
have to do something a little bit more
impactful wait have you ever thought
what was that movie called
with a Russell Crowe gladiator no he was
a genius um oh shoot whatever Connelly
beautiful my beautiful my beautiful my
now if I could somehow have an impact
like that wouldn't had the good stuff
not the faster so are we a saying here
she would like your nickname to be
beautiful mine that would be a good one
exit okay well as on the court yeah yeah
yeah yeah it's peachy a game you know I
hope so
the beautiful part of the mind part all
believe that the my part
all right um all you know obviously
you're a super entrenched in the barrier
culture you got your golf game on
obviously right you got your you got
your Silicon Valley I mean this is all
things being equal you know whatever
this is this is the you know country
gravity do you is the Bay Area it feels
like you're settled here it feels like
this is your home yeah I mean because I
know it's a business - it's um it's
definitely a business you know and I'm
good with keeping that in the rice
perspective but at the same time you
know I gave up a little bit or a lot
whatever you want to say I don't know if
it's just I would never say a lot
because I mean it's perspective at the
end of the day for me I'm in a beautiful
place my family loves it here we all
enjoy it so for me to just take a
day-by-day and let how it happened how
it's supposed to happen
we're in another we have opportunity to
try to make a run at another
championship and that's the plan so you
know my focus is right there I'm not
trying to think too far past that that's
a good answer
yes I've been illegal while learning to
be politically correct exactly like
young and you ain't gonna get me on this
one although I'm actually older
you'll believe that I wouldn't do you
have a guess of how oh I told you I'm
older by order than me so you're about
36 black don't crack eggs and don't
raisin anything don't ragin like that
hey no reason I came over that you can
you can use that will go people's head
though people would understand that I
did it though beautiful mind again I
like that you can make that one out of
your friends be like a masseuse is like
I don't know how she is she like 60
which is less he's like 40 yeah she's
probably 60 I don't know if you won't
tell us her right I wish she doesn't
watch this
you can tell okay um a question we
always ask when it comes to tech are you
an iPhone guy or an Android guy I got
both oh there you go that's you know and
then why do you you know what tell us
why you like maybe both for what reasons
oh man well iPhone that I mean I've been
using it for longer so I mean it's more
user friendly to me but the Android is I
feel like it's safer nobody can get in
that phone I don't care how hard they
try what Android phone are you using
right now
you know s7 oh yeah okay I see tip s8
should be out right yeah it's coming
it's coming real soon I mean okay okay
you saw what it looked like though
I saw a little bit of it like I'm not
the type of person that I'll just go get
it as soon as it comes out like I'll
wait ought to get all the kinks out but
I'm in a white glove program though yeah
I know I've heard about Samsung they
take care of me I don't get paid for it
so people that don't know get on that
white glove tip right get on the white
glove - yeah yeah yeah it's hard to get
on
social media honestly you're the king of
sub tweets let's be real yes people
don't can you explain to people what is
the sub tweak I do I do well on Twitter
so when I tweet something and usually
means the opposite of what you're
reading or it has it has is usually a
movie yeah quote or its inside joke no
one would get about two people in the
world I just like having fun with it cuz
now you I get a lot of responses and a
lot of replies few people have gotten
some of them know a pretty good the
movie ones are starting to understand
like fans are starting to understand
okay that's the movie from this one and
then you're taking it to this and then
just having a game they're putting two
and two together they get smarter I got
I got your bamboo in salt one then
everything else that would Dave
Chappelle when you guys went to the
Hamptons to do the Katy visit you put
out a sub tweet that just said Nobby
what was it what was that one what was
actually that related to that it had
nothing to do with Katy
I forgot what that had to do with
because everyone was freaking out
because you were like no I was mad like
I think I was in the airport some
happened in the airport and there's like
this thing with black men sitting in
first class yeah right when when when
they say first class the board the plane
I always get there can I see your porno
plan you did ask for nobody else's
boarding pass so it has some do that and
somebody asked me a question and I was
in my hair like no I'll be like just
leave me alone like I don't wanna sign
autographs on one do nothing cuz I was
just so mad at it's probably the
airliner something happened so sometimes
I do that like if I have an interaction
with somebody and they just don't
understand what's going on at the moment
whatever I'm thinking I'll just tweet it
but no and that's that like weird things
like that so that was that it was like
perfect timing though right yes it just
I realized that I wasn't thinking about
that because I was on my way back home
then I was flying somewhere else because
I found like Katy sign I was on a plane
you didn't know until you landed no I
had Wi-Fi on the plane I'm sitting next
to my wife and I was like we got Katy
like that's how I found out so like I
was flying all over the place so it was
just a lot going on I mean it was
literally like perfectly time yeah
you're the only one
in that meeting that had said anything
was radio silent right everyone did the
world's whatever on NBA world is on pins
and needles it's like Bobby yeah so what
you did with that sub - oh you know what
that could have been I don't know I
forgot why I said naw bu and then do a
Katy dog um which leads me to like you
said you know everyone's like freaking
out about it like with social media I
mean obviously it's a powerful tool it's
also fun right it also can get crazy
like come on we know like fans trolls
they can get really really nasty on
their do fans sometimes care about this
stuff more than the players
I shouldn't say care more about the
players just that we're channeling all
your energy like as a player you know we
prepare ourselves to the best of our
ability everything we do outside of the
game of basketball is for the game of
basketball you know so our lives are
just wrapped up in this like you know
what I eat sleep train you know how I
carry myself how I dress everything that
I do in life it's basically revolved
around trying to help myself be a better
basketball players I mean you don't have
too many guys like that but a good
amount you know not everybody has to
saved but a good amount our intention is
to try to play the best we can and win
every single game like that's our life
you know and then when fans you know
sometimes a fan may go overboard and
it's like you know all my energy was
just spent out here I'm sorry I don't
have the same passion you have at this
exact moment because I left it on the
court so I think that's where you
misunderstood at times it's like it's
not that we don't care just that right
now I don't care I'm tired because I
just spent my whole life just trying to
figure it out out there and that's where
that's where a sec you know me me on the
court that's where my passion is right
now you know but there's only four
hundred guys that can have that passion
at any given moment because that's how
many guys are in the lead all right we
want to play a little game with you to
wrap things up we're gonna call it would
Andre invest because we know your
investment okay see you guys so what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna throw out some of
these some of these may be rejects some
of these might be products that exist
first one is called the bark bath
portable dog system
to bathe your dog anywhere anytime with
virtually no mess it's kind of like this
steam cleaner system is 109 it's for dog
owners and dog lovers do you want do you
wants to want to see what it looks like
or not a pit fan see how I've made that
brought in setting like dogs didn't say
I didn't like cats I just and I'm not a
fan of pets the thing is the dogs we're
here really get wet it doesn't but why
would you take it anywhere I don't know
like you just take your dog out my car I
take a bath right now or like how about
this you want to brush your dog in like
maybe in the kitchen in the living but
if they don't have to jump in a tub it
doesn't get all bubbly do you want to
see what this looks like it was to stay
at home but what's the point of it being
portable there you go that's what I'm
asking you you know would Andre invest
no I would pass only because I'm not
really in the pits next up this is a
social media app it catches moments as
they happen that disappear after 24
hours and as filters like silly add-ons
that you can turn your face into a dog
or a clown would you invest you know
I'll be honest if I heard that I
probably wouldn't you know yeah we're
like a lot of athletes have
conversations yeah sure and no we just
gonna text through this app and then
it's gonna be gone after you read it so
I would understand that I would invest
in that right away okay here we go
icon this is the products name icon the
world's first smart condom it's a ring
that fits over a condom to track
exercise thrusts calories burned average
skin temperature it can detect some STDs
$74 retail price would andre invest i've
already read about this would Andre yeah
it's a really good we had a really good
conversation about this so could it be
reused
I think cuz it's a ring that goes over
oh it's not like it's not like a
disposable thing I mean I would invest
you were never run out of men next one
we got two golf ones because you know
you like your golf game not dirty but
the name of the product is called the
tittle it's a golf swing analyzer it
mounts on your golf clubs senses your
swing without the ball calculates carry
distance various attributes of your shot
without actually making contact with the
ball you just put this like adapter on
your club would Andre invest
we're not invest we gotta continue to
grow the game of golf first I'm not
optimistic in the golf equipment plus I
have all those gadgets in I'm an avid
golfer like you have to be an advocate
to buy these products and there aren't
too many of me is Andre a basketball
player or golfer less my real that's not
at all watch and play yeah straight off
the course
alright last last thing this is a fun
game it's called RP golf like RPG like
role-playing game think of it as a mix
between zelda and a golf game so
basically like I'm gonna just I gotta
pull this up to show you basically like
you're playing a video game like it's a
golf course but while you're navigating
this golf course you'll come across the
dragons and monsters oh wow
and you fight monsters
a lot going on
I wouldn't invest because I feel like
you know most mobile games the ones that
are very attractive or addictive it's
like we when you can compete or play
with other users and I don't see how you
could you can interact with anybody else
with that game it'd just be you and
fight dragons get lost had like a you
get lost like Nintendo feel old Nintendo
still - or Atari yeah I play the target
that's an ongoing - so no I went out of
this okay Andre thanks so much for your
time thank you very much thanks lady
