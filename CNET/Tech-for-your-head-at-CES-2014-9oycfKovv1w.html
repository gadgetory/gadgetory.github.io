I'm Scott Stein and I'm Bridget Carey
and this is part one of a three-part
wearable tech show we're doing we're
looking at headgear now there are so
many wearable tech products at the show
it's kind of nuts there's too much to
track there's startup ones so to speak
they're startup ones there are all sorts
of different parts of the body so we're
breaking it down and we're starting with
the eyes
Google glass obviously you may have
heard about that I'm the resident glass
whole yes so you know obviously apps are
being developed for that but there's
more stuff going on as well and one of
the others is oculus rift you've heard
about that's really something using it
you know a living room entertainment
what dreams are going mobile but there
are other things that are looking to get
that home entertainment experience one
of them is the avocado and this is a
different type of projection technology
some companies are looking at developing
new types of projection technology I'm
gonna try it on right yeah this is a
virtual retinal display this is using
Texas Instruments DLP technology to put
a 720p display on your retina it's
projecting and it can project 3d images
it can also project 2d it can connect
via HDMI so you're looking at
entertainment with this it's designed in
a you know a high-end style headphone
you know rig his headphones you word on
your head like this and then you flip
down the visor which has got the
eyepieces yeah here we go so you talk
about your experience can you can you
see it yeah so I'm watching a movie
actually actually and it's very easy to
see I mean it's not uncomfortable at all
it's very clear I'm not going cross-eyed
I feel a little bit like Geordi LaForge
yeah this scanner now you know this the
idea here is that you're not going to
obviously scanning the environment
around you but there are other there is
a peripheral vision element so that you
don't you know walk into something
hopefully we're not gonna walk while
wearing these but no I can't see you
yeah so that's the idea here and there
is the potential to do more virtual
reality type stuff with a head with head
tracking capabilities this is a this is
launching a Kickstarter for $4.99 and
you know this technology we looked at at
CNET and it was before it actually had a
design
and now it has this design which i think
is it's pretty awesome that was built in
the headphones and it's got a control on
the back on the side here they're
actually buttons and a little little
spin flywheel yeah that takes care of
you know all of your media controls and
it's hooked up to an iphone right now
playing a movie you can actually play
real racing on it
we should you want all right so I was
just watching pitch perfect you put them
on okay there's actually a text coming
into and it will mirror it's it's it's a
it's a mirrored connection so you could
actually navigate your phone and open up
any app it's it's man is it it's treated
like a display so you're really looking
at display technology here the iPhone
screen oh and now the game loaded up
let's see and why don't we just play
this part where you go ahead good idea
here I'm just gonna grab this and go
ahead can you see it really just seeing
the screen in front of me this is kind
of interesting alright it's loading up
right now this is like having a massive
like game system in front of you it's
kind of cool
I mean when I use them they actually can
can adjust with diopters two different
prescriptions I'm a really intense
prescription of minus 9 and this I you
know I was still able to make out there
was very vivid I felt like there was
there was a more vivid look to the
display you don't really see that pixels
quite as much but it's it amounts to a
720p resolution this is pretty cool I
feel like I'm in one of those like
arcades were like you're just totally
immersive into it it's like a little
movie theater in your head it's like a
little projected screen I'm someone who
gets prone to being dizzy when I'm into
something like this and absolutely not
like its penis no not at all although I
kind of stink at this game I'm getting
better you're doing okay yes you can
look down looking up his harder but you
can look down it to the sides when
you're wearing it yeah that's you know
that's a look at let's look at the
Abigail if I know I can see myself being
on the subway totally ignoring everyone
with this
I think it's actually not just for the
tech but again what do you do with these
displays well how do you wear them
Google glass you know it is small but it
looks like something that's hanging from
your face this is trying to look like
something else it's an interesting idea
now going into you know there are mented
reality technologies there are a lot of
them here at the show some of them are
in startup booth some of them are behind
closed doors
Epson already had a pair of augmented
reality smart glasses before the MOE
Vario bt100
this is the mo very OBT 200 and the idea
here is that this will be for consumers
and for for other people for more you
know be for business use and these are
gonna be available for $6.99 now the
design is kind of funky but the display
is actually projected right in the
middle of the lens these are a 60%
thinner than before
unlike glass we just kind of have to
look up and decide to see it's right in
the middle of this vision this is right
in the middle and it's a middle ground
because instead of something floating in
the corner of your eye you're gonna see
you should try these yeah and we have
someone here from from Epson as well
maybe cuz you want to set up to use it
thank you
well we get set up I am just seeing
right in front of me like free like in
this little chunk yeah I can squeeze it
so the display hangs right in front and
again can project 3d as well as 2d oh
and if you look at this control it's
this is not a smartphone at all this is
the touchpad and as I move my thumb I
can see my cursor girl it's an Android
console so this can run apps this
actually has and it you know it's
Android 4 it has you know full touch
controls and a little micro SD card slot
and it could connect via Wi-Fi connects
via bluetooth and you control it with a
tray and we've also got sensors built
into the glasses so that it detects
motion as well as a front-facing camera
so it's really an ideal augmented
reality platform so I'm gonna hit the
home screen and what you're gonna see is
a series of apps
it looks like an Android home screen
either in front of you and
yeah grab the glasses real quick so I
can load up some content for you and so
I tried using this and you you could
stream something like 3d YouTube videos
we can stream 3d content from the
internet and then for everything else it
kind of goes back to that entertainment
mode where you could play and use you
know any content on it and be able to
see it floating in front of you but then
there's the second element of augmented
reality applications where there are
there are some ideas and games you can
move your head around and you know shoot
things out of the sky there that are
floating around you or pick out points
of interest there's another alternative
it's it's a floating in front of your
face alternative to glass yeah so the
game I'm gonna load up for you is called
cyclops it was actually developed by a
you know a well known glass developer
Sean McCracken and it is a kind of a
light virtual reality game it is done in
rolled dark colors so you can actually
see through it and you'll sweep your
head around and you're gonna be immersed
in this virtual city and if you look up
you're actually gonna see spaceships
kind of shooting down at you and what
you want to do is focus your target on
them and you can shoot them out of the
sky so let me now apologies we're
originally get a bridge this to show
what it was gonna look like via Wi-Fi
direct on the screen which it's capable
of doing but we're having some shoddy
connections here so you're gonna have to
watch somebody using it which is it you
know I will try to make directly gesture
facial expressions to express how great
this is I've already tried this and so
you know give it a whirl oh so what am I
looking for here oh oh I see them it's
right over our boss's head sorry Lindsey
I'm shooting you right now yeah so
they're kind of like floating among the
crowd right now it's kind of interesting
you know I mean I look like a little bit
of a geek I mean you can't really see my
eyes if you're trying to make a
conversation with it's like I've got
crazy bifocals on or some sort of
futuristic multi lens I think it's cool
that they are right in the middle of the
lens and that you don't have anything
you know right on the outside it
projects through a little bit Epsons
vision for these glasses it's really not
to have an always-on type of use case
you know it's really for specific
purposes so when you want to have some
big screen
entertainment content on the go or even
some of the stuff you touched on earlier
Scott was enterprises cases so we were
working with a number of fortune 100
companies with the partners of ours apex
Labs to help out what they call the desk
list worker you know really making
workers more efficient in their jobs
well thank you so I mean that's that's a
look at the Epson mo Vario bt 202 is
which are here at CES and one of a lot
of different types of display tech we
didn't even get in oculus rift but they
are showing stuff behind the scenes with
new positioning technology and they've
improved the blur and that's pretty
impressive too but there are more and
that's a brief look at some of the tech
in wearable glasses now that is actually
2014 I can pretend I'm working also play
games exactly so and that's that's a bit
of the spectrum
I'm Scott Stein I'm Bridget Carey and
that's glasses wearable tech at CES 2014
here in Las Vegas we'll be right back
with more wearable tech next
