schools we're in a school in Chicago and
I've got the new iPad along with a few
accessories so what's it like with this
$329 iPad has Apple pencil support and
we're gonna open it up and see what it
looks like for the first time so here's
the box I'm gonna put these down and
pretty much looks like other iPads and
this is not called iPad pro or iPad
anything else just iPad so you got to
know in the store the 2018 iPad and this
is a replacement to the nine point seven
inch model that came out last year so I
believe this is a 128 gigabyte model
let's open it up it was a very nice
clean packaging here goes right to the
edge and this is the iPad I will set
iPad pro and I'm gonna put that aside
for a moment see what else is in here
we got lightning cable standard got to
have that and here's the little
documentation with a little bit of open
that in a moment here's the AC charger
now what is what's the wattage on this
it is 12 okay that's good like iPad pro
models helps it charge faster also if
you have an iPhone that's gonna charge
your iPhone faster so there you go and
was there anything unique in here
welcome to iPad
sim tool because this actually has LTE
support if you want to activate that and
some Apple stickers got it I always have
the Apple stickers that's gonna continue
on that trend okay let's put that over
here and let's open up the iPad now a
couple things you want to know about
this model this is the iPad pro take off
that plastic that will never go back on
in the same way again and this feels and
is in fact shaped more like last year's
nine point seven inch iPad does it means
it's going to be compatible with last
year's iPad accessories for the nine
point seven inch but not with older iPad
pro nine point seven news so keep that
in mind and there's no smart connector
so you can't use any of those keyboards
or with iPad pro models you have to use
bluetooth or other types of accessories
I'll turn that on now I haven't done any
setup with this and we don't really have
easy Wi-Fi so we have to set that up
later but it looks looks like pretty
much any other the bezels are not as
thin as on the ten point five inch iPad
pro it's more of that traditional design
there's the start up it looks like the
display and the way it's set kind of
feels like that nine point seven inch
from last year home button of course
with touch ID and this is an eight eight
megapixel camera with 1080p video
recording so not 4k although this iPad
can record can head--it sorry 4k video
so should we try setting it up English
the United States QuickStart and if you
want to see the accessories this is the
same exact pencil that's been around
since late 2015
same pressure sensitivity so you got one
of those pencils stylus is lying around
you can use it with the new iPad
Logitech is also making a kid type
version of the pencil called crayon it's
not going to pressure sensitivity
you pretty much know what the what
pencil looks like right
but I'll open this up for you too
here same exact design for pencil that's
a lot of packaging for pencil but there
it is and once again you are going to
have to charge this pencil with this
iPad by doing that and sticking it right
in
that lightning port not ideal or you can
use and included dongle and charge it
with a lightning cable but that hasn't
changed and I've got sticker all over
this iPad sorry about that
finally we've got smart cover this is
not anything with a smart connector this
is your standard iPad Smart Cover and if
you have one that's magnetic that works
with an older model you should be okay
here's the little release here
how do I even open this and you open
these things here we go I am terrible at
opening up the Smart Cover okay here you
go
I'm going to cap that pencil put it
aside and let's take that cover attach
it on there you go now keep in mind the
smart cover does not protect the bat
it's not a smart back cover it's a smart
front cover however I like logitech's
$99 case seems like a pretty sturdy
protection we haven't tested that yet
stay tuned for more but this is the new
iPad in our hands here in Chicago</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
