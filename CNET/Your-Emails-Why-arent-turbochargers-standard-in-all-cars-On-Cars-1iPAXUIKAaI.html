taking some of your emails about
high-tech cars and modern driving and
this one comes in from Ellie II who says
if turbos are so great we talk about
them a lot around here why are they not
standard on just about every new car by
now what would it take to install one
also he says could you please explain
flex-fuel okay Ellie so turbos are an
amazing technology to get more power
more efficiently out of typically a
smaller engine is how they're often
being used today the thing with turbos
though is adding them is not trivial
even for a car maker with all their
resources adding a turbocharger to an
existing engine design is going to add
some cost because the turbo itself is a
very complex highly machined mechanism
and it's got a lot of plumbing that goes
around it it also adds a certain amount
of complexity to the design and to what
you're trying to shoehorn into the
engine bay it's a lot of additional gear
that is external to the engine itself
and know that an automaker cannot just
stick a turbo on a current engine and
say good it's running there's a lot of
R&amp;amp;D and testing and engineering and
recertification to be done before that
goes into a production line of cars and
everything is done at big scale in the
auto biz so they don't onesie twosie
things or big projects so that's one of
the things around turbochargers now
there are add-on kits out there a lot of
them for late-model cars you didn't
mention what you drive but let's assume
it's something made in the last few
years you may very well find an add-on
turbo kit for it they typically cost in
the few thousand dollars range and also
make sure you've got some good
guarantees in there because these are
elaborate pieces of gear that spin at
very high rpms and make sure the kit you
buy does promised to be regulatory
compliant in the state where you're
gonna be installing it and driving your
car now in terms of flex fuel that means
a world of three things that gasoline
engine cars can run of course there's
gasoline that's the main fuel there's a
15 which is 15 percent ethanol which is
corn alcohol basically and the main flex
fuel people think about at the pump is
85 this is 85 percent ethanol typically
corn alcohol and 15 percent gasoline
that's a very different mix for a car to
run on so when you buy a flex-fuel car
it does several things to allow it to
digest that diet including a change in
the ignition timing because there is a
far higher octane to e85 than to gas
Selene secondly you change the fuel flow
mapping because you get more fuel into
the engine to get the same amount of
power when you're running on e85 and
thirdly you have to make sure the
materials in the engine are suitable to
be exposed to ethanol alcohol which is a
very different chemical of course than
gasoline those are the main three things
that constitute a flex-fuel car</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
