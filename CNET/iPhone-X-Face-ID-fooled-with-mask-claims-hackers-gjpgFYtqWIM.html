fool the iPhone 10 space ID system with
a printed mask a Vietnamese security
firm published a video and blog post
saying that Apple's face recognition
security system is flawed because they
could crack it using a method that
combined 3d printing ahead with a
handmade silicon nose and handmade skin
and the mask had some flat
two-dimensional printed areas like the
eyes the video demonstration was very
fast and no one else was able to
duplicate it as of this report so it's
worth being a little skeptical here and
some more details are shared about how
it was done some doubters are wondering
if the phone learned the mask instead of
a real face but the researchers denied
such tricks when asked by Wired the team
said they made a few masks that also did
not work this is not the first time the
security company has cracked biometrics
back in 2008 the company used printed
photos of faces to break into facial
recognition systems and computers from
Lenovo Toshiba and Asus now Apple has
said it's system which uses multiple
sensors cannot be fooled by a mask and
that the chance of spoofing it is one in
a million but if this video is not a
trick well it does pose a number of
concerns in the demonstration the phone
unlocked with a face with printed eyes
so maybe you don't have to be alive to
unlock it we'll have to wait and see if
we can get some answers to these creepy
questions but for the time being it is
probably easier to just trick someone
into looking at their phone to unlock it
rather than make a special mask of the
person I'm Richard Carey and you can
