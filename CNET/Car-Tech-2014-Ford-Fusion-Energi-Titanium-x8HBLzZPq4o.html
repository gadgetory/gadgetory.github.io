fusion hybrid with a much bigger battery
it's a plug-in hybrid is it worth the
cost though is it worth the cord let's
drive this 2014 fusion energy titanium
trim level and check the tech doesn't
look a whole lot different than other
fusions this is a titanium trim so it's
a nice looking car spot one easily buy
the big old badges they got planted all
around it and of course dead giveaway
here is the charge port door two and a
half hours for a full charge on 220 now
about seven or eight hours on a standard
household outlet beyond that the dead
giveaway is in the trunk much bigger
battery on a plug-in much less trunk
space as a result now every Fusion
Energi is gonna have the my Ford touch
LCD touchscreen interface it does not
necessarily have Navis we're gonna find
out later that's an ala carte option but
it's not very expensive we've seen this
before so I'm not going to dwell into it
a couple of differences though when
you're on the energy is you do have this
energy screen it's going to show you in
rather complex ways where the energy is
flowing and what is taking parasitic
loss off the electrical system you've
also got a setting screen here that's
unique to this car which is what they
call my go
it lets you set up some programming for
how and when the car is gonna charge you
can set this thing to charge when it's
convenient to you or you can also set it
to charge at the value time when the
rates are ideal by the way this
navigation systems also tuned up
differently in the energy it's got the
ability to run in an eco mode where
it'll detect when you're going on a trip
you've done before one that it knows and
then it will run an electric only mode a
little bit more if it can because it
knows what's coming
something the car can't do when it's a
trip that it's not seen before and sort
of going along with that is an eco
cruise so when you're in cruise control
which is either standard or adaptive the
car will also change the way that it
does its modulation on the road again to
save energy to conserve electricity this
vehicle does have automatic self Park
Assist it's the basic version where you
do all the pedals it handles the wheel
now you know me I'm not real big on some
of these touch sensitive panels
to fiddly for driving this one is done
well Ford's improved the touch response
a lot past versions were a nightmare
luckily volume remains an actual knob
thank you for that as his power and disk
eject but things like source and track
forward and back are these little non
moving touch sensitive deals you may
like these you may not I find at least
they don't have a lot of false responses
anymore now aside from head unit
electronics you've got the usual set of
LCD displays on the sides of an analogue
speedo the one that I think is most
interesting is their brake coach and
instantaneous fuel economy
you can configure it a lot of ways but I
want to see how I'm doing on
instantaneous and then when I come to a
stop I want to see if I recaptured as
much energy as possible combined those
are kind of a de facto momentum coach
which is really key your drive controls
in this car are pretty simple no paddles
we have a CVT transmission which doesn't
really reward those anyway a very basic
PRN DL shift gate the L is more of a
high regen position than it literally a
low gear over here is your Evie button
this will tell it run and Evie mode more
than you naturally would most folks just
gonna leave this an automatic though and
then here is your Park Assist button to
tell it start looking for a parking
space using its sonar over to the right
now under the hood of course is where
some big differences happen between this
standard fusion or even a Fusion Hybrid
the Fusion Energi being a plug-in hybrid
has just more battery to give it more
ability to run electric only under here
is a 2 liter atkinson cycle inline 4
it's a lean burn kind of an
uninteresting inline 4 no turbos no
direct injection it's just got a motor
but that keeps the power going in
combination with a seven-point six
kilowatt hour battery pack to an
electric motor this is the kind of thing
that lets you run eb more than a
standard hybrid in combination that
means you can run this thing up to 21
miles on battery only under the right
conditions which are fairly flexible
it's not like a hybrid where it runs
evenly a little burps and blips this
guy's kind of an electric car part of
the time now energies are only available
in front-wheel drive other fusions can
be had an all-wheel drive but not this
guy good FYI for those of you that live
in crappy weather the horsepower is the
odd math of a hybrid that is 141 horse
out of the
engine 118 out of the electric motor
that adds up to 195 total system power
you don't just sum them together now
zero to sixty happens in a fairly
leisurely 8.6 seconds largely because of
the vehicles weight over 3,900 pounds
that is almost 500 pounds more than a
two and a half liter gas engine fusion
it all pays off of course in the
efficiency 43 mpg 100 mpg II which
reflects the fact that it can run in
electric mode substantially ok so the
energy has a good power but it doesn't
come on in a terribly sprightly way as
you may have noticed of all of our
controls none of them go to sport they
all go either neutral or into a more
efficient manner so this is not a
driver's car fusions can be fun to drive
this is just pleasant to drive it's got
a good comfortable ride you've got a lot
of extra weight as I mentioned from the
battery and the accessory equipment that
makes it all work so this is a car that
floats nicely down the road until you
hit a big whoop in the pavement and then
it really bottoms out that was a little
disturbing let's talk about the driver
assistance technology the one that's
most notable is the lane departure I've
got it set to active so I get two things
when I drift off the lane it starts to
pull me back with electric power
steering doing its own thing but it also
gives me kind of a a rotating stick
shaker on the wheel
I find the combination of those on the
steering rack at once are kind of
unnerving it's it works pretty well but
it ends up putting me back in the lane
kind of pointed too far the other way
and I have to correct manually the
forward collision technology works well
I think it's well calibrated and when
I've got it set to high I think it
catches things early enough the car does
not stop itself no matter what's going
on it just pre charges the brakes and
cranks up the boost so when you finally
get on the stick and hit the brake pedal
they really Jam on in my experience the
energy is devoid of a lot of nasty
electric car noises which is not the
case with
electrified car some of them make all
these weird whining sounds this one
doesn't on the other hand it's
four-cylinder engine makes a bunch of
kind of weird straining sounds
especially given that it's got a CVT so
it's looping up and down a lot not the
most pleasant car to listen to but when
the windows are up you don't really hear
much ok pricing the fusion Energi may
make you swallow hard because hang on
there are incentives at the end when we
start off at about 41 3 base for this
guy delivered as I mentioned navigations
Alucard extra 800 bucks driver assist
411 40s a good deal blind spot tech
cross traffic alert active lane
departure automatic high beams and
wipers adaptive cruise / standard cruise
is $1,000 and that includes the forward
collision warning and brake boost
technology the self-parking tex 900
bucks a moonroof is $1,000 rear
inflatable seatbelts are interesting
$200 that's a Ford thing all in road by
46 3 for a fusion but then come a
mountain of incentives first of all Ford
shaves $4,000 off the top because
they're competing with the Chevy Volt
which recently had a price haircut if
you're in California where I am is a
$1,500 tax credit and federal will give
you a 37 50 tax credit notice that's
exactly half of what you get for a full
electric car but the bottom line the
real bottom line is is it worth getting
the energy the plug-in hybrid or street
just get a standard fusion with a gas
engine which is real efficient so I've
done the math up here let's say you take
a Fusion EcoBoost two and a half liter
front-wheel drive with a same trim level
compare it to this energy you see that
you've got after all the incentives a
fairly close price all in that's because
we got a lot of money on the hood of
this car if you take it further it's an
833 dollar additional cost for the
energy work that out across the annual
fuel cost savings which is about 900
dollars a year on this car according to
those federal ballpark calculations and
you're looking at a payoff of just 11
months thanks to all the incentives
though if those weren't in place you got
a big difference in your payoff you go
from 11 months to 11 years so with the
current incentives in place and if
you've got a state incentive like we
have here in California as well this
guy's kind of a no-brainer if you're all
about efficiency and if you've got a
shortest commute
let's say 15 miles or so each way and a
plug at work it becomes even more of a
slam-dunk</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
