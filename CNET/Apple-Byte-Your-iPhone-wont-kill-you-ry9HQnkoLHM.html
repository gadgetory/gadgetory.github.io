welcome to the apple pie for all the
good and bad inside the world of Apple
now let's get to the stories and a few
weeks ago rumors of a liquid metal
iphone set the internet on fire but
Business Insider spoke with one of
liquid metals inventors atacan pecker
and he says Apple is still three to five
years away before we see it being used
in a large scale now I feel a little bit
relieved knowing that my iphone won't be
trying to kill me anytime soon but
pecker says it's a technology that still
has to be matured and perfected he could
see it being used for smaller components
like a hinge or bracket for a macbook
air but a casing like the heirs body
will take several more years he still
expects Apple to use it in a future
breakthrough product but not anytime
soon I know guys sometimes reality in
the truth hurts especially in high
school when no one ever asked you to a
Sadie Hawkins dance even if you wanted
to go all right now I know I might have
shared a little too much there but
apples hoping its employees won't have
to worry about that after a request for
a new off-campus restaurant was recently
approved by the city of Cupertino to
provide employees a place to eat and
discuss company plans without fear of
having their conversations over her or
losing their prototype iPhones see this
is a place truly where Apple drinks
their own kool-aid now an iphone parts
are known a part supplier has leaked
what they claim to be the sim card slot
tray to slash gear for the next iPhone
there are minor differences in the
design like a curve section before it
gets to the metal edge but ultimately it
looks like this part if believed to be
true is pretty much the same size as the
current one amazing now in apple patent
use Apple is filed for series
introductory sensory mark it's that
sound consisting of a rapid two-tone
repetition for the note C sharp when you
hold the home button down it may be
music to the ears of some of you but I'm
still on the side of the fence where
Siri is completely overrated it's still
a beta product Apple is selling to
people as a finished one and when it has
to connect to its servers and they're
down but you have no idea if
they're down or not yeah you're screwed
I'm still waiting to see someone
actually talk to their phone in public
like that but I haven't seen it and
don't get me wrong people voice
recognition is still a cool evolving
tech foot I hope to be blown away by it
at WWDC because it doesn't work the way
we've been sold on it and that's a bad
apple alright i'm getting off my soapbox
and let's take a quick break with a cool
app for transferring your photos from
your phone to other devices easily and
it's not email you smart asses now we
all love taking pictures with our
cameras but have you ever wanted to
transfer photos wirelessly and quickly
from one device to another well that's
why you're still watching this and I
have a couple of apps for both Android
and iOS that will do the trick now
you've heard of this first app called
bump it's free it works cross-platform
and allows you to send photos in
contacts from one person to another if
both people are using the app select the
pictures you want give them a little
bump and voila the pictures are received
on the other end it's real world proof
that Android and iOS can get it on but
my personal favorite app to transfer
photos is called photo transfer app
that's the name the universal app on iOS
costs 299 and it's 199 on Android now
you might not like paying for apps but
there are several key things that make
it worthwhile you can still send photos
from phone to phone cross-platform but
what about sending pictures from your
phone to view on a larger screen like
your iPad this app allows you to do that
you'll have to be on the same Wi-Fi
network and you'll pick which device is
the sender and which device is the
receiver I like how it organizes your
photo collection into groups of 100 to
keep tracks of the ones you're sending
and not only does it transfer photos but
video clips as well you know bump they
just can't do that now the other killer
feature is you can also send your
pictures or videos directly to any Mac
Windows or Linux computer by going to an
address on your web browser that the app
creates for you bottom line photo
transfer app is we're dropping the money
for wow that was a really professional
video done by that skunk hair guy thanks
for that Brian all right in some quick
bites Apple's latest update to OS 10
mountain lion adds a Do Not Disturb
feature for notifications that you can
toggle at the top to block incoming
alerts and messages the feature is
activated with a moon logo and this
could be something we might even see
integrated into the much
anticipated iOS 6 at WWDC also cloud
computing is kind of a big deal in 2012
and amazon has released a cloud drive
app for mac and windows that gives you
access to their online storage space and
lets you drag and drop files in the
finder also spotify long-awaited ipad
app is finally here supporting the
retina display and their 18 million song
catalog you'll need a premium
subscription to use the app after a free
trial period but more importantly I hope
none of you dance like those people at
least in public and guys you know the
Apple by we like to stay abreast of the
news the following contains scenes that
are intended for a mature audiences only
and contain scenes that some viewers may
find disturbing like Brian tongs nephew
especially with this iphone carrying bra
called the Joey bra it was created by to
University of Washington students and
they claim it can hold an iphone along
with your ID credit cards keys and boobs
now I personally don't have any use for
this but it's really a wonder to hold
now we always show you the loyal Apple
biter some love so we have another
awesome giveaway from our friends at
griffin technology with this killer
Triple Threat device it's the stylus
