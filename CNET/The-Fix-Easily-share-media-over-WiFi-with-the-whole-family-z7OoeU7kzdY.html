photos from a recent trip I took and I
want to be able to share them on all of
my computers and devices at home without
actually uploading the photos on to
every single one the solution is to use
a networked hard drive once it's set up
I'll be able to view photos videos and
any other files stored on the drive from
any device that's connected to my Wi-Fi
network there are a few ways to go about
this one is by using a network attached
storage drive or an ass drive for the
power user they're great but if you're
more of a casual user who only wants to
share media there's a better and more
affordable solution on the back of most
current routers you've got all of your
standard networking ports plus a USB
port when a hard drive is plugged in
here you can share whatever is on it
with any other device connected to your
network here's how to set it up on
Windows first choose your storage drive
it can be as small as a thumb drive or
you can attach a bigger external hard
drive plug it in and head to your
computer launch your browser and go to
your router's IP address in my case it's
192.168 point 10.1 but you can find
yours in the device manual unless you
change to yourself every routers
interface will vary but if it has a USB
port you'll likely find a file sharing
option under the administrator settings
here be sure to enable the file sharing
server apply the settings and get out of
there now you're ready to access the
drive so head back to your desktop
launch an explorer window and go to the
network folder at the top clear out the
path and enter backslash backslash
followed by your IP address with that
your drive will appear you can
double-click it to access it like any
other folder you'll be asked to enter
your login which is the same one you use
to access your router once i'm in i can
see all of my vacation photos and so can
anyone else on the network
the process is the same for all other
windows computers as well as my android
tablet at this point you might want to
map your drive so that it always appears
in the sidebar for easy access to do
that just right-click the drive and
select map network drive and there are
all my photos from my trip whenever and
wherever I want and the best part is
that if I ever need to take my drive
with me somewhere it's as easy as
unplugging it and stashing it in my bag</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
