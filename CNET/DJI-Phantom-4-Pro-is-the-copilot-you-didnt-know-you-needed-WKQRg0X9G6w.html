precision-engineered proof that the DJI
deserves to be the biggest name in
drones it's really easy to fly in
beginner mode and once you turn off
beginner mode well the Phantom can move
with a top speed of 45 miles per hour or
72 clicks in sports mode you'll get
around half an hour of incredibly fast
flight time out of the battery the
controller itself is excellent offering
very easy to learn flight controls and
impressive command of the underslung 4k
camera but if we're talking about the
camera the most impressive stuff that it
does is automatic it's got the usual
suite of features that you'll find in
good camera equipped drones like the
orbital mode and follow modes but the
DJI steps it up with an object tracking
that lets you select things on screen
coupled with very smooth gimbal
movements and the resulting footage
looks really great it's also got
built-in collision detection to stop you
from flying into any trees or buildings
which is frankly fantastic peace of mind
especially for first-time pilots who are
steering and rowing the costs a few
thousand bucks the DJI phantom pro is a
very impressive piece of kit but that
pro tag is not a lie it's an excellent
offering if you want to indulge in
serious drone photography but amateurs
will want to consider that sticker price
very carefully</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
