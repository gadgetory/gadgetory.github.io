things this time I talked to CNET's
resident TV guru David Katz Meyer to
come up with this list of the top five
TVs of the year at number 5 is a TCL s
3800 Roku TV you might not know TCL as a
brand but you should instead of coming
up with its own Smart TV apps in the App
Store
TCL put together a deal with Roku Roku
interface is simple yet polished and
it's got lots and lots of apps for your
favorite online streaming services the S
3800 series is one of CNET's favorite
entry level sets oh yeah
it's relatively inexpensive so it's
really hard to complain about this TV at
number four is the LG EF 9500 okay so
this OLED TV costs about five thousand
dollars but it has the best picture of
any TV seen that seen its colors are
accurate and this TV doesn't bother to
embrace be curved gimmick the EF 9500 is
flat and flat out awesome at number
three is the LG e G 90-100 now we
reviewed the LG EC 9300 but the newer eg
9100 is basically the same TV according
to LG this 9100 is an OLED TV and costs
less than half as number 4 on this list
with the price around $2,000 for a 55
inch model that's still pricey but since
it's an OLED TV it displays perfect
blacks since you can't turn off pixels
whites are very bright for excellent
contrast the full review it's coming at
number 2 the Vizio e-series now these
TVs top out at 1080p full-hd
with very good picture quality the 40
inch version costs around $300 and the E
Series handily beat more expensive TVs
in our comparisons color accuracy was
also superb and contrast was improved by
a local dimming in the number one the
Vizio m-series this is a 4k TV with a
price and picture quality that puts it
on top of the TV world for now $1300 is
the price for a 65 inch model and gamers
take note input lag for gaming was among
the lowest we've ever tested the Vizio
m-series is our top recommendation for
the year
that does it for us for more check out
top-5 to Netcom am i as a car we'll see
you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
