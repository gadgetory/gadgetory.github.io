and you are listening to the final
episode of dialed in this is no April
Fool's joke because if you haven't heard
CNN is striking out in new directions
with exciting new shows and this is not
one of them are definitely looking
forward to creative video pro
programming in our future second cuts to
the chase and we are going to definitely
miss this weekly opportunity to reach
out to you cnet's listeners so with that
in mind we are dedicating this final
podcast to you I'm Jessica tell Kourt
join in san francisco by lynn law ll
technical producer steven Beecham hello
and buy original hosts Banita hi kent
german on the phone from New York hello
Nicoli will hopefully be joining us at
some point and we've got Brian Bennett
also in New York hey guys we have to be
here we have the whole crew new and old
minus Nicole who's I just got I just got
the call that Nicole is here okay I'm
gonna go better than awesome okay we
will have Nicole we will have the whole
crew but until then we're going to share
some emails we're going to share some
memories of ours we're going to give
this show a proper goodbye show it off
in style and right now we're going to do
what we do best and we're going to share
some news some headlines so basically
the HTC One X which as you might
remember is sort of like the highest
octane of the three HTC One phones
introduced a new family of phone by HTC
in Mobile World Congress and we have a
review of the quad-core world phone so
this is not the same model that will be
coming to the US this is the phone that
will be released in Asia and Europe and
CNN Asia am seen at UK got their hands
on that and they have full reviews and
Brian Bennett is going to tell us all
about them that's right i mean this
phone is basically what a lot of people
who have been waiting for an android
device and we're holding
out is the phone that they hopefully
will want unfortunately us in the u.s.
won't be able to get it right now at
least that's okay we'll get something
else with LTE which they don't we're
hoping that the lose that part will lose
that processor but that's true yes
although I have to say we don't know
that the quad core processor made by
Nvidia is going to necessarily be better
than the dual core processor that we're
getting from Qualcomm in our version so
you'll need to get some side by side
tests and see if it actually makes a
difference that's true I mean a lot of
people have been kind of latching on to
the fact that the european version of
the HTC One X which is the flagship
phone in HTC's new 1-series line of
devices you know will have nvidia tegra
3 processor which has quad core
computing and basically you know has
four pores with one ticking away in case
the phone is in standby to conserve
battery power so basically you know this
device from what aloysius had checked
out i always such a tough name say how
alicious aloysius ella was just low at a
scene in asia took a look at this phone
and basically it turns out that it's
it's what a lot of people that had
expected it's fast it's nimble it's cat
like it's exactly I mean it this this
this device is smoking I mean from what
he had determined its camera is really
quick takes shots you know very very
swiftly and with no delay that's part of
HTC's whole plan to offer devices that
take photos in the blink of an eye if I
remember correctly and you know this
this phone you may they do by the way
like the shutter speed is really amazing
if you leave your finger on the shutter
for more than a second then you will
have taken three to five photos yeah I
mean that's really really fast I'm
and I you know I gotta tell you I
probably take more pictures by accident
you know then an on purpose with this
thing you know it'd be dangerous so so
watch out but yeah so this this phone is
an awesome device I believe it has a 4.7
inch 720p LCD i think is like super lcd2
which is a new version of that
technology it's not ola oled or AMOLED
unfortunately but it seems to be very
cool it's using a new treatment that HTC
says enables it to survive or at least
us are to offer lots of high contrast
and viewability in sunlight and has a
really nice design as well that's you
know very easy to grip so this phone is
is just a pretty awesome handset one
thing that was mentioned in review is
that the battery life isn't exactly that
awesome so you may want to carry your
charger along with you wherever you go
in the day time yeah we also heard from
aloysius that scene at asia that there
is going to be an update and i think he
had better battery life he was able to
get a full day of use with moderate to
heavy use on his memory well that's good
that may not be universal and certainly
shouldn't hopefully won't pose the
problem that it did to our reviewers
when it comes to the US for the AT&amp;amp;T
there was also some photo tests that you
should definitely take a look at if
you're interested in the photo quality
of the phone there's the HTC One X and
iphone 4s shoot out the aloe assisted i
love that sec boy figurine i want it
there's a there's a picture of a teddy
bear hugging sackboy sackboy so check it
out in the meantime and other HTC evo
news we've got this mystery event that
brian is going to be going to this week
that's right and it's between sprint and
HTC and it's very dark and mysterious
but a lot of people has you know their
everyone's making predictions that this
is
going to be the dual core version of the
HTC One X which may possibly be called
the sprint EVO 10 so this actually could
be and it makes a lot of sense because
oh I made a pun there oh gosh better not
do that aloysius is getting to me he put
a pun in his review as well about sense
but anyway what I say he said you know
something about this this this part of
the phone makes sense you know bodum do
we have that here oh that's not a bit on
Shang that's a drumroll oh yeah I guess
that works so in any case um this this
phone is rumored to be the HTC evo one
and it's supposed to hopefully have a
LTE connection which will be I believe
the first sprint phone that would
actually be shipping with it or Lisa now
yeah yeah because they actually just
announced was it last week that they
were gonna know long no more wimax
devices that's right why max I mean not
kill what's already there but they will
not be releasing introducing anymore yes
that's right so I mean looks like it's
going to be the trying to recapture that
that that buzz in that that excitement
that the original HSE evo 4g had with
when it was first announced and it had
wimax now this will have low hopefully
we'll have LTE access so this is going
to happen wednesday there's going to be
a big event at you know in the evening
of 5 30 and there's going to be a lot of
headliners aired is going to be the CEO
of sprint dan hesse as well as the
president of HTC um what's his name
jason mccann McKenzie yes so he's going
to be there I mean you don't pull out
these bigwigs for nothing so everyone's
all excited and we're gonna be there
we're gonna check it out we're gonna see
what happens ah stay tuned so yes nicole
has joined us sorry hi nicole nicole has
joined us everybody's here old garden
ooh what were you gonna say Ken oh I was
just going to say so Brian you'll be
there with Roger Cheng right yep that's
right
to bring you the hot news right we're
going to be there exciting awesome so
there's another fun that we're
anticipating this is the nokia lumia 900
for ATT that's coming out on april
eighth along with the HTC Titan to these
are both windows phones and lynn has a
little bit of news in case you're
looking to buy the Lumia 900 yeah it's a
it's available for pre-order now and we
can't wait because it's april eighth I
mean consumers probably can't we but
anyways we can't wait cuz it's April I
mean it's coming out it's available for
pre-order and it will be a hundred
dollars so that's a very competitively
low price and sorry Steven was attacking
me and recently Roger wrote a really
good analysis piece on you know what
this could phone what this phone me
could mean for Microsoft and Nokia and
basically he's just saying it matters a
whole lot and and i love that
understatement there yes hint hint um
don't you're putting on eggs in this bed
oh yeah that's great I mean this is
Nokia's comeback chance they've never
had like a hugely strong presence in the
u.s. a lot of their top-flight phones
have been unlocked here um Bonnie's
reviewed a bunch of those well I mean
like lesson eight the end yeah the n8
was what like 600-700 dollars yeah yeah
but I mean a hundred dollars for this
kind of flagship phone that's I mean
that's a good first step yeah they're
not joking around yeah they want elapsed
off much stuff must be subsidizing this
phone seriously yes you know even more
reason to go out and get and check it
out yeah both companies microsoft and
nokia have promised putting tons of
dollars behind the marketing campaigns
and they arrived and they're they're
doing it i mean they're both doing it of
course they've got you know two
different pocket books to choose from um
but yeah there was hot story last week
how they're putting 24 million dollars
into like education programs in europe
so they are not joking around they mean
business and that's good that's the
attitude they need to have if they're
going to succeed so since this is our
final show or
to be sharing and reminiscing and we
have somebody who's going to reminisce
with us who send us some a very nice
voicemail so let's listen to that hey
guys craig from trenton and I just
wanted to say that I'm really going to
miss the show i watch it religiously I
download you guys on TiVo and just sit
in front of the TV and then watching
guys and I hope that in the new slate of
programs that scene that is going to
offer that somewhere down the line they
give you give us a show with you guys on
it again and lastly you were talking
about Lumia 900 being may be the last
gasp for windows phone and why would I
buy that phone when Windows 8 is coming
out and it's possibility that a fat
windows 8 will not be on the Lumia so
that's my last comment for you guys on
good luck and hope to see you around the
internet bye that's very nice yeah we'll
need to get some more information from
Microsoft and Nokia about their upgrade
yes I mean they just haven't announced
they haven't made any announcements
about windows 8 and what it's going to
do to mobile I mean outside of you'll
come into tablets of course so we'll
have to see but for right now they're
not saying because they introduced
windows 8 of course a mobile where
they didn't introduce it they showed off
mobile windows 8 again at mobile
Congress but they did not make any sort
of announcement about how it would come
to phones that's that's an awesome
question I have to say I mean I'm gonna
I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that
I have a feeling that this product will
you know hopefully support it and I
think it'll be likely that it will
that's based on 0 information but hold
you to it David go to my clairvoyance
you know but I mean well if you think
about it windows in the whole microsoft
phones they've been good at providing
updates to all their devices even if
they're really old like the first
samsung focus and they got mango and all
that stuff yeah but remember none of the
phones were backwards compatible when
they switched over to windows phone off
rating system yes which does make sense
because they were scrapping an operating
system and starting fresh but i agree
with you i really hope that they just
update everything though I wonder if the
Lumia is dual core is that right no no
no it's not single core microsoft has
announced that they are not against
multi-core and they're thinking about it
and planning for it but no announcements
yet so everything is single core however
they also argue that they don't need
multi-core because they're you know the
processes work pretty quickly and they
don't have they have task switching but
they don't have true multitasking where
things are running in the background but
that might not be so bad because isn't
like task killer the most popular
products on Android yeah I'm sure yes
people don't necessarily want tasks
actually running all the time and I
could you know I if I faced with a bunch
of if I if someone gave me a list of
five features and they said you know
rank them in order important I don't I
can't say the dual core which would be
really that high I mean I care about
long battery life I'd weren't really
experienced and a nice screen and I can
sort of live without that in some way
yeah and plus windows smokes Android
except when it oh yeah without apple
core well there's a lot of controversy
about yeah yeah don't get me started i
carry are you on where are you get her
started i know i'm sorry i'm so i just i
get back to that later let's pop it over
to another email right now Nicole do you
want to read it for us sure I'm Jessica
and crew I've going to adore you all
about that one not that one the one
above it above it oh there we go okay I
got it hi doubting could I was quite set

very nice thank you Paul I'm glad that
you have good memories of us we have
good memories of ourselves and
let's start with the original cast you
guys want to share your favorite dialed
in memories or moments mmm I was trying
to think it I remember like when we
first started this this this this whole
this whole production yeah it it was a
lot different than it is now I remember
like we were trying to switch switch the
board like Stephens doing oh that's
right because we were the predictor that
was kind of a learning process yeah
which is why we have Stephen episode 10
right it was like like like trying to
juggle two things totally yeah I had a
hard time too yeah talking and it was it
was mostly audio to ya in which which
was fine but that when we moved to
videos like oh crap we have to do and
yeah that was a little bit nightmarish
just trying to like converse as well as
such yeah tell me about it there's six
people on the show right now making his
money today I just do an overhead shot
in bed remember like yeah yeah cuz this
is the most we've ever had right there
are seven voices here oh I think I'm
gonna break the laws of causality say
anything or else the world is going to
end do you guys have any oh sorry anyway
our moments mmm um I well it was that
and we do we had a we had a couple
special guests on every now and then we
had some folks machine in Asia yeah
that's cool yes did we ever been
associating UK I don't remember I don't
know if he did oh nothing but then bonny
moved to New York again so we spent many
i think if i had a week we added all the
hours that we added all the minutes that
we spent trying to get Bonnie patched in
anymore I mean like I'd have another
week of my life
thank ya my favorite memory with
introduction Bonnie bear yeah the
brothers there is Bonnie disembodied
voice for a while we might remember
where we got that okay you just yeah
okay so what happened was Bonnie would
always freeze in this weird position we
should crackle and then we lose her we
had to have like a little avatar for
Bonnie and so we just kind of like
grabbed a bear like a stuffed bear that
was around were like this is nobody me
and then well sometimes she was an
Android illegal android right yeah and
they're like the one hint warrant arms
and Roy oh yeah that's right it was
broken to never forget you I don't know
how I found it I found it on youtube you
know like you're lying oh there's a real
thing no not everybody gets a theme song
not even just to think of like I mean
this is kind of very off topic a little
bit but i think the when we first
started podcast like that was even
android then keep it magic / that was
even android was there let me talk about
like yeah we had like we have the iphone
good iphone but that was like no like
there was just like mysterious google
project what that what heck so yeah you
know right cuz we weren't sure if it was
actually a google phone like what was it
your operating system nobody knew it was
yeah it's kind of amazing how things
have changed yeah a lot a lot and rim is
like no oh yeah by the way side and then
back then it wasn't necessary case chill
exciting well I'm we're listening to I
mean this is not a direct story about
you guys but I remember listening to one
of my first podcast one of the cnet
podcasts was through up palm five or
something right right ya know there's
just technology that fast
I think she's called you out right I
know a little bit of both just thinking
about it like the g one yes what year
was that I'm that wasn't that long
that's the ping it wasn't that long ago
you know what it's like in two thousand
seven no six no the iphone is that it
was called the HTC dream too I think it
was at least in 08 2008 there's only
eight so that's a good step that's not
that long not that long ago it's just
everything fast sep tember 23rd 2008 wow
if you've been used sure i still how
many years oh yeah well that was wait
that was the first show 2008 know that
is that what anyone came oh okay okay
well you know I remember seen the google
logo on the back of the phone being like
oh i never liked that phone I never
liked it I liked the operating system
but I never liked that stupid chin bump
at the trough or you reach your finger
said it was like the worst type I really
first time I saw was it in and out and
my friend was like oh I got the google
phone was like oh my god can I touch you
let's jump over to another email Bonnie

windows phone OS and the focus flash is
okay great camera a nice touch screen

that windows phone fits my personality
better simple fast and customizable
pretty colors it does have pretty colors

last Christmas they also broke it so it
is awful tablet the android OS is ok but
i would love windows phone on it instead
the feel of it in my hair
is very nice so I now carry a phone /
camera a tablet in a zune they all have
their place in and still use them all
for different aspects of my life I did
not consolidate nearly as much as I

before the show was taken out hey guys
is Jonathan was a longtime listener I've
always watched a doubt in actually most
time listen to it I've gone from nokia
flip fold to the candy bar and then
eventually moved on to sit windows
mobile blackberry gone android now with
the iphone i did have original motorola
their iteration of the iphone before
with itunes fail oh just sorry to hear
you guys are leaving but you know let's
it love you guys I've chatted with the
Bonnie on a Twitter or drop my phone

so i can continue to watch and dial in
summer actual phone lover so you guys
have been the best hope i wish all you
the best at any time later no Jonathan
you're the better of the bed that's
really sweet also I gotta ask how do you
drop your phone into a bowl of pho
coffee talking M&amp;amp;A kissing yeah Larry
maybe lease on your hands and you just
think it might pick up taking a photo
off the fun baguette head and then
dropped it photo but then your phone
tasted delicious when you were done I
mean but then do you drop it into I mean
do you just get some rice from the back
like the Colonel's and dry it cuz you
know you have to try the phone yeah you
have to unless unless you have a phone
that with a removable battery there's my
not as difficult that would help yeah
but help perhaps that was an awesome
video that was a deal alright and now we
have the new guard when Brian hi Brian I
mean
straddler would three where the news
well you I was super in New and then so
I guess my favorite moment well it's not
my favorite moment because I was really
scared on my mind would be my first she
was 20 and didn't say anything and can't
his like speak like highlight us like hi
he's like well Lynn goes to this school
and she just joined us i was like i
should be saying these things but
actually yes the rock for that podcast
the role of lynn was playing don't worry
my first podcast i was full of nervous
laughter and I even got any email saying
that I had laughed too much and that was
bringing down the quality of the show no
because I was too quickly how can anyone
be two giggly you know you're talking
about though fun stuff exactly having a
good time can't all be mr. serious face
ken are you gonna miss back actually um
I get Jessica need only me on a daily
basis what do you mean so her I don't
know what you mean Jessica we're talking
after the I'm just kidding yes Jess when
Jessica learn that i worked at
Disneyland and I was on The Jungle
Cruise she finds it very amusing I think
she alone finds it very amusing that to
call me skipper d still calls for its
respect for your rank the way I
understood it the way Kent described it
actually being on The Jungle Cruise was
pretty high on the disneyland totem pole
actually it really wasn't well it
depends a lot of people don't want to do
it because you had to be you could we
weren't just sitting there pressing a
button you know where you are John easy
bro you had the inflatable job well the
jokes are pretty dumb so did you have to
follow a script Kent mmm yeah and you
could you could get in trouble for
deviating from it but it it depended on
how far you
deviated from it so you know like the
just actors the belkin there's the look
at all the baboons and we call them
Debbie patent Daniel little baboon haha
then Daniel Boone Pat Boone and you
could in like that wasn't on the script
but you but other jokes were off the
scripts and some people did get fired
for going outfit oh that's pretty
serious yeah I thought it was just like
you know you didn't get you know your
weekly allotment of popcorn or something
Brian do you have any yeah well you know
myself at a whole is not what am I I
think I mean you know I've you know I've
been so new here but I think one of the
first times I hosted this show that was
pretty intense you know and surrounded
by all you know all these lights and
blinking you know doodads and everything
and then you know I'm starting to see my
face like kind of ghostly like floating
in a screen that was that was kind of
cool you know I definitely enjoyed that
but yeah no I mean I you know it's been
it's been awesome you know definitely
enjoyed just chatting with you guys and
you know talking about the news and and
now oh I know I liked and I think you
know what I think this is true i made a
prediction on one of the first episodes
about rim and I know if you guys
remember but I said that they're going
to go straight into enterprise some
point was when you were right brian is
precious actually the Solstice pair in
our chat room says that apparently the
use of illustrious was his favorite
memory of my first time hosting use of
elections I think I would've said the
illustrious though right read it right
well I definitely I definitely enjoyed
seeing Roger Roger Chang and his avatar
inside the phone booth I think that was
that was awesome awesome one time he
didn't want Bonnie bear obviously
because he has his own identity
today Antoine's desk and get a
transformer that's sorry he was was he
after his crime he was then yeah and
then Steve had the brilliant idea of
using real photos to meet you I think um
why I have a lot of favorite memories
there was a the time that funny and I
and Steve had mimosas that's right with
a party hat some party hats what was the
occasion the halloween hundredth episode
Nicole and I had a really fun Halloween
Ellis owed where we got to dress up and
Steve me this is awesome he wore the
Grim Reaper outfit and he made this
awesome awesome intro based off of the

awesome and of course there was when we

Bonnie when Bonnie found it in or it
like literally you know she had to go
because I had to go me for real fun like
Bonnie's phone and identity oh there
were there were a lot of moments I just
I remember a lot of laughs I remember um
I love interacting with everybody in the
chat room and anybody who said email and
one of the best thought I ever got I
just totally like turned me into a
little goop of emotional this that's not
really i'm gonna say that again anyway
it was an email that we got from one of
our viewers who i guess was having a bad
day and watched a bunch of dialed in
episodes and then wrote to say how it
lifted his spirits no I'm in a good mood
and very much just to be able to do that
i mean we're sitting here in a studio we
don't really we've got walls around base
camp might be at the airport he's got
people around no actually i'm in i'm in
the studio in the office okay great
Brian's also there too so it's like
are surrounded by walls it isn't
immediately obvious that you're reaching
and yeah who's listening are you guys

to our second voicemail ok this is from
Tully in Napa hey folks love you
terrible going to miss you even more
best of luck and all you do I did like
your show quite a bit by the way it's
kind of funny that Ken's voicemail
greeting from like this before when even
Jessica was there so it hasn't been
updated in very long time critiquing us
till the very last that was that was my
way of making sure that Bonnie Nicole
lived on Biggs can I Kara Bonnie I did
how do you do I know Brian or Kent's you
want to read our neck actually I don't
have it open Brian so if you want to go
ahead so therefore Brian okay I'm just
making sure we have the right one in
front of me here from France it's from
Brian okay oh that's us right into Brian
all right so brian says just listen to
your second-to-last episode and cried
when you broke the news that my favorite
cnet show was cancelled frowny face how
can I protest this I like your
dramatically they know it's like
listening to fresh air or something
a little like a skull I know the Ryan
dots per last man friend or your ex um
well how good protest it could occupy
this occupied you know I feel great come
in here it's a little tight send in all
your old nokia i don't think that's a
good idea oh man oh man all right i'll
read this one well you guys think of
final thoughts and other stories because
we are unfortunately approaching that
time capital T capital T that type this
one is from Chris in our chat room oh my
well I'm excited about the new videos /
programs I'm definitely sad to see this
one go your show was my favorite podcast
and not just because it gave me a good
info and help me find my phone now I'll
miss it because you made me laugh you've
always been funny and insightful and
cheered me up after a boring day at work
thanks for doing that and good luck to
all of you in the future parentheses
perhaps Jessica can smash some phones in
the finale or at least one final epic
rant just a suggestion thanks Chris
Chris your last request shall be crime
on and another thing oh my god Oh Mike
where are you going oh boy
oh my gosh really especially released at
your own banner Lynn Lynn Bonnie and put
down the headphones and leave work
environment actually uh this didn't do
your bad I'm pretty impressed doge eight
foot you know that old sound room with
all the padding in it take jessica jeff
audio potty OS the phone is definitely
damaged like if i get all right and yeah
look at it I'm like not really class but
um well it's a dummy phone all right
yeah it's actually a fake phone a minute
I couldn't do that too valuable Cena
property but I did want to grant
chrysalis last request it seemed pretty
reasonable what's it very cathartic oh
my God look at that looks like dented I
think I tend to go where did you get the
hammer um well everywhere the reference
by the way to breaking the phone was it
was a sauna meeeeee what's the number XP
3100 force I think that's right now and
it was yeah yeah the indestructible
phone that she ain't destruct destroyed
yeah and Teddy can I had a bunch of
these two right likes onam likes to put
them in case them in concrete for you
and drop them off and they're like
here's one in concrete here's a normal
one have at it so I did so it's a video
where I'm like you know we're outside
and I'm like throwing it down and it
didn't break and I had to pick it up
again and do it again and then at the
end I thought it would be funny like as
a signing out of the video I thought it
would be really funny to just like throw
it up in the air videotape it coming
down and and you know that's that well
it turns out I threw it up in the air it
came down on its face I heard a little
crack they stopped rolling I went to go
get it and I'm like oh damn I just broke
the screen sana was pretty upset on at
me but there
like oh well actually it's you know I'm
like well maybe it's cuz I threw it
higher than 8 feet or whatever and
they're like no well actually you know
that's just a number we give you it's
certified for much more but you know it
must have fallen and hit a pebble or
some uneven surface and the glass broke
I mean they never promised that they're
completely indestructible just SAT there
I don't know resistor mostly they're
mostly until they met just to do exactly
what was a really fun day and can't had
