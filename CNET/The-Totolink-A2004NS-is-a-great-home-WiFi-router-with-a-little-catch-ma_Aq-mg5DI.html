n as AC 1200 Wi-Fi doing bang Digga B
trailer from trolling now tolling is
from the same country that also gives us
Samsung Hyundai and of course kimchi
South Korea dairies and this router here
is quite interesting first is basically
impossible to figure out where is from
horseback for that matter is you can
place this hobby one and it still looks
quite good
also these four antenna here they can be
folded on top like this if you want to
pick it up or simply want to reduce the
Wi-Fi range now other than that the
router here comes with the usual four
Gigabit LAN ports and one gigabit one or
Internet port there's also this use P
port right here to host a storage device
this is quite a good design that makes
working with the raro
very convenient in my testing the router
has the top sustain Wi-Fi speed up some
130 megabit per second and some 18
megapixel second for the Viking hood and
2.4 gigahertz band respectively now
that's not super fast but not slow
either the router also had very decent
range and most importantly very stable
Wi-Fi signal basically perform unwise is
very good router however this can be
tricky to make it performed well at
least in the States
that's because even when set to what in
this region the radar still allows for
selecting Wi-Fi channels that is not
allowed in North America on the Faculty
of frequency band for example only
channel 36 40 44 48 149 150 three one
five seven one 61 and 165 I left yet you
have the option to pick any other
channels to such a share of 60 0 100 etc
and here's a kicker the router has the
function of picking the best channel for
you a tool that basically scans and Faiz
the channel that's currently not used by
surrounding routers and access point and
every time you use this tool it will
pick a channel that's not allowed
simply because is available breeze
volleyball because is not allowed in the
first place is frustrating
it's like using a dating service as
always matches you with a nun
just because she's single so calling
this one the smartest Network device is
quite a faff package also the web
interface here is not the most intuitive
ever seen if you're willing to take your
time you can figure things out but if
you are impatient it can be quite a test
of character and for a new user all
these many items here can be intimidated
a good thing is I am neither impatient
nor am i a new user and for that reason
I like this new idea quite a bit and fie
it was the current $90 Freitag's
in the state now for more on this router
here check out my full review at
seton.com
you know it can be a great experience or
a headache depending on who you are why
are you from but not so much on how much
you have your pocket and for that alone
ensure is better than Derek don't ask me
why and that's because I'm down low and
this has been the first look at the a
2004 and as Wi-Fi router from thoroughly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
