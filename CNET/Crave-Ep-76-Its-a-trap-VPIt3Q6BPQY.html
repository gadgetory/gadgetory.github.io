we call Valentine's Day I'm Donald bell
I'm Banita you were experiencing the
lovely the loving the Valentine's
embrace heart the heart robot Harding
yes create a podcast and um yeah yeah
thanks for joining us yeah we have a
lovely and exciting assortment of
stories here today I'm excited I'm
genuinely Imperial welcome Eric's not
here and Eric's not being here right
well I mean if it it removes some of the
/ factor it daddy but i think the the
fact that Valentine's Day throws a
little bit of it back in plus I don't
think it's too soon to give away our
special guests over yeah let's keep in
the perfect girl I look at them dude you
won't be saying that five minutes when
you see what Hannah be here I don't
think hmm if you're lucky yeah your
valentine or yourself acting as your
virtual Valentine bought you this first
item zombie chocolates bonbons zombie
head bonbons now do these actually come
with a rifle casing no siree that's an
optional accessory shotgun shells not
included oh that well I don't want him
this though pretty pretty dope yeah um
and the best way I mean I feel like it'd
be better though if you were the zombie
devouring little human heads to the
actual I'm not gonna read too much into
this but it's still pretty great oh yeah
um i would actually want to devour
zombies but if i were a zombie i would
want to devour little you know right
human heads yeah but i guess if you sold
like little edible bombon shaped like
baby heads I bet was he screwed up fell
as well newsies yeah yeah could you I
bet that's what guar
probably the right they all sit around
have a bat band meeting they have little
baby head just delicious ice cream okay
you're right yeah yeah I wonder what
guardas for Valentine's Day that's a
good question nothing father yeah
something close someone think about uh
what Bonnie was doing last week though I
was very proud and excited to see her
experimenting with a little bit little
bits tell us a little bit about little
bit let me tell you a little bit about
little bits these are basically a set of
circuit boards that you can snap
together they attached via magnet and
you can create whatever you want each
little module has a functioning there's
like an LED a bar graph pressure sensor
and have them over there right here let
me play with animal you talk about okay
well all the power sources and lab but
it cute packaging first of all yes but
this is actually if you make a little
nerdling in your Valentine's Day revelry
mm-hmm this would be something you'd buy
for them yeah kind of meant for like as
like an educational tool for right so
the person who made this wanted um for
people to understand how electronics
work and get them interested in creating
their own devices instead of just
consuming them hence little bits was
born you get like a little little kind
of potentiometer and a little button and
a little LED and connect it all together
you can connect it in different yeah
ways yeah get the idea of how a signal
path work exactly yeah so that starter
kit costing Amazon rain without the
soldering just magnets um so that costs
eighty-nine dollars right there we are
actually giving a kit away on Friday a
reason to read the crave law so check
out our crave giveaway at the end of the
week and then out of this was born my
little robots my god this is so great
watching Bonnie try to make this yeah oh
oh no no water on it maybe the champagne
yeah Boxey oh yeah open his brains oh no
we can't do that for the don't
well that's so sad well as eyes light up
red I guess that that's that score one
for soldering though I don't have to
worry about the magnet shaky yeah
they're not as strong as that would
think so if you had them if you take a
lighter to it then you melt the plastic
you confuse it make a permanent thing
okay well we're not going to take a
lighter to the boxee over there actually
we can't even box oh yeah the bog the
boxing robot names already taken yes a
little cute and mighty robot yeah little
cam no we need your help dear listeners
yeah um send us a name to crave at cnet
com and we might have some prizes for
you well say like the champagne they're
right next to him he could be boozy boot
whose box this box I like that but send
in the names anyway busy um but yeah
boozy and keep on her I know and I was
so inspired by Bonnie's working on the
robot that I fashioned a little crown
for keep on out of my peet's coffee cup
holder nope I'm pretty proud of myself
on that one question what does burger
king crab about iving those years
birthing wasn't it though yeah yeah
alright so they're gonna keep this
company here keep the keep the romance
alive the end of that table um another
thing that you could make for yourself
or a loved one a fellow a fellow nerd
DIY weekend project make your own Star
Wars Admiral Ackbar SAS bar a paper bag
fashioned Admiral Ackbar this is
actually one of the better kind of
little star wars projects I've seen yeah
you could probably in store some shrimp
chips in there and get the the genuine
see alien aroma I always imagined a
black bar smells a little for me but
yeah these are from Bonnie Burton's star
wore a craft book and I believe we're
gonna have a couple more galleries
coming up in the weeks ahead but I'm
barsac bar yeah and then you can Santa
could happen
I guess I prom love it's a trap not a
sentiment you should be sharing this now
maybe tomorrow unless it's to yourself
if they're all rolling you maybe have no
shot bar and you're sad on valentine's
day you're like well just a trap pretty
good alright something I'm not craving
for Valentine's Day as a kind of sexual
as I think it's meant to be it's really
disturbing these was a forty dollar pair
$75 pair of muscle leggings yeah ya know
that somebody no good what she's they
could look a lot worse I'm but I'm her
like someone who would otherwise you
know be very attractive they're actually
pretty repulsive but I bet you'd like
stare if you saw her walking down the
street in those leggings yeah but right
before I barf into my hand um who was
that it was a dr. Peabody or mystery
buddy he was remember this mr. body or
something about yeah but he always
freaked me out yeah yeah that he had the
full hit the full thing and yeah in the
bathroom mr. body in you yeah here is
yes yeah yeah yeah probably organ good
buddy that's no I would do for years
1985 289 yeah so this I guess a little
bit more attractive than that I would
take this over that by oh yeah I would
not wear these are one anybody to wear
these liver oh yeah alright moving on to
actual craveable gadgets this one's
coming to us from as like a preview from
the toy company was it Wow stuff mmm and
it's a video that's quickly gone I don't
wanna say virulence overused but it's
picked up steam on youtube as this like
little spider toy robot prototype
and the guy who is its maker is half of
the videos appeal this guy is so
enthusiastic like oh my god foam darts
and we can show shoot ping pong balls by
attaching these various things you know
you should a ping pong ball this one
this one's really cool because the
longer you hold down the the shoot
button the more charges up in the
farther the ping pong ball shoots so you
could hypothetically line some cups up
in shoot different distances and get it
in all of them or if you're battling
again I can let's just let's do it
really cool well it's like you realize
that this is the this is what happened
like if if you date this back to like
Robin Williams being the toys movie I
asked where he's like the Willy Wonka of
his toy factory this guy is the product
of that you're right putting different
gear on it yeah there's like little
armor then there's armor that goes on
top of the armor that can pop off if you
give it a direct hit with like the ping
pong balls or like little foam dart
dismay it's neat and but when you kind
of take yourself away from his
enthusiasm about it and realize that
yeah it's it's just a toy I mean I got a
pretty cool toy but not as cool as maybe
his fake enthusiasm for it deserves he
come with a robot and you can have you
have two different ones you have a good
guy and a bad guy and they can chase
each other and shoot at each other doing
what the control maybe there's no other
with the same time okay yeah I mean we
make a lot of jokes about the perpetual
adolescence of you know technology and
yeah and hey you know what but Todd that
guy is making them work for me and it
and actually I like I I really do
appreciate those little peeks into like
that job that guy having that job and
clearly he's pretty excited about that
job yeah like I want him to go to like
high schools talk about inspire kids to
like take on their jobs is toy creamy
action
would be high school kids I don't know I
mean he probably shouldn't show up in
that exact take me out of it yeah but uh
this team isn't a tshirt o.o i do i do
kind of want this toy go say that um so
you can see the whole video will have it
in the show notes check it out and
they're doing a naming contest for two
they didn't have a name for this spider
bot so you can submit your it's hard to
name of our name for I know who knew
like booze bot is not boozy yeah um
nether craveable item i'm calling this
like this block of stories the retro
block electro win Locka because converse
is actually releasing in japan a version
of these uh one star low tops with mario
and the the star from mario brothers on
the side you should see them only in
japan apparently hmm yeah I for
undisclosed price at an undisclosed time
but those would be pretty good as a
great I don't know it's only rock the
black bear for sure I don't know I mean
as much as I want them like as a
collector I put them on my shelf yeah if
I had them i would feel kind of pervy
like I would preppy like they're so like
uh no like adolescent like I would feel
like a pederast walking past the school
would be Zhaan you know I never thought
of it that way well as a guy i think was
a little more sensitive to these issues
but yeah cool she was nonetheless circle
i would but i would put them up on a
shelf yeah you could do it too just not
yes i guess not but what i would do is
next one be back to the future hover
board has gotten a lot of traction on
crave and but now they're actually
coming out with a like a well-done prop
replica of the back of the few nights to
prop or a hoverboard
yes so mattel announced at the Toy Fair
this weekend I believe that they're
finally releasing a hoverboard it
doesn't have a regular it glides
quote-unquote glides over most surfaces
how is it doing this like Teflon coated
on the bag figure that out but I have
not gotten the answer um but you know
everything else is there including the
neon colors in the little whore they you
know Michael J Fox Marty McFly ripped
off the handle bar and pool they are
taking pre-orders starting march first
through the 20th and then with expected
ship date of november december 2012 but
they have to receive a minimum number of
pre-orders in order to go to production
because it's a high cost item so the
silly should a Kickstarter this I mean
even hey done that yeah yeah cuz you
could really get it I meant a good
totally yeah and they haven't released
pricing information which I think it's
gonna be pretty high but that's all and
they should do the bundle with the night
you with the next mags yeah yeah hmm and
like some kind of garbage juicer that
can help fuel your car yes I think are
you can buy well I don't know if it's
actually but there's a replica of that
you can buy two yeah yeah I was very
excited about this and they got to watch
clips it back to a future too while
researching yeah ah pretty great oh this
has been a pretty good week then um
let's venture even without Eric maybe we
can do this okay into the world
Oh doom don't talk over the hollow doom
quote it's very important yet we're
getting a lot of xbox 720 rumors flying
around somehow the 360 seems a little
long in the tooth even though they did
the the remix of it and the price
lowering of it and the kinect connecting
of it yeah ah people one xbox 720 and
one of the latest rumors for is that it
will have a touch screen remote I have
mixed feelings on this what what what
are your concerns and hopes the OCD part
of me knows that the xbox controller i
have in my house is probably one of the
is probably ground zero for whatever
kind of Ebola breakout okay right yeah
it's got the the dorito fingers trust
and like just hours of nerd aggression
having been all greased over the
marinating yep on that remote now I you
know marrying that to my other part of
my life which is using touch screen all
day to review tablets right I know that
those things turn into like just a
greasy ugly mess sure when you use them
yeah and putting them together it would
just make this thing look like it would
reveal how truly disgusting these things
really are the best thing going for the
current controllers design is that the
matte black plastic kind of does a good
job hiding the nasty yeah the
touchscreen of doing that but on the
other hand yeah would it be cool to have
a touch screen on your own like I don't
play I don't know I know that the new
Nintendo Wii supposed to have the big
yeah I mean that we usually do I still
don't I still don't see it I feel like
the best thing about a physical
controller is the facts well by the
physical buttons and then you're not
looking at it while you're writing yeah
yes no I mean it could be kind of cool
in a few different instances to be able
to do like targeting on the controller
while you're playing it like I could see
some use case
is of it but mostly I just want my
control sure I'm yeah but maybe I'm old
school that way like I'm i can see your
point there and also it's just gonna
ramp up the price of these night well of
course you know you're gonna need them
for the whole family right and I can't
have your kids fighting over the control
actually yeah can do the targeting I
don't know go be cool but yeah I feel
like wait for that i'm not i'm not
feeling it well the cool thing about the
wii u is like if someone wants to watch
TV then you could just play your
Nintendo on your little touch screen so
maybe they'll or braid that too yeah I
could do like a little mini games or
something on the screen I could see it
yes but it probably will be a hundred
bucks for this thing from one of them
yeah do you play xbox no now a PS triple
haha Oh send a we gotta we do yes I both
uh both respect and feel sad free but I
I can understand it uh the other thing
that pops crossed my radar today is
having been released yesterday the
Abraham Lincoln vampire hunter trailer
which is being staged by Tim Burton
watch Tim and let's not forget while
we're watching this is going to be in 3d
Wow okay all right because that's
something that's one thing to see
vampire hunter Abraham Lincoln chopped
through a tree sure but to know that
those shards are gonna come flying out
what's your face whole other thing
different story let's check it out
and I heard as it were the noise of
thunder
the old was this thing come and see
tell us all and he'll follow
now that is a date movie that is that's
very romantic perfect valentine's day
movie yeah so we have a zombie
chocolates then we got the vampire
hunter Abraham Lincoln I mean a you got
