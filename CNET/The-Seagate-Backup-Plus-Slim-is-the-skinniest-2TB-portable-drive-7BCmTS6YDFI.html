review this backup plus fast drive from
Seagate and I called it fat it turns out
you get like a little schoolgirl took my
work very personally and immediately
inform me of this and you drive right
here the backup plus sleep want to come
back so let's see just how slim it is
now you know that the company takes this
very seriously when the word slim is
printed in red and here is the drive
itself well it's not slimming app to
disappear when tone sideway but it is
quite skinny and considering the
capacity it is very impressive because
as far as I know this is basically the
skinny is 2 terabyte portable drive on
the market now compared with the fast
drive the new sleep drive belt is half
the size and it's also about half the
performance which is to be expected
because thus fast here is a red zero
drive when this one and you want sleep
on here each has a single volume drive
in my testing though it was actually
still very fast offering the sustained
real-world copy of speed up some 120
megabyte per second about the fastest of
the purple drive I've seen now you can
get that's performance only when you use
it with USB 3.0 the dry also works with
USB 2.0 but of course as much lower
performance the drive itself come with
all aluminum casing and it feels very
solid it also very light at about five
point two ounces
like most purple drive it is bus power
meaning it comes with just one USB port
right here and one standard USB cable
and that's all you need to make it work
with a computer out of the box is
formatted for Windows but come with
software to make Mac also work with it
when you can write and read to it you
can also of course reformat it to work
exclusively with just Mac I have you the
symbol dry but the cilium also come in
other colors all of them come included
with the dashboard backup software from
Seagate which is very helpful the
software allows you to backup your
computer your social media content and
also mobile devices they actually vary
how
especially for a Windows user if I'm on
the drive here check out my full review
at calm you know it's a great purple
drive for everyone considering the strip
righteous $120 for two turbine you can
also get the one to buy off 500 gig for
just about $70 or $50 respectively and
of course the sleep desire the bonus
well until you realize that you might
prefer this fat one right here it just
feel really good in the hand you know
master
just get them boss like the way I do it
you know you can't go wrong with well
having everything that's basically how I
live my life because I'm dumb no and it
has been the first look at the backup
plus sleep from CJ</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
