subscribers and a buttes and non primers
I'm Bridget Carey this is your see net
update video game connoisseurs should be
pleased about Amazon's newest prime perk
physical copies of new release video
games are discounted by 20% for prime
numbers which could save you about 12
bucks and it gets you free two-day
shipping the folks at Best Buy can't be
happy because the retailer also cuts 20%
off the price of its new releases the
Prime membership normally cost $100 a
year and with that you get free two-day
shipping along with access to a library
of e-books and music to stream and
there's Prime instant video which is
Amazon's version of Netflix but if you
do not have Amazon Prime and you're
considering signing up now is a good
time to buy in the US because a year
subscription is on sale for 73 dollars
starting Friday why $73 well it's to
celebrate the 73rd annual Golden Globes
because the Amazon Prime video exclusive
show of Mozart in the jungle just won
two Golden Globes one for Best Comedy
Series the sale lasts until Sunday night
it's only for new members but maybe you
can get around that by purchasing a gift
subscription and then emailing it to
yourself and over the weekend you can
also stream the series Mozart in the
jungle for free until midnight on Sunday
even if you do not have Prime the
comedy-drama is about a guy trying to
make it in the classical music scene in
New York it's also available in 4k HDR
if you have something that can show 4k
Ultra HD research group Cohen's survey
2500 us shoppers and reported that about
38% of US households couldn't be
subscribers of Prime but that's not the
only Amazon buzz this week the Amazon
echo could be losing the power cord and
become portable that's according to a
report from The Wall Street Journal
citing anonymous sources the next
version of the echo could be smaller
portable and cheaper the current echo is
a 180 dollar speaker with an
internet-connected assistant named Alexa
that's trapped inside it's similar to
Apple's Siri and it can answer questions
take
and play music that's it for this tech
