excellent photo quality solid
performance and a very nicely designed
body the NX 200 distinguishes itself in
an increasingly crowded field but $900
still seems like a bit too much to ask
for a camera that's not at the front of
its class on all counts thankfully
there's more to the NX 200 than just a
20 megapixel sensor it's much better
than its predecessor it is smaller yet
more comfortable to grip and it's more
solidly built for those unfamiliar with
Samsung's I function system it consists
of a button on the lens which invokes
shooting settings which you can then
change using the manual focus ring the
system works well and it feels much like
you're shooting with the Canon Powershot
s100 or the olympus XC 1 it also
distinguishes the NX cameras from other
interchangeable lens models in a way
that adds to the shooting experience
rather than to transform it if you
choose to go the traditional route the
camera smart panel interactive control
panel interface upper it's much more
like a typical camera it's easy to use
but I found myself missing the type of
customization controls that Panasonic's
cameras offer over the interface as well
as the capability to save custom
settings you can program a raw override
as well as which options appear on the I
function ring but that's just not as
much as I'd like the camera really does
produce excellent photos given its price
tag of less than $1,000 combined with
relatively clean images off the sensor
it's noise profiles very good the color
accuracy looks really good metering and
exposure generally both consistent
inappropriate and the sensor handles
bright saturated colors well as long as
you're willing to put in some work
recovering highlights from a raw file
blown out light colors don't fare quite
as well though there's no detail there
with the right lens the camera delivers
sharp images to the 18 to 55 millimeter
kit lens is typical it's good enough
with respect to sharpness and brightness
to match competitors believes you
craving something better the 85
millimeter f-14 and the stabilized 60
millimeter f28 Prime's produce lovely
images and are sharp bright and
comfortable
use the video and good lights very
consumer friendly it's bright saturated
and sharp and there's a little bit of
more a aliasing and rolling shutter but
it's fine for personal videos doesn't
fare as well at night though there's
just no tonal range to speak of the
camera has full manual exposure controls
during movie recording and there's a
multi motion mode that records and
placed back both faster and slower than
normal the slo-mo mode only works at
reduced frame sizes though its biggest
weakness is its image processing and
when reviewing photos it's pretty good
about displaying JPEGs but if you shoot
raw plus JPEG it gets really bogged down
initial models of the camera had some
auto focus speed and accuracy issues but
just before writing the Samsung released
new firmware that seems to fix the
problems I had during testing it's not
faster and more accurate furthermore
well the oledb display is bright with
good contrast and it doesn't wash out in
sunlight it's very reflective I really
wish it had an articulated or at least
Hill table display aside would have
already mentioned there aren't many
stand out shooting features there's some
novel effects but you can adjust the
parameters and if you use its magic
frame which overlays some huge preset
designs over your shot it reduces the
photos resolution to 2 megapixels with
excellent photo quality a nice shooting
design and interface and solid
performance the MX 200 makes a nice
package but it also means buying into a
lone-wolf lens system without much
third-party support and because image
stabilization is in the lens rather than
the sensor you're subject to Samsung's
whims 4'o is capable lenses so that
combined with a ho-hum feature set makes
the cameras price seem overly high I'm
