about to get a look at the oculus rift
crystal cove prototype here at the show
now oculus rift is a really cool vr
gaming headset rig this year there are
actually improvements to it one is
positional tracking which means that
there are LEDs all around the outside
and a camera for more accurate motion
sensing and there's also better
persistence which means that there's
less motion blur so hopefully you won't
want to vomit when you play too much we
gave a look at two different game demos
that were there one is a tabletop D&amp;amp;D
type game where you can move your head
down and really get into it and the
other one is a game called eval curry
which is a space dog fighting game where
you're moving around and shooting ships
out of the sky the 1080p oled display
looked good but you notice when you
magnify it to that that you can see the
pixels and they know that they're
working on it and the idea eventually is
you could get to a resolution that could
be 12 k because you're really magnifying
across a larger canvas does it feel good
yeah we all tested it and it felt really
immersive and we used an Xbox controller
to play the games and we're able to move
around and look at different parts of
the world and really feel like we were
transported this is still a prototype
and in the future that positional
tracking stuff may not involve a camera
may involve something better and as we
they work towards an actual version that
you could use in your home or who knows
where there will be few of their
developments this is one more step in
oculus rift and the latest one looks a
lot better than it did last year at CES
I'm Scott Steiner not to look at the
oculus rift crystal cove prototype here
at CES 2014
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
