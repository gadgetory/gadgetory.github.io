season two of Netflix's glove is upon us
and we have some very special guests
here to hang out and talk a little bit
about their characters and also what to
expect this season I have got Rebecca
Johnson and cami Gatewood here who plays
on and Stacy and you may not recognize
them because they play sometimes little
old ladies fighting each other that's
what we're more recognizable as you guys
know everything so night we're going out
there like Donna Stacy well we thought
we would play a really fun game since
you guys have known each other for a
long time and your characters in the
show our best friends we thought it
might be fun to do a type of newlywed
game but obviously there's nothing new
or married about either you guys or your
characters so it's really like a
longtime friend yes she's like she's my
work wife I love it let's do it look so
well let's do it a long time marriage
work wife game okay so pick up your
boards even it's our fancy mop put some
glitter on my so the first part of this
we're gonna do is questions about each
other's characters so and when I ask you
a question
one of you guys does now write down
answer the other one's gonna write down
what you think the other person is gonna
say and then you're gonna show them off
so the thing I know about Kimmi she's a
cheater so don't let her cheat Stacy
also a fight dirty okay so let's get
started first question what is Dawn's
favorite color what is that okay okay
I've got my answer right show it off
showed camera
[Laughter]
Wow we're just off to a great start
great start I feel like we can wrap it
up right now this interview is over I
feel this was a success okay we share a
trailer and glow like you know they're
next to each other so we just open the
door and so it's just one bitch yeah so
that we get two toilets yeah it's nice
you got one for one and that's okay next
question if today were the last day
before the end of the world mm-hmm
Howard dawn spend it okay okay okay
ready yeah wow this is really impressive
you guys I figured we'd laugh and joke
about how different it was amazing well
we move into the glue tell we have a
sage and you probably you can probably
hear some of it but not all of it but we
don't so I'm not even going to ask the
next one which is the reverse of whoo
what would you do have lost a we all
know that together all right
last two for last year for your
characters um Kimmy
yeah Kimmy what is one thing that Stacy
does that annoys Dawn the most uh uh oh
boy okay
you're even racing they can support each
other's boards at all so this is legit
just like no best friends I feel like
I'm hearing some friendship from I Love
Lucy playing right now yeah if anybody
wants to make a remake of uh I Love Lucy
we're all in I would have that time so
that's a insta buy for me this is just I
think it's probably just a jerk old brag
[Laughter]
[Laughter]
is better at wrestling but it also
annoys her Rebecca is going to say
something I was like doesn't know how to
use a bong yes because they're not boxy
and I had to teach Kimmy how to use bad
oh that's really nice her banks are
perfect the blue Nogales bow down that's
number one rule okay Rebecca what is the
one bad habit dawn has that Stacy can't
stand
I know it's a tough question all right
this is just twice the last one this one
just blends reality and nerves diction
and poise or cameltoe two answers that
could not be farther apart from each
other but both delightful there's a lot
of nerd play nerds the candy and in
season two okay Rebecca is legitimately
addicted to them so therefore Donna's
you actually love it
one thing I've liked I don't know eating
vegetables yeah I have to restrict
myself to the amount of boxes of
I'm allowed I allow myself onset so only
on Fridays am i allowed to eat nerds
because the first season one I ate like
six boxes a day like if someone went
into my chair not like them anymore
after that I still love them I still
have them they'll be in my car I love
nerds I'm dying for them to just send me
some nerds I will be the nerd spokesman
I'm gonna call mr. nerd they need to
know you got a piggyback data
you got a piggyback on that coal glow s2
hashtag and then I need free nerds for
life there's something I really need to
focus on it's getting more nerds I am
and I'm gonna work really hard in
cameltoe we do we did sync sing a song
called camel toe to the tune of Purple
Rain just a lot of things and glow that
you don't necessarily see coming like I
don't see a large amount of 80's clothes
that just like they do they just make a
beeline for any crevice that you have
yes really
take home tour your body sit down to
make sure it's not is a lot of things we
don't in the 80s must have been just a
very spectacular time in typing and like
yeah answer sizing fantasizing I'm glad
it's back I think you know what okay so
well we'll be done with boards don't
worry about boards I will just do a
quick fire last time few questions about
the season because I want to hear a
little bit about blow season too okay so
real quick what can fans expect from
Stacey and Dawn in season two more
wrestling from Stacey and Dawn and then
you start to take control of our
identities and we make decisions for
ourselves and aren't just given the
identity we make some decisions we get
competitive with one of the gals you
might you'll see the beat down biddies
and then you might see a different side
of the beat down biddies are buns
yeah
we'll say we'll say that there's
definitely a thong in our future yes oh
that sounds exciting
we've been coming for a long time as
we've said as we play a lot of character
so they wanted to utilize us being that
versatile computer characters and gave
us an opportunity to play a little bit
in the ring that's really nice of them
yes all covered up before the trace
uncover those Mamba
let's get him out blowing in the breeze
slap it on the wind just for me
oh the model I don't know why we're
talking about it like this is not my yes
which one of you guys struggle the most
with training Oh me I was I struggled
the most out of everyone in the hook oh
no way but this year there was a vast
improvement with everyone and Rebecca
did a back bump in season 2 which was
hard yeah yeah I worked out a little bit
between season 1 &amp;amp; 2 got one AB so now I
can read on yeah it's harder to wrestle
when you have no muscle time it's a
little easier when you have like tiny
bit that way you have a sear and desire
to wrestle yeah yeah yes and gets you
pretty yeah that's you pretty far okay
uh and that breezy max favorite
wrestling move sunset flip
just a good old-fashioned headlock know
how many metric tons of cocaine doesn't
say de Sam Marc Maron's character in
jest in season 214 you know it let's
average it out and say seven metric tons
good and then the very last question out
for you is what's the one thing that
could break up the beatdown biddies hmm
the beats on Betty's are John and Stacy
the beatdown biddies Donna stays one
single night not sharing the bathroom or
somethin I gotta get
for my nap but for dawn and Stacy the
only thing that could get between us is
death from one of us cuz yeah routered I
might die I'm writing a missing link or
I would say also like the fame machine
could probably start to break up dawn
and Stacy cuz that just it does
interesting things but I know that they
would also find their way back
interesting absolutely nothing I guess I
would rather be torn apart by Fame than
death so yes I said that's super get out
death anybody Netflix producers watching
no deaf Fame money
yeah stardom soon as yard oh no bang
maybe they suddenly get enough money to
get two rooms
oh yeah right them upon my gosh yeah
