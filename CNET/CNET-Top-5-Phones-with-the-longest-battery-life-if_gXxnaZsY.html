we're pretty much any phone you can buy
will give you a day's worth of casual
use before it needs a recharge but still
some of you need more whether you're a
gamer a YouTube fanatic or just someone
who never puts down their phone this
week's top 5 is for you I'm counting
down cnet's list the smart phones with
the longest battery life based on cnet
labs continuous video playback test
sorry Apple fans they're all Android
starting off at number five with 14
hours of continuous video playback the
samsung galaxy s3 mini now I know you
smartphone snobs won't be caught dead
with this thing now that the galaxy s4
is out but the s3 mini is still hailed
is one of the best entry level Android
phones around you get android 4.2 4g LTE
NFC and a good camera and a design that
actually fits in your pocket throw in
the battery life and a price of just one
dollar on contract and we can just stop
this list right here but we won't
because at number four we have the
samsung galaxy expressed with 14 and a
half hours this one gets you a little
closer to the s4 in terms of screen and
specs but you're still compromising to
get that hundred dollar price that said
yes for only tested ten and a half hours
on our video loop so don't think that
paying more automatically translates
into better battery life except when it
comes to number three the galaxy note 3
when the phones as big as your face you
can really fit a lot of battery in there
in this case you get 15 hours of video
playback on a 5.7 inch screen that you
really actually might catch yourself
watching videos on this is a killer
smartphone and only the first one on
this list that any self-respecting phone
geek would even consider being seen with
coming in at number two with a video
loop score of nearly 16 hours the
motorola droid maxx on verizon you don't
put max in your name unless you really
mean business they even crammed an extra
X in there anymore battery and this
would be a pornographic phone maybe
people to start adding vowels like mad
seriously though it's a great fun now
before we get to the number one phone
for battery life let's take a look at
the other side of the spectrum here are
five phones
only out on the market the had
shamefully bad battery life I wish I
could have been in the room when they
were picking the names for the alcatel
evolve evolve you can only go up from
here all right and finally the phone
that scored the best in our cnet Labs
video drain test the LG G flex yes the
curved phone 17 hours and 49 minutes and
that's with a 6 inch screen on top of
that this thing can take 88 pounds of
pressure and is covered in self-healing
paint this is a phone that can stand up
to all day abuse so there you have it 5
android smartphones with incredible
battery life to see what number six
would have been though check out our
roundup over on cnet com and also for
more top 5s from me top 5 cnet com
