the samsung stand in Mobile World
Congress taking a look at the samsung
galaxy young the galaxy young is
Samsung's entry-level galaxy device it
clearly takes some of its design cues
from its bigger brother the s3 it's got
this segment see white all plastic
design with the nice chrome edging and
airs or the the silvered chrome
microphone and speaker ports it's only
3.7 inch device so it fits quite easily
in your hand and will slide into your
pocket perfectly well on the front
you'll see a 3.27 inch display like 480
x 320 pixel resolution now that is far
from some of the high-definition screens
we've been seeing in the past up nine to
12 months and unfortunately it does mean
that a lot of a small text around the
icons doesn't look particularly sharp it
is at least and brighten and has fairly
good colors so it will be at least okay
for a bit of web browsing it's got a 1
gigahertz processor inside which really
isn't going to give masses of power so
don't expect lightning performance
hopefully though it should handle the
essentials of facebook and angry birds
fairly well though it's running on
android 4.1 point to a jelly bean now it
isn't that much different from any of
you other software that Samsung uses so
if you've already used samsung phone
before then there won't be much of a
learning curve there's been no word yet
on pricing but given that the low specs
we are expecting a very reasonable price
it should be available sometime in the
second quarter of this year I'm Andrew
Horrell for cnet and this is a samsung
galaxy young</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
