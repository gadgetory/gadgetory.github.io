is to get cinematic looking footage when
you fly but learning to fly and shooting
at the same time can be hard that's
where the 3dr solo comes in it's a
regular looking drone but has a couple
of cool features when you're flying it
you can do things like selfie mode
follow mode or even orbit around a
particular structure so in a satellite
view here on the app you can select a
structure you want it to orbit around
and simply start the process it will
automatically film it for you there's an
also another option called cable cab
this is where you can set multiple
different keyframes during the flight
and select each particular one that you
want and then all you need to do is
simply choose a start and the end point
and anything in between start the join
flying and it will automatically make a
pretty cool little film of that
particular flight just like you've got a
cable camera doing all the work for you
also the controller itself is pretty
simple to use there's a couple of
different buttons like a and B but it's
like kind of like you find on a video
game controller that's kind of what they
based it around you have pitch in your
control of course as well as a fly
button which you simply need to press
and hold to start takeoff and a return
to home button there is also a pause
button so you if there's something going
on during your flight you need to pay
attention somewhere else you can simply
press pause and the drone will start
hovering mid-flight so you don't need to
worry about it the 3dr solo is
compatible with a gimbal that is
available for gopro mounts and it is 999
dollars however the gimbal and the GoPro
cost extra if you want to find out more
