this is the HTC first what's interesting
about this phone is that it is the first
phone to feature Facebook's Facebook
home experience for Android already
built in I share many more details about
Facebook home in a separate video but
what you need to know right now is that
it takes over your home screens and it
shows you a slideshow of all of the
Facebook images that you have in your
newsfeed also status updates Facebook
calls this the cover feed and from here
you're able to like and comment on
status updates and photos from your
friends since this is still an Android
phone you still have access to
everything including Google now your
recent list the lockscreen
and all of your apps HTC phones usually
come with HTC Sense as the overlay since
this one comes with Facebook home if you
want to remove it what you're left with
is stock Android so this could be a good
choice for somebody who's looking for a
stock Android phone at an affordable
price
as for the specs themselves the HTC
first has a 4.3 inch HD display and runs
Android 4.1 jelly bean there are three
capacitive touch buttons at the bottom
of the screen that deal with navigation
therefore back home and menu there's a
lot you can do with this central home
button you can call up the launcher you
can raise Google now and you can also
show your list of recent apps
unlike most HTC phones this one is very
simple it doesn't have a lot of special
accents or any kind of crafting in terms
of the chassis you see that it is
completely sealed there is a SIM card
slot but there's no micro SD card slot
and you also cannot remove the battery
the phone does come with 16 gigabytes of
internal storage though if you think
you're gonna need more than that this
might not be the right phone the first
is in robes in this soft touch finish
that does make it comfortable to hold
again though it's not very exciting to
look at phone does come in other colors
black white a light blue and red there's
a five megapixel camera on the back with
LED flash the camera quality is
good 4 5 megapixels the greens were a
little bit overblown photos definitely
looked a lot better when shot outside
than inside and artificial lighting
you're not gonna get as much detail as
you would with today's top eight
megapixel and 13 megapixel cameras but I
think that it does a very adequate job
the camera does capture 1080p HD video
and the phone plays back 720p HD video
there's a 1.6 megapixel camera on the
front inside the first is run by a 1.4
gigahertz dual-core Qualcomm processor
the HTC first costs $99 on AT&amp;amp;T with a
new two-year service agreement Facebook
home is a very specialized experience I
would definitely recommend it for people
who are self-proclaimed Facebook addicts
conversely you might also be interested
in this phone if you're the exact
opposite if you're looking for a stock
Android phone at a good price and you
might consider the first however
Facebook home will be available on other
handsets including the HTC One One X 1 X
plus the samsung galaxy a3 samsung
galaxy s4 and samsung galaxy note 2
including phones in the future so if you
are looking for facebook home you have
other options
this is Jessica tall court for CNN this
has been your first look at the HTC
first you can read my full review at
Facebook home and the HTC first unseen
