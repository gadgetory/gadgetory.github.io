Windows 8 tablet in October speaking of
October is that when we're going to see
windows 8 at all is mog off the auction
block and into the arms of HTC and beets
and our gamers going to be able to
change the ending of mass effect 3 all
that and more on today's rumor has it
brianna now it's Tuesday March twentieth
2012 and welcome to rumor has it I'm
Kareem levy and I'm Emily Dreyfuss and
you are watching the Internet's techie
astounding show where every day or every
week we round up the hottest rumors and
then we bet on them gameshow style that
was that that's it that's all we know
you're watching so speaking of let's cut
to the rumor has it game board real fast
you'll see that emily is oh yeah I have
seven points you can't see it a try to
look at ease I don't I do a seven like
my parents taught me no no me that's how
I do it oh good that the European Way um
so the reason why I got another point is
because but I'm still losing mind you
don't get too worked up is way back in
episode three a hundred years ago we
voted on whether the Xbox would be
announced at e3 and uh just the other
day just recently we had a story that
microsoft said don't expect a new Xbox
anytime soon they will not be announcing
it at e3 and that was the episode where
Sharon Vaknin filled in for Emily so and
she voted that it will be announced at
e3 and I said no and the moral of that
story is neither of us can ever go on
vacation ever again because whoever
replaces I was literally in Chile and I
like I got a cold shiver in the in the
Andes because I like knew that something
had gone terribly wrong well I'm so cold
and I mean I guess that honestly like I
really should have done a little bit of
due diligence and informed Sharon that I
had already voted in a previous episode
that we were not going to see the Xbox
until 2014
and then we voted there was another
rumor and she contradicted my earlier
but I don't even remember that 2014 was
that yeah that was like um episode 1
which we have like I have not we never
kept when we first started the show we
like wrote it down on post-it notes
barely any idea what happened in the
beginning so I for a while I felt like
should I even have to take this lost
point because I didn't bet it and my
real heart said the other way but know
that those are the rules of game I had a
substitute the substitute failed me yeah
I mean I don't know why she did what she
did fail you but I don't think it was uh
I don't think it was a bad though
because why not there's not anything can
any other thing is that Sharon maybe
you'll be right maybe we'll be proved
wrong and maybe Microsoft's definition
of soon is not what we think and we will
see it before well they said III yeah
well that they're not gonna release
today okay mine sorry I mean no I but I
mean to her credit Sharon is a gamer she
plays video games and you know so maybe
you know maybe she was bringing her own
personal bias to it because since I
don't care about video games i'm like
yeah 2014 whatever yeah more affect my
life at all really well and then in a
later episode i voted that it's going to
come out in 2013 I mean with this xbox
rumor it was like the iPad rumor or the
Kindle Fire rumor weed in the samsung s3
the whatever the Nexus that one that we
keep voting on every galaxy s3 yeah that
whatever yeah we were like vote yes no
we don't know why don't we look don't
know it'll have that and so now we've
just like put the kibosh yeah the kibosh
on any possibility to get any votes yeah
because we've already voted on
everything having to do with that phone
I don't want to talk about it and we're
not going to so we probably will one day
ok so let us let us continue please yes
proceed um the first rumour guys that I
have for you I have two windows 8
related rumors today give a round of
applause Microsoft it's not oh so the
first rumor is that Lenovo not Dell will
launch the first Windows 8 tablet in
October a report
says so citing unidentified sources you
guessed it usual I just had to drink
sorry about that pause I was taking syd
because this is a drinking game if
you've forgotten and any time we say
unidentified sources you need to be
imbibing whatever liquid is nearby that
is potable uh-huh so citing unidentified
sources the verge reported yesterday
that Lenovo will be the first company to
launch a Windows 8 tablet there
unidentified sources that they don't
even give us any inkling or even order
from where they live probably one deja
to who they could be the dude at the
window at kentucky fried chicken who
knows but according to that dude at
kentucky fried chicken lenovo will get
it but ahead of dell and ahead of HP who
have both also gone on the record and
said that they're going to have windows
8 tablets for sure now this the the guy
at Kentucky Fried Chicken i'm using
quote marks here Colonel Sanders Colonel
Sanders also told The Verge that the
device will come with an intel chip
which makes a lot of sense and so this
contradicts what the dell CEO michael
dell oh um went as far as to tell
Bloomberg which was that his company was
going to launch a windows tablet the
same day as Windows 8 she'll be there
their launch pad there does a call
they're like main the thing the word for
when flagship flashing launch pad
landing in my yeah that'll be their flag
mean not as how they'll announce the
windows 8 will be with with with a dell
with a dolt who is what Del was saying
but then this is saying that actually
lenovo will be the first one so i don't
know if perhaps maybe the lenovo tablet
will come out a little bit sooner and
then on the day that Windows 8 is
available will get the dell I'm not sure
or maybe they don't know or maybe
they're fighting or maybe this report is
wrong or I'm not sure but there's
speculation that if this report is
correct and Lenovo is going to be the
one with the first Windows 8 tablet
people have speculated that this could
be the ideapad
yeah do you guys remember that from
firstly yes yeah the worst name ever
they might as well called it the pretzel
the downward facing dog the warrior 1
hate yoga I just take yoga class the
other day yeah do it it Stephen can you
name any other moves um duh sunshine
pose that's that's I think that's one
yeah greeting pose right yeah greeting
and child's pose a child's pose I know
yeah one's pretty really I like Pilates
yoga is just too woo woo for me sorry I
know it's really good for you I just
can't okay I mean it doesn't have to be
whoo whoo but I know maybe my experience
with it has been very whoo-whoo and I'm
just I can't anyway so this thing called
the ideapad yoga and the reason why it
has this insufferable title is that it's
actually kind of a neat concept and it
is sort of exemplified by yoga which is
all about bending and stretching there
it is right there you can see if you're
listening to the podcast right and you
can see we're looking at it's basically
like a pc that is open halfway and
propped up on its on both sides so it's
forming almost like a V or an a-line a
frame a frame rate um and what it has
its own eat is a hinge that allows the
screen to fold all the way back on
itself so that it can be used at in
tablet mode they call it and that would
be if it was flattened all the way
completely and the keyboard and the
screen are right up against each other
you could hold it like it's a tablet or
you can flip it all the way around and
use it in normal laptop mode or you it's
a great idea I mean it's a great idea
you know then you don't need to buy a
separate keyboard like like a bluetooth
keyboard that people are doing for their
tablets or whatever it's already there
it's already there very convenient hin
and I mean I would take issue with the
people who are saying that this would be
the first Windows 8 tablet because in my
estimation that is a laptop that funk
has the ability to be used like a tablet
but it's not a tablet right because a
tablet by definition does not have a key
exactly just the screen examiner
keyboards yes so this is a lap
that has a tablet first screen and
according to lenovo a really really high
quality hinge that won't break because
these type of convertible things are
always a little bit problematic because
the hinge if it breaks and you get your
keyboard on a screen exactly and and
often you know something that is a
movable piece like that it's easy to
break so the big problem the big
question is how good is this hinge
lenovo says it's great right well and
also look I mean it looks heavy but it
has to be light like yeah you know
follow the movement of tablet it has to
be light it has to be you know portable
and whatever yeah and this this keyboard
should not get in the way of all those
other thing at all and and I mean
obviously because of the keyboard it
will be heavier than any other tablet
right but it might be a good trade-off
for people who are you know I mean
honestly I might be one of the people
who would want this because as a writer
I constantly need a keyboard and I don't
use my iPad at all for any work-related
tasks and I would never take it with me
like on a trip by myself just take the
iPad because I need to write and I'm not
gonna write on let's have you considered
a bluetooth keyboard I have kind of
pricey but like 60 well yeah and I
already have a little tiny windows
computer that if I'm gonna go that far
yeah it's basically a netbook I might as
well just use that so I I kind of but if
I were to get my next computer and if
this had a really strong processor and
core i5 and things like that like I want
it yeah um so that that's interesting
we'll see now this brings us to our next
rumor because this rumor drive all
related very very well with the next
rumor which is that windows 8 will
reportedly be released in october so
that is what this rumor we've been
reading was saying was that the first
windows 8 tablet will come out in
october from lenovo now bloomberg is
reporting that yes in fact windows 8
will have an october debut our news
editor Jay Greene who has the Microsoft
beat reported that this means it would
be done in the summer they'd send it out
to manufacturers in the summer and then
they can get it onto their devices and
do all of that and create
for it and software and data which
they've already been doing because
developer previews have been out there
and then we will get it in October and
then they will have versions of it that
are running on an ARM chip architecture
and then also some that are running on
x86 chips and that is I don't know why
Bloomberg even really needed to say that
because it's completely obvious because
ARM chips are what go into tablets
because they're lighter and faster and
86 x86 chips are what go into
traditional PCs and we know Windows 8 is
putting a huge emphasis on mobile and go
every so obviously they're going to have
tablets I guess what's interesting about
this rumor that Bloomberg also is citing
anonymous sources to bring us drink is
that it will not have more than it will
not launch on more than five arm system
chip architecture devices and so what
that basically means is there will not
be more than five tablets said it will
launch it will launch so if we you know
we say this del uh-huh the lenovo HP HP
and um nokia right no don't forget about
Yankees force what would be the only the
fin the iPad just get on the Apple
apples like we want in on this game um
and then people were saying Jay Greene
wrote having fewer than five devices
though would all for consumers only
slight alternatives to apples hugely
popular iPad and I disagree with Jay
because I think it's better to focus on
fewer and make them great there you go a
hundred windows 8 tablets out there and
have one of them be the my czar touch
from it which is kind of what you know
what what the Android exactly Android
and now it's so fragmented that people
are like now it's all about the price
and we and I mean if there are fewer to
competing with each other fewer Windows
tablets compete at each other not to
mention competing with Android not to
mention competing with the iPad yeah
then they can focus on price on how
great it is they can each have a you
know a little bit something different
and people won't get confused and can be
like i have the dell yeah Pete whatever
and instead of sams on making 14
different tablets every single
is tablet running windows 8 and make it
great right and make it hit the price
point that you want it to be a hit the
you know screen size yeah battery life
like and by having only one so each you
know company is focusing on one rather
than 14 then they can do all that and
then people won't be as disappointed as
they are with like every single Samsung
and also I think it sends a good message
to consumers like if you are HP and you
only make one windows 8 tablet and it's
great and you put a lot of work into it
what that says to me is that you've
committed to the choices you made about
this tablet because you believe they're
the right choices you believe the screen
size is correct do you believe the
resolution is awesome and all of that
whereas when you give me 17 different
ones I feel like it means you the
manufacturer are wavering and you're
like I don't really know exactly which
one of these is gonna work best I'm just
gonna like throw them all out there and
hope that one of them strikes your fancy
right and I don't feel like I'm in good
hands right and I mean to you know to
play devil's advocate they're probably
saying look we listen to consumers we
want to give you a seven inch a 5-inch a
10-inch a 20-inch yeah you know 14 and
like just give them everything I totally
Tennessee where do so it's competing
with itself and I think it's also just
poor planning because a tablet is an
unnecessary object no matter how many
times a polite commercials tell you that
you're not going to be able to learn a
new language or lion love liver if you
don't have an iPad that's not true like
you don't need an iPad ever you don't
need a tablet I mean you it can be
additive for your life and bring value
but it is not necessary great it's not
food no sleep for I feel like the tablet
manufacturers who make like a million
different options are saying like this
one is gonna be we're gonna work for
this one and this one will fit your
needs in this way this wasn't this one
I'll did it it uh but really you don't
need any of them so it would be better
is if they just said this is the one
that is like one size fits all awesome
for everyone right exactly it's running
a great OS yeah it has a great battery
life just you know just as we were
saying like totally yeah I know that
that's best for consumers but it's
definitely best for manufacturers that's
my advice I guess why am I on the side
of the man in
argument I don't know but under the one
percent yeah I'm pretending to be the
one present but I just think it's that
was what I would advise lenovo HP no no
yeah pour nokia they're like 10 windows
8 is ours oopsies if it's like they
caught windows 8 kissing someone else
behind the schoolyard totally and
Windows 8 is like what we're not married
yeah exactly I never gave you my promise
ring nokia or something good anyway
that's our windows 8 moment for today
yeah I think with that we should take a
break yeah I let's take a mini break and
we'll see you on the other side
oh my god
and we're back thank you for rejoining
us after that quick break for the people
watching live that was the song what is
love played on a floppy disk drive and
that was like that you know and that
damned knocking their heads from Saturn
alive yeah but and then that movie the
night yeah I refuse the rocks night at
the Roxbury I'm all night One Night at
the Apollo that's not right um so anyway
let us continue with our rumors has it
till we will because this is called
rumor has it it's a game show oh it's
not the show where we just watch her a
new videos all the time I mean it could
be that would be a completely different
channel so for was a rumor the title of
it is mog the music company mog is
rumored to have been sold to HTC beats
if you want to say that another way HTC
beats has bought button no bot you got
it as button ma no um and I mean to even
be a little bit clearer beats according
to this rumor has botton mog not HTC so
cute like I know I love I'm a copy
editor I say button that's already been
button according to a single source
that's what is rumors hilarious
according to one guy dug up by business
in wow Business Insider my favorite Wow
in HTC's beats the audio tech company
has purchased mog Giga ohm said it
confirmed it by with maybe one other
person said it but I don't believe them
ever so mod didn't respond to requests
for comment but told Business Insider
we're always looking for the best
opportunity for our business and
shareholders but don't comment on
specific of those specifics of those
conversations nothing to confirm at this
time so it is still a rumor as of
tonight hm mog is a subscription-based
music company kind of like Spotify or
Rdio or Rhapsody or whatever the main
difference between it and the other big
guys is that it's not a big guy at all
and it doesn't have as many subscribers
as those other
a subscription-based music companies do
it doesn't have as many songs but it
does have the highest quality to
basically not as good a time right it is
the highest quality at 320 kilobits per
second which is really high quality
audio the reason I know that is because
one time i wrote a an article for Cena
which is which music service should you
use and i got 128 comments on it all
saying that i should have added zune
everybody was so me soon the big deal we
get that weekend a lot of people
emailing us on buzz out loud about zune
pass yeah and it's a great you know and
and I said fine you're right I should
have included it so I included it anyway
that's how I learned about mall you
listened and responded I see the people
I really wanted to make everybody happy
I today so this follows rumors from a
couple weeks ago that the service was on
the auction block so we had reported in
couple weeks ago that mog was for sale
was putting itself up for sale they
didn't confirm that either on this also
follows rumors from before Mobile World
Congress that beats an HTC were
launching their own music service which
yeah we did talk about that in the show
right in which tip but that never panned
out but why create your own music
service when you could just buy one yeah
then ally for HTC according to this
rumor they didn't even have to buy it
themselves they let it let beats by it
and you know they own 51 percent stake
in beat so it's basically the perfect
but it's just you know that division so
let beats handle the music thing and
whatever when they've got a bunch of
extra money lying around from how much
they charge for those headphones I know
there that's it but they're awesome and
they work really well totally except for
that they make it seem like it is okay
to charge four hundred dollars for the
cheapest version of I know maybe it's
300 maybe it's 200 either way it's
insane yeah oh I think it's 300 i think
the cheapest one is 299 i went to buy it
for my brother as a president best buy
and i honestly have never felt like more
of a popper because i had promised him
this gift and we go there and then i see
the price and i was like nope sorry i
can't there's no way you're gonna have
to choose the $49 ones
I don't carry and they're made by sony
yeah and there's like probably actually
I've never heard the company they're
made by you're getting them um so anyway
so mog already has mobile apps in place
for its services up for android android
and iOS and blackberry app is on the way
a blackberry app is on the way though if
HTC is involved it would probably have
to make a Windows app right because HTC
has windows phones and yes that's where
this rumor starts to lose steam because
mog has recently given a thumbs down to
a Windows app because they didn't have
the resources to make one interest oh
well but maybe now they will right so
yeah be now they will I mean HTC has
other it has android and whatever and
they have everything but windows I think
isn't you know next on the horizon for
that hmm what I realize this rumor
actually does hold water is that when
HTC shacked up with beats it did so
because it wanted to be different from
the you know other companies they wanted
to lay focus on music or focus i think
they also bought open app i think it's
called which was like your it was
something that you can like its
developer your talk to your that it was
like an app that you can like see your
computer on your whatever okay on your
phone and you find everything i think so
and so but it but you know but now that
they've purchased beats or have you know
become a big stake holder and beats
their focuses on music right and so now
HTC phones are going to be the ones you
go to if you're a music lover because
not only do they have the you know beats
audio but now if they have a music
subscription service built-in kind of
how Cricket Wireless has move music you
know then then maybe you'll get like a
great subscription fee or something or
two months free of mog or whatever like
if you buy their phones so maybe it's
like if you are not in the iTunes
universe but you're someone who really
cares about music and you're looking for
a great music phone right dad to the
iphone you should go for HTC's a new
phone right but the difference between
mog and iTunes is that mug is a
subscription service so you have all
music in the world on their servers you
don't have to buy it you just might on
Philippe aunt plan and with itunes you
have to you know purchase the songs
uploaded yourself I think some people
who are so like stuck in the iTunes
world wouldn't even consider trying a
subscription service because they're so
unless it was available on iTunes or on
the iPhone because they're so they need
itunes right to manage to manage their
music I see and I think mog mog does
have music management side to it i'm not
sure if it's available through the app
itself but you know you can manage music
an HTC probably has its own music
management in there like I think my
phone which is HTC has some music
management software in there and I just
don't ever use it because it doesn't
have enough room to hold any right well
and I have Rhapsody on my phone and i
love it i use it all the time you know i
think i'm actually mistaken i don't
think mot let me let me read my article
that i wrote about this thing I don't
think let's see I said who should if
you're who shouldn't use mog there's no
way to manage the music you own that's
not in its catalog okay so you can't
manage your own music through mog so
that maybe that'd be something that they
change or you use HTC's like internal
yeah gram to manage your own music in
any case here's another reason why I
think that this rumor holds true is
because if HTC is going in this
direction and beats and they want to
have a music subscription service mog
doesn't have as many subscribers as the
other guys so it's price is probably
going to be cheaper like even if HTC and
beats wanted to buy Spotify it's it'll
probably be astronomical like they'll
never be able to afford it you know
Rhapsody bought Napster so Napster
doesn't exist anymore by itself Rhapsody
has a million subscribers it's probably
too expensive so only ones left really
are our do and mog and since mog has the
better audio quality and I don't think
our do wants to sell i think that they
believe that they can still get better
and better and better and compete and
take over right and if mog was already
you know maybe on the chopping block is
me you know it's not really confirmed
but they confirmed it to see you know
who knows why wouldn't they sell it to
beats go for it sounds good sounds good
to me so that was that now let us
continue to my favorite rumor that might
not be so excited great like I can't
wait till I get to talk about this room
well it's not even rumor necessarily
it's just like this thing that's been
going hot then they just talked
on the UM I need to use my headphones as
a headband I just talked about on the 40
40 40 for earlier somebody called about
it but bioware maybe is considering
changing the ending of mass effect 3
which I mean which is a little bit not
quite what Bioware said boo is that the
mass effect 3 3 trailer this game looks
so awesome and I know I would love to
play it I so once upon a time there was
a hit blockbuster amazing humongous game
came out had some back it's called mass
effect in eight who had to have
conversations with others you had to
make relationships with others you had
to shoot others and then the end you had
to save the galaxy what did not that you
have to do so cut to Mass Effect 3 which
just launched on march six sold almost
nine hundred thousand copies in 24 hours
OMG then you know everybody played it
for 24 hours straight so by March
seventh everybody was pissed because
they got to the ending and it was
horrible according to them they hated
the ending we won't give any spoilers
guys so but they hated and one fan is
reportedly so mad that he filed a false
advertising complaint with the FTC
awesome i love it how people in america
really believe false advertising is a
thing yes not it's really not you could
say anything you might so regarding the
end to Mass Effect 3 the executive
producer of the game Casey Hudson said
last week that he wanted the game to be
memorable admitting that the conclusion
was intentionally designed to get gamers
talking Bioware says it's actively and
seriously taking all feedback into
consideration with no decision made yet
regarding into space bound role-playing
game so this might not even be end it
might be the end it's probably the end
of this person's story but Shepherd
shepherd but there might be other mass
effect games that you know trap whatever
go into a new version so Oh someone in
the chat room is just like The Sopranos
I totally so so I I don't want to give
any spoilers for people who still want
to play the game i talked with eric
franklin yesterday he's a huge fan he's
like i have not been reading very much
about it because i don't want to spoil
it he's in the middle of playing it but
um I can't wait for him to get to the
end I know and freak out well and then
but so really quick though members of
the mass effect community have formed
this charity petition petition called
retake mass effect chip in fun where
they're collecting the paypal donations
for a charity as a way of encouraging
Bioware to make an alternate ending and
the fun has amassed almost seventy
thousand dollars is an money gonna then
go to bio energy cherry to the charity
just to get their attention that they're
like getting whatever and then it says
in quote so we would like to dispel the
perception that we are angry or entitled
we simply wish to express our hope that
there could be a different direction for
a series we have all grown to love so
that's how they're trying to get by our
attention by raising money for this
charity and they're not entitled they
just really hope that you won't crush
there's just us so eric is like you know
when i talked with him about it because
I was like you know tell me about this
game whatever he was like I just can't
he's like even if I hate the ending then
I just hate the ending like whatever
it's already out there you can't change
it it's just out there I mean there is
something deflating and is kind of like
The Sopranos about investing all this
time in something and then it doesn't
end the way you want and it's over and
you're left with this like feeling of
just lost yeah and you spent you know
years of your life playing this game
you've invested money and time in three
Mass Effect games you know is that you
could have been talking to your girl
hours that you could have been playing
Assassin's Creed right there yet there
you know you miss off um so you know
again I don't want to spoil it but I
read spoilers because I'm that guy who
does that I always do that I always read
the spoilers for everything and then I'm
like why did I do that so I read the
spoilers I read a spoiler and because i
haven't played the game it only made so
so sense because it went like super into
depth about all the plot holes but
apparently there are plot holes and it's
anti-climactic that's all i'll say so
people are mad obviously because you
know such a huge
a game that they've invested so much
time in his anti-climactic in the whole
game is you know climax not to be gross
filet kit but yeah you're saving the
universe but you know what I actually
think that happens with a lot of these
like grand concept entertainment things
does anyone remember lost do you
remember how all of that was like this
grand tease that needed to lead to some
huge enormous thing and then you were
kind of like oh yeah that was the end
but like I bet I mean can you imagine
writing to the lost writers and being
like a zillion people exactly and so the
thing about this Bioware is not saying
we are going to change anything they're
just like we're listening doesn't which
doesn't really mean anything we were
gonna like we were talking yesterday
about what would really in all
seriousness the likelihood be of them
changing the ending and I think we both
agree that it's pretty slim because of
how much money and time and effort would
go into creating a new ending that they
would send out to people like come on
millions of dollars where George Lucas
did it to Star Wars hey what are you
doing here totally I knew and then he
was like I didn't change it that was
always like that um and James Cameron
did it too Titanic what oh my god are
you timing as a version of hytanica news
leonardo dicaprio just not yeah I don't
like I really so what ha I really hated
when the Titanic sank so i'm going to
write a letter to james cameron and be
like please when you release titanic 3d
I'm really mad I'm gonna give money to
charity and please don't make it end
that way change the ending because I
said so and so did all my buddies I mean
they do that like actually Americans are
notorious for not being able to handle
hard endings do you guys know about the
book the Clockwork Orange yes i love the
pin in britain when it came out and I
think it's written by Burgess it has an
ending in which that everything is
terrible and it's a tragedy because it's
a violent horrifying tragedy and then
they went to do it in America and they
were like nope we need a happier ending
so there is a different ending you're
the American version that like wraps it
up and there's a little bit of that now
years later where we still think we can
do that and write letters
a company that they're like we already
put this game you like deal with it
edger yeah exactly we said this is I
mean and I get it like it's a bad ending
or whatever people don't like the ending
but like that's the ending that Bioware
went with and if you don't like it then
you just don't like it like you can't
make them change it I mean you can and
they'll probably offer a downloadable re
ending you have to pay 25 bucks for it
and then it's like oh I guess who came
out the winner Bioware because they just
made a million more dollars on you know
a DLC of a new ending so keep keep it up
keep it up America yeah spend your money
unnecessarily yeah buy an ipad that you
don't need by a DLC because you didn't
like the ending of this game so I don't
know so why I love us no I love us go
getters I but but why the you know the
headlines that are in the media right
now we're a little bit misleading is
that Bioware never said that they're
going to change it there just like we're
listening we here yet we see we're
leaving it open so that you know which
is good I mean it's better than saying
whiny little babies of course we're not
going to change it yeah just what they
could have said yeah exactly so they're
listening as they should I mean they're
making this game for the people and the
people are revolting not to be confused
with revolting anyway that wraps up that
rumor BAM should we go on to yeas or
neighs yay or nay if this we're on you
know 19th century England on someone
were playing that harpsichord one of us

yeah we stopped taking sucker bets we
decided yeah yeah from our guns yeah so
um now we have a couple three voicemails
West you know we had heard them yet we
had left ourselves just enough time for
these three rumors effect I mean
voicemails the first one is from Jeff in
Las Vegas who is calling from the ipad
line hi rumor has it this is Jeff from
Las Vegas also known as flaming printer
on the chat room oh I'm calling from the
apple's new ipad wine in las vegas
and it's pretty welcome but that's up
there and I'm going to get the new iPad
and I wanted to call and tell you guys I
really love the show and unlike what
someone said earlier I'm glad steven is
starting to talk talk more on the show
said it being like Steven makes it feel
like you all are good friends so Craig
it up to about thank you just from being
in a line and I hope you love your new I
don't let us know call us and let us
know what you think of your iPad is it
too hot i'm hearing about a thing to its
flaming printer from yeah man there oh
yeah hey flaming Brenneman printer so
somebody said that they don't like
Steven talking I will find that person
and flappers minute love I don't know I
that's what Jeff yeah what's wrong we do
yoga head contrary to what people are
saying I like that Steven ok let us move
on to our second voicemail of the week
okay this one is from steve from
Maryland and he's teaching us how to bet
properly which we need a lot of help
right girl deeva Maryland blood the
shelf this whole make reference to be a
cute Instagram that um you're not really
having effect if on the second set I bet
the same thing he has its color what you
have to do is that the opposite to
double or nothings really good thing
anybody knew is that what you'd be
losing quite much but if you guys got
the same thing still be up on us if you
lose the bet so it really had did that
that much at least he loves the show
thank you I just want to say I think his
name was Steve yes Steven Maryland if
you ever want to come to San Francisco
and come on the show and give me a
lesson in how to gamble I would
absolutely one hundred appreciate it
because I am like honestly I came up
with the idea for the show a tebya
gambling Joe and that was one of the
dumbest things I've ever done because I
don't know how to gamble I've never won
money ever while gambling I have lost
every amount of money that anyone has
ever let me gamble and I just
fundamentally don't understand it like
I've always wanted us to double down and
go for not right but we could hide like
oh so yeah when we were first like
talking about the show or like yeah
we'll do double downs that day and then
were like yeah well how would we go down
would that mean so if somebody wanted to
take it upon themselves to come up with
some sort of rubric for us if it wants
to be if you want to do it Steve that
would be radical um and we'll do it at
totally because this show is a work in
progress we're always looking to always
evolving be exactly to be a better and
bigger yes we are growing we're growing
grow with um i dunno to always double
down on 11 as Sparkman in the chat room
said I know how to play blackjack I
don't know how to bet on this show i
watch you win oh yeah oh yeah yeah yes I
was like Vegas maureen win yeah i won
like three hundred bucks I have to say
I've never felt more poor in my life I
said that I said that the first time
today when i was in bestbuy by my
brother headphones but no watching you
guys gamble when I had no money in the
bank and couldn't even get anything out
of ATM was one of the low points in my
life have to say VES is such an awesome
so we have one more voicemail to listen
to yeah and this one is related to one
of our stories we did today and it's
about windows 8 tablets I don't know who
it's from sorry so when talking about
tablet ecosystem wouldn't windows 8 like
be the king over at all if it went and
actually does come out because windows
can do itunes and it can also do the
amazon prime thing from for both those
systems and that's all I was wondering
is is wouldn't windows if a tablet does
come out beat the king of contents is it
can all be consistent can do the iTunes
it can do amazon and plus its own xbox
live content that is being hyped up a
lot as well that's my question thank you
very much um yeah I think he's right I
think it would have you know
it would be able to do content from
everywhere plus its own you know xbox
live content I think the thing when
people think of tablets so they think of
apps and I think you know windows
doesn't have as many apps as the other
guys do now and so native apps you know
or or apps the way the app market is are
like you know windows 8 this isn't
necessarily true i'm not sure but like
they don't have instagram or they don't
have I mean I they don't have it they
don't have a kindle app yet let's say
and so it's not it doesn't have as many
apps as the other guys so yes even
though the ipad is tied to its itunes
you know or it doesn't have it let's say
a pandora app or whatever so yes they
can get content they can get amazon
prime content in itunes content or
whatever man they can't but they don't
have as many far-reaching apps as the
other ones do yes yes the is that they
may soon and with I mean the developers
have had it it's coming out people are
Microsoft's putting such a huge push
behind it that especially to get those
like 8 apps that you just named that are
the kind of cornerstones like an Alex
let's say I mean I'm not sure what yeah
so I think that it wouldn't be that
difficult to get them and then in that
case yeah and also you know windows just
has a reputation for being a lot more
open to all sorts of software and like
one of the reasons why you can't get
amazon prime content on the ipad is
because apple doesn't want to let Amazon
have a piece of its pie you know right
it's because they do allow the kindle
app on the idea any good by stuffed as
well I've never said they want
hypocrites no but so I think the windows
would be a lot more likely to let that
be on there and that would be awesome
yeah well totally and I think I mean
again that's I think just I think it
could it does have the potential to be
the one tablet to rule them all of
course because it is open it has the
potential to have netflix hulu whatever
whatever all these native apps I mean
unless they unless the other tablet
makers have like you know exclusivity
rights to Netflix which I don't think
they do so i think i think netflix is
like will give it to you for free try
take it in total i know poor netflix
that's so anyway thanks for spending a
