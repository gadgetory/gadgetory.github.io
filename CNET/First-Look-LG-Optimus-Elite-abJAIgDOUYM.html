editor cnet I'm here to talk about the
LG optimus elite this is a new phone for
sprint now you're probably saying
yourself that you've seen a million
Optimus phones and well you have
actually that's not quite true it's more
about a dozen or so but there have been
quite a few of these phones of all sizes
all shapes all capacities and feature
sets the first is the LG optimus one
which came out for Sprint is the LG
optimus s quite a while ago but now we
have the Optimus Elite now they elite in
the name is a little interesting because
there's really not a whole lot of the
elite about it doesn't have that it's
not like the 3d max we saw recently what
has a three fancy 3d graphics it's not
like did other Optimus phones we saw at
mobile of Congress this is a pretty
average android phone run gingerbread it
runs on 3g it has an 800 megahertz
processor what's more about this phone
is just about functionality and it is
about its eco-friendly design the phones
made of recycled plus think it doesn't
have anything harmful I know the boxes
made of recycled material as well so I'm
a pretty basic design very very very
simple actually really straight lines
just a couple curves here and there ok
display not the greatest resolution does
have 16 million colors has five home
pages for your customization needs so
you can pop in icons which it's whatever
you like and down the bottom you see
touch controls normal Android touch
controls there's home there's back
there's menu and their search up on the
top there is a 3.5 mm headset jack
there's a power control over here
there's a volume rocker and on the
bottom there's the micro USB ports you
can use that for a charge or a sinking
cable on the back of all the flash the
lens for the 5 megapixel camera and a
self-portrait mirror you don't see the
mirror a lot these days so it's nice to
see just helps with those manatee shuts
take the back off and you will find the
microSD slot you don't have to take the
battery out too which is nice but you do
have to take the battery cover off the
battery cover is plastic which isn't the
best but I'd like to text your material
overall the phone weighs a little over 4
ounces so it does have a pretty solid
feel on the hand as this is a
touchscreen phone you'll have a virtual
dial pad and a virtual keyboard virtual
keyboard shows all the gingerbread
enhancements does offer swipe as well so
if you're into that you can use it
features inside pretty standard 5
megapixel camera it's actually pretty
nice it has quite a few options and it
does have a
photo quality it does have google wallet
which is something I didn't expect
especially on a phone of this caliber so
that means you'll be able to use it if
you can find any place that accepts
Google Wallet of course but be able to
use super payment so has NFC so you can
use it for other tags as well so you
know for movie posters or business cards
or anything like that the phone does
have visual voicemail so if you get a
voicemail in it does transcribe it into
text works pretty well it's not real
stickler for punctuation so if your
grammar not I wouldn't get too outraged
about it but it is nice for drivers that
you can just check your phone and see
who call them what they say because of
course if you don't have a headset you
shouldn't be answering your phone in the
car other features you have the standard
Google applications that messaging and
email you have Wi-Fi Bluetooth so you're
pretty midrange feature set except for
Google Wallet solid functional
concentrating on communication a little
play here and there though of course
there's a music player does have some
sprint apps fortunately you can remove a
lot of them you can't remove the Sprint
ID app which is annoying because I never
a fan of that felt what feels a little
like bloatware it makes lets you
customize your phone so you'll have to
ignore it if you can pricing is twenty
nine dollars with a two-year contract
and a mail-in rebate the phone also
comes with virgin mobile where you're
going to pay a bit more of course that
is not without a contract I think that
price is 149 as Optimus phones go pretty
low into the pack has android phones go
a little more mid-range but is a simple
Android device performed well but just
don't expect a lot from it i'm kent
german and this is the LG optimus elite
for sprint
