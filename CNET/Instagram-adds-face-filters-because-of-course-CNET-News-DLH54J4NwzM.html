Instagram has faced filters and the
effect looks just the same as it does on
snapchat
we all saw this coming after all
Facebook owns Instagram and both apps
have been copying snapchats features to
try and harness it's fun and frivolous
spirit the cartoonish effects overlay
right on top of someone's face snapchat
has the famous dog face effect and
Instagram does the bunny face thing
totally different right there's also
golden crown thingies in Instagram and
nerd glasses effects and you can make
cool sexy kissy faces you know the usual
totally unique things you'll find these
effects by tapping on the face icon in
the bottom right corner there are also
more tools in the camera you can play
videos in Reverse just like you can do
on snapchat and there are hashtag
stickers people watching your story can
tap the hashtag sticker to see other
posts with the same hashtag and there's
an eraser brush in the drawing tools so
you can take a photo fill the screen
with a color and erase with your finger
to reveal the photo underneath snapchat
should be worried about Instagram
getting into its space because way more
people use Instagram 700 million people
log onto Instagram every month and
snapchat well it last reported about a
hundred and sixty-six million people use
it daily growth has slowed when a lot of
people you know already use Instagram
and it does the same stuff there's less
incentive to try out snapchat so that's
why snapchat has to keep inventing silly
ways to share videos and photos well
sort of new things I mean recently it
added a way to let you loop a video
forever where have I heard that one
before I'm Bridget Carey and you can
keep up with the latest social media
copycats and sitcom</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
