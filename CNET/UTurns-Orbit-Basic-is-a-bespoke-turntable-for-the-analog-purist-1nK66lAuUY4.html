after it raised two hundred thirty three
thousand dollars on Kickstarter back in
2014 and after putting it to the test
I'm a believer too I'm Justin from C net
this is a first look at the u-turn orbit
basic turntable so the u-turn in orbit
is a well-built turntable with basic
features that work really well and
that's how you turn keeps the price down
there's no extra stuff on here like a
quartz lock or auto return or USB
transfers it's a belt drive turntable
which means it relies on this elastic
belt that connects the motor to the
platter which rotates the record it's
kind of hard to believe that the orbit
is u-turns first turntable to the whole
system is really well-thought-out and
it's easy to set up it comes with a
needle already installed the tone arm is
balanced and the tracking force is
already calibrated so you don't have to
mess with any of that I should say
though that you might not be a big fan
of the manual belt adjustment if you
often switch between listening to 33 and
45 rpm records you have to change the
position of the belt on this pulley
every time so that might be a hassle
aside from that the orbit basic is a
no-brainer recommendation both for vinyl
beginners and experts just be sure to
check out the turntable builder app
online before you buy that's where you
can add upgrades and choose between five
custom colors you can check out my full
review on CNET for a lot more details on
this including product comparisons and
sound quality tests but that's going to
do it for this video you just took a
first look at the u-turn orbit basic
turntable thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
