media reporter do you want a broadcast
straight from your face why Stream has
developed the first Google glass app to
do just that live stream is a company
that helps anyone broadcast live video
on the internet about almost anything
that includes big companies
live-streaming big events like Twitter's
IPO - citizen journalism
- of course puppy and Kitty cams live
stream is releasing the first live
streaming app for Google glass the
head-mounted voice-activated computer
from Google we talked to Phil
Worthington a co-founder of livestream
and its chief product officer about the
app it's the first live streaming app
for Google glass so anybody can now get
their glass install the live stream app
and go live through the live stream
platform to any device - TVs and iPads
iPhones websites so it's really just
enabling anyone with a pair of glass to
go like worthington told us live streams
mission is to democratize live screaming
by releasing apps for iPhone Android and
other platforms this is the new kid on
the block and it's definitely the most
portable wearable camera that we've come
across so it's perfect what we do ok
glass livestream I get a thing that says
go live and I tap it so what I'm seeing
is starting broadcast and it's starting
to take a roll so what's happening now
is it's taking the video from the glass
and it's going up to our servers through
a delivery network called echo mine I
said there's a little delay in getting
to the website and the reason for that
is just so that we can have scalability
so that you know hundreds of thousands
of people can watch you if your audience
is that big you know which I'm sure it
is and then a few seconds later it
appears on the website the possibilities
are almost unlimited from sports events
to concerts to your day-to-day life one
good example is citizen journalism we
actually had a guy from
vehicle temple who was using glass in
the turkey protests which happened not
too long ago so it's a great example of
you know he would otherwise have had a
an iphone strapped to his chest as what
he used to do you know and you can still
use iPhone I guess technically they're
kind of interchangeable but you know
nothing really replaces the you know the
first-person view that you're gonna get
from something like this
however glass itself has long raised
privacy worries does the capability to
livestream easily from glass possibly
without the consent of those you're
filming heighten those concerns perhaps
you know I think it's a kind of it's a
balance between you know privacy and
journalism and you know going back to
the to the urban journalist filming you
know all sorts of crisis moments around
the world you know yes maybe there are
privacy concerns but I think you know
the information that it shares with the
world you know is much more valuable
than that and I think you know you're
really not actually doing anything new
that you couldn't do with the phone so I
think it's the same concerns that were
there already just the medium and the
process for capturing those moments is
just much more fluid and intuitive so
next time you see somebody wearing glass
don't forget to smile you might be on
candid camera
