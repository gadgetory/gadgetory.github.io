editors hit the streets to test the
iphone 4s antenna problems and rate
cellphone carrier data speeds plus we'll
show you how to edit YouTube videos on
YouTube we've got a smiley cell phone
that has kent german frowning and the
mother of all smartphones showdowns the
iphone 4 versus the evo 4g it's all
coming up right now
hey everyone I'm Mollywood and welcome
to the cnet tech review the show where
we round up the hottest videos of the
week tell you which stuff is good which
stuff is bad and offer some tech wisdom
in the form of the bottom line let's get
started with the good from the first day
it hit the streets the iphone 4 has been
plagued with problems most notably
reception issues resulting from that
external antenna design well this week
kent german came to the studio to put
the phone through some real-world tests
hi I'm Kent chairman senior editor at
cnet com ever since the iphone 4 first
went on sale we've heard a lot about
problems with the end of iphone 4s
antenna now it is the first iphone to
have an antenna that goes all the way
around the side now we've noticed
particularly this part right here is on
the left side it's a small gap between
different parts does have a problem when
you touch that area I've heard a lot
from our users just well now what we're
going to do is we're going to look at
two tests we're going to look at the
number of bars displayed on the screen
and we're going to look a call quality
and see if touching that area does
affect either one first I'm going to
look at the number of bars so right now
without touching that area I see that we
have five bars on the display so that's
the full number you can get if I move my
hand and I touch that gap I don't see a
change now on other iphones we have
noticed that we do see a change it seems
to depend on the phone the user the
location a bunch of different things but
right now i'm not saying anything but we
are going to do is after apple issues at
software update in the coming weeks we
are going to see if the number of bars
changes and now we're going to look at
call quality i'm going to head outside
i'm going to call this phone touch that
area and see what happens hello Kelly
how are ya do good what I'm going to do
is I'm going to talk and then count to
10 and in the middle of that 10 I'm
going to move my hand into that top spot
and then move it away before i get to 10
and we'll see what happens i will start
now one two three
aight aight yeah such a difference up
there yeah I sure did you cut out after
three I think we ought to try it again
ok I'll try once more 123456789 em how
was that what's better still a little
garbled around six and seven okay okay
Emily thanks for upping us out so that
was two tests and each time we saw that
when I move my hand of that trouble area
did hear a cutout upstairs sometimes it
couldn't hear me at all sometimes I was
just a little garbled now we will run
this test again after Apple issues of
software update but for now definitely
see a difference I'm Kent charming we're
at the iphone 4 now of course by the
time you see this show Apple may have
already announced what they plan to do
about some of these problems we tape on
thursdays but whatever happens Kent will
be back with more tests to see if
Apple's fixes really worked now Kent
wasn't the only one dropping some
science this week Bonnie cha and Jeff
Bakalar braved a serious East Coast
heatwave to find out which of the big
four carriers have the best cell phone
data speeds in New York City hey
everyone I'm Jeff Bakalar for cnet com
we're here today with Bonnie cha our
cell phone expert senior editor and
today we're talking about AT&amp;amp;T and the
announcement they made that they fully
upgraded their 3g service here in New
York City and while it's tough to judge
and measure that claim we decided to put
all the cell phone carriers up against
one another starting right here at our
cnet labs here in New York so Bonnie how
exactly are we conducting these
experiments here today so we've
downloaded the speedtest.net app to four
devices the nexus one for tmobile the
apple iphone 4 for 18 t got it on the
evo 4g for sprint as well as the droid x
for verizon and we're going to conduct
three tests at each location and take an
average obviously there are a lot of
variables that go into these pitas so
just going to give it a shot and see
what we get so Joe start let's do it
Bonnie what were the results again I'd
like to reiterate this isn't formal
scientific testing but looks like from
the test here that 18g had the fastest
upload and download speeds interestingly
a Verizon and t-mobile around the same
but t-mobile is running on edge so it's
pretty interesting result yeah cool all
right we're going to brave the heat and
venture outside our next stop columbus
circle so Bonnie there's a lot of people
here what do you thinks gonna happen in
our speed test well it should be
interesting to watch but you know with
more people i'm sure a lot of people are
on their cell phones so data speeds
might be slower but we'll have to check
it out all right let's see what we get
here at Columbus Circle ok so we
averaged the three tests and t-mobile
had the fastest download speeds which
actually doesn't surprise me because
I've gotten grade 3G speeds with tmobile
here in New York sprint and came in last
that is a bummer for me cuz I have an
EVO but alright I'm sorry but you know
just in formal testing here to her and
verizon and 18t were similar as far as
download speeds but the upload speeds
for 18t were little on the slower side
you know we've had that issue this week
we've heard about it so
it's apparently a software issue so
hopefully we'll see it fixed soon
alright our latest trip brings us to
Times Square in New York City Bonnie
chow what do you think's going on here
so many people so much traffic what can
we expect well yeah a lot more people
than columbus circle i think that's
gonna put more of a strain on the
network so I'm expecting some slower
data speeds here but let's see who can
handle the heat we're done spinning here
in Times Square in New York City Bonnie
shall we have our results what do they
say we got some mixed results this time
t-mobile still in first place was the
fastest download and upload speeds
sprint actually came in second so
they're coming on up verizon came in
last in 83rd all right we're here at our
final location for testing Union Square
what did the result say well actually
this is the location I was most
interested in because when we posted
that 18t story got a few complaints from
readers saying the Union Square area was
the worst in reception so 18t came in
third wasn't the worst sprint was the
worst you know i'm really upset about
everywhere we go except for Times Square
sprint performed terribly sorry about
that it's okay it's not your fault it's
not your network you know again these
are informal test a lot of variables
happening um as far as first t-mobile
still comes in first and Verizon came in
second I think I think you know we
learned a lot and I think surprisingly
t-mobile having by far the best
performance scores is there anything
else that contributes to them again it
could like we said it could be the
number of subscribers but you know
t-mobile just hasn't really advertised
their 3g network as much as the others
people might not be aware about how fast
this network is um what else did we
learn today really I feel like
regardless where you go in Manhattan
your results are gonna vary you know we
got ups we got downs different locations
changed is there anything else we could
sort of conclude after all this i mean
the mixed results you know there's so
many variables it could be your location
the time of day you know so you know
just if you're looking for a carrier
talk with other people to see what their
experiences and choose from there for
the second there well thank you bonnie
cha our cell phone expert senior editor
here at CNN com we've braved the heat
we've jumped all over manhattan testing
the various cell phone providers and
their data speeds i'm jeff bakalar for
CNN com as well thank you so much for
watching we'll see you guys soon you
know in this day and age of smartphones
iPads and what have you sometimes you
just can't beat a pad of paper for your
complicated computations that is my kind
of tablet now last week we showed you a
couple of options for editing video on
your iPhone for this week we've got a
solution for editing video from any
phone as long as you can post it on
youtube first
hi i'm josh lowensohn with cnet com and
i'm going to show you how to use
YouTube's Video Editor to make a video
out of several clips well a little basic
when compared to software based video
editing tools YouTube's Video Editor
works right in your browser and does all
the hard work on Google servers meaning
you can edit HD video on just about any
computer as long as it as an internet
connection the first thing you're going
to want to do is head over to
youtube.com slash editor here you'll see
a list of all your uploaded YouTube
videos on the left hand side a
storyboard on the bottom and a preview
of the finished product on the right one
thing to note right up front is that you
cannot actually upload videos to the
editor itself your videos need to be on
YouTube first if you're just dumping a
few clips from your digital camera our
advice is to upload them as unlisted
this sends them to youtube but they
won't show up two people have subscribed
to your YouTube channel or in the
services search engine in case you don't
recognize one of your uploaded videos
you can play it just by hitting the
little arrow that shows up when you
mouse over the clip this opens up in a
pop-up window
when you found something you like you
can simply grab it and drop it down to
the storyboard or hit the little plus
icon in the top right hand corner of
each clip once the videos are on the
storyboard you can rearrange them freely
the storyboard is also where you do all
the editing to start an edit just mouse
over any clip in your storyboard and
click the scissors icon this will open
up a video in a pop-up window where you
can drag and change at the beginning and
end point to get a finer level of
control over these in and out points you
can click the small arrows on the top
and bottom of the clips timeline YouTube
is calling these nudges since they can
only change the length of the clip one
way or the other by a 15th of a second
to see your changes after making a nudge
or to just hit the play button it's
worth noting YouTube currently does not
let you split a clip so if you want to
use a different part of the same clip or
just repeat something again you drag the
video into the timeline multiple times
and trim it down to just the parts you
want if you want to add some audio to
your projects you can just pick a track
from YouTube's audio swap library in the
Audio tab on the top left just like
videos you can preview these before
adding them to your work then drag them
down into the storyboard keep in mind
that adding an audio track to your movie
will wipe out all the sound that was
there before and after you've done this
there's no way to go back without
starting a new project when you've got
your clips in the right place and added
the music you want you just give it one
last look by hitting the play button in
the preview module on the right if
everything looks good you just give it a
name hit the publish button and YouTube
does the rest once the server is
finished processing your new movie it
will show up in your my videos list for
everyone to enjoy I'm Josh Lowensohn and
this has been a how-to on using
YouTube's Video Editor happy editing
of course you can use the YouTube video
editor for any of your videos not just
the ones you've shot on your phone so
here's your chance to spice up your cute
kitten videos by adding a sexy salsa
beat it salsa kittens kitten salsa while
you ponder that I'm gonna take a break
but we'll be back with an old timey
internet history lesson right after this
welcome back to the cnet tech review
your weekly digest of all things good
and bad from cnet TV continuing on with
the good back in 1985 the first woman
won the Iditarod New Coke was introduced
and both Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs
left Apple and also the first six
dot-com domain names ever were
registered here's Brian Cooley with um
five of them
the very first dot com address was
created 25 years ago but I bet you don't
know what it was I'm Brian Cooley with a
scene at top five the original 5.com
domain names number five Dec com
September 30th 1985 only us og tech
types remember Digital Equipment
Corporation today but it was a heavy
hitter from the 60s into the 80s I
learned programming on one of their vac
systems but this isn't an ancient
history course deck was sold to compaq
in 98 compact to HP in 02 and that's why
deck calm there today number 4 mcc calm
july eleventh of 85 mcc stood for micro
electrics and computer technology
corporation not really it was a
high-tech rd consortium that went poof
around the year two thousand or so today
it's a sad parked domain the only one of
our originals that sit there in that
forlorn state number three think calm
May twenty-fourth of 85 by the way
notice how like a month used to pass
between each calm registration Backlund
things weren't quite so busy think calm
was the home of Thinking Machines an
early maker of supercomputers based in
Cambridge Mass the last iteration of the
company was bought by oracle in 1999
that's where think calm points today to
their thinkquest teacher student
learning something number two BBN calm
April 24th of 85 BBN was a legend in the
early internet days doing a lot of the
heavy lifting on the packet data
switching that still powers the net
today transmitting the first email and
they came up with the @ symbol in email
addresses today bn.com points to a
raytheon page because yes they acquired
the firm in 2009 before we get to our
number one oldest calm domain a little
trivia dot-com was originally going to
be dot core for corporation but you can
imagine that might have been
misunderstood because it sounds like
core or core or core we have the top 5
first domain
here but only six were registered in all
of 1985 Northrop calm would be in our
list if this show is called top six
microsoft com not one of the original
100.com registrations but apple was at
number 64 and sexcom was also not one of
the first 100 we had more pure
aspirations for the net back then okay
now it's time to reveal number one the
very first dot-com domain ever
registered symbolic scom March fifteenth
nineteen eighty-five you may not know
the company but it was a high-end
computer maker that among other things
lays claim to making the first computer
workstation that supported real-time
video digital video and HDTV 1985 think
about that the next time you fire up
final cut today symbolics is owned by a
domain brokerage that maintains some
kind of a blog there but it's mostly
tumbleweeds well that's it for this
edition of top 5 i'm brian cooley from
cnet.com registered March fifth 1994
we'll see you next time
so our domain was registered in March of
94 but cnet com didn't officially launch
until June of 95 13 months to make one
website man the internet was hard back
then all right let's move on to the bad
speaking of Technology history you heard
Brian mentioned that the good people at
BBN technologies give us the @ sign back
in 1971 but according to wikipedia the
smiley emoticon didn't show up until
nineteen eighty-two now 28 years later
Samsung has gone and ruined it forever
hi I'm Kent chairman senior editor at
cnet com today we have first look at the
samsung smiley apparently there's one
employee of Samsung that actually sits
around and comes up with these phone
names so this is the smiley and I'm not
too happy about this name at all mainly
because Samsung didn't call it SMI Ellie
why they actually used the emoticon I
think they could come up with something
just a little more creative and not
something that doesn't require us to use
a colon in a parenthesis so it actually
is a decent phone just not a fan of that
name it's got the same overall slider
design with the keypad that's exposed by
this sliding face display is pretty
decent for this type of phone you
actually see that emoticon right there
we're really really glad that they
didn't actually print it on the side or
the back of the phone it's fine on the
display because you can take that off
below us that navigation toggle the talk
was actually raised about the service of
the phone so that's pretty good you have
a couple of buttons here this feels a
tiny bit scrunch just a little but we
got to we got used to it after a while
keypad is fine it does feel a little
cramped of course I've sort of larger
hands so I find a lot of things like
this cramped but other users may not
find it that way you do find most of
what you need there's a space bar down
in the middle and I get you guessed it
there's a dedicated emoticon key so
Samsung's really taking that thing to
all the extremes you'll see the camera
lens and a self-portrait mirror behind
on the back of the front slider so you
will have to have the phone open to use
it inside you'll find largely messaging
options you'll have instant messaging
you can get some outlook email you can
get regular pop3 yahoo hotmail whatever
might be as i said it is a decent
messaging phone it's not it's only about
$19 with contract and the call quality
is quite good but I'm just not a fan of
that name
at all I'm Ken chairman here at the
samsung smiley for tmobile boy if Kent
is this upset about the smiley I can't
wait to see how he reacts to the HTC
hugs and kisses XOXO he's not gonna like
it and now it's time for this week's
bottom line to 4G or not to 4G that is
the question and brian Tong is here to
answer it in this week's prize fight
what's up fries five fans i'm brian Tong
and this is the number one most
requested prize fight that you the
people have been asking for it's an epic
prize by battle royale between the
iphone 4 and the HTC evo 4g now we've
given enough time for these phones to
show us what they're working with in the
real world so we're bringing the best
judging this prize fight our senior
editor Bonnie boom boom cha senior
editor Kent kg German and Brian
boomshakalaka Tom now we'll take all
three judges blind scores and average
them out to the nearest tenth each round
the final price wise score will be an
average of all round using the same
decimal system this prize fight is as
big as it can get to let get it all
round one is sexiness and durability the
iphone 4 brings a whole new design with
a curved bezel but a flat back and
sharper edges its retina display is
clearer than crystal clear but we're all
questioning how durable it's all glass
body really is the evo 4g smooth things
out with a gorgeous 4.3 inch screen and
a slim figure to match its soft touch
back side is nice but this is still a
bigger phone and it might be a little
too big for some people the evo 4g might
be more durable but the iphone four
still has the sex appeal apple takes
this round with the 4.7 and the evo 4g
gets a for next round is controls and
user interface the iphone 4 brings new
features like multitasking and dropping
multiple apps into folders with iOS for
android has always had these but the new
additions don't subtract from the fact
that pinching and zooming swiping and
double tapping make this the easiest and
most accessible mobile interface on the
planet the evo 4g featuring HTC Sense UI
is our favorite Android interface you
have seven home screens with a pinch
custom layouts depending on how you want
to use the phone and widget
customization that can't be matched but
there's a learning curve with Android
even if you get more control the iphone
4 gets a perfect five and
4G gets a 4.3 so after averaging two
rounds Apple takes a commanding lead
sprinting seven tenths of a point ahead
of HTC the evo 4g will have to make it
up round three is features both phones
are packed with 3g Wi-Fi gps and
bluetooth but heavy hitters like these
guys have to bring more to the table
than that the iphone has finally caught
up with multitasking folders and email
enhancements even if android users think
they were so last year the App Store
makes this device more than a phone and
it also makes this the best gaming phone
we've ever seen we haven't even talked
about FaceTime it's one of the iphone 4s
killer features its integration is
seamless but the evo 4g can do that too
without forcing you to be on Wi-Fi only
now if you're talking features the evo
4g is the most feature-packed phone on
the market with its 4g connectivity you
can use a phone as a mobile hotspot
let's just throw in some kickstand
action and it's android marketplace is
respectable as well Plus don't forget
it's Android staples like the
notifications pulldown turn by turn GPS
directions ask my son street its
unmatched voice search Thai restaurant
and text messages by voice let's crack
in homie the evo 4g is just a piece and
it tastes round three with the perfect
five and the iphone 4 gets of for next
round is web browsing and multimedia
safari on the iphone is still considered
to be the best mobile web experience
even without flash the iphone four still
has the best media player on a mobile
device and it's iTunes integration get
you access to loads of music and video
content that still looks even better on
its retina display it's 5 megapixel
camera with LED flash and 720p video
takes excellent pictures and if you want
to dabble with editing movies directly
on the device Apple's I movie will
satisfy the iphone 4 is the definition
of a multimedia phone now the HTC EVO 4
g's web browser is on par with safari
with its smooth running multi-touch
flashlight support is here with full
flash coming soon amazon's mp3 store and
double twist will take care of your
media sinking but the lack of a video
store hurts a little the HTC Sense UI
also gives us the best Android media
player plus it's 8 megapixel camera with
LED flash and 720p video also takes
great looking pics the larger screen
really allows media to shine and then
you add in the kickstand and an HDMI out
port ACC is stepped up its multimedia
game both bones have made media of focus
and we're calling this round a tie at
4.7 points apiece so after averaging out
four rounds the iphone 4 leads by just
one-tenth of a point HTC has closed the
gap and the final round that decides it
all is call for the amp performance the
iphone 4 features it's a floor processor
and the phone is snappy call quality has
improved and it's the best sounding
iphone we've heard but it's just a hair
behind the evo 4g but then you get to
the antenna issue in our test audio
quality completely disappeared or became
garbled when we covered the magic spot
and we know it doesn't affect everyone
but this is a big deal and a thirty
dollar bumper or a software update isn't
a real fix to any of us the saving grace
is that Apple's improved battery life
makes up for it and we squeeze out
almost eight hours of talk time over 3g
and that's impressive now HTC is evo 4g
1 gigahertz snapdragon processor makes
this a smooth-running phone as long as
running too many apps it also has some
of the best call quality I've ever heard
it was Chris clean and clear for all
three judges with no drop calls running
on 4G just kills this battery and you're
lucky to get it through a day but
running it on 3g still drains a good
amount because of the screen but like
bonnie says at least you can replace the
battery we were able to get five and a
half hours of talk time over 3g which is
respectable but one drawback is paying
the additional ten dollar premium even
if you don't have 4g coverage in your
area in the final round the evo 4g gets
a 4.3 and the iphone 4 gets a 3.3 so
let's average out all five rounds and in
a battle where the iphone 4 led from the
start the evo 4g cloud back to close the
gap and finish with a final round blow
to take this epic battle 4.5 to 4.3 and
is your prize fight winner both of these
phones are the cream of the crop but it
was the evil 4 g's features and some of
the iphone 4s flaws that made all the
difference i'm brian Tong thanks for
watching we'll catch you guys next time
we're another prize fight
the bottom line this week I demand a
recount or a recall out too soon either
way it seems like Apple just cannot
catch a break and that's our show for
this week everyone tune in next week for
an all-new look at the tech week that
was until then you can always find more
great cnet video at seen at tv.com see
you next time and thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
