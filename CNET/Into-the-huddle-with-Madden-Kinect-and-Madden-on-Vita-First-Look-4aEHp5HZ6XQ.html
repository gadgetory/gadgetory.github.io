almost over that can mean only one thing
in videogame language Madden is about to
arrive and sure mostly the people are
rich than that our football fans NFL
fans like myself and what is new in each
version of Madden doesn't seem to be
that big from year to year this year
there are actually two new technological
innovations that merit some conversation
one is a version of madam for the Vita
which I'll get to in a moment and the
second is that for the Xbox 360 well in
addition to man and having a new physics
engine and also having a new connected
careers mode there's Kinect capability
and what that means is that it's not
motion it's voice that it's listening to
and Kinect can work with a 6,000 word
vocabulary that you use to command
players on the field it sounds a little
complicated and I'm actually wearing a
wrist band that Madden sent me with play
calls listed in here for help I thought
that was a little silly but actually it
is a little bit complicated more so than
I thought at e3 just because while you
can see some of the things that you can
say that pop up is words in the huddle a
lot of other things that you can use to
control the players don't show up so
it's kind of like carte blanche and
you've got to figure out some of those
plays pro players might find some really
nice shortcuts in there but a lot of
other people might find themselves going
back to the buttons just to feel
comfortable I'll show you what I mean
now we can see that Kinect control works
right away and you have to press any
additional button to use it it's
available anytime that your Kinect is
plugged in so let's give it a try quelle
heure streak there you go and I got them
to control it actually worked
it kind of feels sometimes like you're
telling a dog to do something and then
the dog doesn't quite listen so can be a
little frustrating when you're playing
game and that's the problem those few
seconds of disconnect using the Kinect
might really turn off a pro player in a
game I did have one incidence where I
was controlling a player named shillin's
and what I call that chillings it called
a challenge and burned a time out now
some of that may be get fixed in certain
software updates or not but it's
something that I've noticed right now
but you can do a lot of stuff with
Kinect including some things that you
couldn't normally
with the button controls for instance
tell a player to cover a wide receiver
in a way that was not so easy to do
before the advantage of Kinect is that
theoretically you could use us to get
some commands you may not know about
like oh line block left and I actually
worked really well and you may not have
realized before that oh I could get my
own line to block left there are a lot
of deep commands and Madden that this
kind of reveals so it might be a fun
mode for people to play with just if
that play clock were a few seconds
longer I've also found using this so far
that if you have your volume on your TV
high it has a little problem registering
your voice I find it works better using
headphones right now maybe that would
get patched in a software update too
because we haven't seen that happen on
other kinect controlled games audible
audible audible deep pass timeout yeah
it's incidentally called the timeout so
my advice to you is if you're using the
Kinect mode wear a good pair of
headphones and then just keep barking in
the room until somebody else see you to
be quiet so with a little bit of time
and maybe a little bit of know how you
can finesse out a Kinect game plan that
might make sense for you in addition to
the buttons but it's gonna be a
specialty item and not the killer app
that maybe it seemed to be when I saw it
at e3 but who knows maybe by mid year
I'll find myself barking at the screen
more than I thought before now let's
take a look at Madden on the Vita which
really takes the console and brings it
into the portable mode in a way that is
better than any previous version of
Madden the Vita version obviously takes
advantage of the larger screen and
better graphics and also pushes out the
game to really become a portable version
of the console game franchise modes
included online mode and pretty much all
the stuff the fan and last year's
version of Madden and even some of the
features in this year's although there
won't be a new physics engine and there
obviously won't be anything like Kinect
capability on the Vita although you kind
of could do that so what do you get out
of this you get well dual analog sticks
to which hey you've never been able to
do before on a handheld I mean the
graphics are maybe a step down from the
console shore and
maybe some of the load screens took a
bit more than I expected to load up but
the experience even down to the submenus
is like a carbon copy so you can take it
on the road and for if you're a football
fan like me that's a tremendous value
and could be a real killer app for the
Vita which is desperately in need of new
and interesting games there aren't that
many that can appeal to mainstream
audiences I think and something like
Madden is one of them this is coming out
all at the same time as the console
versions on Tuesday and just in time for
the football season</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
