for you let's share the same name that's
love nothing cordial let's get back to
the basics see me no need for lacy it's
just a name no it's Who I am to you
that's the worst thing
I switch to t-mobile because of the
flexibility I don't have a contract
which I love that the simple choice plan
is so much better because I know what
I'm gonna get every month I'm happy with
that it's great to understand what
you're paying for within the first two
weeks I was using ten gigs I'm thinking
I could not survive doing this with
another company because they would have
shut me down by now
I have a 5s right now as soon as the six
inviting me to go trade it in and get
the new one I like the fact that the
installments can go towards a new phone
if you want to upgrade
even overseas I still want to have fun
with my phone overseas I still want to
be worry free which is what I'm able to
do with the t-mobile phone once I switch
to t-mobile and went on my first trip I
said wow this is so much better I got
lost and everything but what was nice
was that I had the data to pull up mast
to buy my way home
yeah we've got this thing we'll pay off
your early termination fee so like okay
where do I sign up
I don't think it's right at all to have
to pay for an early termination fee when
you're done with it you're done with it
and that should be the end of it
immediately when I walk in this store
the representative goes are we paying
for your break up today and I said yeah
t-mobile is the it brand right now you
have wireless that's what you want to go
to me they're the pioneers of the new
the new age of cell phones because they
take chances
promise less and deliver more after
light t-mobile has that I'm really
really glad they switched are you man
customer for life with them it's
probably like the best thing I ever did
with my cell phone
t-mobile keep doing what you're doing
ladies and gentlemen this has the main
events of the evening we
la from the soda Paramount Theatre in
the Emerald City and now it's time
introducing fighting out to the magenta
corner please welcome John the un-- CEO
okay good evening everybody especially
all of you that had a real long day if
they gave you any of those hologram
cameras you can point them at me and see
if they'll tell you who I am
oh they didn't give you one sorry I hope
you got the goody bags welcome to
Seattle
there should be an energy drink right
next to the do be in the bag for you to
welcome you to the state of Washington
hi
I should acknowledge right up front that
this is a rather unique event our
friends from the media here our guests
of honor we did invite one or two people
to join us today I got two groups of
people we have quite a few of our local
customers and maybe one or two employees
from Salem Bellingham in Belgium
I I bring this up for two reasons to
some of you I've talked today in the
media with I want to help you understand
this group is not a plant nor are they
coached they're out of their goddamn
mind on their own
and if you want to know one of the
biggest differences between t-mobile and
our competitors is this is what our
employees and customers look and sound
like every minute of every day now
that video that you saw I love that
video because what I've been doing since
I got to t-mobile and it may sound
oversimplified but I can guarantee you
when this story is written and students
want to know what did we do at t-mobile
I guarantee you what I did every day
since I got here and I do every day for
a living is talk to individual customers
those people on the screen and with all
the geniuses in the telecom and the
wireless industry and business in
general we make it so complicated we
talk industry structures in customer
segments and retail distribution
channels that is a complete crock of
 this is nothing more than an
industry of 250 million individual
people that if you take the time to talk
to them on Twitter talk to them on
Facebook talk to them in the store
they'll tell you everything you need to
know and then in this audience are the
only two other people you need to know a
customer care replica
B knows to people you hear everything
and then in a retail store a person who
for a living
talks to you about what you want in a
device and a wireless service and I can
guarantee you everything we do
everything that happens at t-mobile the
entire uncarrier revolution comes from
those people and from solving these pain
points and the last thing that was up
here I want to guarantee you on we're
gonna end on this note today as well
very important we will not stop we will
continue now so so since since we
started this together and I don't feel
together with all of you
17 million people have chosen t-mobile
and that since the uncarrier revolution
17 million now customers and not just
our customers and that's an important
difference customers in the wireless
industry are experiencing Wireless in
ways that they never did before either
they're with us or they've had the
benefit of our competitors responding
contracts this world of no contracts no
overages this isn't that long
customers are rejecting deceptive phone
practices and if you can remember back
when we started this and I was going on
and we were talking about this craziness
of thinking that that phone you know
cost $99 it's a thing of the past
upgrade plans where did that great idea
come from it's like everybody has an
upgrade plan now international roaming
these things are all things that
happened here in what we're doing and
it's about transforming an outdated
industry that's something that we're
gonna talk to now I want to start today
about the announcements were gonna make
today and what they're about these
devices our competitors don't get that
this is not just a phone they don't get
it and by the way they were created our
competitors were created when what you
got this for was to make a phone call
that's not the world we're in anymore
smartphones
our mobile supercomputers we use them to
do everything that we do right in the
palm of our hands and what causes that
to happen
data data networks carry every Meg of
your text of your mail of your photos of
your songs and very important for us we
see ourselves as a mobile Internet
company now why does that start to
become important you know that in 2012
connected internet devices mobile Anette
devices surpassed pcs right and as we
head into 2015
mobile Internet users will surpass fixed
wireline users right so the big question
is why does the industry treat data
users as second-class citizens why are
there overages why are there limitations
and for example we try to eliminate over
just 200,000 people signed up right away
why haven't they gone away we're gonna
explore this together there are very
good reasons that I'm gonna point out
then we're gonna solve a few you know
users like Roger the Twitter maniac over
here
inna 78% of Facebook users a mobile 76%
of Twitter users 66% of streamers of
music are mobile now we're at a tipping
point we're officially crossing over
implications
first a question why don't they and team
Verizon offer unlimited data plans okay
let's let's list the choices a they
can't be they're greedy bastards okay or
or my favorite see both okay now
it it is pretty clear to me what's
happening and I'm gonna use this as an
intra pologize I won't go as on as long
as somebody did this morning but I've
got more to announce what's happening is
these folks were created to help a
network make phone calls on a fixed wire
network and that asset needed to be
monetized they needed to make a return
on it so they were trying as long as
they can and now they're slowly creating
their data networks and holding back as
long as they can to monetize the
incremental investments mainly because
they can their mobile their utilities
phone calls were an app now t-mobile's
network let's talk about this for a
second
and this is what we really wanted to
talk about today before we solve some
pain points our networks designed
different it's built for data let's
explore that together this generation
not mine this generation here these
young folks they were built purely for
the mobile internet age you got the guys
don't get it
see these maps we keep seeing these maps
are you sick and tired of these maps you
know you know what this map is it's 2d
it's a 2d map it's flat if there's a
piece on this map where you can make a
crackling phone call it gets filled in
so let me help you we are all all of us
going to cover this map and it's time
that this map starts changing because
one color thin is not enough it turns
out that Millennials and the new
internet group they used data and we
know where and when they're using data
working with our spectrum portfolio and
what Neville and his team have been
doing our data is concentrated where and
when people use the network so we've got
to coin a term called data strong so
let's make this three
right let's look at this Network and
where people use the network and let's
start to change the dialog what's most
important to you if you spend 97% of
your time in the city downtown in
Seattle and then you go
who knows where to Montana ok and you
can make one phone call there which by
the way we will be able to do we're
moving towards complete ubiquitous folk
voice coverage but where you work and
play every day the differentiated
capability of data usage is off the
charts different I think that dialogue
has to start the fundamental difference
in the approach between us and the other
guys let's just look at this t-mobile
customers how about this for a small
wake-up t-mobile customers use 69% more
data than an average Verizon customer
they use 61% 61% more data than
everybody in the family ok
but here's the shocker for you I saved
my favorite for last an average t-mobile
customer uses 100 percent more data than
an AT&amp;amp;T customer 100 percent now why
here's the wide t-mobile has far more
network capacity per customer than any
other carrier doesn't sound like the
conversation they're telling you does it
how about this one you ready t-mobile
has 70% more spectrum per customer than
Verizon and and we have and by the way
nobody's been arguing this remember when
I brought this up earlier this year that
we have the nation's fastest 4G LTE
network
no dialogue happening it's no Doubt's
when you take those together mobile
antennas our DNA better adapted than the
utilities fundamental difference so what
do we have as an issue here big news
wideband LTE now launched in 16 markets
in the United States okay let me explain
to you what this means
we have 230 million pops of
belty we have 250 million by the end of
the year we look at wideband LTE as at
least 15 by 15 okay and we will be 20 by
20 and 90% of the top 25 markets okay
what are these speeds mean you ready up
to a hundred and forty seven megabits
down and up to 40 megabits up okay 147
magnets that is a 90 minute HD video
download in three minutes
or an 11 song album in seven seconds
what what that also is what that also is
it's so much faster than even the
laboratory promises of whenever the hell
sprint finishes the SPARC network
whenever that is this is already faster
than the laboratory white-coat guys are
doing in their demos so data strong
ready now here's the next piece of both
team here are the dialogues about volt
e15 markets launched a hundred and seven
million people currently have voting
right now will have nationwide
deployment of volte by the end of the
year so these things sound to you like
what they should sound
we are absolutely kicking their ass on
both fronts wideband LT and volte way
ahead Neville and his team completely
annihilating the competition so here's
the before I go to this piece I would
just say the dialogue around t-mobile
has shifted so much listen to us we are
fighting the battle on network in one
and a half years what these guys have
done has created we want to taunt you
about the network now here's where we
get to the pain points here's what
drives me nuts
I'm absolutely out of my mind on another
set of issue do you know the media
spending in our industry in a year in
the United States on TV media it set a
six billion dollars six billion dollars
that creates this cacophony of the
biggest
 in history maps and charts and
promises and happy families running
through the goddamn store it's a joke I
mean come on you got Grant Hill and you
got the little woman telling about
playing varsity bet this is this is how
America makes Wireless decisions when
this supercomputer in your hand is truly
differentiated in many places what the
 do I care about all that so here's
what it is what I always get is you know
every time we do something people don't
tell me you know hey that's a great idea
they say well how are you able to do
that because the assumption is that
these high-and-mighty do APPA lists that
are raping you for every penny you have
if they could do something nice for you
they would the hate you I'm
telling you so I promised myself I
wasn't gonna be angry today so I'm gonna
be happy okay and there was a pool as to
how many time I swear so I promised him
I'd say at least four in the first five
minutes okay so here's the here's the
tough one the industry wants you to be
confused they want the way you purchase
to be tough how about this stat 46% of
Americans say they have gone in and made
a Wireless decision and gone home and
regretted it
remorse how about this one out of ten in
the first 30 days has changed they've
gone back so let me help you this is a
higher remorse rate by a factor of
thirty three percent then the used-car
industry and and if I'm not ashamed of
my own industry it's just about the same
as the cable industry which is really a
low bar to try to put out in front so
this is the pain point this is what
we're going to try to change and solve
and trust me
not just for us not just for t-mobile
customers
but for everybody
you so much data Instagram Facebook
YouTube
I'm always sharing photos I'm always
sharing videos t-mobile is crucial the
speed is just amazing
t-mobile's network is a lot stronger
than I thought it was going to be Paige
Louis's like that
once I switched to see mobile I said wow
this is so much better
I love what the interior is doing but I
know they say they're fast but are they
fast there everyone trust a map on TV I
trust it when I see it once before and
it was not good am I ready to do it
confused with all these claims and ads
about networks everyone says they have a
ton of data and I can't be like
yeah
sometimes I think we create these videos
for ourself I hope you are entertained
with that now for me the last time I had
a seven night stand was approximately
never but if you remember back in
January when we invited people to break
up with the carriers some weren't quite
ready and what we started to hear from
people was the concept of they wanted a
pain point solved they wanted a test
drive and we are so confident about our
network capability and by the way both
ways there may be some customers that
it's not quite time it's our time for
them try it and then after a seven night
stand you can make a decision and most
importantly we think everybody should
cheat on their carrier we are we hold in
this world of reality we believe
everybody every Verizon every AT&amp;amp;T
customer should cheat on their carrier
and enjoy every minute of it so what
we've done is partnering with Apple
which were very proud of
anybody can for seven days get a fully
loaded iPhone 5s with an unlimited data
plan and you can test drive our network
and then simply return it to a store and
it is zero cost no down payment and
it'll be fantastic to see and by the way
very importantly we also found out that
an unbelievable low percentage of
Americans actually know that t-mobile
carries the iPhone so if you want a test
drive an iPhone 5s this is here for you
as well so what I'd like to do this is
big it's very exciting there's a lot
more to it I'm gonna ask Mike Seaver to
come up and give you the details of what
we call test drive and a seven night
stand
you guys like the seven nightstand yeah
you know people ask us when we do these
things this is the fifth one and people
ask us where do we get these ideas
how do we come up with the pain points
with the with the focus areas for
uncarrier and its really simple we
listen to customers we do this
astounding thing of listening to
customers what they want what holds them
back and just solving them as John said
and so when we came out with uncarrier
we eliminated contracts we got rid of
them with simple choice and we got rid
of the stuff that people hate about
contracts we got rid of overages we got
rid of the upgrade runarounds we made
the world's your network at no extra
charge and millions of people responded
but some people who were held back they
said do it we listened because and what
they said to us was pretty simple
they said okay but I'm stuck in a
contract I've got a family plan contract
with staggered expiration dates and I
can't get out I love those things but
I'm stuck and so we solved that one too
with contract freedom in January and set
them free what this is about is about
addressing the next thing that people
are telling us they look at this and
they say okay the uncarrier revolution
makes a ton of sense but it feels kind
of risky how do I decide how do I know
for sure that it's gonna work for me if
I make that decision and amazingly the
way this industry answers that question
until tonight is patently absurd the way
we answer the question about whether or
not this is going to work out for you is
is a buying process that is worse than
used cars
I mean imagine it what if you went to a
car dealer and they said now just take
it you can't drive it
just take it no one would buy it that
way and yet we don't question that this
is how Wireless works and it doesn't
just work this way sometimes it works
this way across the industry last year
82 million times that's the number of
gross ads in our industry people were
forced to make buying decisions in this
patently absurd way as John said what
you do here's how it works what you do
is you take your whole family
and you come into a retail store and
everybody hands over their phones
including the entire digital life that
they built into these phones and gives
it away never to be seen again and then
you pay hundreds of dollars for every
person in the family to get a new phone
spend a half a day of your life moving
into that phone reinitiating your
digital lifestyle into it and then only
then after a few days you figure out
whether or not it's gonna work for you
that sound okay is that sound like away
and somebody should buy Wireless but
it's how it happens 82 million times and
so we said why don't we just do it
differently why don't we just make it
totally free come in get an iPhone 5s
sign up we're gonna send it to you and
when you get it you can use it check out
the network for seven days and the way
it works is pretty simple I was I
thought to myself let me make a slide to
lay out the process that people should
follow so that people will get this at
the press conference and then I made the
slide and I thought to myself well I
don't really think that was it was
probably necessary but it works like
this you go to tmobile.com/the
get your name and address so we can ship
it to you it comes in about two days
we're gonna take your credit card number
we're not gonna charge you all we're
gonna do is make sure the shipping
address matches the billing address and
we're gonna make sure the credit card
number is good you pay nothing
there's no deposit there's no payment we
send you an iPhone 5s or whatever is the
latest and greatest iPhone and then you
take it for a spin bang on our network
for a week have a ball take it for a
seven nightstand sheet on your carrier
and then bring it back that's it bring
it right into a store where one of our
representatives will take it in and
you're on your way and it's a complete
transformation in the way to assess
whether or not it's gonna work for you
now you might remember when we launched
on carrier for contract freedom we did
it with a little bit of fun we can't
help ourselves so we launched you might
remember it the break-up do you remember
that the breakup letter
so we thought well if we're gonna do a
test-drive
we need to have a little bit of fun with
this one too so as we've been saying the
t-mobile test-drive we're referring to
it as the seven night stand
so what we're launching tonight is the
seven night stand challenge now if
you're taking the test drive there's a
there's one for each day that you can do
if you're not taking the test drive
knock yourself out this is for everyone
because it's a chance to have fun with
this thing to win prizes like gift cards
or free t-mobile service or trip set for
seven glorious nights a romantic getaway
to someplace that you can use your
simple global data and each each day
we're gonna give you a new challenge of
something you can do like for example
confess your cheating ways like this guy
who says he's posting I'm coming clean
I'm cheating on you with t-mobile we
have a phone together so it's a little
awkward or or this person another
challenge is to flirt with t-mobile a
little and so this person says hey
t-mobile can you open a pickle jar for
me your networks so strong or or you
know and as it goes along it gets a
little bit better maybe you're gonna
stand in front of an AT&amp;amp;T store with a
sign I'm having enough seven nightstand
don't no need to wait up no need to wait
up
or come it light or light people did
tens of thousands of times with the
breakup letter come in to our store
where we've got a few props and you can
post it like this one kiss off Verizon
have your picture taken put it on the
internet and have a lot of fun with it
and and you know what it should be fun
because what we're doing tonight is
we're bringing in the end to the control
that this duopoly has had on the way
this industry buys things the way
consumers are forced to buy things
what uncarrier five is all about is
making the buying process simple getting
rid of buying blind let people see this
data strong network let them know that
it'll work for them take the control
back and have fun with it along the way
so I hope you love it what I'm gonna do
right now is ask John to come back and
what we're gonna do is answer the first
and most obvious question
so we're gonna take a lot of questions I
know there's some there's a tremendous
amount of questions I know people want
to have but as we get started I'll tell
you that the biggest question I usually
get in these events we usually end with
which is is that it will there be
another uncarrier in the future and by
the way when is it and let me just go
over here for a second because I think
what I'd like to do is answer that
question by telling you yes and it's
right now
face
okay
music freedom so the answer to uncarrier
6 is right now okay yeah I knew people
thought there was going to be some sort
of a free streaming service given out in
Seattle today they just picked the wrong
location when they guessed it so let's
just talk about music freedom talk about
a pain point and a trend a hundred and
thirteen million people stream music on
their mobile devices now that is up
twice since last year and in the last
couple of years the streaming traffic on
our network has gone up six-fold so talk
about a coming attraction how about this
sixty seven percent of streamers do
their streaming on mobile devices
remember that trend in the beginning and
what's happening here now how about this
a huge percentage of people forty
percent and growing say that they limit
their streaming on their mobile devices
because they're petrified about data
bucket overages and charges that they're
going to get from the carriers major
fear major pain point now me I am a
music fanatic and you are going to hear
one of my favorite bands tonight
I use my phone for streaming all the
time it's the best way that I can stop
having to listen to these guys talk to
me all the time I've got running
I've got driving I've got soundtracks
but the smartphones are where we do this
and I and we had to unleash this for
customers it's a big pain point now
fantastic to see these trends that
everybody wants because what do the
other guys do they see everything as an
opportunity to tell customers what to do
and to gouge them and this is gonna
cause some pain the data bucket overages
how about this what happens one of our
competitors has decided I know you love
streaming I think you should do it with
beats I don't give a crap if you like
Spotify Rhapsody Pandora iHeartRadio
iTunes radio slack or Beatport Milt I
don't care you're gonna use beats and
then every goddamn note you listen to
including the ads we're going to charge
you for that's how they unleash
streaming another one of our competitors
said hey I know this is a big deal we're
gonna have a big event and that guy that
sings happy that makes me sick is going
to come in and you're gonna listen to a
bowers until you stab somebody just sick
of that freakin song
okay and here's the special I got it for
you give me your credit card I'm gonna
let you buy Spotify at a slightly
discounted rate for six months and then
six months and one day we're gonna Jack
the price up and yes it's going along
with the rest of your family against the
data plan this is the way you do so what
do we do we free you and back to the
first point why because we can because
of our network because of the data
capability and this is a trend so music
freedom means that every single note
from right now starting with the top
seven or eight which account for 85% of
music will come free not against your
bucket and even when you exhaust your
high-speed data bucket you will still
stream music free at a high speed
so we're gonna talk we're gonna talk
some more about that but this is this is
where people start to say you know I
will tell you we will never run out of
things to fix in this industry all right
because even and I'm gonna let Mike talk
about this but even when we started
fixing this one
and learning more about internet radio
we've figured out that internet radio
was broken and we may just fix that as
well so let's um let me ice doesn't get
Mike up here to just say that it's a
pain point it's a big one it's a growing
one and we decided not to step in
slightly but to completely eliminate it
forever and I guarantee you starting
tomorrow
customers are going to show up for this
service and customers are going to show
up at our competitors and they're going
to demand the answer as to why can't I
have this from you as well so Mike ones
come up
so let me tell you to underscore what
John said one of the fundamental
differences between our company and
everybody else when when our company
sees a chart like this one that shows
that music is a phenomenon that is going
nuts that has doubled in the last year
that reaches a hundred and thirteen
million people on their mobile devices
we see an opportunity to set people free
our competitors see an opportunity to
gouge people they see an opportunity to
grab overages to lure people in with
bundles and apparent low prices and then
get you on the data that's the
difference between our company and the
others they're doing it wrong our view
is really simple our view is let's just
give all the top streaming services all
of them in fact these six services
represent 85 percent of the streaming
music data traffic on our network let's
set the data price for all of these
services to zero let's have full speed
streaming let's have no data overages no
caps unlimited let me ask you a question
when was the last time you heard 18 T or
Verizon even utter the word unlimited
come on they view it so totally
differently and that's what we're
excited about tonight and by the way not
only these top six services but also a
couple of our of our closest partners
services like milk music from Samsung
and also an app that we're very excited
about coming soon to all the app stores
from our partner SFX beep port music and
EDM sensation coming soon will be
included in our program and so what
we're doing is essentially saying look
let's just stop the complexity and the
confusion and get behind a concept
that's very easy for people to
understand it's free it's free and it's
unlimited and we're doing it for one
simple reason our network can handle it
our data strong network can handle it
we're here tonight to talk about the
difference between our network and
streaming music is a showcase of what
makes t-mobile different our data strong
network is concentrate
where people demand the data and we can
do it and as John said there's one of
two reasons why they're not doing it
either their network can't handle it or
they just won't and so it's time for us
to challenge this industry to change now
we're gonna have some fun with this one
too because obviously eight sites
doesn't make the internet part of the
magic of the Internet is that you never
know who's gonna be trending next and so
what we're gonna ask is for the social
community to help us out because we're
gonna expand music freedom as we go and
so you can go to tmobile.com/the winners
will be added to music freedom as we go
along we will expand this program as we
go now John started to hint at our final
announcement of the night and that is if
you stop and think about it for a minute
music freedom is fantastic for each and
every t-mobile customer on simple choice
but there's one group that's kind of
left out it's those people on our
totally unlimited 4G LTE plans after all
they're streaming's already included in
their plan and so we set out to do
something really special for these
customers because in many ways they're
our very best customers and we scan the
landscape for an internet radio service
that we could provide for these
customers probably not surprised for
free and we didn't really find it
because what we found was internet radio
itself as John said has a few pain
points involved in it there are some
things that people aren't getting from
their internet radio and so we sat down
with our crosstown friends at Rhapsody
and we created together and asked
Rhapsody to create Rhapsody unreal
being announced and launched tonight
from this day
available in all of the app stores
available in all of the app stores
nationwide tonight a totally new
internet radio product that takes things
to a totally new direction it's $5 a
month for the public but you might not
be surprised to hear for our unlimited
4G LTE customers on our newest plans
it's free it's included and for every
other t-mobile customer it'll be
available at a discounted price of $4
now what's interesting is when you think
about internet radio and the phenomenon
you saw that graph the phenomenon is
incredible when you when you look at
internet radio itself there are a few
issues because with internet radio you
can't necessarily replay your favorites
you if you like a song you love a song
you can't necessarily replay it with
Unruh do from Rhapsody you can with
under a do you can listen to the tracks
you want with Unruh do you can skip as
many times as you want there's no
advertising and there's 20 million
so we are very excited about this you
guys this this was a double bill we
threw a lot of News at you tonight
uncarrier five the t-mobile test drive
the seven night stand
transforming the way Americans buy
Wireless and eliminating buying blind
and uncarrier 6.0 music freedom stream
all you want data charges do not apply
because music should be free and
rhapsody Unruh
the first breakthrough radio product
that solves the pain points and lets
people stream free lets them choose
their music unlimited unlimited skips
we're so excited about bringing you all
of these news and we know that our
friends in the media have some questions
and so to do all that the first thing i
want to say is neville raised in the
house so now don't come on up and john
come on up and we'll be happy to take
your questions so so as we go to Q&amp;amp;A
just um I want to get some unbiased
feedback what do you think about these
announcements t-mobile
somehow I thought you'd say that listen
as we go to QA I want to reiterate
something that we started with
everything we do is about solving pain
points everything we do is forever
everything we do is designed to change
the entire industry so I'll jump ahead
to one of the questions I always get on
these which is you know what are you
gonna do if the other guys respond and
do what you're doing and I have two
quick answers I don't give a and
I'll celebrate because we changed the
industry and then secondly what I will
say to you is a commitment we will not
stop and continue to give us the pain
points and we'll continue to solve them
so with that why don't we now I want to
point out I know we have a lot of
customers and employees this is the
media's chance to ask questions so
please know positive or negative
feedback to their questions no rushing
the crowd here this is where you be
quiet and respectful you got it
everybody do - all right who's first got
one here
hey John how big ring guard current
analysis so let's say you're looking at
this great new plan that I want to take
its seven-day test drive and I'm not an
Apple fan I'm more of an Android guy why
can't I test drive the Galaxy s5 yeah
you know to start we took this idea to
our partners at Apple and we have a you
know an evolving relationship what I
also said is you know it's clear that
there is a very low awareness in our
customer base about the fact that we
carry the Apple product strangely enough
statistically it could be you know 2/3
or so of what most people's awareness is
of a carrier so it's very low and so
we're trying to solve several things so
is Apple you know we've got a great
partnership growing with them and I
think you know Apple is also interested
in the fact that the fastest growing
wireless carrier in the US has a low
penetration of their product so we
brought this idea to them they responded
they're providing the devices to us for
free we're providing the service and
capability to handle the process and so
I think it's a win-win for us on both
fronts now where we'll go over time I
don't know but I think having it very
targeted and focused at launch point
here today is you know extremely
important yeah I was just wondering are
those six streaming services you
mentioned the only six that are starting
at launch or is a Google Play Music
included in that
well actually it's eight so it's the six
plus samsung milk milk music and also
Beatport Wendy port launches and that
launch is coming up and then what we've
got is this voting mechanism on our
website so people can choose which is
the hot trending one and and Google
play's the Play Store is one of those on
so we'll see you know we'll let the
public vote I have a feeling there's a
lot of Google fans out there so you know
we'll see how it all shakes out hey
listen this is some these services
account for 85% of the internet
streaming right and that's a changing
industry there's a lot of action going
on you know we keep talking about our
partnership with
affects some of the things that we're
doing around you know a couple of
upcoming shows and things that we're
going to work on together but Beatport
which is the place where djs go to buy
their music they'll be you know doing
things and they'll be evolving I think
that's a space to watch
well my commitment to you is if there's
something that people want vote and we
will add it we will add all the services
that customers want in an orderly
process so we'll probably have a contest
for three weeks or so and then a month
add a bunch of them in an orderly way
but if you want it will at it be the
same price free yep from tech I've
southern nightstand sounds really cool I
was just wondering if there's a huge
demand are you guys gonna is there any
kind of capper you're gonna run out of
devices yeah and also is there there's
no restocking fee or any kind of hidden
charge of people want to give it back no
no in what we've said is we will do at
least a million test drives in the next
year a million okay now if there's a lot
more demand we'll do a lot more I just
think it's a very cool idea we not
necessarily the seven night stand idea
but you know I mean my thought is why
not why not you know what what I've been
what I've been watching is you know one
of the biggest games that people play
out at night with each other strangely
enough it's sad about our society is
speedtest you know hey how fast is yours
how fast is mine and you know geeks sit
there like me and speedtest and we win
by the way all the time you do that's
yeah so you know what I'm aspiring to is
an even sadder world which is where you
don't even need a friend to speedtest
you can have to yourself so like I can
go out to the bar with my best friend me
and I can
I can order another round for both of us
and I can speed test at both and then
you know I think the fun part is it's a
no-lose event but strangely as I said
there are some customers that you know
travel 30 miles to a store with their
family and we want them we want them to
know that we want to make sure the
service is right for them because I know
that between today and a year or 18
months from now my service will be great
everywhere and if it's not yet today I
want you to know I respect you enough to
have a test drive I also want because I
hear this all the time I think Roger
gave me this line today it Rogers one of
those guys that outside of getting me in
trouble in Las Vegas with a TMT and by
the way from now on I'm only going out
with ena because Roger gets me in big
trouble the the you know the issue is he
always says when I talk to a guy I mean
that's like hey telling the doctor hey
I've got a friend that's got this issue
and in the and the issue usually is I
talked to this guy and he said he tried
your network at his man it didn't really
work my suspicion is most of those are
either third-hand sharing of information
or two to three-year-old information and
that what I want to do is I want to
answer those with for free let me just
try it let me just show you that it's
different and I think the hard part is
when you get that phone for seven days
and you go home and you go out every
night and it's not just a little faster
it's double and it's perfect what's
gonna happen make a lot of people are
gonna come even you you know I urge so
the the mobile the music freedom thing
is pretty interesting but from a net
neutrality perspective I think it's
problematic to treat a certain kind of
data differently than other data just
because it's music and I'm wondering if
you guys thought through those issues
and if
as a you know data first kind of company
if you think that's problem so you
actually think that somebody would have
a net neutrality problem with you giving
it to them for free thank you yeah I I I
don't agree
especially since you know if you have a
different service that you want and it's
being used we will put it it's a
technical inclusion in the process it
takes a short period of time to get the
appropriate site get the URL figure out
how to whitelist it and get it on the
network so it's more so than that our
idea is to give free streaming of music
to everybody and I I don't I don't
foresee the uncarrier x' issues and what
we're doing with the industry being
other than something that the proponents
of net neutrality would really be
supportive of and by the way other than
surrounding unreal with our new
partnership with Rhapsody there's no
commercial relationship between us and
any of these top providers there's some
technical integration to make sure that
we really do get that data intercepted
and set it for free but there's no you
know this is being paid for by t-mobile
we're providing this service to our
customers and our North Star is our
customers I mean these principles are
important we respect them the customer
is our North Star
hi Yan Dawson from jag door research a
lot of the data out there suggests that
it's video rather than music that's the
major consumer of bandwidth on networks
and that if you bump up against your cat
that's much more likely that's because
you're using YouTube or Netflix or Hulu
rather than a music service so I'm
curious to kind of get your take on a is
that what you're seeing on the t-mobile
network and B would you consider doing
something similar for video in future
yeah I mean let's let's be clear right
clearly video uses more than streaming
music quite a bit more and I think I've
made my comments clear about the young
guy in the AT&amp;amp;T family that was
searching porn the you know so so one
step at a time I think what we are doing
is we are pointing out and this free
streaming of music is amongst other
things it's an attempt to get people to
think differently about their data
service you know provider and to if they
bump up against their data caps they are
far more likely to be AT&amp;amp;T or Verizon or
Sprint customers than ours because as
we've already pointed out between 61 and
a hundred percent more data per user on
us so we want this debate to take place
we want the questions of unlimited and
as you know we offer an unlimited data
service for a price that's something the
other guys don't do so we want the
debate pretty clearly to provide
something right now that was free video
would have far bigger implications on
even us so I think you know the answer
the question and but we're certainly
open to moving people to our unlimited
plan which will take care of their data
but who knows when I'm Neville's age and
we're doing uncarrier 22 I mean
anything's anything's possible
I appreciate you participating and bring
my son to work there
but as of tomorrow Mike will be going
back to school
awesome show Thanks great excited about
the music I was gonna ask the video
question but I actually have another
question related is there any way you
can make it such that we can actually
configure which music services we want
in our you know in our dashboard on the
team website for those of us who maybe
use some more obscure ones that's
high-wire yeah we'll have to think about
that I think the you know the mechanism
we're putting in place is now let's have
folks vote a vote about what are the
most popular services they want to see
us you know drive that free streaming to
so I mean that starts that and we'll see
I mean I think we can take can be very
fun yeah we'd have all the ones I want
and not other ones would probably win in
the poll you'll list much okay just to
get the gist of what we're about I would
have no problem with that and it
certainly is our intent the the only
reason we've done you know the first
group and then we're having the contest
is it's it's a simple process of getting
connected with the provider providing
the URLs figuring out what the you know
what the services that's coming down
whitelisting it on our network and
getting it set up but if there was a way
to do that an automated fashion would be
all for it we have every intent of
moving every streaming service that
people use over to this but I have no
get-together never know I know what I
got to do tomorrow but we listen I don't
want I do want you to understand that's
how we think to test drive going to
effect and then what happens if I return
a phone after on day nine or
and break it or something like that so
it starts on Monday
that's when the first time you can order
a phone is on Monday when you go to
tmobile.com/the pre-registration page up
tonight but Monday is when you can
enroll there's gonna be a little bit of
a grace period so you know we know that
the way this works is you need to come
back to a store when you sign up by the
way we're going to show you some stores
that are near you and and you know you
can make sure that it's gonna be
convenient for you because you must
return the phone to one of our stores
and there's a little bit of a grace
period we're not gonna like slam your
your your credit card for $700 on
midnight of the seventh day we want to
make a great experience and a positive
experience for our customers if it's
similar to this question remember we're
not trying to make money on this right
we don't want to ring that card and have
a fight with you
we're not if you come in and the phone's
got a little scratch and we're not gonna
ding you for that and we want you to
have the test-drive return it and we
want you whether you come or not you
want we want you to think that was a
cool experience and you like us for
doing it and or you come in the store
and you you know you purchased something
else
so it's Monday how many how many of you
this is not for the people in the back
how many of you right now
here used other than t-mobile now don't
be shy okay and not view just quick how
many of you will ty try a test drive
okay and if it's way better how many of
you will switch okay it's not bad and
the rescue stupid or
or just wealthy or you want that
hologram
Roger yeah hey by the way you raised
your hand for all of those maybe see how
frequently can you use this program like
you know maybe today the network
coverage isn't great but six months from
now it is for like a customer who test
drives today or next week like how long
before they can get back on and do nail
wash on one test drive and then they're
done yep once per year per household or
credit card number once per year yeah
okay there's so many things that I could
say Roger so many you're so you're such
a glasses glasses half-empty guy dnews
love also from the tri-cities first time
attending one of your announcements and
as a corporate owner do we have
corporate plans for corporate companies
since most of these business owners down
here beat media if there's corporate
business plans one I raised my hand on
every one of those questions - yeah now
I'm not sure if I would change over yet
and I like your shoes and I'm not sure
I'll change over to your shoes he's
gonna give you his shoes the answer is
yes we do have a business-to-business
portion of the t-mobile test drive and
when you go to tmobile.com/the strive
there's a link for business customers to
the program works a little bit
differently instead of signing up and
having the phone come in the mail what
you're gonna do is sign up and you're
gonna be contacted directly by one of
our sales reps who will hand deliver the
phones you can have three phones not one
phone and it's for two weeks not one
week so it works a little bit
differently for business customers we're
gonna hand you the phones make sure that
everything's set up for you and then
personally collect them back after the
two weeks
so did you say this was your first to
announce we come to how not bad
you guys stay for the concert time
that's all guys got to stick together
I'm making any commentary on you look
what else hey thanks for taking the
question just wondering where things
stand on the potential merger with
Sprint and how the uncarrier initiatives
can be affected by that we had a pool
amongst ourselves on how many minutes it
would be before and it's always fun to
see how the question is prefaced you
know at least you were kind enough to
insert in the preface the rumored you
know I'm clearly I'm not gonna make any
comments son on rumor or speculation I I
think the things that are important to
me and I'd be glad to iterate on this
topic the second part of this topic with
any of you very important to me is that
this uncarrier movement will continue
and the competition in the united states
wireless industry I believe is much
better because t-mobile exists and I
think it's getting better all the time
now what what I think the United States
is getting a chance to see is what an
inkling of competition looks like and
what we are looking forward over the
next three to five years as a company is
as I said how do we get the scale in the
capital in the spectrum to make that map
blank and big 3d and continue to change
things in the industry and there are
multiple paths forward for this company
that our board considers one of them is
consolidation of the industry without
any comment on specific items but I can
tell you in anything we do it will be
about the uncarrier revolution and the
t-mobile company and brand getting
bigger and stronger and chain
in the industry
so we take take one or two more because
I know you're had a long day yes anyway
am I not going to take this question
look it I'd be dead I think you said
stuff I just wanted to make sure I heard
you correctly it's the iPhone 5s now but
someone also said it'll always be the
latest and greatest iPhone is that
correct so going forward greatest you
know we're not going to get into details
about the future after all there's no
future product that's been announced
you know we're waiting like everybody
else for details of what's next but the
intent is we want an Apple wants the
very best possible experiences for
people that's the way this has been
designed the philosophy of the program
is to put the latest hottest device into
your hands so you can experience the
device and the latest hottest devices
happen to maximize the experience on our
network so there's an interesting test
drive here by the way we have t-mobile
customers that have not migrated to the
latest devices and it's interesting our
own customers can test drive to see what
the experience is like with the latest
devices on our network yeah we're all
for that as well
cheat on us with yourself I mean I'm
come on we're in Seattle loosen up
anybody got one more okay
listen and I would also tell you we got
a little bit of time and I know some of
you were exhausted and want to go get
dinner or do something before we have
this event tonight we will hang around
we got a couple of media people to speak
to but well hey if some of you didn't
get a question you want to come up and
get a follow we'll hang around for a few
minutes and make sure you get that now
members of the media in the lobby area
you want to join us we've got an area
out there for an after if you know place
where you can get a drink and hang out
and you know write stories as long as
they're favorable if the stories are
negative you know you're you're going
out but what we also have for all of you
is a test drive phone so for for all of
the media we have a test drive phone for
you to pick up not you out there with
them Roger your test drive is beginning
and this press rooms available for you
as well now I would tell you please
