swimming with my watch
I sleep with one Apple's newest Apple
watch can now do at least two of those
things maybe three if you don't mind
charging by midday water resistance
that's what the new Apple watch is all
about it in addition to GPS this is 50
meters water resistant you can use this
while saltwater or fresh water swimming
it can also track swimming in open water
like this you can drop it in anything
anytime no worries
and it can track runs with onboard GPS
something that a lot of bands do
currently do but Apple's promises that
it can do it faster by using Wi-Fi
towers to acquire a bit quicker this is
an outdoors watch go get lost in the
woods with it wandering a swamp with it
it's extra bright display handles bright
Sun better it is super bright and won't
stay on all the time however like
Android wear watches are pebble and the
battery life still pretty similar a tiny
bit better in fact a lot of Apple watch
is still similar same design brand new
software though and it's faster Series
two comes in a variety of prices and
flavors so you're paying $100 extra for
an Apple watch Series 2 is swim proofing
GPS and a brighter display don't forget
there are other options you can always
upgrade to watch OS 3 on an existing
Apple watch and get faster better
performance or you can go to watch
series 1 something we haven't tested yet
a new Apple watch the Lexus one flipping
and GPS it supposed to be faster if you
want the best outdoors a sporty watch
that's Apple you might want to go with
this one series 2 is that Apple watch
sport should have been in the first
place
