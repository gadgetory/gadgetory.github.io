Morris and it's time to get loaded you
may already know that today is
Valentine's Day and there is no love
lost for Groupon the coupon site was
caught in a scam with FTD this weekend
FTD is the flower delivery site Groupon
was offering forty dollars worth of
flowers for just twenty dollars the
problem was that the group on site for
FTD was selling those flowers for
significantly more than they usually
sell for thereby making the deal not at
all a deal in fact the valentine's day
bouquet cost more through the groupon
page groupon responded by closing the
deal page who do they think they're
fooling sony has officially unveiled the
Xperia Play phone otherwise known as the
playstation phone we have been reporting
rumors of this phone for weeks and now
it's finally official it is an Android
phone with a 4-inch touchscreen and a
slide-out gaming control system that
looks a lot like the sony dualshock
controller games will be available
through a sony store the phone will
launch in the spring on verizon wireless
sony also launched two other noteworthy
phones at the Mobile World Congress in
Barcelona they are the experian neo and
the Xperia Pro they are candy bar
touchscreen phones the neo has a virtual
keyboard and the pro has a physical
keyboard both are Android phones LG

optimus 3d it's an android phone with a
1 gigahertz dual-core processor it has
twin 5 megapixel lenses that can take
photos and videos in 3d which can be

public offering late last week the
company is converting its preferred
stock into more than seventeen point two
million shares of common stock hoping to
raise
one hundred million dollars according to
the company the IPO will happen as soon
as practicable I don't know what that
means Bank of America may have had some
kind of security breach over the weekend
reports are that users were logging into
their accounts and seeing someone else's
financial information Bank of America
did not widely acknowledged this problem
but the company did tweet the online
banking was back up and running late on
Sunday and if you're thinking of popping
the question today it is worth noting
that Google now has a wedding planning

sites and google docs and also picnic it
