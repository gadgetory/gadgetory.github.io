the Apple buy for everything good and
bad inside the world of Apple let's get
to the show and a report from The Wall
Street Journal that Apple is now in
early talks with Comcast about the
possibility of a collaborative
television streaming service
now the proposed plan would be for
Comcast to provide preferential
treatment to an apple set-top box like
the Apple TV
allowing subscribers to stream live and
on-demand programs now apples box would
get priority and still continue to
stream smoothly as if users were
watching live TV even if other Comcast
connections are being hit with high
traffic and bandwidth issues again these
talks are very early Apple proposed a
similar plan to Time Warner that broke
down the locking down a deal like this
is very difficult
Plus Apple would still need to acquire
the rights to streaming programming from
networks and it would also require
significant upgrade to comcast current
infrastructure I like the idea of this
partnership at least it makes sense
unlike that a Facebook oculus rift
acquisition yikes but I don't expect it
to happen anytime soon
also billboard reports that Apple is
considering launching an on-demand music
streaming service similar to Spotify due
to declining music sales and this move
could also include an iTunes app for
Android in January music sales had
declined for the first time since the
iTunes Store open in 2003 with
individual song purchases dropping
almost 6 percent while Spotify Pandora
and YouTube have generated one point
four billion dollars in subscription
advertising and licensing revenue in
2013 a 39 percent increase Apple's
iTunes radio is station based like
Pandora and it's actually made me
purchase a few more tracks here and
there but they don't have a service that
lets you pick and choose your own music
to stream whatever you want the idea of
expanding iTunes with streaming is still
in the early stages but why not just do
something like offer an 8 to 10 dollar
monthly service this would be easy and I
think it's safe to say we could see this
happen in 2014
alright everyone has been waiting for a
MacBook Air with a Retina display and a
new report from digit Times claims that
this unicorn of a laptop from Apple will
be launched in the
second half of 2014 according to of
course their supply chain sources away
phone composting claimed new MacBook
Pros will be released in September of
this year alongside a retina err there
had been continued rumors of a super
slim 12-inch sized MacBook with a Retina
display since last year that's believed
to be this unicorn retina err but there
has been no real evidence to back these
claims up all right now when there isn't
that much news always turn to emojis if
you like emojis raise your hand like I'm
asking you right now raise your hand all
right Thank You Little Billy now you
also might notice emojis aren't the most
diverse group of media grams and what is
an ideogram you ask ideogram a written
symbol that represents an idea or object
directly rather than a particular word
or speech sound now you know well MTV
act sent an email to Tim Cook and
address the lack of diversity emojis
this is important stuff an apples VP of
worldwide corporate communications
actually responded saying we agree with
you our emoji characters are based on
the Unicode standard which is necessary
for them to be displayed properly across
many platforms there needs to be more
diversity in the emoji character set and
we have been working closely with the
Unicode consortium in an effort to
update the standard so I can't wait for
them to add the emoji for the Asian
person with bleached hair because look
it's pretty obvious they need one
speaking of additions Apple has added a
new section to its iOS app store called
sharing selfies and probably the worst
use of time ever for an Apple employee
this section includes apps like snapchat
and the Justin Bieber backed shots notes
never make a section for the app store
that has a Justin Bieber app and also
stop taking self-obsessed selfies
unless you're hot now this reeks of you
know what a bad apple alright til the
quick bytes iTunes radio gets its first
new streaming channel with an NPR
station that will stream 24 hours a day
they see live news with pre-recorded
segments from its staple of shows I love
this edition and it brings more of a
radio feel to the service and flappy
bird yes that game is set to return
according to creator don't go in
during the games developer conference a
fan ast√≠n win and he confirmed with a
yes but not soon which really makes you
think that he just messed with us from
the start
now unfortunately flappy brian was
unable to gain any traction the App
Store because most to play flappy Brian
