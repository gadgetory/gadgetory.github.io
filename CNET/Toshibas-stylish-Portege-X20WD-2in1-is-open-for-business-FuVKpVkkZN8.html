market but it's porter j:x 20w shows it
still knows how to make a good business
laptop the ultra portable two and one
starts around $1000 but can go up to
over 1500 if you load it with things
like a core i7 processor and 512 gig
solid-state drive since it is a two and
one you can use it as a laptop or a
tablet or anything in between and
included is a Wacom true pen so you can
draw and write on the 12.5 inch full HD
touchscreen and although it has just a
headphone jack and two ports one of them
is a USB 3.1 type-c with Thunderbolt 3
and Toshiba includes an HDMI adapter
with a type C port for data or charging
Toshiba rates the battery life at up to
13 hours and we got 10 hours on our
video streaming test and it lasted me
through a workday which is pretty good
considering it's very thin and weighs
under two and a half pounds the size
does mean the keyboard feels a bit
cramped and shallow and the trackpad is
small but you do get a fingerprint
reader built in there's also an IR
camera so you can log in with your face
or a finger using Windows hello and with
a high screen brightness and a matte
finish I had no problems with screen
glare again it just goes to show you
that Toshiba hasn't lost its touch when
it comes to business pcs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
