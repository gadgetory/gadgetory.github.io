host open tab and Joe I am so scared
what makes you so sure the commenters
every time I'm on the show they make fun
of everything my checkered shirts to my
sugary drink choices to the fact that it
looks like I've been doing my homework
when I'm just trying to read their
comments on the air Mike you're gonna do
fine you just need a little courage let
me give you this Joe what tha jo what is
this not just a dongle it's the courage
to move away from headphones and do
things the way Apple wants us Joe are
you kit wait I could do it yes I can do
it I have the courage I could host the
show it's gonna be great that's it now
where do i plug this thing on to listen
to some tunes seriously just get a
different phone from last year be easier
that way well that's all the time we
have for today
what's up welcome to open tab and I am
NOT Jeff Bakalar he is away on a likely
beautiful vacation far far away from the
iphone 7 my name is mike sorrentino and
this week i'll be taking the reins of
our conversation show where we talk
about the week in tech with you live on
livestream and youtube so join us right
now send us your questions and comments
right now in the YouTube chat John
staring at right now you send us a
questions using hashtag open tab and
we'll wrap them all up to answer you i
later in the show right now we're here
to of cnet's top audio experts executive
better david carr doy thank you so much
for being here thanks for having me and
returning to our show associate air just
in you thanks so much for joining us too
it's good to be back Mike awesome how
you doin my guys good so in crazy crazy
week and a half fish with like Apple
things sure I mean I mean the onslaught
of stuff obviously the release of the
actual and iphone 7 7 plus today so
people now have it in their hands yet
people are apparently in New York here
where breakdancing and the line one of
our colleagues offered eng was a took a
gif of the guys breakdancing apple store
employee specifically we're break
dancing while people are buying phones
and it always kind of you using me how
happy people get about buying expensive
gadgets i guess do they still have the
Apple employees that applaud you when
you come out yes at first that was the
first the first guy who buys a phoner
gal they pass through the whole day
another colleague of ours I was chatting
with Caitlyn she bought our phone this
morning too and there were people like
cheering people on as they were dropping
seven hundred dollars fools all of our
motors um oh yeah so the iphone 7 7 plus
they're now out in the wild and earlier
this week Scott Stein reviewed the
devices which now support water
resistance improved cameras and battery
life but as everyone expected over
rumors for months no headphone jack at
all instead they include an adapter and
Bluetooth audio support so you guys have
both spent a lot of time reviewing a
variety of headphones with without
headphone jacks when
announcement came out do you think
losing the port's a big deal nowadays we
have so many bluetooth audio uh devices
out there now I'll start yeah I think
it's a huge deal yeah I was really upset
by it i'm still wondering if there are
people that were shopping for the
headphone for the iphone that don't know
it doesn't have the headphone jack i'd
love to see that reaction even today but
yeah i think it's it's a huge deal even
though obviously apples not the first
company to release bluetooth earbuds I
just don't think that their version of
them are good enough to sort of warrant
that decision mmm I I actually disagree
i was a little bit concerned i thought
about it for a while i've written a
bunch of articles on it and in the end I
was like you know I don't think it's
that big a deal um partially because at
least there's someone I was more worried
they're going to charge thirty dollars
for the adapter at least they put it in
the box hopefully you don't lose it um
but and then you know I just think right
now the market is really swinging
towards wireless headphones anyway so
it's already over a fifty percent of
revenue or sales going to and that's
going to keep increasing and at least
now you know good wired headphone is
going to be a a wireless headphone a
bluetooth headphone but it's finally
bluetooth is finally getting to the
point where it actually sounds pretty
good Apple did that before when they
moved from 30-pin to lightning the
adapter for that was about i think
twenty to thirty dollars and this time
it's only nine dollars for that 3.55
into lightning but i was very much
expecting it to be thirty bucks and some
of the competitors which might get to a
little later they still charging thirty
to forty dollars and they I'd like
multiple lightning ports or an inline
remote to the thing yeah i mean i think
that apple's trying to make it as
seamless as possible to move people away
from it at the same time i think the the
benefits of not having it it's
supposedly there's a little bit better
battery life there's also the
waterproofing obviously there's phones
out there that have a headphone jack
that are still water
proof so the idea that you're getting
something in return you are getting that
second speaker I don't know how much of
a difference that makes butts gonna make
a little bit of difference but the idea
of selling that loss with another gain
they're trying their best to do that hmm
yeah the thing that the accessor that I
love the most I think you wrote about it
this week David was by a company called
spigen I wish we had them in the office
right now but it's an accessory that
attaches to your to ear paw ear pods and
it's basically just a Langley lanyard to
turn your bluetooth earbuds into a wired
earbud well it's an Aristo they call
that true wireless um true wireless
earphones what's the point of that is
that just for people that wanted dangle
and negligent acts out feelings yeah
they're like well I think people a lot
of people are afraid that they're gonna
lose them if they don't have to carry
around that case all the time is that
what it is I mean how much does that
thing like 30 bucks or something else No
ten dollars Oh ten dollars oh well it
will be ten dollars but the bridges
those air pods are going to be 160 170
dollars 59-59 awesome some 160 then the
and maybe it just gives that a little
more security if you in case you were to
lose or domina I also think that isn't
as big a problem with the air pauses
people think because you just I've been
using a lot of these totally wireless
earphones for last a few months and once
you put it back in the case you just put
in your pocket and they're stowed away
just like having headphones any case
what I will say is I think what people
are going to be shocked about is how
many people buy these air pots and then
use a single air pod as basically their
way of making calls like all those you
know they've sold literally millions of
LG tone neckband style headphones and
the idea what that is you can use them
as stereo buds but at the same time
you'll see a lot of people just pull a
butt up to use as a single
but to make calls so I mean I think I
think that's what's gonna surprise
people how many people end up you see
them wearing one of those things and
there's and you do need to put it back
into the case at least every couple of
hours to get that full 24 hours yeah I
mean I look I kate's charge of the
earbuds to the thing that I was really
surprised about what the air pods is
that you can't change the track by
touching a part of there's no button on
the actual air buds a lot we're going to
show a bunch of examples of bluetooth
earbuds that came out prior to the air
pods and those all have some way or
another to either control the volume or
change the track of both and I think
that's going to frustrate a lot of
people when they buy them to you spend
160 bucks you still have to pull out
your phone change the track or turn the
volume up I'm not so sure about I mean I
think it's more you know I think apples
focused on making them dead easy to
connect and stay connected in a very
reliable connection those are the two
things that are problematic with these
truly wireless so that's where
everything was focused so when you pull
one of these these buds out it is
connected to your phone you're done and
that is appeal it going to be appealing
to a lot of people yeah especially if
you have the entire ecosystem to I mean
it's not just your phone if you have
it's connected by iCloud right so if you
have ipad or you have a watch it'll
connect to all those automatically which
is pretty convenient too but you have to
have all those devices in order to buy
it I mean if anything people are going
to be possibly slightly disappointed by
the sound I think they sound fine but
because they're an open design first of
all they let some sound in so if you're
in a noisy environment you'll have some
sound leaking and also you're not going
to get a ton of base so if you're a base
lover I don't know if the air polish
going to be for you yeah you're
definitely trading convenience for a
sound alright so let's start off with
them some examples for the headsets that
you guys have tried out what I want some
headphones that are like on the lower
end a little more affordable that would
be compatible compatible with a phone
like the iphone 7 or the Moto Z that
doesn't have a headphone jack but it's
still wireless and would be easily able
to connect to multiple devices which
David's been testing water well this one
this one I just got yesterday it's just
coming out now
from from ifrogz it's a sports headphone
its water resistant has a little magnet
so you clip it onto your shirt and it
gets better a little bit better it gets
better battery life because it you can
put everything here so gets about 10
hours of battery life and then you you
would either clip it onto your shirt so
hope I stay secure that way i can t
shirt and then you put it you know you
then you put it in your ears and they
fit pretty well they're lightweight $35
you might seem pretty good even a little
bit cheaper they sell they sound pretty
decent so i think um there's going to be
a ton of these types of headphones
hitting the market you're talking about
25 $35 there's already a bunch of
Chinese wireless headphones out there
these are the ifrogz summit it's a
sports model they also ifrogz has a
bunch of other ones they sell a lot of
headphones in the you know Walmart the
drug stores you'll see these cheap head
they sell a lot of cheap headphones in
places you you know not best but not the
apple store so these are going to
actually start sounding okay and work
pretty well for very little money I
think the advantage of some of the other
ones that David brought to he brought
the dash here by braggy and that's
version 1 they have a second version
coming out pretty soon too but the
advantage you get by not buying the air
box is that a lot of these third-party
manufacturers have wireless earbuds that
also do more than just listen to music
these also have fitness features
built-in right yeah there then the
higher end then these are three hundred
dollar yes yes for cheap ones I give him
some cheap ones but they're there these
actually fit really well and with the
issue with Bragi is a German company
when it first came out the some of the
features didn't work so well they didn't
they weren't staying connected well and
they roggies come out with a series of
software updates and now they're good uh
so and then they're coming out with a
less expensive model um just called the
headphone they start on Kickstarter yeah
I mean they're there
this this took a while to come out and
if you know there were delays but it is
now a very good truly wireless headphone
the other one I've been playing around
with is this company called Erato and
they make these buds here I put the
wings on them they're also totally
wireless then these are totally wireless
and they fit they fit well in your the
key again is they stay the wireless
connection between them is reliable they
stay connected they sound pretty good
and they'll stay in your ears and they
slip into this case and i haven't lost
yet i've been using for a couple weeks
and then you just jam it in and this is
also it these these come with their own
charging cases like the apple so there's
power inside of the case as well see it
has a battery and it can charge it a few
ctrl G said to these a lot of these
headphones are only about three to four
hours of battery life but when you put
them in the case they start charging
they turn off automatically pull them
out these actually have a little control
on me on the bud themselves and then
there's the one of the original ones
also was these another company called
ear in I reminds you of the men in black
camera can flash it or Apple pencil
that's oh those are earbuds you pull out
yeah and this is a swedish company i
believe this does not have a microphone
and at the both of Bragi and the arado
have a microphone for making calls but
this one hasn't gotten as good reviews
but it definitely has a sleek design and
if it my ears and it's it's probably
going to come down in price a lot of
these because of the air pods you know
these were these are two 279 dollar $300
headphones but with the air pods I would
suspect they'll start having to come
down more towards $200 some of the
premium models but they're that the most
important thing is basically that they
stay connected to your phone and the
buds themselves staking it don't drop
out there with Bluetooth you so you're
always going to get some dropouts the
brog ease use and new
jabra coming out use actually some a
technology that is found in hearing aids
that communication that doesn't they the
actual connection between the buds as a
magnetic connection is not via bluetooth
so there's some point we're trying to
figure out how Apple is doing its
connection to the iphone they made they
may be doubling up on the Bluetooth
connection for each but some of these
headphones are using actually hearing
aid technology to make them more do you
find the ones that come in cases they
fit well in our pockets I'm depicted
upses sort of like the size of a lighter
in a way a little thicker than that yeah
i mean i was a little worried it was
gonna slide out if I was in a cab or
something like it out and I dropped on
the floor I'm grabbing it it's
definitely a little slippery doggies
pretty big I don't know if you get this
is that in your pocket all the time yeah
that's that's that's a you know definite
first gen product but I suspect their
new model which I don't really like the
name the headphone I'm going to compare
it to this other one and then here is an
iphone 6s plus so we happen to have on
set it's pretty pretty chunky so you had
these like lined up in your pocket but
they all they're coming all different
streets and sizes yeah I mean I mean
obviously the case also one would assume
would have a bigger battery and if it's
a little bit heavier so you know I think
you'll see coming all all shapes and
sizes and just inform a couple heads up
that you headsets that you tried out I
actually wanted to show this one off
it's not wireless at all but this is
another way to output really good
quality sound from your iphone 7 even
though it doesn't have a headphone jack
obviously the three-and-a-half
millimeter to lightning dongle comes in
the box but if you want to bypass the
DAC inside the phone and get really good
quality sound out of your iphone 7 you
can buy this it's by a company called
audioquest it's called the dragonfly
it's about the size of a USB key and
when you pop off the cap hear what you
have to do is buy this it's 100 bucks
but then if you plug this into
another adapter which is the iphone
camera adapter it's lightning to USB
plug this into that is that it has i
think that was thirty bucks to i bought
it this week and it has a headphone jack
on the other side and when you combine
those you get a slightly larger dongle
than you know what you would get with
that but i think the audio benefits are
excellent you convert it to 24 bit it's
a saber DAC inside of this thing it's
really small and compact so for the
audio files out there that still want to
output really good sound from your
iphone 7 i think this is the best
solution there are there are also
smaller versions of that a lightning
cable with it a smaller DAC in it so
that that's a little bit clunky dunno it
was actually a lot smaller than most of
the headphone amps that you have to
bring around a lot of them no but not
the vid eyes and put its own and they
come with a rubber band that you have to
attach the back of it so if you're
looking for a portable note i would i
would leave the room now and get the 1i
have them on my desk of the deal it's a
kickstarter but it basically I think
it's called I amp but it's the amp is
built into the remote control yes as
long as a smaller I just think when you
start having you know that's actually
designed to plug into your laptop right
right it's sort of a hack that me and
tied put together for the iphones so
there was there will be other deck and
some companies are already have
lightning cables for their headphones
but i think that we will see all kinds
of accessories so bluetooth or not when
you get when what what do you think
people should look at when they're
looking at headphones to buy what do you
think are important aspects of it should
be looking at may sound quality versus
portability what do you like to look for
when you're looking for something for a
new headphone to buy for yourselves i
always look for sound quality first i
think with bluetooth you're always going
to get a little bit although bluetooth
sounds a lot better than it did a couple
years ago it's still not going to sound
as great as a wired headset so I'm still
sort of in the Steve Guttenberg world of
audio files with that I always prefer
why
set over Bluetooth but you know these
the bluetooth wireless earbuds are
always a good solution to your just
going to pay for the convenience of it I
I mean I think people look I personally
I do listen to wired headphones but if
I'm on the go I prefer a wireless
headphone and then at that point I'm
looking first at the style whether it's
in ear on here over here there's
obviously a whole bunch of headphones
out there there now bluetooth with noise
cancelling the bose so nice and Heiser
parent there's that's a big category for
sort of the people who want the noise
canceling business travelers in the
streets of New York I tend to like to
have a smaller profile unless it's
winter then I'll go for the the earmuffs
drives me nuts but those bluetooth
headphones that sometimes when i try
them out i'll lose a little bit of
quality in terms of like hiccuping do
you find that on the higher end the
bluetooth headphones sort of do they
have a better connection or they stood
up that problem remain no matter what
it's getting better you know with each
with each version of bluetooth they're
addressing a few different things one is
the quality of the connection so when
you go from bluetooth 3.0 then we're
around four point four point one four
point two there's also there's that
reliable reliability of the connection
battery life and then bandwidth which
sound quality so with each iteration
that gets a little bit better so it is
definitely gotten better with the latest
ones Bluetooth five-point Oh we'll
probably see the release it at the end
of this year and we'll see it in devices
in 2017 so that will get it even better
and evie I'd shout out light the
Lightning of the ones that connect
directly to lightning do they have any
better quality than three-and-a-half
millimeter headphone jack I I think
you'll see with lightning you really
have to have a really good pair of
headphones I just don't think it's going
to make a huge difference with you know
an average
headphones and it it sometimes it
there's a question of whether it sounds
better or just different but I think if
you're trying to drive you know a higher
end headphone it has some sort of deck
in the actual cable there's a company
called Odyssey that makes it something
called the sign headphone and that comes
with its own cypher lightning cable and
you know I think you know I had a
discussion with ty about what he thought
sounded better than the analog
connection or the digital and I think it
a lot of times it can be you know some
people prefer one of the over the other
the cool thing about the Lightning port
2 is that it can obviously transport
data and power at the same time so we're
already starting to see earbuds that
have a built-in noise cancellation and
then you're going to start to see more
of those smaller noise-cancelling
headset sigh don't have to have a big
bulky battery pack in them and those
will start to shrink too so I think it's
going to be a really exciting year for
headphones so we got some interaction in
our chat so if you are on our YouTube
keep chatting away I am watching by the
way as well as a tweeting us at open
hashtag open tab on Twitter Andrew
rights and he doesn't he doesn't feel
like losing a headphone jack as a deal
breaker he's been using wireless
headphones and Bluetooth in his car for
years Jim in our YouTube chat right now
well something a little similar he's
been using wireless music since the
first mini ipod 2004 which i'm not even
shortly I guess he had an adapter and
then went over to bluetooth in 2006 so
people that say they are going to miss
heaven jack is it's ancient wenzel
rights to us saying he thinks this paves
the way for high-def music on iPhones
the headphone jack restricted iphones
ipods to 16-bit 44 kilobits is that
sound about right do you think we work
well we'll get so yeah a little bit
earlier but yeah you just gonna come
from that it you will but at the same
time again you're gonna need really
high-end headphones to hear the
difference in my opinion so
Oh most people are not necessarily
buying those headphones and if you're an
audiophile I don't know if you're
necessarily want to use your iPhone as
you're so yeah you know it they can
market it as it you know these are high
res headphones or these are you know but
again that the actual quality the
quality sound is also just dependent on
just how good the headphone is all right
gentlemen thank you so much for joining
us today to talk about this is not going
to end anytime soon because I phone just
dropped today so there's probably like a
whole wave of new headsets that are
going to be taking advantage of this
over time and there's certainly
certainly air pods we have the beat
stuff coming out pretty soon too so
there's obviously going to be some
interesting when when those new models
come out in the next few weeks we'll see
how people attached to those mm all
right David were so weird saying goodbye
to you Justin you're hanging out for the
longer David where can people follow you
on twitter david carr annoy at david
carr boy awesome and follow these guys
for more and more audio news over the
next several months so we're going to go
to break and I think we're flipping over
to a review of the air pots and so we
will see you very shortly
Apple's air pods are independently
charging wireless buds that come at
their own little dental floss light case
now there are a lot of earphones that do
this and are independently connected
that attach to your head a couple of
companies make them apples can be used
for music or phone calls and the
microphones actually sound really good
with built-in noise cancelling mics in
each and the air pods coolest trick is
that it auto connects with iPhones iPads
Apple watch and Max you need to have
apple's latest software iOS 10 or mac OS
sierra to use it pair once use it across
all your things and it switches as
devices are switched so the idea is keep
them in walk to your next device keep
going keep those air pods in your ears
they even start and stop automatically
now i would have liked a little bit of
remote built into them right now you can
only double tap to get Siri wireless
earbuds again they're not new and apples
while sounding good look completely
ridiculous if you can get over that you
might like them but what's most
interesting is the trip inside that new
w one ship Apple's been talking about it
does all the handshaking via bluetooth
imagine that in a smart home gadget a
speaker a lamp a car from watches to
earphones to who knows what else Apple's
deep in wireless accessories now you're
not necessarily going to want to buy air
pods but you'll want devices that
seamlessly work just like this
Julie the race on welcome back to open
tab and now on the couch and cracking
open the beer immediately I fake dr.
Joseph Kaminski cheers are what's yours
who it's been a long day long a week and
a half some of our colleagues recovering
between Apple last week PlayStation
which the whole other ball of wax up
show Jeff will get back on when he gets
back from to talk about video games
where'd you dig about the PlayStation
Brooke it was sleeping I know it the
those two devices the Pro and the
slimmer exactly what I expected them to
be but I could never seen a sleepier
press conference from Sony but you know
it was sleepy but the one thing I will
respect unlike Apple did indoors oh man
I wish some of these remaining the word
magical Oh God was vocal amazed magical
is not real okay that's for D&amp;amp;D into
anyone I appreciate what I appreciated
from Sony it was to the point here's a
device here the specs here's a release
date I like that in and out um when I
get one I doubt it unless it has some
sort of enhancements with the vr vs the
current system our colleagues in San
Francisco they made a video as on the
scene at YouTube channel if you're
watching us on that right now and it's
essentially sort of an ad lib game where
they showed every year I'm saying then
the blank iphone is the most blank ever
advanced magical every supra you think
I'll say that for the intel processor
nvidia graphic cards it's always there
best one i mean that's that's kool
progression just you know do you have an
adjective that you heard a press release
the press conference in nature's go are
you kidding me uh it's not an adjective
but courage made me kind of buffer yeah
that's why we wrote that schedule
encourage more thing for samsung job to
said that before but i felt like he kind
of pulled it off I don't know about
Chile I feel like he did courage yes
courage okay today's cover nine dollars
yeah I don't know about that courage
thing either it's just but you bought
the iphone so you well I like I i well
thing it sorry I don't even know was
drinking the kool-aid it's I think a lot
of people what they forget is once
you've had a certain device for over X
amount of years hmm I probably have more
money in apps and music then the device
is actually worth you get locked to it
that way and I said this before and I'll
say it again yeah if you want somebody
to move over I think a great way would
be maybe if you gave them an incentive
like hey just switching from an iphone
to android or vice versa here's a
hundred dollars to get you started on
your app library or if app developers
actually gave you a discount if you own
their app on a different platform that
would make it easy to transition and
also just a convenience and yes I just
just like I you know I go back and forth
for graziano because he likes to do all
the customization stuff I just need to
pick up my phone and use it I guess as
you get older you have less time do
these little things you know when you
get older like is icy to pick it up and
I need to figure out where i put this
button or that blender yeah what color
will crazy live wallpaper killing my
battery etc so it's it's it's a
preference thing it's a comfort thing
it's also your meats what meets your
needs I had a comment on one of our
Facebook post saying oh the photo you
took had no headphone jack here's the
iphone 7 it's on sale starting today and
no headphone jack I mean it's black you
probably can't see it to be honest but
speaker speaker lightning I means but
it's motorola did it wasn't such a big
deal i guess you know it's it's it's a
bigger deal because apple is the direct
competitor and you know depending on
your perspective apples the bad guy or
samsung the bad guy and those are the
two that's your luke and your Darth
Vader everybody else is like an Ewok my
question really is what are we going to
see in the future for Apple devices do
you think that they're gonna get rid of
the headphone jack on iPads is the next
book will say no bad not have a
headphone jack because that's really
gonna piss people off Lee well because
if you know there's a lot of video
editors out there that are doing sound
on their machines you give it to the
headphone jack well i think i think my
disappointment with the removal of the
headphone jack was I thought that would
allow them to make it thinner though
that's not really necessary yeah but I
mean if you're going to remove it do
something like that I personally haven't
noticed that big of a battery jump that
warrant the removal of it i mean great
the stereo speakers but you know what
HTC did it with the you know what their
phone with the stereo speakers in the
front and you still had your headphone
jack there's a way
work around it I think though actually
with this non physical button now
they're just they do tend to treat
people like their little ignorant their
prayer I think they're personally
prepping them with this this this this
this um like the macbook button so
eventually you remove the home button or
the home at home circle and you start
using 3d touches the home button I think
just teaching everybody how to use the
pressure-sensitive mechanism with the
haptic feedback I think that's probably
where they're having people do Apple
does tend to treat people less
intelligent but it also makes a lot of
people feel intelligent when they can
open up their phones they look what I
can do if people actually feel like
they're magical it's a damn phone I'm
we'll see I guess and they get in a year
if it does indeed go that route yeah so
Joey we got to get down to business fun
business okay I'll do it but we got
another edition of wait for it Joanne
today Joey tell us what you have well
I'm just I'm just trying to lift this up
into my lap while they look at the demo
this is from the darts factory this is
the goose to dart board I mean shoot me
the goose square at dart board it is a
digital dartboard with LED lights it has
multiple gameplay modes where you can
actually play locally with multiple
players you know typical cricket or
count up but a nice feature with this is
you can also play someone else somewhere
else in a game of darts so Brian
actually came up with an excellent idea
say hey we should get one of these here
in New York we already have one in New
York but get one in San Francisco and
maybe you know a little Joe versus
tongue action going on this don't
actually have they're not just sharp
know so they're not yet then yeah yeah
so they're not short starts there
they're plastic tip darts and I would
recommend buying an extra pack because
we had some pretty aggressive dart
players in the office yesterday
everything breaks but the tips obviously
didn't screw and they screw out there
waited if you want to hold it um it
comes with this face plate but they're
five different face plates it's magnetic
so you can evoke magnetically comes off
there's a blue purple pink
and I think maybe are red and I had
mother in the Indian well the cut the
plate the faceplates give you it's
actually nice this way the face plates
can be purchased for like 25 bucks this
particular model dart board I saw an
Amazon for 245 what's special about this
is for all you iphone or android or iOS
users it works at both KitKat and up the
app this is that there's a sidekick app
that actually keeps the score um so it
works with KitKat nut bluetooth 4.0 and
iOS 7 and up and it either works on four
double A batteries but I think what
really what really impressed me and of
course is an imported dart board from
the dartboard factory is in the box that
came with it they give you not only a
measuring tape where you can measure to
hang it they give you a sticker pad we
you can stand back and with the plug
they give you a plug for America you
know and pretty much all around the
world and you can run it via the outlet
or or from the battery so we just want
to leave it plugged in all the time you
know if the pie batteries take it off
the wall another thing is the
instruction chart which is really cool
that comes with it has markings so you
can measure up and you can literally and
it comes with the screws to hang it so
you put the screws in here and you just
rip it off the wall and put so you
measure when you put the paper you put
the screws through the paper I'm sorry
showing you guys were so gentle you
measure where you put it and then you
can just rip the paper off the wall and
just hang the dartboard right there and
you're you're good to go in terms of the
app and the dart board yeah if I just
yesterday I can flick it on I just
turned it on you can also control the
LED lights when you turn it on and then
you can use sorry this is cnet's iPad
not mine so before anybody goes crazy in
the chat right let's have a salon so
it's like this is the app
and the at make sound effects with the
dart sitting as well right so it has
begins of this vanish you flip it up
sorry it's loading so it's loading and
you know you got your guests name you
can slide I think I created seen it they
put C hardy music in there yeah the idea
here is that two people have the dart
boards you can play the same time so
yeah so if you have one at home and I
have one at home we could play each
other or we could play locally so you
just go to settings and you go like the
option dart board connected dart board
it'll connect to the dart board ya see
connected you can go back and you go new
game cricket get your choice a game you
can pick like cricket next then it
creates a game I want to add a player
very simple somebody has an account i
could put their account in there i could
just go guest and i can add another one
guest and then I can start game and
connects the dartboard or create the
game then here it highlights the
person's turn and you can bring up the
menu here the person skip or thrusted
are you can go back next to the next
person options and it keeps everybody
score here and what you need to hit also
what the dart board does is under if you
can see it in the studio likes but it
lights up where you need to hit you see
it if I twist it it lights up where you
need to shoot I think so you know you're
aiming for so it's it's it's really cool
it's really cool arms guys have fun with
it yes a we broke it off at third
Thursday yeah mr. McGee and our chat has
written do you get dart DLC that's bad I
don't know if their beauty dart DLC but
um it's it's it's it's a really cool
product um how much is that this
particular one is I saw like it for 245
on amazon um there's the sigma which is
the step below this it doesn't it
doesn't come with the overlays it's just
a completely circular dart board yeah it
doesn't have all the LEDs you know it's
it's like the LX it's lacking extras
this is this is the crème de la crème
but it's a really nice unit it's yeah I
mean I haven't bought a dart board
before but sure
54 door he'll die boy weren't you just
showing eyes like a hundred feet but
weren't you just showing me like pieces
of wire for music for like two hundred
dollars really different though but is
it really your headphone to just you how
many people can you play darts with I
mean question what they were spent yeah
it depends on how much you value having
a scoreboard on your tablet essentially
right if you can't hey add yourself
which I'm terrible bath I mean I could
use something like that yeah I just
don't know if I value it at 250
personally it does look pretty cool
though it is cool and I mean hey if you
can make a cheaper one go get it go get
your Kickstarter going no but I
personally think it's cool I haven't
personally seen many other than this so
I couldn't tell you if it's too high or
not yeah but i mean it's it's cheaper
than a lot of things you find it is the
new Playstations four hundred dollars
you know you got your own you got game
boy you know the 3ds is like 179 so the
mean when you talk about like Roger
you're always hitting around the 200 all
tomorrow that seems to be the sweet spot
paid for businesses mr. McBee then wrote
back after reset talked to his question
that if he owned a pub that this would
be his go-to no doubt it well I won
another nice thing is that if you know
like let's say like you know I'm a
family man you know I'm not saying you
can't take someone's eye out but at
least a plastic dart you're not piercing
the skin that's true yeah you can
actually you can actually play with the
young ones and not worry about anything
really dangerous happening other than
but let everybody play with like glasses
and everybody's like you know they're
impervious um so how's your dart game
game it's better when I drink more or
maybe I think it's been I think I think
it is better at pool and darts I think
seem to be a little better for me when I
drink but have to be right at that that
that magic spot yeah like not not like
going up the hill but not too many trade
yeah what is I'll tend to focus better
yeah i'ma go can we get this physical I
just checking through our comments of
the chat one more time to see if is
anything else we scooped through there
was a fight over samsung while we were
chatting so the note 7 let's just talk
about that really briefly i believe is
about a hundred thousand people in
america have done the recall return
maybe 800,000 ish to go Lynn saying I
mean you have you had a phone that
overheated so much they just couldn't
use it any
I've had phones overheat where they shut
off I had that happened a long time ago
it wasn't anything to reflect on the
brand itself because i had i had an HTC
evo 3d when they came out and the the
aluminum rimming on the metal rimming
started peeling yeah and at that time I
had like the insurance for it so like a
dummy I should just glued it and kept it
I took at the sprint they swapped it out
for me and they gave me a refurb and
that thing was just getting so hot it
was shutting off I was like damn i
shoulda stayed where I was that was as
bad as I've ever seen it what happens
with iPhones to I mean if you use your
phone or put in your in your pocket on a
really hot summer day sometimes we'll
take it out and won't even turn on
because yeah give me that message was I
think that also I was like when an app
gets when a nap hangs yes it gets really
hot but it's never gotten so bad on
iphone for me now yeah it had to send it
back I i yes i have to say that people
probably get upset but that's probably
the reason why nobody can find an iphone
7 plus because everybody returned their
note 7 is it is like dude this is
exploding i need a phone i can't get on
a plane I'd your phone i'm gonna play
with yeah i just want to say hi to bail
