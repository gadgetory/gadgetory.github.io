appliances and right now we're taking an
up-close look at the technical mocha
master KBT 741 coffee maker the first
thing you're gonna notice about the
mocha master is it's very mid-century
modern artistic design which definitely
has lots of clean lines and it's very
striking and it certainly will look very
handsome on your countertop for two
hundred and ninety-nine dollars though
this coffee machine certainly doesn't
come cheap looking closely at this
coffee machine you're gonna see it has
this main tower section inside here is a
very powerful heating element which has
the capability to heat water from the
reservoir up to 200 degrees or hotter
and that is something that is critical
in brewing extremely delicious coffee so
this baby definitely meets the sca a
brewer guidelines for making delicious
drip coffee as well as the European
standards for the same method of coffee
brewing in our tested also consistently
delivered delicious coffee as a matter
of fact it often delivered outstanding
coffee and it also does it within six
minutes or less it may sound silly but
one of the coolest things about this
coffee machine and something I
personally like is that within this
clear reservoir there's a channel in
here where the water travels from the
reservoir down into the heating chamber
and there are bubbles that come up all
the way up through here while it's
brewing it has this sort of retro lava
lamp effect it's something that's very
mesmerizing and I love it
so like I said before the technical
mocha master is certainly expensive it's
easily $100 more than many of the other
coffee makers you're gonna see in the
store also it is a bit bulky it's kind
of large its tall you have to watch out
for the height of this guy especially if
you have tight cupboard space or not
much room on your kitchen counter tops
so if you want to spend a little less I
suggest you buy the Bonavita
1800 TS which for about $100 less offers
the same level of coffee brewing
performance
I'm Brian Bennett foreseen it appliances
