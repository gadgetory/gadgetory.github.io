watch is here oh my god oh my god
beautiful guys she's beautiful what are
you doing huh are you looking your watch
no Mitch um look just the Apple watch
just came some I'm just checking out to
Brandi look it's pretty cool it's a new
watch so uh it's pretty cool dude yeah
yeah freak no I'm just checking out the
watch man it's like a river wash
what's good brian Tong here and welcome
to the apple pie for all the good of bad
inside the world of Apple and yes i have
my Apple watching I've been using it for
about a week now and I'll be honest I do
like it more than I expected to but we
breaking it all down more next week now
there's lots of goodies this week thanks
to apple releasing the new macbook pro
15-inch with the all-new force touch
trackpad now a few things here to note
these are still using the current
Haswell chipset and not broad wheel so
you won't really see a huge speed bump
instead the biggest performance gains
you'll see is flash storage that's two
and a half times faster and an extra
hour of battery life pricing still
starts at 1999 now the new iMac 5k
brings a fat price cut dropping from
2499 to 1999 but the entry-level model
cpu speed drops from a three point five
gigahertz to a 3.3 and the Apple touted
fusion hard drive is replaced by a
standard one terabyte drive now you'll
see a dip in performance and there's no
option to upgrade this unless you jump
up to the 2299 model now that pretty
much refreshes the entire macbook
macbook air and pro lines and the imac
line for 2015 and it's a safe bet we
won't see them at WWDC but see that
leaves the door completely open for the
new apple TV set-top box and it
definitely won't be the apple TV TV we
started talking about back in 2012
according to a recent story by The Wall
Street Journal Apple shelved the plans
to make a TV set more than a year ago
after its search for breakthrough
features that would justify an
apple-branded TV set Apple considered an
ultra high-def display and adding sensor
equipped cameras for viewers to make
calls through their TV but none of it
was compelling enough for them to enter
the market against the big boys like
Samsung and LG now according to combined
reports Apple's now focus on a
redesigned Apple TV set-top box with
their trackpad remote their own online
TV streaming service and App Store
series support and hooks to home kit to
act as the center for the home for
people in the Apple ecosystem now
internally the new Apple TV hardware is
said to be codenamed Jay 34 and the
operating system is known as monarch
tied a new version of xcode also
includes a new feature called TV
for developers to build third-party
Apple TV apps and really that's the
product I'm looking forward to seeing
the most at WWDC this year all right an
Apple watch news Tim Cook confirmed to
employees during a recent trip to apples
China headquarters that the company is
aiming to have the Apple watch available
to purchase in Apple stores by June in
multiple countries also the first update
for the Apple watch was recently
released watch 0 s 1 point 0 point 1
includes bug fixes for Siri and better
measuring of activities like standing
calculating calories and distance for
different activities and workouts it
also supports the new emojis found in
iOS 8.3 and provides additional language
support users can also really look
forward to the next big update after
9to5 mac reports features like find my
watch will allow a user to track its
location and remotely wipe it if it's
stolen there will also be an optional
feature internally called smart lisheen
that will let you know if you
accidentally leave your watch behind
since you can't go anywhere without your
Apple watch all right onto the bites
Apple took their merry time with this
one in by Mary time I mean three years
later they have finally released their
new iphone dock with lightning connector
for 39 bucks it's compatible with the
iphone 5 5 s 6 and 6 plus and the fifth
generation ipod touch which still sees
no signs of getting a major update
anytime soon and i know a lot of you are
sad about that also reuters reports the
US appeals court has partly reversed
apple's 930 million dollar patent
settlement with samsung and may reduce
it to around 548 million they found that
violating the patents deserve the
penalty but making a phone that had the
same general appearance as the iphone
was not a violation and check this out
universal studios released their first
trailer for the Aaron Sorkin written
biopic Steve Jobs and here's a peek from
it the musicians play the instruments I
play the orchestra
I said Mirage and invented the future
because artists lead and access for show
of hands now you can tell it has a
facebook the movie feel to it there's
drama and tension just in this trailer
and I'm definitely going to see it but
it has not been confirmed if the entire
movie was shot using an iphone all right
now on the apple byte we got some great
not-so-great mean and straight-up
idiotic comments from you every episode
on YouTube specifically youtube so we
wanted to shine a light on our favorite
feedback of the week and this week it
goes out to trip maschmeyer who said
screw you Brian for being a warriors fan

gonna do for this we show you can email
me at the Apple by to cnet com or tweet

my dolphin trainee lessons thanks for
