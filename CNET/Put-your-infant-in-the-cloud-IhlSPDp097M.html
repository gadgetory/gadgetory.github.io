at CES unveiled and we're going to look
at this scale to weigh baby's fault yes
indeed small baby scale my wife is okay
tell me about this product when my child
was born I brought her to the to the
supermarket we put her on this scale
yeah so what we are presenting it for
the very first time we are very proud to
introduce a small baby scale so it's
basically a no baby scale let me show it
looks like a very regular baby scale
with the basket I just you know started
to eat here for you and it's waiting my
baby so so far so good very simple to
operate I can even update the head of
the of the trial so by just like sliding
it here let me show you how so you get
now the wait 10 grams precision and let
me update now by just lining it a few
centimeters inch the baby all this
information is now recorded and it's
transmitting a real time yeah Wi-Fi or
Bluetooth wireless directly to the child
profile and so as you see here I get a
live phone it's the same with an iphone
android or any internet-connected
computer so real time Cushing's
information so i do not have to tell you
know on beforehand any kind of
application and you get the measurement
here it's thought direct is the
application and you get an update graphs
of the way i understand the advantage of
a regular scale is you can keep track of
the weight and maybe you see how your
baby's grown over time and have some
records right yes it keep track but
first also maybe understand you get the
measurement but it compare it with
recommended value for this exact age so
get more information i see this is not
in the American system when is it
available here how much is the cost yeah
it's very first time so it will be in 22
2012 in pounds displaying pounds and it
will retail for around 150 girls and
we're working people buy it so I hope
you will be able to buy it in a lot of
retail our product already sold in Apple
Sora at best buy for the former product
so let me show also just such it's both
product in in one
it's a baby scale but you can remove the
baby basket and it turns you to a total
scale so really the basket when the baby
grows up yeah you get the second product
you know adjustable within very simple
because I just remove this get your baby
basket and you know that it's displayed
the screen upside down because it's a
sustaining scale now for the kids and
all the information obviously keeps
recording and grasping on the same
profile okay sounds great thanks so much
