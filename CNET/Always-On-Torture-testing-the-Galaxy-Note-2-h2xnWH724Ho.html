galaxy note to go little buddy to ours
see you soon I hope it makes it let's
see how our note 2 is doing in here
okay
ready
admire our crystal formation swipe to
unlock oh yeah
tiny bit sluggish
launches apps just fine
touchscreens still pretty responsive
despite the cold I think we can call
this a pretty easy pass
looks like our note 2 is baked time are
off let's get it out see how it's doing
we're not getting such the bet
oh no there's some bad chemical smell
yeah there it probably isn't that safe
to be off gassing these kind of fumes
into my house so maybe next time we'll
do this but the windows open
okay let's unwrap it see how we're doing
well good you know I'm just an open
window now
just gonna come to think of it it's
probably not such a bad idea okay let's
see if it's too hot to touch of course
it is
the hotness hotness it was the hotness
it still is alright let's see if we can
get it to come on the metal parts are
particularly hot of course anything it
smells like burning plastic alright
nothing so far definitely does not want
to come on after it's a little stint in
the oven we will let it cool and check
on it in a little while
our no.2 is all cooled off only slightly
warm to the touch now let's see if it
turns back on what come on you got to
come back on everything come back on
don't die on me I want to do like Snoopy
arts come on come on
okay I guess we're gonna plug it in and
then see we're gonna plug it in maybe
the battery died should be right back
okay I'm gonna plug it in I just can't
believe this is possible that the
heat alone could have done it it look at
that
it drained the battery this thing went
in on a full charge now apparently the
full charge is back okay let's see if we
can get to come on okay so it's pretty
gory okay then of course the big test
will be will it stay on after we unplug
it which I'm sure it's going to sure
it's fine all right let's back on those
charging okay let's unplug it now we're
back to full charge we're back on the
Wi-Fi the screen is working connected to
the Wi-Fi network okay all right well I
feel like we basically gave it the
emergency paddles and now we have tone
the phone is okay
all right bud you like that phone it's
pretty nice to be careful with it okay
all right here we go give it a kick
which make sure it gets all the way down
there
you're being careful you can pick it up
and throw it toss it
maybe try bowling there now we're
talking good job kind of broke all right
let's put some stuff down and then check
it out you're not supposed to tell them
that I told you to do that okay that was
realistic but like most of these phones
as long as it can come open it can
protect itself it looks like there may
be there's definitely a little scuffing
on the screen I can't tell if those are
actual scratches or disgust here hold on
through the pants test oh yeah we've
actually got some legit scuff marks on
the screen there which is kind of
surprising maybe not that surprising
okay let's put our cover back on yeah
well dirt to major though a little
scuffing on the side here okay back is
back on let's try to turn it on right
yeah no problem
didn't even restart okay so it's all
right with a pretty easy drop maybe
we'll take it up a notch keep on going
now here's something a lot of you
suggested the phone falling out of the
car when you get out and since I said
that cell so our camera guy does this
all the time we're using his car it's
like a real-life reenactment alright so
say I have it in my lap here because I
was using it for directions getting all
my things getting out like oh no
like how it tried to slide under the car
to very dramatic oh oh we broke it
okay that's pathetic
I mean I know it just went down the
stairs but dang between this and the
scratches it seems clear that this is
not made of the same stuff as the
Samsung Galaxy s3 what came in the pen
wants to come out
I guess our drop test is a failure I'm
still working through my shock and
disappointment at this screen completely
cracking on what seemed like such a
small innocent drop but that said it's
not dead yet
so I think we're going to have to keep
trying to kill it now I know the water
test is unfair at this point but you
never know so let's give it a go
marinate a look at a bubbling just
bubbling away witch's cauldron broken
phone just trying to shut itself down
and that seems like a good moment to
rescue it
don't worry it's almost over
it's still on so what I'm gonna do is go
ahead and choose power off as so many of
you have urged me to do turn the phone
off all right I'm going to dry it out
have to be kind of careful drying it
because I don't want to get cut poor
little thing
gosh okay so because it is not a unibody
design I'll take it all the way apart
dry off the pieces get as much water out
of here as I can all right and now today
we have kind of an interesting little
dry bag proposition this company beastie
sent us their pre-made beast eternal
premade dry bag removes water from
personal electronics so since we've gone
through quite a lot of rice and silica
gel packs figured why not oh wait
hold on I'm assuming that I'm supposed
to do not remove beads from clear pouch
hole Ella's course interesting okay I
guess if I used it wrong they were
entangled what's their phone in here it
barely fits your have to take the beads
up and then not meant for phablets maybe
they'll come out with a new tablet sized
version get our battery in here shove
our bees down fill it up nice and tight
we'll see if we still have a functioning
although fragmented phone in a couple
more days
well we know how the screen is doing
let's see how the guts are doing we did
find out by the way that beastie makes
bigger size dry bags for iPads and other
devices so you don't always have to have
such a tight squeeze okay
gotta be careful we'll look the battery
starting to go back in here we go
god that damage is so upsetting
get back on ow I'm okay let's see if it
comes on
after submergent oh it does I will be
afraid to manipulate the screen in any
way lest I be injured but at least it is
functional because screens can be
replaced that's actually not that big a
deal as long as it's still working let's
try to unlock it carefully all right
pretty impressive it comes back on seems
responsive it looks like actually it's
even managed to get back on our studio
Wi-Fi not bad I will say that at least
in terms of the water test this is a
pass</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
