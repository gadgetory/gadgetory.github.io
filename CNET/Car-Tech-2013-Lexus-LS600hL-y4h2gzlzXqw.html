to put into a production car this is
your huckleberry but are you a dumbass
for buying one let's drive the 2013
Lexus LS 600h L Hybrid check the deck
now before we get inside three things
that make an LS hybrid a hybrid aside
from being a hybrid first of all they're
all long wheelbase five inches more
that's all about the back seat second of
all they all have the bigger v8 not a
smaller engine by being a hybrid and
third they're all all-wheel drive
now I'll categorize the interior under
two buckets wood and won't the wood is
everywhere this bamboo wood sure it's an
optional color scheme but man there's a
lot of it especially down here this big
chunky piece on the wheel looks like
somebody was drunk when they were
driving hopped the curb and drove
through a flooring store now let's get
to won't I won't be using most of these
drive controls this car is amazingly
busy in that area let's go through them
first of all at your shifter you've got
Drive of course then Sport within sport
shiftable gate for up and down no
paddles by the way which is interesting
now down here you've got your drive
controller which gets you a push for
normal mode of suspension transmission
and engine one turn left gets you to
comfort mode which moderates down the
throttle response and softens of
suspension another turn counterclockwise
takes you to Eco mode which really dials
things back and also turns down the
accessories to use less fuel now let's
go clockwise our first stop is the land
of sport that's going to sharpen
throttle response transmission behavior
and the suspension but another one takes
you to Sport Plus and on top of that
you've got an Eevee mode button but the
car will also go into easy mode on its
own so by pressing this you make it do
more of it more often that's an awful
lot to choose from how about just three
simple modes go normal go fast or use
less gas now right adjacent to our drive
controls is the Lexus remote touch
controller which I'm becoming less a fan
of every time I Drive it you really have
to think about your hand motions where
you are and where you're going to land
and that's just too much of a diversion
from what I should be doing on top of
that the Lexus interface is a little bit
ragged it lacks
a sort of structure that Audi has with
four corners or BMW has with a left menu
here it's kind of different on every
screen the way things are organized and
it just gets a little bit chaotic now
once you do get into your radio and
media setups you got everything you
could want here HD radio with tagging
am/fm satellite radio your apps sweet
through in tune we'll bring you some
music but also you've got lots of media
choices got SD card USB streaming
Bluetooth iPod connections standard aux
jack it's all here and luckily there's
no dumb hard drive to rip to so they've
made smart choices
unfortunately meta tag information for
bluetooth streaming just isn't happening
and that dates the system rather
seriously this one has 19 speakers
around the cabin including two over the
rear passengers heads 450 watts and it's
7.1 surround the screen as you can see
is huge I believe it's a 12.1 inch
display
nothing is in small type it doesn't need
to be now under apps here is where
you're going to find your inform suite
of apps Bing I Heart Radio
movietickets.com
Pandora open table so you've got a mix
of media information services and things
that are contextualized to driving now
of course you do have voice command on
this guy and the recognitions excellent
but it still requires you to enter an
address one little chunk at a time
that's pretty old-school full mobile San
Francisco San Francisco
we have what they call the executive
class backseat for example here's our
shiatsu massage controller with more
settings and choices than even the most
we toidy spa in your neighborhood now
the seat over here on the right where
I'm sitting does amazing stuffs I push
that my seats reclining now that seats
getting out of my way
the downside about the ottoman is unless
you're pretty damn short you can't use
it if I put the ottoman up struts to
push your legs up your feet get trapped
underneath the front seat and your legs
get broken somewhere about six inches
north of your ankles on the other hand
if you're 2 foot 1 like the bear you'll
find it palatial a spacious we've got a
big old motor in here even bigger than
the v8 in the conventional LS it's a 5
liter this is clearly a car not using
hybridity for efficiency but mostly for
performance 438 horsepower 385
foot-pounds of torque the only
transmission here is a CVT interesting
choice cvts don't normally handle
massive torque all that will 0 to 60 for
this 50 150 pound sedan is a remarkable
5.6 seconds while the mpg is 1923 for an
average of 20 not exactly a fuel zipper
is it this car is only four tenths of a
second faster than a gas l all-wheel
drive now big part of a virtual wash on
those numbers is because this guy weighs
four hundred and sixty pounds more than
a standard LS long wheelbase with
all-wheel drive this is a lot of extra
weight because of the hybrid gear and
really it's battery this is what they do
that no one else does I really think
this is one of the great comfortable
luxurious driving cars of all time that
said this model is just not working for
me
there's no particular efficiency here
the hybrid numbers are not great on that
front it's got plenty of power but it's
crippled by the fact that initial tip in
on the accelerator and initial decel
when you back off are both numb and kind
of buttery doesn't work even in sport
plus there is no sharp heel-and-toe on
this car so why have
months the other thing you notice about
Sport+ is it never really conquers
body-roll
hmm it should do that it doesn't
another reason for it not to exist now
we do not have but there is this
advanced collision package which brings
you active lane drift prevention forward
adaptive cruise control that same
technology gives you low-speed collision
avoidance not on the highways but around
town it will break and keep you from
running into something and a few other
technologies it will basically keep you
out of trouble okay let's price our
Lexus LS 600h l it's big piece of change
to start with about 121 base now to go
seen that style you got to add that
executive class backseat that's just
plain fun but it's gonna add $7,500 the
collision avoidance package which we
didn't have is definitely interesting at
$6,500 now you're up around 135 grand
with those numbers this car makes no
sense at any point in fact by my
calculations it takes 115 years or 1.8
million daily driver miles to earn back
the penalty on this hybrid versus a
conventional engine LS L with all-wheel
drive so you don't do this logically you
do it cuz you're in love with an LS that
happens to be a hybrid and because
you're paying for it with out of the
company's money or the taxpayers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
