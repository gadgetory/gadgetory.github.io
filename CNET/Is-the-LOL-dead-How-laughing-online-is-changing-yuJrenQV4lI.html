Bridget Carey this is your cnet update
how do you laugh online are you more of
a haha or a hehe do you go right for the
crying laughing emoji face or the
classic LOL for me it varies depending
on the conversation but facebook says
the most common form of laughing on
facebook comments is haha and the emoji
comes in second place the social network
study the sample of users to find trends
of how people are expressing laughter
and it seems that LOL is dying only one
point nine percent of users in the study
we're using LOL the lowell is now an
endangered species of eel after but age
does factor into these trends no
surprise that the LOL skews a little
older for the generation that grew up
with AOL instant messenger facebook says
young people and women tend to use emoji
more and men tend to go with the longer
hehehe and geography also plays a role
in your laughing dialect chicago in new
york tend to use emoji more and the west
coast cities like seattle in san
francisco use more haha the emoji and
LOL are both very popular in my home
state of Florida so what do we take away
from all this well maybe to win over
Florida voters the presidential
candidates will need to master the
commenting combo of emoji and lolz not
only are we chatting online in new ways
but there are more ways to talk to your
phone Microsoft's Cortana virtual
assistant arrived as a beta test program
on Android last month but there's an
update to the app that lets you set
Cortana to be the default personal
assistant replacing the google now
shortcut first reported by the blog
microsoft news Cortana works just like
she does on Windows 10 but with one
exception you can't wake her up on
Android by saying hey Cortana whereas on
Android you can start a voice command by
saying okay Google and in the world of
mobile payments Apple pay is expanding
to include American Express corporate
cards so if you have an amex you use for
work you can now sync it with apples tap
to pay feature on the new iPhones in the
Apple watch the program has slowly been
expanding to include more banks and
businesses last week it added 46 more
banks and credit unions in the you
that means Apple pay works with more
than 400 US banking institutions and
last month it also expanded to work in
the united kingdom that's it for this
tech news update you can always get more
