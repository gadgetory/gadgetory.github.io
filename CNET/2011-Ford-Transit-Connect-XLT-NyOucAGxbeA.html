it tends to go either toward love or
hate but either way this vehicle gets
forward back into minivans in a very
different way let's drive the Ford
Transit Connect XLT and check the 10
question I've answered dozens of times
while I've been driving this is what is
it looks like something that would
deliver a package to your hotel in Paris
right with DHL library on it
well it's forged first minivan since the
rather unloved Aerostar this guy's built
on the focused platform not the new
focus but the previous North American
style focus we had for too many years to
be honest it's available in two
configurations we have the wagon that
means glass around the side panels and
second row seats and belts but they'll
sell most of these as a van with mostly
metal panels around it and just a big
cargo box in the factory
check the tech what tech there isn't any
there's something I'm not even gonna sit
down am/fm/cd four speakers there is a
backup camera a little postage stamp
thing in the rear view that's about it
now you can get a version of sync on a
Transit Connect even though you never
get an LCD screen but it's real basic
without 911 no sync services and no
support for apps it basically handles
music and hands-free calling it's here
in the second row where things start to
get interesting the roof starts to
really slope up pronouncedly you get a
really Airy feeling back here you're
second row holds three obviously and
these seats can fold forward or fold all
the way forward but they don't come out
now when everything is all boxed up back
here you've got about a hundred and
thirty cubic feet of cargo area just 7
cubic feet short of a full sized
suburban which is a hell of a lot bigger
car that uses a lot more gas and a lot
more your dollars on the MSRP different
kind of vehicle but it's a pretty apt
comparison interesting story how these
come into the country they all arrive
from the factory in Turkey set up like
this as wagons and they've got glass
windows on the side rear seat rear
seatbelts
the majority though are going to be sold
as vans so the end of having all those
accoutrements torn out recycled and then
they put metal panels where the glass
used to be and that way they avoid
what's called the chicken tacks
apparently when commercial vehicles and
trucks come in from Europe to the US
they get this 25% tariff by bringing
them in like this and then converting
with the port saves a lot of money on
the MSRP more examples of how Spartan
this vehicle is and that's how they keep
the price so low this little cargo
pocket here that's part of the Premium
Package
that's not premium that's just barely
above Soviet era car manufacturer as is
this nicely exposed leads for the
heating element in the glass don't lay
your tongue across that kids
you do have niceties like this simple
button that lets you open this door flat
you can also option 255 degree doors
they go flat against the body all the
way also part of the premium trim these
rear side windows flip out
now the Transit Connect rather jealously
guards its little motor
check this out you need the key outside
the car to open it up you flip the badge
put the key in there like that turn it
once to the left to unlock once to the
right to unlatch and then up she goes 2
litre inline-four gas engine nothing
really tricky going on here
transverse-mounted drives the front
wheels only you're going to get 136
horsepower 128 foot-pounds of torque
garden-variety stuff gets this guy up to
60 in a leisurely 12 seconds but
delivers 20 to 27 mpg with something
that shape and all that power goes out
through 96 not a 5 but a 4-speed
automatic I don't even know where they
source such a thing anymore I just like
driving the Transit Connect I don't know
why it's slow it's not a handling
vehicle but there's something so good
about it being big and small at the same
time incredibly useful I think it has
nice Euro lines and it's a great price
so you come to the vehicle with
relatively should we say modest
expectations but it works and it over
delivers I think the interiors clean and
simple nothing to stylize that's in
keeping with the utilitarian nature of
this thing and the mind just reels with
all the things you would do if you owned
one of these things all the things you
do on the weekend
how you go do various trips differently
how you'd be the one who picks up
friends when a bunch of people go out
you're right not a good vehicle to own
the weak link in this car as we had a
feeling it would be is basically the
transmission with only four gears to
choose from it's basically in the wrong
one all the time
you might think that visibility is going
to be dreadful in this vehicle but it's
not if you get a wagon with the full
complement of glass all the way back
then you've got pretty decent sight
lines those headrests are actually your
biggest issue in the second row not the
actual bodywork if those are out you
have tremendous visibility I just think
the Transit Connect is fun to drive and
it allows you to have all that kind of
car
ability everyday cargo ability without
the penalty of driving around the truck
all the time
all right let's price our little red
friend this is a Transit Connect XL t
wagon the passenger eyes version 24 -
there is a premium package which gives
you those flip out glass rear windows
and that little mesh covered cargo
binnacle in the back door that's 150
bucks
why wouldn't they make that standard now
three tech options on top of all that
that detuned version of sinks gonna run
you 220 yeah do it the backup sensors
280 yeah do it and the backup camera in
the mirror is 470 probably doing beyond
that you're going to want to change out
the head unit almost certainly and put
some cool wheels on it and this is kind
of a hot little ute</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
