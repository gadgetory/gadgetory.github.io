this year's iPhone gates let's get to
the core of this week's Apple news and
rumors mark your calendars because
October is shaping up to be yet another
busy month for Apple
now the cheaper 10r goes on presale
October 19th arriving a week later on
the 26th but Apple could also be gearing
up for another important launch event
this month where the company is rumored
to announce new iPads a cheaper MacBook
model an update to the Mac Mini and
maybe IMAX now we're not sure whether
this is going to be a standalone event
or just an announcement like what they
did with the MacBook Pro updates earlier
this year but in the event of an event I
would probably guess that it's gonna be
later on in the month like in years past
and I would put my money on the 25th a
day before the 10r goes on sale but
that's just me now rumors point to an
iPhone 10 like redesigned for the iPad
pro with those slimmer bezels and face
ID but no knotch
and no OLED display as shown in these 9
to 5 Mac renders one with an 11 inch
display and the other one with a
12-point 9 inch display we're also
expecting a 13-inch MacBook with slimmer
bezels and a Retina display at a similar
price point of the MacBook Air that I
have right here the Mac Mini is rumored
to get new storage options and better
processor but those upgrades would cost
you more than the current 500 dollar
price tag meanwhile those new iPhone 10
s's are still giving us plenty to talk
about both good and bad now first off
battery life last week's Thomas guide
report suggested that both the tennis
and the tennis max didn't last as long
as last year's 10 now those results have
since been updated and now only the
smaller 10s lags behind the 10 but that
still contradicts what Apple suggested
in the keynote but the latest consumer
report findings paint a completely
different picture than the tom's guide
results stating that the batteries
actually go above and beyond
Apple's 30-minute and 90-minute improve
on the tennis and the tennis max okay so
why the huge difference in results it
could have something to do with their
testing methods now Tom's guide says
there's involves continuous web
searching at the same brightness level
while consumer reports actually uses a
robotic finger that is programmed to go
through everyday tasks these include web
surfing GPS and making calls we haven't
finished our own battery test so wait
and see what RSA and we can compare all
of them in a later edition we've also
started hearing more complaints about
this year's new iPhones and the new
gates could be charged gates and Beauty
gate as noted in this Gizmodo article
now neither seems to be as serious as
the antenna gate of the iPhone 4 where
users were losing reception depending on
how they would hold the phones or when
the six Plusle is actually bending in
people's pants but they're still worth
taking a closer look first up let's take
a look at Beauty gate now users are
accusing Apple of airbrushing portraits
from the front camera mainly because the
results show smoother than normal
skintone and while they do seem to have
a softer quality to them it could also
be a result of that smart HDR effect
which is essentially evening out the low
lights and highlights to create less
contrast and making it feel a little bit
flatter there have also been reports of
bad reception in certain areas
particularly by Verizon users including
some of you guys who suggested we test
this out in the comments section below
and that's also coming up soon
then there's charge gate people would
plug in their phone at night and wake up
to a completely drained battery and the
issue as shown in this unbox therapy
video isn't that the phone itself isn't
charging it's that it doesn't start
charging if the phone is asleep when you
plug it in so you have to wake it up and
plug it in to actually charge the phone
will eventually start charging even when
it's off and it's reportedly only
affecting a small amount of users and of
course Apple has remained mum about all
these issues but the closest that we're
gonna get of admitting that there's a
problem is found in the latest
developers version
of iOS 12.1 where they're addressing the
battery issue the update according to
I'm Maura's Renee Ritchie
comes with the solution to the charging
problem but clearly the company has more
pressing issues to discuss in its
newsroom posts than charging issues
because you're getting 70 new emojis
with that iOS 12.1 update including
lobsters bagels and a redhead emoji no
seriously this one's big because it even
had its own change.org petition and the
developers beta of watch OS 5.1 would
include group FaceTime support but only
through audio and full screen color
watch faces for the series 4 and
circular color watch faces or the series
3 and below now the only issue with
these Vedas is we're not sure when
they're actually seating out to
consumers so if you have the charging
issue you might have to live with it for
a few more weeks at least and we're not
done with the testing
I took the Apple watch series for on a
six-hour hike to test out Apple's
battery claim on this product and those
results are coming to you later on this
week and also let me know if you've
noticed any issues with Apple's new
products on the comments section below
or hit me up on Twitter and come back
next week for more apple core</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
