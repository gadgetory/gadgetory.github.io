PlayStation View we're going to tell you
where you can get it how much it costs
and what you get for your money and your
favorite Marvel character is probably
going to die we'll give you more
information on that after we do the
other things NASA
I'm so sad NASA has an electric plane a
little tiny propellers and engines I'm
sure it sounds cool it's on Steam
website my Marvel characters tomorrow
daily
greetings citizens of the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily and best cake
talk show in the known universe I'm
Ashley sceva join me once again master
of all he surveys Wow the one and only
kill anonymous subject has returned but
you'll be gone on Monday yep and then
I'm out of here stealing suckers no I'm
back I'm excited to be back
I really have you really missed this
seat we missed you some good friends but
I heard always glad to have you back
yeah is it South by Southwest and
actually that's part of my into it yeah
okay because you get to see things a
little bit beforehand yeah so you guys
are really gonna like this hopefully it
lines up perfectly with the show you
don't even know but before that let's
look at those in you're in fine form
today my friend I'm excited I'm excited
so I had a coffee so you may have drank
18 cups of coffee right before you
bottoms and didn't stop until the
cameras through he actually just as an
IV going
like totally okay so let's talk about
PlayStation view PlayStation view is
official it's launched it's out now so
you can get it in three whole cities
here in the US it's ridiculous so it's
only available in New York Philadelphia
and Chicago right now and you have to
have a Playstation 3 or a PlayStation 4
to access it okay that's all right New
York Philadelphia and Chicago okay they
did say that even though you can only
access view with a ps3 or ps4 right now
they're gonna try to expand it to other
devices they're working on an iPad app
right now
so here we go so we're watching on the
screen we're scrolling through we're
checking it out David Katz Mayer over in
New York one of our TV guys went through
because he's in New York which is great
he wins this is actual footage actual
PlayStation view footage he's using it
right now so you can see there's Archer
there's CBS shows there's a about 75
channels so you've got Fox CBS NBC and
all that like a lot of related channels
them so you know Fox News Bravo Cartoon
Network effects I'm seeing Wi-Fi Comedy
Central all right Telemundo NBC Animal
Planet Animal Planet yeah bet it's not
like a gambling channel bTW
oh okay Black Entertainment Television I
know it's just kidding um I'm still live
Food Network mean to me Wow okay yeah
there's a lot more than on say Slingbox
I'm say sling okay so sweetie TV is sort
of the big competitor but here's the
thing yes it does have a lot more
channels but unfortunately it doesn't
have to kind of major things which one
is ABC okay it's kind of a big broadcast
network you want to see those major
broadcast networks here in the states on
whatever cord cutting device you want to
use and including that because ABC and
Disney ABC is owned by Disney and Disney
also owns ESPN there is no ESPN okay
okay so for the sports fans with sling
TV kind of a bummer sling TV does have
ABC a Disney Channel like all that stuff
so no premium offerings no HBO Go no
Showtime don't know that so can't get
but I mean no to imagine you that's part
of the ala carte process you're going to
be adding that some of those services
kind of sand alone gee that sounds like
cable sounds like cable um so another
ten dollars if you're a sports fan and
you want your local sports teams you can
add ten bucks so in New York they have
like Yankee the Yankee Network you can
watch like so you get like the local
sports channels or whatever a month a
month yeah so and then there's another
package come like a bowl worth another
$10 that adds sort of these like nice
channels or of lifestyle music different
things that different things like that
right okay fifty bucks a month so it's
50 bucks a month and you get there's a
lot of channels on there are a lot of
channels and you also get something that
sling TV doesn't have which is cloud DVR
you can yes you can record a show and
then it will keep it in your queue for
up to 28 days after yeah watch at any
time and also unlike sling TV you can
fast-forward through commercials you can
pause stuff like a lot of times that's
like to be you can't do that it's pretty
rare that they let you so kind of some
differences and obviously you're paying
a premium for those differences but
definitely a service that I think some
people would be interested in but is it
too expensive I think this is sort of
the question a lot of people are not
sure about yeah 50 wing Wang's is a lot
of money especially since they're trying
to kill cable subscriptions getting
close to the price of a cable
subscription right right
and I'm sure there's you guys were
theorizing that there's going to be
another competitor entering the ring
pretty soon so we're hearing again
always like where there's smoke there's
fire kind of thing we're hearing that
Apple TV and an Apple is looking into
partnerships with a bunch of different
studios and broadcast networks and all
that stuff to launch something for Apple
TV sometime in the fall so we might hear
more about that with iOS 9 which will be
it's possible that they may loop in
Apple TV as part of iOS 9 where you'd
have access to games on the App Store
you'd have access to maybe a TV
subscription service so we don't know
how much that will cost or what that
even would entail or how many services
Apple would get ahold of so um there's
there's just a lot of options out there
and all of them have their pros and cons
it's happening and it's happening we
knew this we were like this is this may
happen everything's gonna go digital but
it's also way more expensive than we
thought it would be so much more
complicated yeah that's the one thing
that a lot of people didn't realize is
in unbundling all of these like services
you're gonna end up with kind of
something exactly like what's happening
with view where you're not getting all
the channels that you were used to
watching on cable but it's like this
might be how it's gonna be going for yep
and we may it may fall back into that
like paid packages type thing so yeah
ultimately I want to know like if people
are excited about it because I was
excited about all these digital
offerings and sling TV came along and
then I learned about all the caveats of
like I can't really save your stuff and
I'm like well I live on VOD bro and so
it's video in demand is it so then this
view comes out and that's fifty dollars
and then that's on top of my Netflix
subscription
amazon prime i also have hulu so maybe I
won't need who anymore but I mean we'll
see it's just it's stacking up on top of
each other right and then also HBO I'll
have to get the a trio to take another
job is there another like gear like tech
show they don't make you a show okay
yeah all right cool just you doing songs
and dancing is that it is that our
hashtag
you were curious if people are excited
about this it's tv-viewers hours okay
and the view as in vu e which is the
surname of the service and we just want
to know are you in are you out is 50
bucks too much how much would you pay
for it or you know what what do you need
to see to pony up fifty dollars a month
like what's the thing that needs to be
included okay yeah I think that's that's
how it cuz this is like the future we
don't have like a choice like would you
pay the $50 do you even have a
Playstation that's part of it actually
you have to have a Playstation so and
how long would you wait for it to come
to your city that's the other everywhere
US only and only in three cities right
now they said more cities in the coming
months but they also need to make it
available on our mobile devices too yeah
that's my bad I want to be able to
access it somewhere else okay with you
you could watch on up to three devices
at one time okay well that's cool so
that's not bad again it's like you're
paying a premium for sort of these
privileges that were used to having with
cable so that's our opinion yeah here's
TV I'm very concerned you said something
about my favorite Marvel character being
killed yeah it's funny cuz I told you
this two months ago I told everybody
this two months yeah no I'm sorry
there's actually this big story going
around right now about this whole Marvel
and universe reset that's happening
today yeah this is they came out today
this reset is gonna happen in May and
it's gonna destroy practically everyone
in the Marvel Universe however this did
was announced a couple of months ago but
it's it's news now again so I'll go
ahead and cover its news again today
yeah we're just gonna go with it
so it's all based on on one quote and
actually a series that's coming out
called that what is it called secret
universe secret secret war sorry secret
wars are gonna happen and it's gonna be
a battle that's happening from earth 616
which is what the primary unit Marvel
Universe is yeah that's the place that's
the earth where everything takes places
yeah and so then once this were once
this battle happens at the end
everyone's gonna be dead and everyone's
gonna be dead in their own comic thing
and it's all gonna be reboot just like
how DC rebooted like a like just
recently
yeah so so they're gonna reset
everything this is nothing new this is
happening for priests but this is really
cool because we're gonna get new
versions of everything Thor he's gonna
die turn over again and we just go sorry
so here are some of the people on the
list
Avengers okay dead Captain Marvel
Fantastic Four dead calor going to the
galaxy and I'm just reading that one now
dead Hulk Thor x-men all part of the
list they're all gonna die when I
originally read this the only person
that was going to survive was Miles
Morales man yeah he was the only one to
survive but now apparently they say yes
you may get knocked off so maybe he'll
like dodged a bullet it'll last minute
let me read you just a refrigerator yeah
oh yeah the prairie dog we'll see him
thanks for bringing that back up we
needed to hear that again
so the Alex Alex Alonso editor-in-chief
had this quote to say and I have to read
it again I love it so much here it is
this is you know metaphor for how this
is going to happen imagine there's two
pizzas they're going to smash together
and you're going to have all new
toppings sometimes you're gonna drop off
you're going to yell about some that are
missing you're going to love the new
ones I think you're losing it here I
think you're losing it the new ones here
they're the new Marvel Universe moving
forward bobble up so anyway there's
they're gonna erase it and try it again
when two pizzas collide so there's gonna
be new versions of a lot of stories that
we've already seen which is really cool
I'm looking forward to seeing a new run
of the Infinity Gauntlet because I love
that story and what's the best part is
that each of the comic book creator all
the creators of the kind the current
storyline is getting to end their
character the way they want so that is
that is perfect okay March 31st
everything line them up it's not like
that it's like it's like Thor Thor wants
to die in his sleep that's gonna happen
don't quote me on that time yeah so
there you go it's pretty cool it's been
reported everywhere yeah I remember you
talking about it on kale has a show
called nerd bait on his channel
yeah and he talked about it like in
January the end of January he was
discussing this and today for some
reason it like blew up all over the
Internet and we were just like and kill
was like I talked about this two months
ago yeah it's well look I'm okay with it
because it's closer to
now the date of I guess yours coming out
so but actually be like I'm also if
you're into comics are you going to be
reading the secret wars I'll be
interested to see I definitely am that's
this seems like a really big deal yeah
alright alright let's talk about it
brings us to our hashtag of the day
which was already but you you can
totally tell Kayla if you're gonna read
Secret Wars and get into this reset and
I'm like I it makes me want to read
comics like get into the reset and I
also feel like for a lot of people who
don't read comics right now maybe this
is a great way to get them to start
because they're like I'm starting fresh
I can get in and this can be my
character this is my comic series so
that's kind of a cool thing she started
reading Captain Marvel as well another
exactly alright so I have to tell you
about leap text so this is the thing
that NASA came up with we've seen a lot
of electric cars we've seen like Tesla
and the Nissan Leaf and all these other
electric cars that are pretty cool but
the thing is is a lot of people see them
they go well where's my electric
airplane like why aren't we doing
electric all-electric airplanes they do
say that and well like I've seen people
go well how come we're not even working
on this in the sky why is this not a
thing and actually we are so but the
problem is is battery tech is just not
in a place to really make it work with
planes so NASA is kind of going in a
totally different direction and I love
this so much they are testing out leap
attack which incorporates a bunch of
small electric motors so we're looking
at this video you can see a whole bunch
of little propellers along the wings and
each one of those is its own electric
motor has its own electric motor so
there's 18 of them spread out over a
31-foot
wingspan 31 foot wings so it's just like
a 62 foot wingspan which is pretty cool
plus the width of the actual body of the
cabin this is awesome yeah okay so they
spread out all of these electric motors
and propellers and what they found very
interestingly was that they had a pretty
great result a 60% increase in wing
efficiency and some drag reductions so a
little bit less it's a little more
aerodynamic which is pretty great
especially for planes obviously so this
is the thing they haven't rigged on
right now it's they have this truck that
has a spell
we mounted things so they can test these
the wings of the propellers and the
engines and so they were saying that the
whole point of this is that you can
actually move around because they're all
independent of each other you can move
them around on the wings to optimize not
only the placement of them to get the
best sort of lift and the best amount of
or the least amount of drag and and they
were also saying that because again they
operate independently let's say you get
up to a certain altitude and you're
cruising we can shut some of them off
because there they can or some of them
can go slower than others so like maybe
as you're flying you would be using less
energy like on some of them maybe half
of them or 1/4 of them as opposed to
constantly with a turbine engine that we
use right now these like big turbine
engines it you'd constantly be running
that you have to the next step would be
to have an actual like small plane so
they said basically this would be
scalable so they would start very small
and then they would work their way up so
they would start with like small you
know single-engine planes and then they
would sort of either fit them or or
build a plane that would be electrically
powered by these little electric motors
and then they would move up to a bigger
plane bigger plane and then maybe
someday if the tech continues to be able
to scale they would be able to do it
with like a commercial airliner that
would be fantastic and then they could
put solar panels on top of it and it
gets close to this can we just keep
going for like just you know you never
know you ever know that would be thing
you never know right um but I thought
that was so cool and everyone I've been
asked always does like really amazing
things I always love these videos that
they have but that's what's going on up
at up with up with leap tech a show very
cool good work NASA we are gonna take a
quick break we'll be right back with
Intuit our user feedback with some great
photo shops that I saved for you I
wanted to make sure you saw them okay
welcome and then of course we have our
own Agra for the day so don't look away
it's tomorrow daily
welcome back to the show
I was just noticing you kill at two
different colored shoelaces like one's
white and ones blue very serious oh this
is our life this is this is what we do
here we are back and it is Thursday and
I'm excited because I have something
that you haven't seen yet and you
brought something I haven't seen yet so
it's time to talk to you guys about the
things that we are super excited about
this is into it I'm not gonna con you
you I'm gonna let you finish let me
finish okay
I don't wait I really had something so
uh this last week while I was gone I
wasn't just lying around in the street I
was actually in South by lying around on
the street yeah you were Austin Austin
laying in the street so I got a chance
to check out some music I got such a
chance to check out some tech but I also
got a chance to check out a movie and so
that is my into it this is this week I
want to talk about a movie that
premiered there called X and machina
this is saw the trailer for this movie
oh my god you saw it yes I saw it so ex
machina was one of the big movies this
year and if you don't know it you
haven't seen the trailer recommend to go
see the trailer I'm so excited about one
man
testing an AI to find out how efficient
it is
and he's also down there testing it with
the creator of it which is Oscar Isaac
who's gonna be in the new Star Wars
movies okay so as so is this guy always
they're both gonna be in it and I in
during his interview he kind of maybe
accidentally had let it so that he may
be holding a lightsaber but anyway so
it's these two guys and they kind of get
to a point where nobody trusts anybody
thriller yes it's a thriller the it he's
testing the AI and AI confides in him
says hey don't trust the guy that made
me and then the guy that made it was
like don't trust the AI and then he
can't trust either and then AI can't
trust him and then it's it's all it all
becomes this giant know who to trust
you don't know if the AI is smarter than
them or if it's this feeble little AI
that's being taken advantage of because
it's this beautiful robot but also it's
a beautiful robot
so maybe it's you know but it's it's a
crazy like I recommended someone who I
was like do you like black mayor you'll
love this oh my god but it's great it
has you guessing to like you like I
thought I had figured out where it was
going and then when it different
direction I thought I was gonna go but
it was great fantastic ending really
great acting and the effects are unlike
the effect of this woman is that is real
real and she's gorgeous they're like oh
did you have to like during somebody
else's interview they told him oh did
they did you guys have to do a lot of
crazy trick she's like no we just filmed
it twice and he was like and then we
fixed it in post
so it was like in crust but anyway
really great movie probably one of the
best ones that came out of South wathah
by that wasn't like a comedy like there
was a lot of big comedies there but this
is great I was just telling producer
Logan yesterday I'm like do you see this
trailer for this movie called X Mach and
he's like no I was like you have to
watch it cuz this movie I was like Logan
would love this it was written by the
guy it was directed and written by the
guy that made sunshine remember that one
yeah 28 days later oh it's a great love
and I think Dredd as well so he's got a
lot of sci-fi street cred a lot of
sci-fi street cred look really great
really very small in it like isolated
like it feels very claustrophobic I'm
into it yeah you're already into it and
you hadn't even seen it and I'm gonna be
into it when I see it oh my gosh okay so
um what I am into this week is the
weirdest thing I've ever seen on YouTube
and that's saying something but in such
a delightful way it's this user called
manager space and basically what this is
is it's a Japanese guy of course it is
with a miniature kitchen okay and he
makes food in the miniature kitchen with
miniature tools okay so here he is in
his miniature kitchen making pancakes
so you see he's got you know he's got
all his pancakes there's a butter and he
had maple syrup okay so he brings in his
his little his little stove and he
lights a candle and he puts it in there
watch look so he lights a thing and they
put it inside this this stove and then
he gets a little tiny pot and he cooks
up pancakes like I'm not kidding this is
and the weird thing is is there's no
music there's he's not talking it's just
silent it's just the sounds of cooking
and it's very it's oddly soothing it's
so strange
it's so weird but he really cooks stuff
in these little tiny pans he only makes
pancakes no he makes everything he makes
everything he doesn't eat him afterwards
or I don't know he did they don't show
that part you never see this guy's face
what else does he make it's only
missions okay so pretty so Logan we have
another one - its fright he made he
makes fried chicken he makes fried what
the chickens are normal size I know he
has like a little tiny cutting board
where he like cuts up the little
chickens and he rolls them in little
time lookit watch look this that is
actual oil in there that is frying this
little tiny like what is it a spring
roll like paper okay so you fries that
thing I love it like there's a tiny
coffee mug there he's got absolutely no
reason for absolutely no reason it's
ridiculous but he heats up oil in this
little pot and then he puts in these
little tiny he takes a normal-sized
piece of chicken cuts up and he has a
tiny chef's knife is this the weirdest
thing you've seen it's so bizarre and I
love it so much this so weird this guy
needs to work with the tiny hamster see
little tiny pieces of chicken inside
utensil
yeah a little tiny look he's got a
little shelf there pots back there
inside can I ask you something if you
and this could really go for anyway if
you were like on a date and the guy
invited you over and I was like I'm
gonna make it he's like I'm gonna make
you dinner and you come over and he
makes you look like a little tiny dinner
is that like cool or is that like no
that wouldn't I would probably run for
my life actually that that seems like a
serial killer like he's like he's like
hold on let me make you a tiny dinner
but he also made a little tiny cake that
was adorable he made a little cake what
is this this is the end of the fried
chicken thing he cuts up look at this
little he has a little chef's night this
is so dumb you guys like I know it's
this a whole channel of this just all
kinds of total no music miso soup yeah
it's super soothing though if you like
just having background noises on it's
great like you just play it and he said
miso soup he made he makes puddings
he makes katsu he I think everything he
makes a little tiny sushi like the sushi
one is unreal like they're a little itty
bitty on one
of rice he puts his sushi on its no he
doesn't I'm not real but look at yeah
here's this fried chicken even fried it
up not tiny old pot nice serving it I
want to see him eat it this is why I
love into it because nowhere else would
I find something like this but from
Ashley a skier oh okay I'm like I'm sure
you gonna show me more I will make sure
you take those alright guys let's talk
about what you have to think about the
show it is time for user feedback we're
gonna be a long show today but only
because you haven't been here with a lot
to talk about
yeah like little food okay that's true
so yesterday we asked you guys to think
of weird ways of signing into your
Windows machine because they introduced
Microsoft hello which is login for your
face and all stuff so Rick Rhoden has
said maybe Windows 10 can recognize my
catchphrase
I am the Vengeance I am the knight I am
Batman and then he tries it in Kevin
Conroy
Joey wrote in and said unlock with a
secret dance Oh like that one yeah I
like they didn't share the secret dance
no don't ever share the secret dance
here I give people your login
information so those are our two
feedbacks that I saw that I really liked
now if you dance and Batman very similar
photoshop's
oh we have Photoshop yes of course so
remember last week we have this ski the
ski picture well the snow yeah yeah yeah
monster in there well we had two people
do that Jerome and Frank so I roll again
and said couldn't help it added three
monsters lol and I love that so much
he's going after that one guy that's
down on a snowboard oh he's got two
people yeah and then he actually got one
and then Frank wrote and said only the
gum bloom can save them from the Beast
yes you had a dip Goldblum see I'm sorry
no boarding downhill or skiing there we
are you're snowboarding wow I am good
yeah I look like a really good skier
look at ours Goldblum like he's having a
blast we look like we're not exactly in
the area but this is great yeah wait so
they photoshopped those people into it
yeah they photoshopped those three that
is a really fantastic photo show is this
a real picture I really it's a real cool
all right
and then Stefan wrote wrote in about
gills yes
Guil and we talked about it one of the
pictures it was the South Carolina State
House and we said what make it better
and Gill said aliens and I was like yeah
I agree that would make it so much
better so Stefan wrote in and sent us
this and said as per as you or Gil we're
talking about aliens are now attacking
the photog refers photo and taking
taking away the statue above oh so it's
super good I always loved Stefan so it's
like unbelievable Stefan and Jerome
likes to send in photoshop Saul the time
and we just love it
that you guys do that so high fives guys
oh my god Stefan you guys are you guys
are all kind of the best yeah if you
guys want to send it in Photoshop so if
you want to send in oh I we have to do
our phone talk for the day right ready
for today yeah I mean there might be
some would Photoshop magic in this too
okay so the young wrote in to us who be
young okay young and he said I'm from
Auckland New Zealand and in December
last year I went to the South Island for
the first time here at the top in my
opinion unedited photos I took using my
Moto X 2014 keep up the great work with
the show the first one on the left there
is Queenstown he said that's Queenstown
