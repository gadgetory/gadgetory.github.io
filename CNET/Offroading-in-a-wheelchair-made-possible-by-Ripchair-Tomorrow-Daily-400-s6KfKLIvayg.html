welcome to tamale the best seat talk
show in the known universe and it's 400
episode watch I'm Geoff Canada
hundred episodes we have a live studio
audience yes we are shutting down the
show if you existed on Thursday Justin
time is the we've worn it in a few we've
hit our limit yeah well we're spinning
down the show if you missed it on
Thursday show our last term our daily
will be August 18th um this week we have
four short episodes because producer
Logan is living it up in Hawaii nice so
you guys can give a shout out to
producer Stephanie who's out there but
for now let's do the headlines maybe
Jack White of the White Stripes
isn't the person you think of when you
think of the edge of space but maybe you
should early last month Jack White's
record label Third Man Records launched
a small craft with an unusual ability
into the skies he was able to play a
vinyl record during its trip into the
upper reaches of our atmosphere it's
called the Icarus craft and it reaches
altitudes of about ninety four thousand
feet before heading back down to earth
Third Man Records consultant Kevin
carico designed the craft with help from
a group called students and teachers in
near space and if you're wondering what
song was playing during the trip
it was a remix of Carl Sagan's a
glorious dawn which is of course
available on Third Man Records website
to buy this is cool man it's kind of
like the golden record Redux right yeah
it's one it's inspired by the idea of
the golden record on Voyager which has a
whole bunch of stuff on it including a
Hello in a bunch of different languages
I believe Chuck Berry Johnny be hood is
on that this is a really nice sort of
homage to that and keeping in with the
Carl Sagan spirit is there anything more
hipster than vinyl in space I think not
vinyl is here I think you might be right
I think you might be right patients in
wheelchairs
may be excited about another way to
access even more mobility
check out rip chair 3.0
it's been around for a few months but we
noticed it last week and wanted to talk
about how cool it is it is made by how
and how technologies and offers
offroading
to the disabled giving a user the chance
to go where a typical wheelchair can't
its gas-powered and holds a full sized
wheelchair inside it so a driver never
has to leave their own chair to use this
vehicle they're fully customizable
including options for various control
schemes winches and even storage space
making it a great option for anyone
looking to enjoy the outdoors in a big
way that's pretty amazing stuff you know
actually I've always wondered why there
weren't more things where you could just
take your wheelchair into it and then it
goes almost like a mech like kind of
like a very sort of basic version of a
mech like this seems like such a cool
thing and I love that this is giving
people who are in wheelchairs the
opportunity to really enjoy the outdoors
in a way that might be considered a
little bit dangerous if you're in a
standard wheelchair it's awesome stuff
yeah totally cool that videos wild we're
not doing a deep dive on Thursday but
what we should so we will just say send
us some tweets about these topics
because we're dying to know what record
you would send into space then be no
man's sky soundtrack oh yeah
very soon through I am a bit calm which
I bought I have a real ever real vinyl
videogame vinyl problem very niche
problem hipster problem so you I
probably sent Purple Rain but that's so
purple rain of course well you got to
have the aliens realize we are very
talented yeah they will just send us
love and return Purple Rain back kills
us sorry it's like it's what they wanted
you can always use a hashtag hey TD on
Twitter for those tweets so you know

course hit us up online and usually if
