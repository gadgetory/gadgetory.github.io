today to talk about the Nutri ninja
blender this single serve blender is fun
and easy to use either of these jars can
be attached to the blades for the
blending then you can take the same jar
put on a lid and be ready to run out the
door with your drink ninja has a few
high-end blenders out there including
the 1500 watt ninja Ultima for this one
they streamlined it down to 900 watts
but they also cut the cost the ninja
Ultima is 260 this one's only 90 bucks
the reason they cut the cost and
streamlined the device was to compete
with health-conscious smoothie makers
like the nutribullet both offer features
like nutrient extraction this one even
comes with a patented pro extractor
blade so you might ask what's the secret
how is this blender and how is the
nutribullet getting extra nutrients out
of your fruits and vegetables rest
assured it's not it's just blending the
fruit and vegetables well but this thing
does make a good smoothie that said so
does just about every other blender
we've tested so because it's only single
serve the Nutri ninja is lacking in
features and if you're paying for this
over the Hamilton Beach you're really
only getting speed and style the Nutri
ninja will make good smoothies quickly
it can't handle more detail-oriented
food processing tasks like its Big
Brother which can take almonds and turn
it into almond butter it will help you
do little multitasking things like
grinding up coffee beans nothing in here
is gonna magically help you get healthy
to do that you're gonna have to diet and
exercise but if you do want to make
quick smoothies on the go the Nutri
ninja is worth your consideration for
seen it i'm angie Gephardt
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
