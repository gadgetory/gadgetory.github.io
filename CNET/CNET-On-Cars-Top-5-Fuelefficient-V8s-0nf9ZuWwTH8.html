reputation as being yesterday's engine
incapable of doing much better than the
low-teens in mpg yet the allure of the
thing hangs on 50 years of marketing
we'll do that for you
I'm Brian Cooley with our top five ways
you can have your v8 and good gas
mileage - we selected cars only for this
list no trucks right now and gas only no
diesels are hybrids we wanted to get
classic v8 stuff to rank them we counted
in mpg the sheer horsepower and the
power-to-weight ratio of the car the
list we came up with by the way is all
German except for one American at the
top kicking all their Teutonic assets
number five the 2015 BMW 550i a 4.4
liter v8 that delivers 20 mpg average it
just pushed out the excellent Mercedes e
550 coupe by the way to begin the list
this Beamer has 145 horsepower and a
power-to-weight ratio just below that
magic number of 10 pounds per horse very
good in a great handling car that just
happens to be a very practical sedan
there's a lot to like here for about 65
grand second cheapest on our list number
for the 2015 Audi s8 4-liter v8 20 mpg
average the sporting version of the big
Audi has a v8 that you'll know when you
step on and it cranks out the most
horsepower on our list 520 now the
average mpg of 20 is at the bottom of
our list while it's MSRP of 115 gram is
at the top of our list
hence number four number three the 2015
audi a8 same basic engine but now 22 mpg
average what a difference a single
letter makes going from s to a makes
this the only car in our list to break
30 highway and still have that 22
average but we keep it at number three
because it is a big boy and this
smallish v8 means a power-to-weight
ratio that was our worst at 10.32 the
2015 Mercedes slk55 AMG
a biggish five and a half liter v8 but
still 22 mpg average who knew you bought
an AMG to be fuel-efficient this is the
baby brother of the big SL and it's got
the power-to-weight ratio to show for it
aleem 8.6 pounds per horse that makes it
okay for it to be the lowest powered car
on our list at 415 while time for the
best average mpg wait is everything
number one you'll be glad to hear is the
2015 chevy corvette 6.2 liter v8 but
still 21 mpg average the new c7 Vette is
amazing having the biggest engine on the
list doing 455 horse and has the best
power-to-weight ratio as well mpg is 17
29 close enough to say and get about 30
largely thanks to cylinder deactivation
that make it a 3 point 1 liter for when
you don't need everything add to that
the lowest price on our list
about 55 K if you've got a sanctimonious
tree of driving cousin this is the v8 to
drive to Thanksgiving or top 5 lists to
wait the car lover go to see net on cars
