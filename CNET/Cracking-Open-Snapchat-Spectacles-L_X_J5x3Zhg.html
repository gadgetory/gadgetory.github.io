the summer than a good pair of
sunglasses but these shades can do a lot
more than just protect your eyes
these are snapchat spectacles and
they're packed with a ton of tech to
help you capture and share all that
summertime fun how do they work let's
find out I'm Bill Detweiler and this is
cracking open snapchat spectacles are
basically a video camera built into a
pair of sunglasses the camera is mounted
above the right lens and the mic is
hidden just behind it by the left lens
are a pair of LED indicators the record
or the snap button and a charging
connector is hidden next to the temple
hinge our first step in cracking open
the spectacles is to remove the temples
or the arms that run alongside your head
with the temples removed we broke out
our trusty heat gun and loosen the
adhesive on the plastic covers that
protect the electronics mounted to each
side of the frame after gently prying
off the covers we got our first look at
the tech inside the spectacles on the
left under the snap button are the
battery charging circuitry LED
indicators and snap button contact on
the right are the camera microphone and
all the chips that make the spectacles
smarter than your average shades now to
get a closer look at all this tiny
hardware we first remove the battery now
attached to the battery is the charging
circuitry and the LED indicator that
lets the wearer know when the glasses
are recording next to come out were the
snap button contact and the front-facing
LED indicator now turning our attention
to the other side of the glasses we
detached the cable that connects the
electronics on the right side to the
battery and the circuits on the left
then we removed the miniature circuit
boards the mic and the camera and
Amborella
a 12 wearable camera processor
is the brains of these specs this
system-on-chip handles video and audio
capture and encoding and it's integrated
ARM Cortex a9 CPU runs pretty much
everything else the spectacles have a
four gig flash storage chip it holds all
your videos until you transfer them to
your phone and a Nordic semiconductor
wireless sock provides Bluetooth and
Wi-Fi connectivity so what did we learn
from cracking open the snapchat
spectacles
well basically snapchat took existing
wearable camera technology like that
found inside police body cameras and put
it inside an oddly stylish pair of
sunglasses while the spectacles only do
one thing record video for snapchat they
do it surprisingly well according to
most reviews so if you use snapchat
you'll probably want a pair of these now
for more information on the snapchat
spectacles check out our full review on
