I'm Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update nintendo announced that it will
drop the price of the wii u deluxe set
by fifty dollars starting September 20th
the deluxe system will cost three
hundred dollars and it'll also be
offered as a bundle with the game legend
of zelda the windwaker HD but that's not
the biggest Nintendo news the company
also revealed a brand new portable game
system the Nintendo 2ds it's forty
dollars cheaper than the 3ds and as you
can tell by the name it doesn't have a
3d screen it also doesn't have a hinge
to close it's just two screens on a
square block like a tablet the design
quickly garnered plenty of mocking
online considering it's not pocket
friendly like the 3ds but Nintendo is
not getting rid of the 3ds this is
supposed to be a cheaper option for
those that don't care to play games in
3d but is the sacrifice of a larger
device worth saving forty dollars you
could have always turned off the 3d on
the 3ds and without a clamshell design
you better buy a $13 pouch case to
protect those screens the 2d s arrives
October twelfth in red and blue and the
wii u isn't the only gadget with a price
cut Google's Nexus 4 smartphone is a
hundred dollars cheaper the unlocked
phone now starts at two hundred dollars
for the eight gig model in the Google
Play Store next this is a hot phone
because it is the pure goodness of
Android without being tainted by any
extra software it's a good phone but the
downsides are that it doesn't have a
micro SD card slot to expand the storage
and it doesn't tap into 4G LTE speeds
and that may change with the new Nexus
model later this year the kindle has new
competition from Kobo the Kobo aura is a
new 6 inch e-ink reader that's selling
at the high price of one hundred and
fifty dollars but that cost comes with
new technology it reduces the need for
flash refreshes which clears the screen
of ghosting marks there are also new
Kobo color tablets coming later in the
year with good specs at reasonable
prices at the high end is the Kobo arc
10hd it's four hundred dollars the
smaller arc seven
HD is two hundred dollars and if you
don't care about high-def screens the
arc 7 is just one hundred and fifty
dollars Kobo isn't a big player in the
US but it does well overseas a new angry
birds game is on the way game maker
rovio posted a YouTube video teasing a
new cart racing game called angry birds
go there wasn't real game footage share
just grown adults in bird costumes
driving go-karts so it could be similar
to a game like Mario Kart look out for
more details soon that's your tech news
