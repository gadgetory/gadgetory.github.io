aspire to but Nissan has combined real
styling with car light comfort to at
least make you suffer the indignity
smugly
let's drive to 2011 Nissan Quest SL and
check the tab the last quest looked like
it was on a quest for some kind of
identity and the quests before that were
twinned with the Mercury Villager well
Nissan killed the entire product line
after the 2009 s and just took a
breather now the quest is back with this
2011 a completely new look you're not
likely to mistake for anything and a
hunger to no longer play second fiddle
to Siena and Odyssey look around the
quest has a reputation of having the
best quality materials of any of its
competitors it's the newest model on the
market and I'd have to say it does do a
very good job of getting nice materials
but even though we're near the top of
the line on this guy you can't get
navigation I didn't say we don't have
navigation I said you can't even get it
in this car which is kind of strange for
a vehicle this high in the lineup of the
quest minivan oh by the way the screens
decent-size nice and generous and it's
quite reachable but it's not a
touchscreen you got to use this Nissan
controller kind of a simplified version
of what you'll find in an Infiniti for
example we've got six speakers around
the cabin just kind of a base audio
system is what you get on one of these s
l's sources our am/fm optical drive yes
but it's been sent to Siberia aka the
bottom of the console down here I do
have a very handy look right here
household outlet hundred and fifteen
volt kneel right there there's an
inverter built in the vehicle right next
to that is my USB jack which of course
can be USB thumb drives or in my case
I've got my iPod Touch hooked up one of
the key things on iPod connectivity is
how quickly can it load and scroll
things this one does pretty good I've
seen faster but this is fast enough to
be okay
one thing I don't like look at the
resolution I've gotten a $200 phone
compared to the crap on a $35,000 car
and it's 2011 I'll own this car for 7.6
years if I'm average what do you think
that display is going to look like
compared to everything else I own in
that time I noticed like lost over
satellite radio when I was listing all
of our audio sources because the only
way to get that is in kind of a chunky
package you've got to get the Bose audio
system which roles in the Bose
amplification 13 speakers and then you
get XM Radio I don't think it's
available Alucard now back here in the
second row it's good times for the juice
box set here's my drop down 11 inch
widescreen LCD that's one of the
better-looking ones I've seen in a
vehicle of this type and while it does
drop down from the ceiling it doesn't
block the drivers visibility from the
rear-view mirror just a slight amount
they did a good job of the altitudes
here notice it can echo the same content
on the front screen the seven inch or
these two can split off you can watch
the DVD in the front for example and
watch something on the aux Jack's to
write down their audio and video on the
rear so good flexibility keep everybody
happy here's our second row let me show
you how much I can fold these nice comfy
captain's seats down by the way these
are standard in the second row and
that's it they don't come out unless
you're handy with tools third row is
right there as you can see it's better
suited for kids I wouldn't put adults in
there unless you hate them now our
vehicles optioned up with not just one
but two panoramic glass moonroof they're
pretty good size they're not gutter to
gutter like you'll see on some vehicles
today but you do have one the kind of
services both second and third row here
and of course this one covers the front
row now back here these little switches
on the side panels these are a little
power assist to lower the third row
that's kind of nice it'll save your back
there's my flat load floor I'm talking
about it's not real low but then again
neither is the back of the vehicles that
kind of makes sense under here that was
interesting I'd call this a Smuggler's
box except you can put the smuggler in
there not just the whiskey he's carrying
now Nissan's known for their v6 is we've
got one in here real familiar stuff
three and a half litres sitting
sidesaddle driving the front wheels only
260 horsepower 240 foot-pounds of torque
gets this forty five hundred pound box
up to sixty in a respectable nine
seconds while delivering 1924 mpg one
transmission choice only it's going to
be a CVT and as we'll see on the road
Nissan does those really well
now underway the quest has a very
car-like feel it's very comfortable ride
nicely tuned and a lot of vehicles like
this tend to be harsh when they're
unladen and then they kind of settle out
when they're loaded that designers had
to pick a certain load level this one at
least unlaid rides very nicely Nissan
does CVT is continuously variable
transmissions exceptionally well
especially when made into relatively big
motors like in this one you get what
feels like real shift points not lots of
loopy spooly slipperiness I hate that in
some CB tastes easy handling here on a
tight turn in the city and now we're off
the freeway on to some choppy city
streets as they always seem to be in San
Francisco and again the ride is
isolating out all the craft pretty
nicely so all in all it's a nice minivan
with a real car like nature to it okay
let's price this big boy this 2012 quest
SL again one notch from the top is about
35 delivered fairly nicely equipped but
there are some tech choices you got to
consider first is that rear seat DVD
system which is pretty good that's
$2,100 but here's what's interesting
about it you better start with that for
the following reason because the
panoramic roof option requires DVD it's
1350 more and the Bose option which
gives you XM and better sound requires
both the DVD system and the panoramic
roof I've never quite seen a stacking of
packages like that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
