getting more conversational check this
out
hey Google what movies is George Clooney
George Clooney's movies include Batman
and Robin Ocean's eleven and fifty-nine
others how old is he he's 56 years old
notice I didn't say the wakê words again
this is a new thing where you don't
actually have to say those wakê words
every single time you want to give a
command it continues listening look the
mic is still hot and it stays hot for up
to eight seconds after you issue a
command and continues recording to see
what else it can respond to it still
keeps those features where it remembers
context from your previous question so
notice I didn't say George Clooney again
it just knew that that's what it meant
and I can get the mics to turn off just
by saying thank you and then it finishes
and stops listening so the continued
conversation feature is one you're going
to be able to enable in the app so if
you don't want that mic to stay hot you
don't actually have to keep it you can
also give it multiple commands at once
or ask multiple questions at once hey
Google set a timer for five minutes and
add baking soda to my shopping list
alright five minutes and that's starting
now okay I've had in baking soda to your
shopping list Google actually
soft-launched the multiple actions in
November of last year so Google
definitely wants you to be able to have
more natural conversations with its
assistant but it also wants to help
train your kids to be a little bit more
polite so that when your kid gives a
command to Google home your kid will
actually have to say please in order for
Google to respond to the command the
feature is called pretty please so Robo
is playing a little catch-up here to
Amazon's assistant Alexa Alexa will
already keep the mic hot if you enable
that settings so you can give multiple
commands and Alexa has a version of the
pretty please feature however you can't
multiple commands at once to Alexa like
you can with the Google assistant
finally you're gonna be able to
customize how Google sounds when it
talks to you a little bit more you can
already pick between two voices for your
Google assistant Google's rolling out
six more options and you can customize
your voice and your spouse can customize
a different voice and your Google home
smart speaker will just switch depending
on who's talking hi I'm your Google
assistant here to help you throughout
your day and now you can choose from
different voices for me to speak with so
with pleases and thank-yous and six new
voices and ongoing conversations Google
assistant is getting a lot closer to a
natural human assistant and it's getting
a lot more customizable I might not
forget it's a robot quite yet but it's
getting closer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
