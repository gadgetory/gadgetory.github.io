Johnny salesman the cheapest live TV
streaming service Philo is trying to
catch up with its big lead competitors
Philo streams live TV from a very skinny
bundle of cable channels for about 16
dollars a month without any major sports
TV or you know around-the-clock news you
know compared to rivals like sling TV
and PlayStation View Philo's the
smallest streamer but it's taking two
steps forward Joanie solve Salzmann
scoop that the surface is going to be
adding support for streaming on Apple TV
and fire TV by this summer so how
important are these moves well they're
also adding a feature where if you're a
subscriber you can authenticate into any
of those cable network apps so you can
go to the Comedy Central app and log in
there and together what it means is file
is just more competitive you know before
it wasn't it you weren't able to stream
it on anything other than a roku device
basically and they only have an app for
iOS they don't have one for Android so
by slowly having more devices like Apple
TV and Amazon fire TV as something you
can stream on that gives them a broader
base of people that could potentially be
subscribers so if it doesn't have sports
or you know around-the-clock news
networks I'm assuming you know big
baseball fans aren't gonna be really
wanting so who would want in on this
right so the person that makes this
makes sense for they've found that their
sweet spot customer is somebody who is a
major fan of one of their networks so
they do cover so if you're a huge fan of
like discovery that channel or a huge
fan of Comedy Central then this is a
great option for you because you can get
the live TV and now with this expanded
TV off TV Everywhere authentication you
can also sign into those channels apps
and get all the extras that you would
want the kind of super fan would want
those kind of things so house is
different from like say Netflix or Hulu
right so they like to say that it's a
great companion to Netflix Netflix it's
all obviously like all on-demand content
and Efrain says like you know crossed
themselves millions of times and said
they're never going to have live TV and
so if you want live TV without having to
pay for a really expensive digital
package or very expensive cable
subscription and this is a way to get
you some live TV for like lifestyle sort
of content without having to pay a whole
lot
yeah so next up the Commerce Department
announced that it was banning US exports
the Chinese phone company ZTE this is
over violating sanctions et agreed to in
March 2017 after the company pled guilty
to providing American technology to
phone makers in Iran and North Korea z-t
said they would reprimand 35 employees
involved with it as part of the
settlement but they didn't in fact they
actually gave them annual bonuses for it
US officials said that alleged lie led
to a ban announced today which means
companies like Qualcomm and Dolby won't
be able to export 2zt this is kind of a
massive hit considering that their
phones pretty much like run on Qualcomm
chips you know and so what does this all
mean really right well it definitely is
a bat it's definitely a hurdle for ZTE
you know Chinese handset makers have had
a lot of trouble lately
with the u.s. you know wall way the
government says like there are security
concerns with Huawei and because of that
all these people that sell that could
sell their phones said sorry we're not
gonna carry them anymore the difference
is that while we doesn't really have a
lot of people that use it yes he's often
reviewed on our website a lot it's it's
popular within the prepaid market so it
could actually have more impact on
consumers yeah so Facebook also has a
major problem with fake news and it's a
address with fact checkers for news
stories and changing how it except ads
over the last two years but you know
experts find that the majority of
disinformation on Facebook is coming
from memes which might sound a little
crazy but I mean have you ever seen a
meme on Facebook sending you know
basically that was like completely false
information I mean everyone I know you
have yes yeah so one of them that I'd
seen that was really popular was
something about Barack Obama giving a
medal to like Harvey Weinstein and Bill
Cosby which is obviously fake right but
it was like distributed like crazy over
Facebook on that so that's all the time
that we have for today's show if you
like what you heard check us out on CNET
i'm out for ding I'm Joni sauceman
thanks for listening and that concludes
the recording of the audio podcast it's
time for me to go and earn my pay check
by delving through all of your fantastic
questions and comments to keep the
conversation going we appreciate you
tuning in I'm shocked and stunned memes
aren't real well the thing is is like
memes are like meant to
like not be believed right like it's
supposed to be so absurd that like
obviously it's fake like one of the
examples I pointed out in my story was
like it's a very like favorite meme of
mine that's just like the Italian
warfare kind of thing words like they
they take like Italian stuff like pizza
and then they say there was like a
picture of like pizza floating on the
water and they were like Italian World
War two Navy like that's like the the
joke is like the thing with memes like
they're not meant to be believed and yet
like we've come to a point where so many
people look at them and like basically
think right yeah this is this is
definitely information I mean like you
even look at Donald Trump's Twitter
account from when he was running for
president he then posted something about
like the the rate of black-on-black like
crime right which was completely wrong
and it was like some like really like
racist like meme post right but yeah
that spread for a while until the
account was deleted that he retweeted it
from yeah the idea though is that you
know there's way more fake news like
spreading like via memes and like actual
like fake news articles that which is
what Facebook is tackling and and your
reporting did you people you talked to
you and did you discuss how that can be
I imagine it's a really tricky thing
because they're pictures yeah with yeah
in misinformation in there it's not like
it's taxed yeah so Facebook has actually
been ramping up its tools for this they
actually only rolled it out late March
and they're only testing out in France
right now yeah so they used it
originally for picture their
fact-checking pictures and videos now
they the first pilot program was during
the Alabama special election where there
was a lot of fake images about Roy Moore
and you know just just leading up to
that and they actually banned like
thousands of accounts from Macedonia
that was spamming it with like fake
memes and things like that so what
they're looking at is essentially like
post like there was one a fake one of
like an NFL player burning the American
flag which is also fake photos like
taking like an image of like a conflict
in like Syria or something like that and
claiming that was like an anti like gun
rights protest in like the US right so
they're looking at issues like that but
like a bulk of it is also like divisive
memes that like tend to go viral a lot
right yeah and it's such as stuff but
like it's like there's there's liberal
memes that are yeah yes yes yeah yeah so
you're showing your cards a little bit
Alfred I when are we going to actually
see punishment brought forth on trolls
is there going to be some kind of oh
they get their kind I mean it's
activating what we do yeah we gonna
actually see fines there's no law
against relying on yeah we should
somebody should consider that yeah I
mean extreme degree it's one thing to
crack a joke it's one thing when
somebody posts something that like you
should know better that's obviously fake
and then there's the active people there
yeah that yeah that comes into a serious
issue of like why why are we policing
memes and things like that
and it brings up a serious issue of like
censorship for Facebook so when does it
become hate crime though it it's that's
a problem it's anything more thing it's
tough but like there you have to
consider this during the Senate hearing
last week Mark Zuckerberg dict did talk
about how it's like a very thin line
between like censorship and you know
making sure that you know hate speech
doesn't get out there or anything like
that I believe during one of the
testimonies in November with Facebook's
like legal counsel Colin stretch he had
mentioned that all of the posts that
were like paid for from like Russian
trolls would have been perfectly fine on
Facebook if they were actually done by
like the groups that were pretending to
be sure it wasn't the you know
inauthenticity of the content more so
that the the source like if it was just
like a normal person saying like an
American person yeah yeah and this
person's like the devil or something
like that and you know we should get him
out of our country that would have been
fine for Facebook it was that it was a
Russian troll pretending to be an
American that was the problem for them
so would you say that that is a good
border line to cross for when as Josh
boy two points at what point does a mean
go from satire to misinformation that's
yeah that's like the big question now
that's like the big reason why Facebook
has has not really been addressing this
because there's there's such nuance to
it there's way more nuance than you know
is this a joke you know who's really
behind this versus like when you see a
news story that's this is clearly fake
we have you know evidence showing that
this never happened kind of thing so
it's it's like a very like
gray area especially for something that
like all these you know a lot of people
like a look at memes like they are jokes
which they should be but you know we're
in a sad state of affairs where we can't
do that okay that's enough on the trolls
we've had enough Facebook for a little
bit let's move over into streaming
something that does affect everybody
well damn near everybody at this point
for us cord cutters Jonathan Wilk is
asking is Philo going to be available in
Germany and I'd like to go ahead and
extend that to see when and where we're
gonna see this in other international
markets yeah so I don't think that it's
gonna that's definitely not imminent I
feel like Philo I haven't heard this
from them myself but you know they're a
snitch small product in the US and so
they're gonna be focusing just on the US
for the foreseeable future I mean they
don't even think don't even have an
Android app like they have to get an
Android app for the u.s. the other thing
is that because they these channels are
basically u.s. channels and so for them
to expand internationally they have to
go to the programmers many of whom are
backers of the service but they have to
go to the programmers and say hey and
you want to make your service available
to stream anywhere in the entire world
and so it's up to those programmers
people that own the network's to decide
whether or not that's the stuff they
want to take so it's not even in really
Philo's hands and even if it were it's
they're a long way away from having like
an international rollout just by virtue
of being a small company got it that
makes a lot of sense I mean we saw any
amount of other of these Oroku took a
while to really get their wheels spin
and yeah I mean that's just growing
pains I'm actually really interested it
only because you know my our viewers
know exactly how cheap I am why yeah if
I weren't already on my parents like
cable plan we're like I know their login
so I can find out the TV Everywhere
thing check I would probably like pay
for this it's like 15 bucks a month
that's you know cheaper than what I'd
pay for Spotify or Hulu or Netflix like
together yeah I mean it's not like
there's music channels on this but like
yeah yeah yeah yeah actually no no but
like this like you know how am like
cable there's like those like
straight-up radio station channels yeah
I you I actually use that yeah that's
the lease millennial thing I've ever
heard just like it's like stuff I put in
the background and then I read a book or
something
subscribe Spotify
yeah that's why I don't use it anymore
that's why don't have cable saying like
if I did have TV yeah right alright so
we've got it coming to Apple TV we've
got it coming to amazon firetv right
what about chromecast we got people
asking about chromecast right so right
now what you can do you can stream with
a coke a scuse me you can stream with a
chromecast in the sense that you can
cast from a Chrome browser sure which
isn't the ideal way and to be fair as a
regular chromecast yeah it's a little
rough it's it's a little janky for sure
so you can use Chrome cast with a via
that method there's no right now on the
roadmap so by the summer they're gonna
have Android fire I'm sorry fire TV from
Amazon that whole family so if it's the
stick or the set-top box either one
Apple TV and then from there because
Amazon fire TV is run on a version of
Android from that they're gonna kind of
understand what it means to program for
Android and then have an Android mobile
app roll out after that so presumably
chromecast is one of the most popular
ways to stream presumably that they
started with Roku which is the single
most popular way to stream content to a
TV and I imagine that chromecast because
that's their strategy to go after the
way people like to stream most may
imagine it's gonna be pretty soon on the
room that but chromecast is the most
like popular way to stream like when
you're like I usually cast from my phone
I don't know how other people like cast
their stuff but for in this specific
example you'd have to go on like a
desktop or a laptop computer with Chrome
to chromecast right because you can't do
it because I'm an Android version they
don't have a chromecast app yeah they
don't have like a channel yeah yeah yeah
but presumably believe that that would
be pretty high on their priority list
yeah as we have said with everything
regarding this its forthcoming but we
don't have an ETA I wonder how long it's
gonna take before Roku becomes like the
kleenex of set-top boxes is it just like
there's a I'm gonna watch it on my Roku
but you have a fire I don't care it's a
broker would love that they would they
would go crazy for that I think it's
easily the best marketed um maybe it's
definitely the one that people use the
most they and it's a company unlike any
of the other streamers all the other
streaming set-top boxes are made by
giant companies it's the only one that's
like a pure play all they really
concentrate on is having their set-top
box work well and so by virtue of that
some people
say like cats Meyer our reviewer says
that it's his favorite and that might be
part of the reason why is because all
they're focused on is on getting their
set-top box right maybe a few more could
benefit from that work ethic let's take
some questions from the chat from
Matthew data this is more of a statement
that's after my own heart
as per usual sir so many sources of
video when will we get to the point when
I can pay a few cents on the dollar per
episode for shows I really want to watch
rather than pay for an entire service
that may that means one show I want to
watch one for every single 100 that I
don't watch and that's the ala carte
thing that we've always dreamed of and
as we are starting to get it
we would to any extent iTunes kind of
epitomizes that right but everybody's
got their own app now and Disney's gonna
launch an app you have to pay an extra
four bucks a month on top of Netflix on
top of Hulu on top of Amazon on top of
this and that in lifetime and you kind
of pay like per episode on Amazon right
now you can do it on Amazon iTunes it's
not a couple cents like that good thing
like you're never gonna have an all the
cart world where you can you know pay a
nickel and watch an episode of no cuz
when they're all done with this instead
of paying $180 a month for a cable
service you're going to pay fifty five
different installments of 399 a month
for the different networks you want
because only single shows exist on those
networks and I'm going to give you
they're not gonna give you the
Mythbusters app you're gonna have to buy
the Discovery Channel Science Channel
package right so that's the kind of
irony or tension about the idea of like
the dream of Alucard like in theory
Alucard is what people say they want but
the programming in order to pay a la
carte you cable as much as people hate
it is a really good value you may hate
the fact that you're paying for ESPN and
you're never watching it but you're
getting every single channel for that
amount if you had to break everything up
and pay ala carte only for what you want
it's kind of approximate it's concerning
you also have to pay for internet
service in order to stream if you're
paying all the card for just what you
want you're still gonna be paying pretty
much about the same amount and there's
something to be said for the improvement
on where cables come from where is now
back in the day the actual formula for
cable was just like it's just programmed
it's you miss it you miss it you're
screwed now with all of the they what do
they call TiVo's and
like that makes it more work they call
it like stacking season on demand stuff
where if you decide you start one want
to start watching Walking Dead at the
12th episode of a 13-episode season you
can watch from season 1 that's that's
viewership suicide well it's not because
they're watching if you're watching on a
cable programmer you can insert ads into
it and they've also already you know
programmers are starting to learn that
they can't just ignore the fact that
people want to watch what they want to
watch when they want to watch it they're
learning that the only reason they
resisted that is because it's really
lucrative to only have it on a live feed
with ads but they're learning and
they're changing it's just we haven't
reached that promise Leon that gotcha
yeah I'm with you - always in forever
here's a terrifying thought from Abdulle
well Disney make their own set-top box
how terrifying and how close are we to
these proprietary streaming networks to
them making their own hardware I would
be shocked if Disney made a streaming
box
partly because Disney has a really good
relationship with Apple or a close
relationship with Apple and that's not
their you know that's not their sweet
spot they're gonna be going through this
giant takeover of Fox this assuming that
it gets regulatory approval that's gonna
be taking up a lot of their attention
first yeah you make more sense for them
to start their own streaming service
what they're doing yeah yeah the service
is one thing but are we gonna have to
start carrying around bandoliers of USB
sticks like HDMI stick I don't swap
outlets or some ship mp3 players except
terrible like cyberpunk future thank God
I don't worry about that there's plenty
of dystopia is to worry about that's not
one TV start coming with the USB HDMI
dongles fanning out all the way around
the monitor you have to tap one every
end of that 90 inputs on there and it
just looks like a sunflower of shame I
don't think from Alex Cutler Direct TV
now is the best streaming TV app I have
used I tried sling PS view they were
okay but not as good
also Zack Ali likes Hulu TV what's
everyone's favorite right now who do you
think you're getting the best bang for
your buck out of
right quality to selection I don't have
my parents account I don't I don't have
any favorite um and actually I don't
know you know I think even cats are
reviewer who's you know it's his job to
make this sort of like determinations I
haven't talked with him lately if he has
a favorite I think that you know
PlayStation I think the you know kind of
like with streaming music services it
just kind of depends on what you're
looking for which one suit your needs
best yeah I mean I really just have an
antenna like at the moment like Leif
kind of thing that just gets the local
channels and if I need to watch
something that I want to watch I'll ask
my friends for their password yeah and
then I watch that like one episode or
something where I find it on YouTube you
got to pay that forward though man you
got to like yeah I'm brown eyes or
someone or I sure my Spotify with them
alright yeah we're all part of yeah I'm
a digital communist digital media
communist communist
the coop that is accurate for me it
depends on the day I want to say the
most frequent I probably appreciate a
lot of what netflix carries as far as
the content goes because they're
appealing right now with all the Marvel
stuff that I'm obviously into as a comic
book geek but we're gonna lose that soon
with the Disney app so who knows where
I'm gonna be
however Netflix has put a lot of value
into their original content but at the
same time you know tomorrow I could say
like Hulu keep me up-to-date with actual
network stuff that I don't get as a cord
cutter Bob's Burgers so on and so forth
but then last night I was poking around
in Amazon Prime and it floored me
anybody who's got Amazon Prime go out
there and look now they decided to do a
supercut of the old sex IDI videos you
saw in like the 50s and 60s in the
middle in high school and I'm not saying
that like that is a some bizarre
perversion for me so go go ahead and
mean that up I don't care but the fact
that that exists and there's also like
old PSA collections of content you never
thought whatever surface ever again the
fact that Amazon TV
excuse me provides that platform is
fascinating to me but like they're deep
cut they're they're rabbit hole is
deeper than you could even begin to
imagine but you know um yeah
you know you mentioned Hulu one of the
kind of criticisms of Philo is that you
get a lot hulu has a lot of the same
programmers involved with them and you
can get most of Philo's content on Hulu
for like $4 $10 less half the cost
you just can't watch it live you know
and how much does it matter it's that's
a personal thing for you know each each
individual but you know how much is how
much doesn't matter if you watch like
Deadliest Catch live or you know yeah I
think the last time I needed to watch
something like on live TV on cable was
Zuckerberg interview of CNN and yeah I
use my parents account for that but like
that was like nearly a month ago
yeah most really most of stuff you want
to watch live or news or sports and it
doesn't have any of that yeah and that's
does not going anywhere anytime soon
yeah that's always gonna be around but
as far as the original content we're
seeing that migrated to the digital and
yeah that's no redundant statement on my
behalf
let's pivot real quick before we wrap it
up for the day from Josh Boyd our ZTE
phones now band to be sold in the US or
is it just harder for them to get the
Qualcomm chips yeah they're they're not
band to be sold in the US though you
would have a very hard time finding any
like store or carrier that would want to
you know sell their phones yeah that too
so yeah it's the second point it's all
US exports to ZTE so like like I said
Qualcomm can't like send their their
chips to them anymore so for the next
like 7 years so I don't know if it's
gonna be harder more so that's going to
be like impossible for them to do it
like just like a quick look at a CTE
phone that I looked up on see Knights
website you know they also use like
Gorilla Glass which is also from the
u.s. USA for their screens and also
Dolby like speakers so mm-hm you know
they're gonna have to get all our chips
from somewhere else and their screen
from somewhere else and their speakers
from somewhere else which is you know
that that's gonna be like a pretty big
deal for that yeah it's gonna be
time-consuming it also might hurt
quality yeah I mean it's probably even
gonna spike the price if they're gonna
have to start importing from somewhere
else who knows maybe it could they find
makers in China that do it cheaper then
maybe it won't cost as much but the
point is the way that they wanted to
make their phone without any of those
restrictions they wanted to make it this
way Gorilla Glass and with Qualcomm
chips so it's definitely gonna cause
them to go for a plan B do you think
there's a snowball's chance in hell that
they bring that manufacturing under
their own hood and they start no no no
like the only the only like a few
companies that do their own
manufacturing is like Apple and even
they yeah and like Samsung and they
don't make their chips yeah sir it's
right they don't Sam some makes well
they use Qualcomm chips Apple No yeah
they don't they they it's like also made
in China yeah but like it's like their
technologies right right all right that
pretty much does it for today well great
way to kick off the week fascinating
subject and we had to minimize our
exposure to Facebook sorry is lucky
Macca's ah Christine that's gonna do it
for today thanks everybody for joining
us in the chat we'll wrap it up here and
we'll see you again tomorrow
