on-ear headphone that sells for around
26 dollars online as a relative bargain
at its modest price point hi I'm David
Carr noise and JVC makes a number of
inexpensive headphones though not all of
them are good I'm a fan of the $13 on
ear flats the $7 in your gummy plus and
now this H is 400 which some people
simply referred to as the nanotube
headphone it comes in white or black and
from a design standpoint this model is a
ho-hum all plastic affair that isn't
going to WoW anybody but it's not ugly
while the build quality only seems okay
the headphones do feature a fairly thick
3.9 4 foot cord and l-shaped plug that
lends some sturdiness to the overall
design this is a dual core design with
cables hardwired into the ear cups terms
of comfort the nanotubes are pretty
decent for an on-ear model there's no
swanky memory foam but the ear pads are
reasonably soft I was able to wear them
for fairly long stints with only
occasional adjustments I liked how they
both fold up and fold flat at this price
point you don't expect too many extras
and there really aren't any no carrying
pouch is included and there's no inline
or microphone for making cell phone
calls
JVC says this headphone is powered by
the world's first carbon nanotube
diaphragm it's a 30 millimeter driver
and while I can't tell you how special
that diaphragm is or isn't the results
are good the headphones sound pretty
dynamic the little extra sizzle in the
treble and deep bass that's reasonably
tight it's got what we like to call a
happy face sound profile with both highs
and lows that are a little amped and
mids that aren't in fact I'd say the
mids are the weakest part of the
performance there's just not a whole lot
of warmth to the vocals but in all the
headphones sound quite decent for the
money and compete favorably against such
models as a similarly priced Panasonic
RPD j/s 400 K and the sony MDR ZX 300
I'm David Conroy and those are the JVC H
a s 400 carbon nanotubes
