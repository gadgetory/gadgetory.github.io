wheelchair just getting around requires
lots of planning getting in a door may
not be an issue but once inside things
can still be tricky for anyone with a
disability we're gonna keep track of the
number of floors a number of stairwells
a number of Oakman who's getting his PhD
at the University of Pennsylvania is
part of a growing movement to use mobile
apps to collect information about
accessibility and share it with the
people who need it he created an app
called the accessibility mapping project
he and other volunteers visit each
building to collect the data Oakland was
born with a rare degenerative condition
similar to AOS in the last couple of
years he's had to use a wheelchair
full-time
he said changes to his own body have
made him realize how accessibility may
mean different things to different
people
I'm in a wheelchair so I'm gonna door to
be a certain size I need there to be a
push plate but I can't think from
everyone else's point of view but if we
have everyone being able to contribute
their own understanding of what access
is then we get a much more robust
complete picture I'm going to look for a
place to eat for dinner
Sharon Pennock is a disability rights
advocate and community organizer in
suburban Philadelphia she's used several
mapping apps to help her find a place to
host events that are accessible to
everyone so you could read the entryway
now she's doing her own site surveys and
updating the apps this is her second
visit to a community center in Ardmore
Pennsylvania since we were there last
there's actually been a piece of
furniture added that blocks the entrance
to the bathroom
sohe wheelchair user would not be able
to get in there right now Pennock is
grateful that the developers created
these apps but she says many are still
buggy or they don't provide enough
information so frustrating she'd rather
just fire up Google Maps and find what
she needs she may soon get her wish
google just announced its adding routes
for wheelchair users to its Maps the
fact that Google is now beginning to
collect that information is is exciting
to me and I hope that the places that
pull information from Google will be
pulling all of that information as well
for Bookman it's all about raising
awareness and opening a dialogue
starting those conversations between
what is access is like a pen
what is access alike at Penn included in
Philadelphia and what is access look
like at Penn including Pennsylvania the
u.s. the world is the conversation that
I want to start</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
