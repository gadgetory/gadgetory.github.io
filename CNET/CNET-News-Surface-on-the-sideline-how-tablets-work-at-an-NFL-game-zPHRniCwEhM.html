field at MetLife Stadium at a very rainy
beginning to a Jets dolphins Monday
Night Football game and we actually are
here to take a look at what happens on
the sidelines this is well before
kickoff but there are surface tablets
that have been deployed here in this
past season and these are the first time
that there have been tablets as opposed
to the more traditional system of
printed app plays so what happens
technologically on these sidelines are
these tablets full-featured stat heavy
things no they're actually much more
targeted simplified play delivery
mechanisms that show you pictures of
what's going on in a play-by-play basis
before we had these still prints rarebit
we need series we had guys on and out
and in these black-and-white photos you
know for a couple years we had the color
high-definition photos but now they just
hold on to it and are standing there and
in serious like right after playing
believe it or not some of the older guys
really embraced it like we didn't expect
our offensive coordinator to dive right
in we thought he was gonna hesitate to
jump into the technology sure and he
grabbed it and he loved it and it's a go
and you can't use cell phones on the
sidelines you can't use a lot of
technology so the existence of tablets
is new and interesting what you see from
the floating cameras and the special
Birds Eye views and the glowing
sidelines and the yellow markers that
stuff that's for TV production the what
the coaches get access to is a much more
simple system it could get more
complicated as time goes on so the
coaches are gonna have a setup that they
want to see and each coach could be a
little bit different from special teams
or offensive defensive coordinators so
they before the game starts have a
preference that preference is unloaded
in and so whatever they're seeing from
the sideline or the end zone cams what
they want to see coaches would have to
wait for the series now they get it
instantaneously right the other
advantage is like they can take it in so
I'm an NFL coach I'm standing here in a
soaking wet sideline I'm grumpy I'm
using a tablet but this thing actually
does work in the rain you can annotate
with this that the the stylus thankfully
does write in in pretty rainy conditions
here
very well this is the only technology
that you're gonna see them using they're
not gonna pull out a cellphone or
anything else like that so what they're
doing is they've got the headsets
they'll be communicating with we've got
their tablets and and they've also got
the still shot system as well but then
also they're independent networks you
couldn't take this for example and go
walk over the other side lines and even
get on their system I think the biggest
challenge is really were the ability to
work in the harsh environments the NFL
but that's why you have this as a heated
and weather controlled charging station
for these tablets that also acts as a
backup in case the wireless isn't
working you could actually load the
photos from each play inside this that's
this hardwired connection right here
I've been out here only about an hour
and you can see how wet I am so you can
imagine a three-hour game how wet the
electronics get so it's got to hold up
that's a view a quick look at how the
NFL action works on surface tablets and
some of the tech that goes on on the
field I'm Scott Stein here in MetLife
Stadium getting ready for kickoff</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
