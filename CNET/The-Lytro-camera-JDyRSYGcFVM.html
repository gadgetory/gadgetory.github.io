and we have a first look at the electro
camera this is the first ever a
light-filled camera now you see this
design it's really unique it's not a
traditional camera because this camera
does not do traditional things so when
you talk about your standard digital
cameras you know you focus on one one
angle one specific amount of light focus
on a prana subject but here this
captures everything a light-filled
sensor captures all the light
information in the picture so what I'm
going to do here is kind of show you an
example we're going to take this camera
right here now and we're going to just
go up really close the beauty of this
you do not need a focus I know it
doesn't sound like it could happen but
you don't need to focus on the picture I
just snap it instantly and I have this
dinosaur right here in the forefront now
some of the specs inside of this camera
it includes an 8 X optical zoom an F to
constant aperture really unheard of in
any kind of camera at this size and what
you can do once you have the pictures in
here is you'll plug it into your
computer your PC or your Mac the
software that comes included allows you
to manipulate the picture so no matter
what I take right now after the fact
I'll be able to choose what I want to
focus on so I mean like I said really
crazy amazing stuff now if you look at
the form factor on here there's not too
many buttons there's really not many
buttons at all
you have your standard power button you
also have your shutter button it's an
instant shutter and you have here at the
top if you kind of slide back and forth
you'll have a zoom what also makes this
product unique is that this glass screen
in the back this is a touch screen that
allows you to interact with the pictures
just like you interact with it on your
computer so you can swipe left or right
to see some of the previous pictures
you've taken and then what's a beauty of
this is in the camera the software is
all there which enables you to pick a
focal point and then it focuses it on
the camera just some really amazing
software again you don't need a focus
when you take your picture so the big
question is when are these going to be
available you can jump on electro comms
website there's a few models out there
the graphite and the aqua blue color
they'll be going for 8 gigs at 399
dollars and then if you talk about the
red hot model that's going to be a 16
gig model for $4.99 but they'll be
starting to ship early sometime in 2012
but overall this is just some
the killer technology first time we've
ever seen it bringing it to you in your
living room I'm Brian Tom Christina TV
