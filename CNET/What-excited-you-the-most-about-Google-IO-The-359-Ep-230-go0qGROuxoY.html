Thursday everybody it's May 18th episode
230 or tooth hurty if you will if you're
a dentist
welcome to the 359 podcast and in the
house today we've got a Reggie Chang and
Alfred Inge guys what's going on hey if
we all bounce back from Google i/o yes
sort of I don't I had I was an intense
amount of coverage well me well there's
no other day today yes I'm gonna try to
reincorporate today I try to give you
the the highlights good luck rest us
most with disappointed us with Google
i/o might need like an 859 for that one
yeah I know we're gonna try to keep it
quick but that's what the appo shows for
right alright so as always if you have
any questions about Google i/o or any of
the huge announcements from yesterday
leave in the comment section Brian will
get them and we will get to them in 3
minutes and 59 seconds from 3 to welcome
to the 339 I'm Roger Chang I'm Alfred
Aang so Google dropped an overwhelming
amount of news yesterday at this I Oh
developer conference from Google lens
updates to its home in photos and of
course Android Oh Google has certainly
been keeping busy so after what aside
you most from the developer conference
yo did you see that google lens on the
Wi-Fi password that was amazing yes like
the most practical use of something like
that I've seen it a lot just frustrated
that like that didn't come out early I
just seems like one of those things like
why didn't no one think of this before I
have to imagine it's that's that was
pretty complicated to pull off yes for
our listeners if you're not familiar
with it it bit google lens basically
uses your camera is kind of like an AR
yeah thanks so it's sort of like image
recognition so one of its features is
that if you need to get the Wi-Fi
password from underneath somebody's
router and if it's like 16 letters long
you can just point the Google lens at it
and it'll automatically recognize that
and then I'll populate the autofill
Autopia and it'll connect straight from
there it's not like a copy and paste so
that is like I said one of the more
practical uses I've seen of this kind of
image recognition technology you know
there's other things right like pointing
your camera at a restaurant
yeah the reviews
and that's actually not just based off
your camera because it's connected of
like Google Maps and your locations so
like it connects with that it knows
where you are and then it like takes a
look at the restaurants and it like
scans for the names and all that so you
can basically find out you know if it's
a good restaurant like what they look
like on Yelp all that kind of stuff
what's really interesting this is
actually a form of augmented reality now
AR we've mostly seen through snapchat
Instagram through those filters right
through like lenses puking rainbows
unicorns crowns all kind of fun stuff
Google is actually taking a different
tack they're actually making AR that you
actually want to use I'd be interested
to see how well this works though
because they had something like this
before with Google Goggles yes on like
an older version of Android and I tried
using it in the past and it really
wasn't it was a it was their incest then
again it that was a couple years old
yeah they've definitely stepped up their
uh their work in terms of AI the backend
machine learning so there's there's a
lot more resources being put here so
this isn't just a part of Google I think
goggles is kind of a project like a
one-off for them if you like a lens it's
critical to their their whole strategy
assistant right up speaking which let's
talk about Google home yeah so they they
offered a bunch of improvements
including home or phone calls uh but you
were still kind of pointed right you
were looking for more yes because I
wanted a cheaper version if you listen
to podcast yesterday it was basically
please give me something that I can like
buy and just justify having as opposed
to you know this expensive like home
assistant what you're looking for is
basically their equivalent of echo dot
yes yes yes the stocking stuffer that
can they just are tossed around it's
fairly not disposable but it's you know
sort of cheap people wait that's a thing
all the features looked incredibly cool
like the the phone calls that you could
make they're finally catching up to
Amazon with Spotify integration being
able to stream off chromecast which like
I really want that feature for Amazon
but probably won't see it yeah all the
features are really cool it's just one
of those things or like please you know
drop the price on this thing
alright lastly we have to talk about
Android Oh which they didn't they didn't
spell out the name but I guess we
weren't really expecting that what what
to you was the most
same thing by undertow for me it was
definitely project treble so that's kind
of their move to kind of get every
Android kind on the same level here so
they're not as fragmented as it is yes
that's definitely the biggest problem
right seven percent are on the newest
version of Android that's a small small
number and right now that's kind of like
a major security issue for them because
not everyone's getting the patches as
soon as they should be getting them
which from wanna cry we know you know
you should try to update us frequently
as you can but in some scenarios you
just can't right all right look there's
plenty more today Google i/o so for more
of those stories check us out at sea net
I'm Roger Chang I'm Alfred Aang thanks
for listening there is a lot more that
we we really kind of breach through some
of the highlights I'm sitting so project
drag pack that in the four minutes I'm
sitting here sweating listening to talk
about Google photos we could even get to
Google photos like it's just there's
just so much from that show we talked
about the VR aspect this the standalone
VR and like that Sarah Lee graze the
surface on the AR oh yeah it's uh do you
think is I for me it seemed like the AR
aspects were a lot more interesting this
year than the VR VR sort of you know
they kind of like they talked about it
they're the headsets are coming later
this year but for me the AR self had way
more practical applications now like I
would I want lens now and what that
Wi-Fi thing now also to be fair if your
Wi-Fi is still underneath your router
like what are you doing actually your
life - why why don't you change it yeah
I am super lazy it's not even that hard
it's if you go on your computer if you
go to any website ever like it's it's
the same amount of effort yeah I'm just
at least alright will you change it when
you get google lens like you can just no
in fact it's like it'll encourage me to
be more lazy because I just put my
camera I'm gonna take away your CNET
card okay your official company
sanctions seen it a thority card if you
at least rename your server you're like
why fired yes okay yeah yeah to not
Rogers house verizon fios whatever no I
have renamed the networks
oh wait what's the name of your network
um a one no that's lame it's very
newspaper II yeah I guess oh yeah
Charles nerd what's yours uh RC network
and you guys are no fun I mean I named
mine the house of tradies it used to be
ha ha ha I used to be good reference
yeah used to be whoo tang LAN and then
like people were calling me out for not
being original because like they've seen
that before I'm like I'm not trying to
impress you guys my wife is a Wi-Fi name
let's get let's get to Google all right
let her our viewers wanted it well let's
go ahead and pitch that question back
out to everybody what were the things
that you saw that you're most excited
about we kind of touched on them here
but will expand on for a few minutes on
let you submit your comments and
questions a couple submissions already
from buffa says the force touch is kind
of cool on Android and balm invention
says I'm excited about the new security
it's cool we can now delete apps they
don't like that is an amazing feature I
yeah the end of bloatware I know
thank you Google in a problem since day
one but yeah I was looking at my phone
today where I was trying to get on
facebook Messenger and then I have
message messages
yeah Messenger and I'm like why does
samsung phone right yes yeah that's why
yeah and it's also like Verizon use like
fifteen browsers as well no I only have
Chrome on it okay
cuz I think Sam's like what the SH
Samsung has its own browser I might have
hidden it okay but I don't know but I
mean it's a my like drawer or whatever
yeah yeah yeah here's a good question
from our old buddy Yahoo he says what is
a difference between having YouTube red
and the new Google picture in picture
mode that's a great point that does kind
of like shave a little incentive of
YouTube red but considering it's all
Google at the end of the day mmm yeah
that's to me the problem with you don't
get that premium content yeah and the
different delivery packages though it's
a addressing ad free experiences yeah
believe so they're there they teared now
I forget if you can do sure yeah by Joan
yeah YouTube red has its own that's
their whole like oh we've got like
exclusive yeah exactly they've got
premium content original YouTube
syriza's but the picture no pointing
that was huge running like background
running every youtuber and uh red
subscribers that was awesome that was
almost enough for me to get it but I
didn't almost I thought about getting
just so I could like just play music
from that and yeah my phone shut up but
it's like I'm already on Spotify don't I
don't really
that's the thing about yeah I go one or
the other really does suffice I don't
think you need both yeah
Matthew doctor says is Google still able
to visually solve Sudoku puzzles that's
an interesting question I've never tried
that I don't yeah I don't know are they
well he said still able to so this is
all that already a VHS is news to me is
that some of that they downloaded or is
this like one of those like Easter eggs
like the dinosaur game probably an
easter egg
yeah no no like something somebody
figured out along the lines there a
other visual AI is up to par for that
right right now like like lens that they
showed off but they didn't really from
what I understand there weren't any live
demonstrations no through the yeah at
the conference yeah you know it's still
early that's why I'm saying I would love
to see if I see actually were surprised
if they did that yeah alright keep
sending in your comments and questions
what you saw what you liked what you
didn't like let's uh let's get real for
a minute Alfred what was your your real
editorial personal take away from this
put a put put down your your CNET card
for a minute and just oh let me i've
already closed my laptop um no I think
it's really cool I always feel like
androids kind of like behind the ball on
a lot of these things and it's kind of
disappointing that a lot of older
devices like don't get them yeah um very
excited for the Google home stuff again
I still wish it were cheaper just
because I'm I'm very frugal about these
things I'd say give it like six months
yes this the dust settles from the new
features and then it'll roll back off
real quick I agree yeah I also imagine
during holiday season like surprise
we're gonna have this cheaper dental
home that rolls out right before
Christmas right before Black Friday
let's figure this whole thing the
competition between like the Google home
and the Amazon echo though like it
really feels like a tortoise and the
hare kind of scenario for me we're like
Amazon's like look at this we're doing
this we're do this we're like all the
scenario then Google just like just like
chilling back although I'm and then
according to band's reporting like it's
Amazon that feels the heat right now
because Google home is able to recognize
different people yeah mm-hmm echoes
cannot not yet yes yeah that kind of
freaked them out I think that's why they
that's why you saw them kind of ramp up
the number of problems and showed off it
we've got show we've got look we've got
all these things now we'll see if any of
them actually sell Google
a lot of cool stuff out of this I mean
the lens is like really cool to me um
the the one thing that I'm like I wonder
if they'll actually do this with the
lens because they've been talking about
how like they're billing their AI out a
lot and if you consider like with Google
photos all these photos are like
people's faces on it I wonder if they're
building kind of like a facial
recognition thing off of that or like
you can like use google lens like oh
that's Brian and like that isn't that
kind of what they're doing with Google
photos is the idea that you'll be able
to recognize not just objects not like
yeah but that's that's in your phone I'm
saying like in life they're just like
yeah like yeah you know it's funny I
just I was having a conversation with
someone building a pair of smart glasses
running on Android and that was like his
ultimate goal like a front-facing camera
like you'll be able to scan Brian's face
you may not know Brian like facts about
Brian would just pop up into the glasses
yeah yeah this is weird and it's like
not that far from reality
there was a startup that that that was
like what they were trying to build that
I spoke with before um where basically
it was able to scan faces but the only
way that I could scan your face is if
you were like if you use the app and yet
like enroll your face in it but this was
someone else like you couldn't I
wouldn't be able to just like join you
at a stranger but the thing is with like
Google photos if everyone is using that
yeah you know I already logged in yeah
like we were just talking about before
the podcast started the Google Photos to
me sort of the kind of sneaky way Google
getting you to stay on their ecosystem
Google Photos I mean one you've got a
sentimental attachment to these photos
it's hard to let go but Google photos is
increasingly using all these services
whether it's Gmail Google system now
Google blends if you ever want to like
quick google cold turkey and go to Apple
like it's pretty much impossible you're
talking with your photos they have
Google photos on like Apple though no
but the famous you're still using a
Google service yesterday okay you can't
give up on Google yeah yeah I mean you
can't give up on Google in general
though what are you gonna do big all
your search on a big stuff yeah man it's
possible um did you do did you see the
New York Times story that was basically
of the top 5 tech companies which one
would you cut like which yes you cut yes
like pretty much nobody cut alphabet Oh
like Facebook was actually the one I
the one I kept my topkapi I kept was
actually Amazon okay cuz its prime I
mean I'd say it's is tied with alphabet
videos Google was for me a close yeah
but you give up on Apple Microsoft was
the Twitter Facebook basically the first
one I cut my first guess like as like I
don't really need this snap sure I be
snapchat that's not a top five oh yeah
uh Don Wilson has a great comment says
google lens look just like the API
announced at Microsoft to build 2017
that's an interesting point
Oh which that's so weird it's like it
just happened a few weeks ago but right
kind of blur I don't really remember
that is it the the principle of great
minds think alike yeah I mean they're
all look they're all focusing on AR IVRS
or like the next growth engine and so
it's not surprised that everyone's
trying to use an image recognition
that's the key component AR I to getting
getting those stats and facts up into to
your line of sight but yeah I mean like
they're all like all these big companies
are investing in the same thing it
really is I guess it's really who
actually gets there first and I think
Google has an advantage because they're
there to put this on the phone
right Microsoft doesn't have that
physical platform to deliver a our
services right they've got hololens
which who knows when it'll actually come
to market for consumers sure so yeah
maybe windows should like make a phone
bump the breaks kid um yeah I don't know
one of the I think I forgot what I was
gonna say but it was uh definitely
related to your point about um like them
pushing for like AI and AR and all that
stuff
yeah Roger let's get your wholehearted
response and very personal take away
from IO in total just just yesterday's
so far I mean I thought was long it was
over mommy there was just a ton of stuff
that they dropped on us it was a word
vomit and you just I mean I do think the
lens stuff is incredible if they could
pull it off but for me there's you know
the skeptic in me that's like well is
this too good to be true
I'm very much with you on that one I
seems really neat on the surface I have
philosophical back-and-forth over it I
wanted to know the world around me but I
don't like the idea of it knowing me yes
that's right yeah go figure uh and I
thought I mean we don't few people have
talked about as much but I thought
Android go was kind of a nice way to get
you know pushed towards that next
billion users X billion phone users with
the with an operators of this little
strip down that's cheaper that it's
actually cognizant of the fact that data
is expensive some parts of the world and
that connectivity is an issue sometimes
like having a low conductivity stripped
down operating system that's that's
going to be key when you're going after
that that next billion users oh
absolutely
yep absolutely before we move on
Matthew dr. points out that Edie
reposted a scene article in 2011 about
Google Goggles solving Sudoku puzzle we
have to go look that back up that's
before my time and I apologize but we
will look into that that's really cool
I never yeah this thing I never never
used goggles that often I when I did
that it rarely works I tried to time
kind of start yeah I tried two times of
the name workout all day all right well
the most missteps are like
pre-programmed exercise yeah for goggle
maybe yeah that could have just been
like a like uh but thanks for that info
that was I mean what to look that up you
know history better than we did
to be fair scene that's huge and we
don't know everybody right everything
and that was actually I think slightly
before my time as well I guess yeah ed
Murray and I did not cross has passed
yeah all right we got a few more
comments coming in JC morgendorffer says
uh those future daydream phones have a
chance to get word sense or world sense
excuse me like for example the zenfone
or AR which both have daydream and tango
AR support uh I'm not familiar the world
sense what which one is world - I don't
know world sense myself
Alfred I'm gonna be looked at all right
we'll move on uh so so UK says does
Google have a plan for satellite
communications as he's currently working
on a project and space technology I know
they have a bunch of projects for
getting planes in the air to deliver
cell phone signals I'm not aware of any
projects using satellite radio from what
I understand satellite radio or
satellite phone service is or cell
service is extremely expensive yeah yeah
so I don't really know if Google is
actually working on that I remembered
what I was gonna ask before now yes go
for it um so Google assistant now on
iPhone
are you actually planning on putting out
on your iPhone or yes yeah but problem I
think the problem with Google systems on
your iPhone is it's not gonna be as
proactive as it is on an Android phone
right but yeah that still has to flow
through apple's api's and through their
their system so it's not gonna be as
proactive and it's not gonna it's not
gonna be as useful yet from what I'm
actively I think why assumes you'll have
to actively trigger yeah from what I've
seen that I feel like it's like a lot
better than Syria's I was going to say
is it the nail in the coffin for Siri I
don't I think as long as Apple keeps
making it like a pain in the ass that's
effective it that's it's like Siri you
can at least yeah
trigger it with your voice their way
there were easy ways to trigger Siri
there isn't yet an easy way to and I
don't know if they will somehow get
visit but there isn't an easy way to
trigger Google system on your iPhone
beyond like tapping the app cuz that's
the thing like I prefer Chrome on my
iPhone use but every default every app
their default browser comes with is
Safari so like I'll have chrome but like
everything that I open is like in Safari
anyway and yeah even have chrome I feel
like that's just what's gonna end up
happening of Google assistant on the
iPhone yeah going back to world edits by
the way world sense was the name of the
standalone VR headsets okay gotcha was
the question again he says um something
about those future daydream phones have
a chance to get world sense like for
example the zenfone AR which have both
daydream and tango air support oh the
idea is like motion tracking correct I
don't fix it I imagine these feckless
yeah this is a speculation but these
headsets have special cameras that are
kind of position tracking they track in
and out hence the inside-out erm we
tried some of these at CES actually
Qualcomm had like a sort of a reference
design or concept prototype and their
work pretty well but there's special
hardware that's required and out know if
if those phones kind of work tango might
actually tango enable phones might
actually work with this but it's almost
like I feel like it's two categories
like the phone VR headsets are kind of
like just sort of simple motion these
are not just motion but like
positionally you could actually move
forward and back
that's a bigger difference that's kind
of like what the vibe does so in related
news and this is just a question from
meek since I didn't get all the details
during this part of the presentation
yesterday tell me more about these
standalone VR goggles that they're going
to be putting out so like up until now
we've got the daydream which is part of
your phone you tap into it it's part of
the greater thing and it's a novelty for
lack of a better word at this point
we've got the HTC vive we've got
PlayStation VR the gaming consoles what
is Google gonna do Google going to do
with a standalone headset is is going to
be the next wave than the new 3d TV and
home entertainment no I feel like it's
sort of an incremental step up from
these headsets with phone plug-ins right
those headsets those are definitely more
of a novelty I think I feel like they're
kind of a gimmick
these purpose-built headsets for VR
these world sets had set I think a
little more useful and like if you're
buying one these things you're like
investing in a VR yeah for real I think
they're there for me there's always been
issues plugging your phone to a VR
headset whether it's sometimes it's
tracking it overheats there's there's
battery issues if these are
purpose-built headsets I'm assuming
they're they're free of a lot of those
problems right you don't worry about the
battery training already overheating
because it's designed for VR only as
opposed to a phone that happens to do VR
but taxes everything in the phone mm-hmm
so imagine it's a it's a slicker
experience is not it's not as high end
as vive Fisher just to be clear these
are probably running on like Qualcomm
Snapdragon processors they're not
they're not running out PC gaming level
type computers so the experiences is
going to be as slick but I think it's
going to be a step up from what we've
had and I think it's it's sort of
natural evolution to what we've seen
with VR with like basic VR Google
cardboard right in daydream I think
we're going to see designer model's
start coming out something flashy
something to decorate your home with oh
yeah and that's about we were gonna run
out of time designer headset Gucci VR
headset Gucci Google's site Prada man I
love my Prada headset now all right
Roger send us out what do we still have
coming up today from Google got a lot of
focus on VR and AR Google i/o still
continues day two so definitely tune
back in to see net we've got plenty more
Google i/o stuff for you
all right if you like day that you saw
or heard here
cassano CNET our podcast is also
available to tune in stitcher SoundCloud
feed burner and Google Play Music thanks
everybody
you have on down great weekend</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
