today we're going to check out the LG
envoy - from US Cellular now as you can
see this is a very very simple feature
device that's geared towards users who
aren't looking for a high-tech smart
phone outside you'll get a small
monochrome display about an inch across
that shows info like the time date and
battery status once you open it up
you'll see a 2.2 inch display that has a
176 by 220 pixel resolution the phone
has a very simple interface and you
could customize your menu page here to
show different applications and features
the keypad is generously spaced and
really flush with the surface you'll get
a lot of shortcut buttons including one
for the camera speaker phone and alarm
clock now due to the placement of the
voice command key however I oftentimes
find myself pressing that button when I
really want to press the end or quit key
so be mindful of that the handset has a
1.3 megapixel camera that doesn't have a
flash or record video it runs on a 9 15
milliampere hour battery and has a
reported talktime of five hours
currently the handset is going for about
70 dollars with a two-year contract but
oddly enough US Cellular is also
offering it prepaid for about 20 dollars
less - again I'm Lynne and this has been
the LG envoy - from US Cellular
