del Conte mean it's time to get loaded
there is no Facebook phone at least not
yet facebook's mobile announcement on
wednesday had to do with a single sign
in feature for mobile devices so this is
a lot like facebook connect where you
sign on to other sites with your
facebook account now you can sign into
mobile apps with your facebook account
but you do have to be signed into the
facebook app for this to work if you are
other mobile apps will be able to see
that and sign you in facebook also
enhanced Facebook Places allowing local
businesses to offer deals to people who
check into those places an obvious
affront to Foursquare this is a big week
for Microsoft with connect and Windows
Phone 7 coming out microsoft expects it
will also be a big year with five
million connect units being sold in 2010
that's lofty especially considering that
there are only two more months left in
2010 but of course they're the biggest
shopping months of the year so we'll see
if they can do it i actually think they
might AT&amp;amp;T announced 18t for health it's
a new division aimed at using technology
to automate health services for doctors
and hospitals the goal is to use a tts
basic networking and phone services to
streamline medical record-keeping and
communication myspace is not in a good
way the big boss Rupert Murdoch who owns
News Corp which owns MySpace called the
site's losses quote not acceptable or
sustainable he called myspace a problem
which management teams would have to
address ouch of course News Corp did
purchase myspace at the height of its
popularity for 580 million dollars and
it's been all Facebook ever since I'm
sure you know the story you saw the
movie facebook credits are now the
official payment method for the social
games made by game giant EA those are
the games that EA got from acquiring
play fish last year this means that if
you want to buy virtual things or
upgrades to your characters you have to
use facebook credits you can buy them
online or at Target incidentally
foursquare is giving local businesses
the right to revoke mayorship to anyone
they think has earned it erroneously
becoming a mayor of a location on
foursquare often gives people advantage
as in discounts which is why some people
are incented to fake it but no more you
can't keep your mayorship if you've been
unscrupulous and really gaming
Foursquare that's low those are your
headlines for today I'll see you
tomorrow I'm Natali del Conte for
cnet.com and you've just been loaded</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
