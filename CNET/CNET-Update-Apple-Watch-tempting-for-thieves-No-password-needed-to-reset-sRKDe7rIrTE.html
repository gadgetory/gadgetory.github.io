need to know the passcode to use it for
yourself I'm Bridget Carey this is your
cnet update should Apple have put in
more security protections on its Apple
watch apple support website shows how to
reset the watch without knowing the
password and that has people wondering
why Apple didn't give its watch the same
security protections as the iphone
here's what's going on when someone
steals your iPhone you can disable it
remotely so it's locked off from being
used again turning it into a useless
brick that is until you put in your
Apple ID and password and that's called
activation lock but there's no
activation lock on the Apple watch if
you don't know the password you can
still reset the watch to factory
settings like its brand new and sync it
to another person's iPhone of course if
someone takes your Rolex watch that
doesn't need a password either but why
not come out with an update to
discourage theft keep in mind if Apple
watch is stolen your banking data on
Apple pay isn't exposed and that can be
disabled let's move on to microsoft
windows product names can sometimes be a
bit confusing with multiple versions of
the operating system under different
names remember when Windows 8 came out
there was a version called Windows RT
for tablets along with Windows Phone 8
well Microsoft said things are changing
this time around with Windows 10 it'll
all be called Windows 10 no matter which
device you use one Microsoft is the
motto these days so in that spirit
Microsoft is dropping the name Windows
Phone the next operating system for
phones is called windows 10 mobile
you'll find it on smartphones and small
tablets other pcs and larger tablets get
Windows 10 home or Windows 10 pro both
are going to be free upgrades when they
come out so when will that be microsoft
says sometime in the summer microsoft
also has a new video app for making
hyperlapse videos that's also known as
those sped up time lapse videos you can
try it out now in a preview version for
Android and of course it's available in
the Windows app stores you may also be
familiar with hyperlapse from instagram
which added the
forward video editing to its iPhone app
last year but with microsoft's version
you can add this effect to any existing
video and in other news walmart is
taking on amazon by creating its own
version of amazon prime walmart is
offering unlimited delivery to customers
that pay fifty dollars a year that's
half the cost of amazon prime it's only
a small test now by invitation only and
walmart is not saying which markets will
be able to test the program later this
summer the Amazon Prime two day delivery
service launched ten years ago that's
your tech news update you can head over
to cnet com for more and be sure to
