building in San Francisco it's the Apple
byte extra crunchy podcast with your
host Brian Tong Thank You mr. Beecham
for that lovely warm intro welcome you
know how we do it once a week we give it
to you the Apple byte extra crunchy we
are here to talk about expand on a lot
of the stories that we've talked about
on the actual Apple bite video podcast
but then there's always new news
happening there were like two or three
more big stories that broke after we
recorded the Apple bite show so that's
where we also talked about it here at
the Apple byte extra crunchy this is the
place where you guys can also get
involved with us on the show
1-866-376-8255
lots of phones do it but there is a
difference there is Apple's wireless
charging yeah so what they're working on
here according to Bloomberg is that
they're working on developing a new
wireless charging technology that could
be deployed on its devices but also the
big thing here is range instead of it
just being directly on one of those
charging mats are those little pedestals
that you get they're talking about
having a range not just within inches
but feet away from a actual wire
charging kind of station that sends out
that signal just think about it think of
it as Wi-Fi but it's it's Wi-Fi charging
yeah that's right now they haven't
described how far this range will go
because as you move further away from
this charging base station wirelessly
this
yeah the transmitter it gets weaker it
might take longer to charge but Apple
and even as far back as 2010 they have a
patent application with this concept of
actually using an iMac as the hub for
wireless charging yeah so if it's just
sitting on your desk wherever your desk
office is that's your charging hub and
if you're wandering around your office
your phone's just constantly charging I
think that's cool yeah they're uh it's
right now that patent as described just
talked about recharging at a distance of
about one meter using a technique called
near-field magnetic or resonance so this
is similar to induction charging with
its watch but this is that's you know
within millimeters this is a further
arrange there was also another Apple
patent that really talked about making
aluminum phone casings that would allow
radio waves to pass through yeah so pass
through the casing to the battery so
these are all indicators of what Apple
is trying to do what they're working on
GameChanger it would come it would be
the mean as long as other companies
don't beat them to the punch that have
already created wireless charging right
yeah exactly and also depending on how
far this charging capability will allow
you to move like a video if you can go
through your whole apartment and your
phone's charging that's awesome that was
IQ like if I can like steal some charge
from my neighbors to have you go give it
to me so we we have we have that kind of
story that broke but then also earlier
in the week if we're still sticking to
the iPhone 7 a new story from KGI
Securities analyst Ming Chi Kuo who has
sometimes made up some things but
typically over the past few years has
actually been pretty pretty on it he
reports that the iPhone 7 will have
obviously the iPhone 7 and the 7 plus
but in addition to that it's likely to
have two different 7 plus models that
are into
right now one with the standard single
eyesight rear-facing camera and another
one boosting a dual camera design 3d
like double multi you know mult dual
lens camera system double lens dual lens
is the same thing I can't even talk but
where this where like kind of the
breadcrumbs here of how this might
happen
Apple acquired a company an Israeli
camera tech company called Lynx imaging
last year and they have multiple
basically camera sensors into one
specific piece it also the way that
their tech is built allows you to have a
flat camera so it's not protruding
anymore you won't have that little
wobble I call it the the eyesight nipple
right it's just there on your camera
which and then also just the actual
visual benefit you get from here the
results are it has better low lighting
capability it has higher resolution they
like to talk about it
I know it's people get like there's no
way it's SLR quality right I know my
cameras my canons my Nikon's they're
knowing that they're throwing that
around they like to throw yeah they like
to say hey it's SLR quo yeah we'll we'll
see the thing about this is the reason
why I like this story is if there's any
differentiator that Apple has typically
built kind of a reputation on its having
arguably the best camera for a mobile
phone definitely that's like their focus
now they just wipe their phones to have
the best camera this phone this this
camera also is expected to have two to
three times optical zoom which is pretty
cool yep and then also it just helps
with depth perception of your images you
know like it has depth mapping or
something yeah so that could actually
can even like focus on different parts
yeah you know it can sense like your
nose versus one camera what was it
called the like Lytro camera a little
bit right yeah we got a light row it's
kind of cool very cool stuff so that's
what's shakin and bakin in the iPhone 7
world but if we're gonna talk about
upcoming products what about what Apple
is expected to be you know announcing in
March mid March according to
ninety-five Mac is the proposed or
targeted date of March 14th where Apple
will purportedly release and announce an
updated iPad air three an iPhone 5se
formerly known and rumored as the iPhone
6c
all right so that's the lower everyone
was like yeah right kind of the more
budget-friendly phone yeah they're
actually according to the report calling
it the iPhone 5se and then additional
Apple watch bands at this mid-march with
a potential of iOS the iOS latest update
which right now is in beta public beta
even for a lot of people nine point
three which adds some cool stuff we
talked about last week that would be
part of this bundle of announcements no
rumblings if we'll see a laptop but this
is like the iPhone 5se
now in our shows we like to kind of have
fun with this right like we called it
like the special edition yeah Yeah right
the sucker edition I called it the
iPhone single essay so we want to know
we want you guys to call in or tweet us
but we wanted to call in just quickly
tell us where you're from and tell us
what you think the iPhone se stands for
you make a little montage right so it's
1-866 268 we want you guys and gals to
be a part of the show that tell us what
you think the iPhone se stands for I'm
sure we'll get some crazy responses I
think it's worth it to mention too that
se is lowercase right yeah five
lowercase s lowercase e which is
something I haven't seen from out I did
I I don't this is all this is all crap
this is all made up I have no idea of
rumors about the actual phone say now
that there's been a models that are in
testing one with an a8 m8 chip the other
with an a nine m9 chip and the thinking
is that because once the new actual
iPhone 7 comes out which would most
likely have an a-10 processor they don't
want that iPhone se - hey there's my
phone it just called my phone just made
a call
they don't want that iPhone se to be
slower and behind oh yeah right two
generations behind happy 2014 phone
you're buying in 2017 or 2016 yeah and
the iPhone se will have like Apple pay
and all those good things so um you know
we'll wait and see what happens there
and then in addition that when we talk
about the iPad air 3 there was this
released kind of sketch of what there
are no confirmations that this is what
it is but I could see this where the
iPhone sorry the iPad air 3 potentially
would have four speakers just like the
iPad pro which would be good yeah that
would be good because when you turn the
iPad pro right now we're depending on
its orientation it actually adjusts the
audio so that you can hear it the best
probably really that's pretty cool yeah
that's probably one things I love about
the iPad pro not that overall the sound
just sounds better on the iPad pro yeah
um so yeah iPad air 3 also the sketch
show to flash on the camera hmm do we
want that I think so I dunno you want to
flash you want people to be more
encouraged to use their iPads as cameras
yeah that will be annoying when they're
flashing them I don't add like sporting
events I don't want to see this this
this that's a that's a bad apple man
that's that's horrible people are like
what's your phone number to call in okay
what okay here just leave it up there we
don't have an actual live call this is
just to leave a message for what the
iPhone 5se stands for 1-866 2 6 3 8 all
right moving along we talked about
everyone wants to know when are we gonna
see updated MacBooks that's probably one
of the more anticipated products of next
year intel just recently released their
price list for the latest skylake chips
that could be used in the actual I sorry
Mac my brain is like all over the place
so many products like we're talking
about I know it's hard to keep track of
it all please anyways they release the
specs and the pricing for the future
15-inch MacBook Pros potential suitors
for the skylake chipset if anyone here
people ask me all the time when should I
buy this what's up
Dixon he just jumped in if it people are
listening and want don't buy a laptop
now wait for a skylake processor you
could wait three months you could wait
six months just hold out unless your
computer like exploded and you need it
just just relax a little okay that's all
I'm saying
but uh that's good news because I don't
think we'll see them at the March event
I could be wrong most likely we'll see
MacBooks at the June WWDC event they've
done in the past and so uh my hunch
would say that that's where we're going
cool all right
Apple earnings also were announced this
past week some of you care some of you
don't I think that it's important
because you're gonna really see where is
the momentum and where is Apple going
here yeah so just to let you know Apple
off the top right they had quarter a
record another record quarter seventy
five point nine billion dollars in
revenue eighteen point four billion
dollars of profit okay that's a lot now
that is their best record reported
quarter all time in which cute which
quarter was that without technically as
so they call it fiscal quarter one haha
but calendar quarter would be it's the
last quarter of 2015 so October November
December is fiscal quarter one but for
us regular people it's just the last
quarter of 2015
gotcha so you could pop those bottles
people on periscope were like throwing
up like cash money you know Jesus right
now but here's the thing
they sold seventy four point eight
million iPhones slightly shoots it is a
huge number slightly up from seventy
four point five the year before then we
start talking about Mac sold five point
three million compared to five point
five million that's a dip then when you
talk about iPads okay just get ready
16.1 million sold this recent quarter
versus twenty one point four million a
year ago that's a huge drop yeah and
then tribute sent that to not releasing
a new iPad air since 2014 but he but
here's the thing they released a new
iPad pro they did yeah but thanks
and remember I was like dude they're not
the iPad pro is not going to be able to
kick up make up for that yeah I think
even last the last quarterly report
iPads or something like down ten percent
I was like there's no way even the iPad
pro can make up that gap because it's so
niche like I love the iPad pro for what
it is but all the ways that Apple
advertised it that smart Keyboard is
like it's like doodoo I returned it I
got a regular cover case I just travel
and I've watched movies and I read
comics I don't even really use the
multitasking that much yeah it's just a
bigger screen iPad for me and I I've
only used the pencil a few times my
niece's mm-hmm
maybe maybe maybe everyone else is using
it exactly the way Apple watch YouTube
it's just a when did it when did they
release it like late late cue feel like
and I feel like I got it in like
November like like early November I feel
like I can't remember I loved for the
record me personally I love the iPad pro
but I don't think it's for everyone at
all yeah like it's just not so you know
just to kind of look at these numbers
look Apple's iPhone sales compared to
one year ago is basically flat right
seventy four point eight to seventy four
point five million that's flat Mac's are
down iPads are down they reported record
sales for the Apple watch and the new
Apple TV yes and that they tributed that
to the holiday season of course but they
didn't reveal the numbers either they
didn't see the numbers so you know we
predict we did our predictions show was
it was it yeah yeah December so when we
did our predictions show we were we
basically agreed that it was gonna be
either a flat or down here for Apple
this year and all indications show that
Apple even told people that they expect
to sell fewer iPhones there next quarter
than any quarter so it's the momentum
guys and gals is kind of like slowing
down it's and I'm just like I don't I
don't see anything shocked in the world
I don't see anything like just all of a
sudden kicking that up I don't yeah it's
this is kind of like a transitional time
for Apple right now it is we'll see what
they can do that wall yeah it is no but
when we talk
like the whole Apple TV what can
potentially you know jumpstart this help
them with this well the reports are out
now according to the street that Apple
could pull a Netflix and start creating
original TV shows along that's what they
need to do they do this for a long time
right like content is King Apple isn't
locking down this TV service anytime
soon there were reports a while ago that
they had approached Bill Simmons the
sports broadcaster there were reports
that they had approached the Top Gear
crew the original Top Gear crew right
yeah and both groups turned them down
which is actually probably really smart
and so look at all that amazing original
content that's on Netflix even on Amazon
not as much on Amazon but dude Netflix
is worth every penny I know yeah I mean
everybody everybody's doing even Amazon
has some cool stuff out right now but uh
yeah I mean we talked about this last
week at Apple's very late to the game on
this and they need to jump in quickly if
they're gonna be competitive with the
Apple TV you know like what okay what
what series have you watched on Netflix
that are Netflix exclusive well I have I
haven't watched mini series on Netflix
Chelsea Handler's show I hear is very
good really long because it's like
documentary style like doing weird stuff
yeah I was like yeah I mean I I can't
really point that you see Masters have
none no I have a good show unbreakable
kimmy schmitt dope show house of cards
obviously house of cards you have seen
daredevil Jessica Jones I mean jessica
jones is a huge hit it's like huge
Netflix is killing it and so I don't
know I I'm just getting the point where
like all these things that are hot Apple
like talks about it like two years later
and it's been that way that's been that
way in the past but there all I'm saying
is that in the past you not least the
Apple say okay here this is this is our
idea this is our vision like there's no
vision it's all stuff that people have
done already it's all catch-up
yeah like would you like the next few
stories we're gonna talk about to is the
same thing we're talking about now
exactly you know it's like they're still
trying to catch up we're gonna talk
about VR chapel working on VR stuff like
they have a team they are like maybe you
know there's a lot of things like oculus
just came out there's things happening
maybe we should assemble a team to start
looking into this VR thing there's this
VR thing happening maybe we should do it
so at Apple's quarterly earnings people
always ask Tim Cook questions to to give
him an idea of like Oh what what's
happening and so he was asked directly
what are your thoughts on virtual
reality and Tim Cook said it's really
cool it has interesting applications no
she's always sad - I mean that's like no
 surfacey no Sherlock it's really
cool guys so a report from the Financial
Times and we've seen patents for Apple
working on like 3d virtual interview
like UI interfaces of their own goggles
but a report from the Financial Times
says Apple has expanded its research
efforts they have a team of hundreds of
employees that are part of a secret
research unit no longer a secret again
exploring AR and VR okay see this is
what's had to be the word exploring why
dude exploring AR and just say building
I went to CES this year and it was the
first year where I finally got to
interact and have real VR experiences
yeah whatever I did VR porn but that was
it might have been I may have been the
best but it was like we did it um you
know the interactive experience is some
of the amazing stuff that oculus is
doing with gaming I'm not gonna buy a
specific desktop PC to get a knock
oculus setup yet Samsung's gear VR is
the most accessible because it's only 99
bucks you pop it on if they have some
really cool experiences as well but for
gaming wise right oculus is just
crushing it HTC vive is interesting to
me but you know the innovators are
already out there
Apple's exploring right now they're like
we mean you were at a warrior's game in
VR yesterday yeah yeah and it was
awesome I was like courtside under the
under though you're under the hoop that
was the best angle by the way he's right
under the hoop but you you're at the
game it's amazing these experiences are
you know people that have criticized
right oh you're not gonna wear goggles I
don't know what's the longest period of
time I'll wear VR
goggles yeah you know because most of
time when we do these little demos and
stuff it's like uh maybe fifty five
minutes to like 15 20 minutes tops you
feel that's pretty good I don't know if
I would wear a VR headset for literally
one hour or two hours that might be a
little too long so just the short time
we were doing the Warriors thing that
those goggles were heavy and
uncomfortable yeah and I was like they
need to fix this because that's why
you're not gonna hang out in this you
gotta sit two hours do that VR that VR
heads there you're like yeah but every
demo I've seen is like guys running
around with a virtual gun and you know
jumping over stuff so so just to let you
know guys Apple is working on is
exploring in VR right now innovation mob
so that's happening uh I've just you
know it's like hey we're doing an Apple
car cool yeah oh you know what though
I've seen rumblings man my prediction
might be coming true what's your what
was that rumbling uh uh just uh Brian
Cooley if you got guys go watch the road
show autocomplete podcast that we just
started producing and talk about him and
Tim Stevens talked about it and how
Apple is you know thinking about Silicon
Valley could be the next Detroit you
know building cars and stuff so that's
kind of happening right now in in you
know I think we talked about it last
week Apple getting the car
URLs or whatever they were locking down
stuff like that so I mean it seems like
my prediction might come true you might
see a Fender or even just like I'll just
a piece just yeah just like I was at a
hubcap no I got oh dang I if I had a
pair of head Beats headphones I just
show you like that's a totally just like
just like the ear piece but uh we didn't
even put this in the rundown but in a
related story of the whole car thing
there were reports recently from Apple
Insider that Apple has put a hiring
freeze on all hires related to the Apple
car project because two things happen
the head of the Apple car or project
Titan as it's known internally Steve
Sadowski who has helped who helped with
like the iPod launch and I think also
camera versus the iPhone one but you
know multiple products
he just has decided to leave the company
for personal reasons they had it didn't
get into details for that but he was
basically the head of that project then
they did an internal review and
according to the report Johnny I've was
unhappy with the progress of the actual
Apple car project and the direction so
whether that means the look the feel how
far they've gone like you know Apple has
never built a car apple has met with car
companies but apples not partnering with
car companies to build a car right they
want to do it themselves it's gonna take
a lot longer than they think it's not
easy it's like starting from yeah it's
starting from scratch for them right
this is not a phone it could be like you
know more than five years in the making
just to build this I mean when we are at
the Detroit Auto Show we are
interviewing car makers talking about
this and they're saying yeah from start
to finish when you when you design and
build a new car it takes five years of
like guys sculpting clay into the shape
of a car every little detail inside the
car where it where's the car dog and
handles gonna go you know it's like
there's so much involved and then plus
Apple wants it to be all connected to
the iPhone so and this is another church
their first attempt right yes first
attempt so you know it would be cool it
would be cool one day if Apple just
jumped ahead of a trend and made
something really special and we just I
don't see us I don't see that happening
in the next three years minimum
right yeah Apple watch that was a
reaction to the Pebble watch keep it
real right VR reaction of VR car
reaction the Tesla like it's all very
reactionary and you can argue that the
iPhone was a reaction to palm and
although I I pad Pro reaction to the
surface and then you know the surface
book and the actual surface just
Microsoft was the most innovative
company of 2015 for me so well we'll
talk more let's uh people that someone's
like wait the Apple guy is hating on
Apple I'm just keeping a real it happens
don't I'm not trying to hurt your
feelings I'm just telling you how it is
okay mr. periscope or mrs. periscope on
there all right uh do you want to go
jump in yeah see what we got with the
phone calls yeah we got some phone calls
our first one is from Archie in Boca
Raton Florida and while while we're
doing these calls if you guys want to
post some questions we will try and
answer your calls as well okay
oh cool
here we go hello Brian in the beach my
name is Artyom Kahn kombucha Raton
Florida and today I'm calling with a
question about the Apple TV unlike when
Apple went from the first generation to
the second generation Apple TV it looks
like they're still selling the previous
generation and what I'm wondering is do
you think they will be doing any
software updates to the third generation
Apple TV since it does not run the new
TV OS main reason why I asked it says on
the website that the new Apple TV
supports Apple music but the third
generation supports iTunes music and
iTunes radio and it seems to me that if
they're getting rid of the free iTunes
radio that feature matter you can
disappear from third generation anyway
thank you very much all right thanks for
the call we appreciate that in response
to is Apple going to update the software
of the third generation Apple TV it's to
me it's a definitive no from a
standpoint of the processor is a lot
slower than the current one in the new
Apple TV when you talk about Apple's
radio service that'll just basically be
either an icon that doesn't work anymore
on the Apple TV 3 mmm third generation
because now we talked about last week as
of this Friday you have to have an Apple
music subscription to be able to listen
to Apple radio now okay which is a
bummer
yeah which I've destroyed which I've
ranted on all about but I think that
moving forward because of just look how
historically Apple treats phones look at
how Apple treats products in general
that Apple TV 3 is going away we have
the new Apple TV it's here its processor
already does things that allow more
vision you know the visual nature of it
the Siri voice blah blah blah they're
not going to do anything to improve that
third generation Apple TV they they
would surprise me if they did so there
you go all right
ok let's go the next call they didn't
leave their name so I'm just gonna play
it here we go hello hello I wanted to
know what you guys
the current state of the you touch and
how or what use what you want to see the
next generation of DD touch and Apple
products I also wanted to know what you
want to incorporate in the next
generation after you touch in apps or
games or just general news at anything
thank you so this question is what do we
foresee with 3d touch and what could
they do now I do feel that 3d touch was
the best innovation for Apple last year
now it hasn't made a lot of noise yet
but I use it all the time it makes using
my phone better it still needs to get
better and developers have to get their
hands on it really kind of integrate
more of these features in there it
allows our phones to be more complex
well you know being a more simple
interface but 3d touch someone will say
uh was it was it while we had a phone
that they said Oh was gonna have 3d
touch before the iPhone it's not a phone
that's out everywhere Apple had their
little 3d touch setup on the Apple watch
too
I started the Apple watch but um I just
think that right now people are still
getting used to using the behavior and
as we do that this year we'll see a lot
more functionality out of it and from
the operating standpoint operating
system standpoint you know I like that
they've added new shortcuts with iOS 9.3
more than anything it's it's gaming that
we'll see that maybe even with video
editing apps we could see that but how
many people gonna really edit video on
their phone and yeah like like really
edit video like professionally edit yeah
it's not gonna happen but um
I think it's pretty cool I mean I'd like
to see it if I can like do it when my
screen is locked I know that sounds
crazy but I might be kind of cool to
like deal this weekend and see what's
going on like just touch your screen
maybe see like some widgets or
information yeah but but to me is I was
a big huge fan of 3d touch right from
the start I still AM but it hasn't it's
one of those things that hasn't caught
on just yet so yeah I've had I've had my
phone a couple weeks in
and admittedly I haven't used it a whole
lot but also it's just because I don't
know exactly all the things that it can
do yeah so you know I'm gonna play with
it some more what happens is you're
gonna end up finding which apps have
three times that you like so for example
I use Shazam I stop and open the app
ashes and then hit the listen to icon
well now I can 3d touch to Zam and just
say listen I'm gonna try that right now
you got Shazam I got of course so like
if you 3d touches am forced it whatever
push touch it so I use that all the time
because let's say my just force but
that's awesome right see so that's cool
boom um with the new beta right on your
settings they add like Wi-Fi and
Bluetooth I hate always going into Wi-Fi
and then having a tweak with it I just
want to jump to it directly so yeah that
I will totally use that when you're
using like bluetooth headphones or
something like that I don't leave my
bluetooth on all the time yeah I do them
I turn it off so it's a battery and
sometimes I want other Bluetooth devices
to work and it'll get in the way yeah
it's it's it's not like that okay
I'm gonna try and rewind in the chat on
YouTube to try and see if there's any
other questions I mean there were but
it's like so hard to keep up okay do you
think Apple this comes from echo mg 13 I
don't even know what this question is
but I'm just gonna read it do you think
Apple will ever promote the iPhones to
have beat speakers like HTC used to if
you're trying to say are they gonna
promote like beats technology or the
fact that there's headphones have them
um I don't I don't think so
it's it's weird Apple like beats
built-in on the iPhone I just I don't
know I don't see them do that because
they like to keep that brand really pure
even if they put beats technology in it
that whole beats technology was just
like you know it's kind of gimmicky they
they bought it for the colors really I
felt like it was like did a did a phone
really okay it had beats technology so
you could optimize you know based on
sound settings how it sounded but you
could kind of do that with every phone
you do that were there any like Wi-Fi
with anything you could tweak with it so
you want to read this question real
quick yeah go for it scroll back up
was a good one does you mofos Fink debt
to iPhone 7 won't have the headphones
jack question mark it will not yeah
everything is pointing to it will not I
right now as of whatever January 29 I
don't I don't think it's gonna have it
okay I have another client what do you
think who's it from beacon yeah let me
see bail bail bells you house bells you
house okay wait wait yeah now it's
moving sorry my thing what do you think
will be the oldest device on iOS 10
that's a hard one wait wait wait
that's from JJ Brander oldest device
yeah Eli do you think we'll be the
oldest device on iOS to support it yeah
it'll just be the it won't be an old
device it'll be what typically what
let's say two generations back like
maybe the iPhone 5 I don't know maybe if
we're going I phone seven iOS 10 I don't
even III don't I don't even know if
we'll see well I guess we'll see iOS
then fine call it the iPhone iPhone 5s
cuz they'll have that one at least has a
faster process let's just say iPhone 5s
okay just for the heck of it who knows
no I know it's good stuff okay guys and
gals see it's hard periscopers it's hard
because when you ask a question it
pretty much like goes away right away
yeah so if you if you can get your
question right now I'm gonna try I'm
gonna really try and read one more
question and then we'll get out of there
for all of our loyal listeners that are
like you know what maybe you just stick
to the phone calls because I don't want
to wait for questions yeah we're trying
things Sunday Dixon just did a little
hand clap okay battery life for the
iPhone 7 it's probably going to be
exactly the same because they made it
super skinny if they got rid of the
headphone jack it didn't increase
battery life their iOS is optimized to
give you the latest one to give you
about an hour of battery life more which
pretty much makes up for the fact that
they made the phone skinnier so it's
probably going to be pretty much the
same
ya know ya know indicate
that there no major improvement yeah it
would be like a software-based thing
like some sort of you know software
thing to make everything go faster
final question someone asked gem please
jkm please can I cancel itunes Matt
music and have Apple radio the answer is
no so as of today you guys have to pay
for Apple music in order to listen to
iTunes radio the only free radio station
you're gonna get moving forward is beats
one B's one beats one so sign here with
these longer string costs again it's
like $9.99 a month yeah $14.99 for like
5 or 6 users I think so
there you go some people love Apple
music so to them it's not a big deal but
for people that don't subscribe I use
the iTunes radio all the time yeah me
too I really use it all the time so I'm
kind of bummed by that but I need Apple
thanks guys alright thank you everybody
here for listening and hanging out with
us for I don't even remember what I said
episode 24 I went so 24 so again guys
