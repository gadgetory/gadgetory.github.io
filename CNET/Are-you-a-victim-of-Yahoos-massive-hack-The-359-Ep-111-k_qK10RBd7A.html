we're gonna end the week with it with
another busy show we're gonna try to
pack in for headlines today yep we've
been talking about reports that Yahoo it
will confirm that again it got hacked
losing 200 million users these are
accounts user got out getting them then
actually lose the users themselves well
that don't happen eventually right we'll
also be talking about a Donald Trump all
of a sudden supporting Ted Cruz in
opposing the US handover of control or
oversight of the Internet you're gonna
have to help you with this one yeah well
it's a little wonky but I'll walk you
through it we'll talk a bit about that
Priscilla Chan Mark Zuckerberg new
initiative to cure all diseases he
pretty ambitious and then lastly a
verizon dashing the hopes of anyone
hoping for an element of data plan very
sad again me just I'm still sad about
yeah they're just driving a dagger
deeper into your heart so let's make it
half so let's as always if you have any
questions about Amy's topics leave them
in the comments section or producer
Brian will pick out the best then boom
will try to adorn our best handsome all
right let's get started all right time
to record the podcast be back in three
minutes and 59 seconds from 32 welcome
to the 359 we talked about the top tech
news of the day we have the crap we want
to throw it I'm Roger Cheng I'm Ben Fox
ribbon do you still use yahoo well
chances are you might have been hit by a
massive hack that NAB 200 million
usernames and passwords yahoo hasn't
confirmed the hack yet but it has been
conducting investigations it's August
what do you think that did that they are
gonna day is expected today that they
will actually confirm this but now we
have gone official work yet yeah my
question to most people are are you
worried because
you have an old yahoo account i do you
yahoo account i have two old yahoo
accounts i don't think that there's a
lot of information in there as far as
like my personal information compared to
my like facebook account right nobody
wants their stuff stolen you end up
using the same password sometimes that's
prob yeah my I'm actually conservatives
I do have a yahoo mail account that I
can't use a cup a burner e milk it's
like where I signed up for all my junk
mail so Yahoo yeah that's how bad do you
think this is for the new parent company
though is this gonna happen after the
verizons about to acquire them I think
that they're gonna have some serious
implications I mean security the
reputation for security is a big deal
for verizon and having yahoo tour drop
the ball like that yeah not not that
great yeah next up Donald Trump and Ted
Cruz are all of a sudden Sympatico a
Trump joins cruz in opposing the u.s.
seating oversight of the internet to a
non-profit third-party organization
called icon icon I see a NN you know
this has been a big article it's a big
political battle has been for a while
Cruz has been leading the charge against
this transition which has been proposed
since 2014 help me out here yep why why
is this transition going on and why is
it political I mean like this to me
seems like a bunch of backend stuff why
don't ruse and Trump involved so the US
has traditionally had control over our
heads oversight over how these domain
naming systems work in the dns basically
runs these IP addresses which translates
the URL the addresses that we use
between when we go on the internet and
so there has been sort of a transition
in place to kind of move it from the
u.s. to a third-party organization
that's more neutral so it's not one
country controlling crews are now Trump
believe that you know us lose a seating
oversight means us losing control
potentially countries like Russia taking
over the ad and we lose our American
exceptionalism exactly main naming
that's important Steve shanklin a great
faq looking at this company bunking that
theory and actually the idea of moving
it to this neutral third party
organization would be more beneficial
most tech company support this because
it definitely Spurs innovation and it
isn't beholden to anyone countries
agenda
thing all right what do we got next next
up well the big headline yesterday
Priscilla Chan and Mark Zuckerberg
launching their their initiative to the
three billion dollars to cure all
diseases this is like the moon shot of
moon shots right sure hey what do you
think I like the idea that all the time
that I've wasted on Facebook has
actually resulted in some good in the
world so I for one celebrate this
initiative and good for them yeah good
slowly go with it hopefully this is this
actually pays off Bill Gates was there a
lot of it was a who's who's of Silicon
Valley yesterday lastly a verizon has
once again confirmed that there will be
no unlimited data plan coming they've
kept a pretty consistent tone about this
but it comes after t-mobile's per ATT
have all sort of touted a limited data
as new offering and so I know as your
verizon customer you frustrated yeah I
mean Verizon's been known for being
pretty parsimonious with their data so
yeah this is just a continuation of that
and as a verizon customer yeah that
makes me a little annoyed that they're
just never going to open that door yeah
the CFO spoke at a goldman sachs
conference today said people don't need
unlimited data plans and we like the
idea of them just give them to us
they're easy matter what there you go
all right liked any of these stories
check us out on see that I'm Roger Cheng
I'm Ben Fox Rubin thanks listening turn
my microphone on to joining the show ah
we are cut on the audio podcast
recording and I want to start filtering
through the chat yeah and I'm
anticipating I'm kind of with you been
on the sentiment of the Facebook thing
is like I hope something good comes with
this and hey just candy crush saga yeah
definitely I mean is three billion
already and that initiative is expected
to do to put more than like 40 billion
dollars off their wealth yeah to a
variety of initiatives the like help the
world so hey I guess good for them I
mean there is a problem with it in that
it's set up as an LLC instead of a
non-profit which is the more control
yeah but like a lot of people have like
raised complaints about that that like
is this just like a big scam to try to
avoid taxes so I don't I don't think I
hope it's not me I'm not that cynical
yeah I believe that
that's like the move but I think it's
still why not set it up as a non-profit
I don't know and uh but I Priscilla Chan
Mark's wife is a pediatrician so there's
definitely a skin in game she she knows
it from a technical level hmm sort of
what can be achieved so that's that's a
good sign right yeah yeah it's not just
uh just not just some rich person just
throwing money at a cause I'm not sure
she definitely has and know how to come
help execute on this mm-hmm Louis in the
chat is a he wants to talk about the the
yahoo hack he says I was one of the
victims they somehow got into my
Instagram as well had to delete both
yahoo and instantly yeah now was it
because you are curious is it because
you shared passwords or you use common
passwords usernames really or you have
not that i would ever do this but you
would have like an email draft folder
with all of your passwords on it maybe
maybe some i really hope you don't have
that a friend of mine might have wow
there's a there's a large sentiment in
the chat as well from Cyrus to Jeremy
and beyond that it's kind of our own
fault for this is like why are you still
using yahoo back yeah OHL accountable
there are a lot of yahoo accounts yahoo
had actually correct me from wrong here
but gmail had overtaken yahoo mail only
in recent years yeah some people people
are creatures of habit and we still have
our yahoo accounts and unfortunately we
also like when we stopped using certain
accounts we don't shut them down the way
yeah shut yeah i still have a hotmail
account dude i don't like it i still get
emails for a while i just linked into it
it's linked to my linkedin account my
older brother has a rocket mail account
that i said oh yeah I think that was
gobbled up by like Microsoft or yahoo a
long long time ago but it still says at
rocket mail is so Randall says cnet how
do you suggest we protect ourselves from
hacks like in yahoo well if you look if
you're already exposed I mean obviously
the first thing is to change all of your
username and passwords or your password
too lazy the biggest thing you can do
activate
two-factor authentication right that's
the sort of the biggest week the best
way to protect yourself and that's you
know having a whatever email provider
sends you a random code to your cell
phone that you have to entering the
second password that you have to enter
that's really the best way to protect
yourself I mean there's these hacks are
gonna happen like we could blame yahoo
for it but you know frankly it's it's
just it's a matter of time before these
services all kind of get hit it's become
pretty typical right it's a pretty
common thing so having two factor
authentication means that even if they
have your username password if they
don't have your cell phone then they
can't get into your account right it's
just another hoop to jump through my
gmail account was hacked a couple years
ago and I switched to two-step
authentication yeah I can vouch for the
fact that I haven't been hacked since so
know that I know of but this in this
case my gmail was hacked and they
spammed all my friends okay they were
like I need money send it to this
address so you know yep mm-hmm Jeremy
says we need one big button on all of
our services to just shut it down that
would be great it's a kill switch does a
kill switch for anything of the internet
would be awesome mm too much power I
mean for your own accounts not what
everyone what if you're like drunken
friend got a hold of your kill switch
two-factor authentication yeah there you
go there you go yeah Saul's everything
my friend so can we go back to the I can
yeah I'm still like really kind of
curious as far as like so the so US
government was in control of all like
the domain naming that's uh it was the
the US National Telecommunications and
Information Administration NTIA I think
had a contract but to basically be
responsible for doling out IP addresses
and usernames within the us out over
later national world okay and so the
idea was that it would see that that
responsibility to a third party or third
party it's the Internet Corporation for
Assigned Names and numbers that sounds
very thing they love their academia the
government won't and the internet I
guess but yeah so they've had this
control for a while and Cruz and Trump
believe that
and you know this this is gonna affect
freedom of speech on the Internet I i
can has said like you know being
responsible for donating names and IP
addresses doesn't affect the content of
the internet so that is how about I
think there's like this critical
misunderstanding of what's going on
right but also shows like just general
skepticism of you know certain
international bodies i mean yeah it's
been typical of some politicians well
whether it's like the Paris Accord or
right now like The Hague different
things I said the ironic thing is what
what Trump and Cruz are supporting their
they actually support a more united
nations run or over the United Nations
group that would oversee the
administration of these IP addresses
think of it is is that would subject
that organization would be subjected to
the influence of countries like Russia
and China the same countries that
they're afraid are going to take over
the internet if we see control you know
their party the UN is so good at getting
anything done so I'd love to see the
inner wall I mean we've had just our
recent visits to the UN I've show just
the amount of like red tape I could suit
just to get into the UN not like to
access anything like literally just to
visit the UN the amount of red tape that
we hit to the amount of acronyms that we
had to decipher just an to get our
passes the internet needs something like
that I would say if you want to open a
new twitter account you should do stuff
just like that Jeremy definitely changed
your password changer yahoo password yep
set up two step authentication actually
Kevin and the chat has been very very
helpful he's even suggesting using a
password manager like LastPass I yeah
myself although black selfless act that
is true nothing is sacred right but
today nothing is completely one under
percent safe yep um but the more so
you're gonna make yourself more secure
you can and just pile it on make the
password situation complicated for
yourself it'll make a server everybody
and also make sure your password doesn't
include any public information right
like birthdays or wife's name or you
know just make sure the password is not
simple it's not one two three four five
or Superman which I think are still like
top 10 passwords I don't yeah our
password or password is to know i think
that the top one is the top one is
123456 work yeah not giving a lie
passwords away sorry one two three four
five there's a six in there somewhere to
outlook versus gmail what do you think's
more secure that's a good question i
haven't been using i haven't used
outlook for sign up in a gmail user for
a long long time and i haven't had but
and google is typically known for being
pretty good with their technology but
like i said before my gmail was hacked
and i don't really know how so it's it's
not like I bazar de tous me oh ok
password interesting yeah so um but yeah
that one was also a particularly
annoying one because I had a bunch of
friends ping me and say like hey are you
in trouble are you in trouble do you
need money and I'm like no I rest
assured I would have I would have paid
you don't worry hmm what about you like
trouble think what I guess he's in
trouble ok so I I don't actually have an
answer to that yes there's weather which
one is better than the other that's the
thing it's matter of like I feel like
it's a matter of time before everyone
gets hit it so it's dark yeah
unfortunately it's kind of terrible yeah
I mean I've had a couple of instances
where I've had my identity stolen hmm um
yeah so usually any time now I get maybe
a little too thorough maybe a little
extra paranoid but if something I use
gets hacked and it's somehow associated
accounts tied through whatever
authentication I'll just trickle down
that that river and just start changing
everything that could possibly be web
together we have Gunnar so art any
especially anything with e-commerce of
course yeah it's a pay the buck but it's
smart but yeah I'm pretty sure I know
for sure I've been like involved in a
couple hacks Home Depot you t-mobile no
no in terms of like my accounts I'm sure
my accounts have been compromised at
some point cuz there's at least three or
four big retailers or wireless carriers
that been hacked that I know I was I did
business what so yeah target target was
probably had one for me yeah let's talk
about password managers kevin is
suggesting
secure he's all thinking about keep pass
got another potential option we
mentioned last past that's one password
yep what other good options are there
out there those are pretty solid those
are the ones i reckon LastPass is the
one I usually recommend aside from the
fact that I gotta act itself yeah yeah I
can't think of any other can't talk
ahead these are more good ones those and
those are typically the ones that get
names you know for that kind of thing so
yeah that's that's definitely a good
start keep yourself safe out there we'll
probably wrap it up for the week okay
yeah it's been a good week busy week
