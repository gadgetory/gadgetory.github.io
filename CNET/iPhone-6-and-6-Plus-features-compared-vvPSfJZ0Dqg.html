what's new about them I'm Scott Stein
and I'm going to tell you the
differences between the 6 and the 6 plus
the iPhone 6 and 6 plus are actually
really similar and both of them combined
are a nice step up over the iPhone 5s
before in the following ways they both
have a better a a processor that's
faster has better graphics these both
have faster Wi-Fi and LTE browsing the
Wi-Fi is 802 11 AC finally and they both
work with Apple pay which is Apple's
Wireless payment system that's coming in
October they also both have higher
storage capacities they start at 16 gigs
then they go to 64 and 128 this time and
they both have slightly improved camera
technology we're talking about autofocus
mainly plus the ability to shoot even
slower slo-mo and 60 frames per second
video plus some improved multi burst
features on the FaceTime front-facing
camera and a better aperture for
capturing a little more around you now
those features are all on both phones
the iPhone 6 plus has everything the
iPhone 6s plus a little bit more
you've got more battery life on this the
camera also has optical image
stabilization which is big for low-light
photo conditions and if you're shaking
your hand around a little bit
who isn't Plus this also has a higher
resolution screen 1920 by 1080 as
opposed to 13 44 by 750 5.5 inches 4.7
inches now iPhone 6 plus also allows you
to tilt in a landscape mode which the
iPhone 6 doesn't for the home screen and
for other core apps now if you've used a
lot of iPhone apps you know the lot of
them already do work in landscape so
over time you may find out that both of
these work in landscape mode pretty well
but apples tending to this one a little
bit more as an iPad like work companion
and there's one more difference between
these two that's price the iPhone 6 is
$1.99 it's starting point up to $2.99
and 399 the 6 plus is $100 more at every
configuration considering that you'd
want to probably have more than 16
gigabytes of storage you're going to be
looking at 399 under contract for the
iPhone 6 plus that has all the storage
that you'd want to take photos and video
now while you may be driving yourself
crazy thinking about
whether you get the 6 or the 6 plus no
this at least whichever one you pick is
a big screen upgrade from any previous
iPhone so rest easy on that
I'm Scott Stein with a look at the
iPhone 6 and 6 plus and what's different</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
