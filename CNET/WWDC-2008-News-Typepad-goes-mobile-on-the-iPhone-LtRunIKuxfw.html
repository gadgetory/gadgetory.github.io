blogging service in the world every
month more than 100 million people visit
a blog that's powered by typepad and
photo blogging is one of our most
popular features let me show you type ad
on the iphone so this is the
applications home screen and from here
it's incredibly easy for me to post to
my blog I can create a simple text posts
by tapping create a post and that brings
up our post editor or I could choose to
blog the moment by taking a photo and
sending it directly to my blog this
takes advantage of the camera API in the
iphone sdk but what i want to do today
is actually blog a photo that I took
yesterday a group of folks were visiting
San Francisco from our Paris office and
i took them down to Fisherman's Wharf so
I'll tap on add a photo this will let me
browse my photo albums and I'll go to
the trip to San Francisco album and I'll
pick that post that first photo there I
can move and scale it to make it fit
just right for my blog and I'll tap
choose to select it this brings me to my
post editor I'll tap to change the blog
that I want to post it to my default is
michael's blog but i want to put this in
travel in california which is where i
blog about all my adventures in the
Golden State I'll tap to add a title and
I will just call this wow I'm going to
tap to choose categories to put it in
the right place in my blogs archives
will pick bahria and food and drink and
now finally I'll tap to add some body
text and some commentary for the post
will just say yum so I tap publish and
type ad for iphone instantly starts
sending the post and the photo up to my
blog and returns me to the applications
home screen I'll tap on the pending
items view to watch our progress and in
the meantime I'd actually go and create
a new post if I wanted to but there we
just got an alert to let us know that
the post has been published will tap on
the View button that will launch Safari
and take us right to the post that we've
just created and it's available for the
world to see and that's how easy it is
to blog with typepad on the iphone we're
really excited about the iphone sdk made
it incredibly easy for us to develop
this mobile application and we're also
excited to announce that the app will be
available for free at the launch of the
iphone app store which we believe will
be the best
way for users to get applications on
their mobile device thanks very much for
having us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
