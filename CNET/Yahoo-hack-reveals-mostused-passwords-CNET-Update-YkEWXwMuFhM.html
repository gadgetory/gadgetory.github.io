gold medal in multitasking I'm Bridget
Carey and this is your scene at update
folks we have another nasty password
hack on our hands and this time it's
with Yahoo more than 450,000 usernames
and passwords for Yahoo voices were
posted online and the hackers say this
was done as a wake-up call to yahoo to
step up security this is the same type
of hack technique that was used against
Sony and the PlayStation Network last
year it's another reminder to not repeat
your passwords even with a big name like
Yahoo you can't trust the security it's
also scary how many people use easy
passwords cnet comb through the exposed
data and found the most common password
was one two three four five six the next
most popular was all ones and all zeros
the word password was used by 780
accounts and that was followed by
welcome as an yes welcome to hackers why
don't you the f-word also quite popular
why Olga V so angry pop culture terms
also dominated like ninja Superman
Batman Star Wars and ncc 1701 the
registry of the USS Enterprise ya don't
boldly go with that as your password so
directv and Viacom are having a battle
over money and as part of the fight
directv is not showing Viacom channels
like Comedy Central and MTV but now this
is turning nasty because Viacom disabled
watching popular shows from the web so
great Yap now this fight is affecting
everyone you can head to hulu to find
some episodes in the meantime get ready
for the most social olympics yet because
NBC an Adobe have created two mobile
apps for streaming all the games which
has never been done before and the ABS
will be filled with extra footage it's
all part of this growing trend to get
you to be engaged on two screens at once
the TV and your tablet NBC and the BBC
also partnered with facebook to track
what's being said and shared online
during the 17 day event you're going to
get hit with olympics and facebook from
every angle also facebook is changing
groups so you can see exactly who has
read each post meet in a group it'll
mark you as having read the post if you
click it like it or even if you
just open the group page which isn't
always an indicator that you read
everything on the page but it'll assume
you did so just keep that in mind
groupies and today's appt to watch is
the amazing Alex it's new game from the
makers of angry birds and it's out now
for Apple and Android devices it's
similar to Angry Birds because it's a
bunch of physics puzzles use a series of
objects that bounced and ricocheted to
create a contraption that in the end
will trigger something that your tech
