your stovetop walk away for a second and
forget what's going on in the kitchen a
Wi-Fi enabled device called the eye
guard intelligent wants to prevent fires
that your forgetfulness may cause but
automatically shutting off your stove
when you walk away here's how it works
you plug the eye guard stove into the
outlet you'd normally use for your range
then you plug your range into the eye
guard stove and mount the devices
control panel nearby the control panel
includes a motion sensor if it senses
that you're away from your stove for
more than five minutes the a guard stove
will put your cooktop or oven into a
standby mode so your food stops cooking
when you get back within range of your
stove the a guard stove switches your
cooktop and oven back on this specific
model only works with electric ranges
but there's also a model for gas ranges
too this product isn't just geared
towards the easily distracted its
manufacturers say this product would
also work well in homes of people with
physical disabilities or aging adults
the a guard stove delivers on its
promise to stop cooking if you step away
from your stove for too long it sounds
an alarm that's loud enough to remind
you to get back in the kitchen the email
alerts come fast and it works for both
the cooktop and the oven but there are
drawbacks to the a guard stove
specifically the absence of a smartphone
app for the product and its 495 dollar
price but this is a really good product
if you want to help keep someone safe in
the kitchen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
