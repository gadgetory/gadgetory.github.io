com and welcome to Road Warrior where we
take a look at the hottest gadgets for
life on the go coming up a super
portable sirius satellite radio receiver
the ultimate road warrior phone and will
you ditch your pc laptop for the new
macbook pro with the core 2 duo first
dope james kim finally explains how the
Wi-Fi in the microsoft zune music player
works i send this i will send it to any
of the zooms that are nearby and i've
got three of them here and it's actually
searching for and i just found two zooms
i'm going to send this song to the brown
zune what it's going to do is send a
message to the brown soon it will pop up
a prompt that matt white that's the
white version wants to send me music and
i'm going to accept that you don't get
to keep the music you receive forever
and you can only send to other zunes now
we know james also got his hands on the
serious stiletto 100 it's a satellite
radio packed with extras we have here
satellite radio internet radio your
library there's two gigabytes inside of
this thing overall so far it looks like
a pretty nice piece serious hasn't had a
device like this one that was totally
portable and this thing does a lot of
different things the Wi-Fi element is
really cool i don't know how useful it
will be but we'll check that in our
review james said the battery will give
four hours for satellite eight hours for
internet radio and 20 hours for mp3
playback next up Bonnie Shaw has
singulars first 3g smartphone the 8520 5
in terms of design I really like it
pocketpc phones tend to be able big and
bulky but this is pretty manageable and
fits nicely in the palm it is a little
bit heavy so just be aware of that got a
nice 2.8 touchscreen bright colors and
shrimp text the navigation rate here's a
little bit small for me so I imagine
users with larger hands will have even
more problems however if you do flip up
the device like that you got a nice full
qwerty keyboard it's really spacious and
it's comfortable to hold while you're
messaging it also has Wi-Fi Bluetooth
and push email capabilities finally dan
ackerman has the macbook
Pro with the core 2 duo cpu besides the
souped-up processor here's what else you
get other groovy extras include a
firewire 800 port the old models only
have 400 so you can hook up your
external DVD drive or a DV camera pretty
easily and of course it comes with
Apple's front row remote take this
little guy right here aiming at the
screen press the button and front row
comes up and then you can navigate
through your music through your photos
you can watch a DVD movie or watch video
files on your computer will it be
cheaper than a PC laptop no but it is
prettier that's it for this edition of
road warrior I'm Tom Merritt check back
next time for more gadgets that keep you
armed and dangerously productive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
