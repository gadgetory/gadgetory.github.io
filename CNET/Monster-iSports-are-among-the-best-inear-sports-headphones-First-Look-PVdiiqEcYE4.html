for cnet.com and I'm here with the
monster I Sport immersion in ear
headphones these are as their name
describes a sports headphone they are
sweat proof and they also have a flat
core design as well as an inline
microphone for making calls they really
are pretty durable and the key here is
that they do offer a very secure fit
they come with these little sports clip
clips and those come in various sizes as
well as the ear tips and the idea here
is that you try to find one of those ear
tips and sports clips that fits your ear
best and you really can get a very tight
seal they won't work with everyone's
ears really well but with most years
they do seem to fit and they worked
really well for me for running they did
not fall out of my ears the key of
course to getting that tight seal is
that you do get better bass response and
these guys have really good base for an
earphone they also have really good
detail so these really offer pretty
premium sound in a $99 earphone they do
make a yellow version of this a
livestrong version it's the exact same
version but it's the LIVESTRONG monster
also makes a step up Limited Edition USA
model that one actually has a little bit
different design and I got a little bit
tighter fit from it and a little bit
better sound but that does cost $200 or
twice as much it's really not worth
jumping up to that model it's also worth
noting that these do come with a nice
little carrying pouch it's one of the
better carrying pouches that comes with
headphones because it offers some
protection but it isn't too bulky one
small issue with these is it because the
noise isolation is so good you actually
can't hear a lot of what's going on in
the outside world so if you are worried
about hearing cars and other things
around you these may not be the best
earphones for that but if you want to
shut that noise out these are actually
very good I also use these on a
day-to-day basis rather than just for
running or doing sports in the gym and
they work fine as well so these really
are a good multi-use earphone I
recommend them for in the gym or outside
running or doing other sports
they really do say in your ear as well
and offer premium sound I'm David karna
and those are the monster I Sport
emergent in-ear headphones
