front of me here are apples two new
iPhones the iPhone 5c and the iPhone 5s
this is the first time that Apple has
released two iPhones at the same time
they're not really two new iPhones one
is a nice design shift away from the
iPhone 5 really an iPhone 5 with a new
paintjob
and a couple of new tweaks but the new
phone under the hood is the iPhone 5s so
let's talk about that one for a moment
this looks a lot like the iPhone 5 it
looks almost exactly like the iPhone 5
except for a few new color schemes this
is Space Gray versus black because it's
two-tone of course you know about the
gold iPhone which kind of looks a little
more like a light bronze and there's
also a white silver iPhone the same
exact looked as last year so what's new
inside the iPhone 5s what you're really
getting is a brand spanking new a7
processor that's faster and also is
64-bit well what does that mean it's
probably building towards the future of
computing more than something you can
appreciate right now there are a lot
faster graphics and it's also got
something called an m7 chip that allows
for what Apple claims is better motion
tracking the iPhone 5s is biggest party
trick that you will want to show off to
your friends is probably touch ID that
home button has changed there's no
little square there anymore and it is
still clickable but built-in underneath
is a capacitive sensor that actually
scans your fingerprint any finger or
even your toe it worked now that sounds
kind of great and the technology is
really fast much faster than any other
fingerprint sensor but curb your
excitement at the moment because what
touch ID does is pretty limited right
now it does allow you to bypass using a
passcode on your phone it also will
store your iTunes password so if you
wanna make a purchase you just press a
new buy but it doesn't do right now is
allow any other storing of other cloud
connected service passwords remembering
your facebook or google account or
allowing to buy things with other
services now what's interesting is that
your fingerprint is stored on the a7
chip itself it's not cloud shared or
anything like that and it will allow you
your grace period of login attempts but
then it will default to asking you for
your passcode if you don't scan enough
times correctly or if you restart your
phone so keep your passcode handy keep
your iTunes account handy now the
changes with the camera are multifold
some of them have to do with the a7
processor some of them have to do with
some changes in the sensor design and
the flash there's a larger sensor
although it's still 8 megapixels the
pixels are actually larger and the
aperture is larger now that means better
light sensitivity and there's now
built-in image stabilization so there's
a little less blur and the flash is a
completely different flash system called
true flash or two-tone flash and it has
an amber and a white light that it
actually pings your environment and
provides a complicated mix of up to a
thousand different color tones to fit
the moment when you use flash what it
boils down to is that in testing it
flash actually looks a lot better and in
general the clarity and the the detail
on pictures is a lot better if you blow
it up and look at it now there's some
other tricks too in this camera you've
got a new video recording mode it
actually gives true slo-mo recording
capability and that's a separately
toggled mode from regular 1080p video
recording you have to trigger it and it
records in 720p and 120 frames per
second and then at any time afterwards
you can actually toggle and adjust where
the slow-mo effect kicks in the a7
processor is based on every benchmark
that we've thrown at it so far
definitely fast at least twice as fast
again as the a6 last year but what shows
that off in everyday operations with the
current apps that are out there you may
not notice it but you can definitely
expect that their me games coming down
the line fast and furious that take
advantage of those better graphics of
course you're also getting iOS 7
that's pre-installed on the iPhone 5s
what hasn't changed is the screen it's
still a 4-inch 11 36 by 640 Retina
display and it still looks great but it
looks exactly like the iPhone 5 before
it and the size is the same overall the
battery life also is performing about
the
equivalent of what the iPhone 5 did the
iPhone 5s just looks a lot like the
iPhone 5 it's definitely a better phone
but those improvements are really things
you may have to wait for down the line
versus stuff you can appreciate right
now if you're waiting for something to
show off and get excited about maybe you
wait for a future product if you have an
iPhone 5 maybe you don't need to get the
iPhone 5s but you've been waiting or if
you really care about camera technology
or you're interested in idea of a
fingerprint sensor this is a very good
time to get a board you're basically
future proofing your iPhone we'll see
where that goes
I'm Scott Stein and that's a look at the
new iPhone 5s from Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
