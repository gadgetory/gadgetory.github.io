week we featured the best new songs from
our site music download calm i'm kurt
wolf and this week my pick is a new
collection from nina simone it's called
protest ontology Nina Simone's music was
a hybrid of jazz soul full gospel and
blues she was trained as a classical
pianist but she also did amazing
versions of songs by the likes of
screamin Jay Hawkins and the Beatles
some of her best-known songs though were
those written during the civil rights
era such as the one we have for free
download on the site right now
revolution revolution is one of eleven
previously unreleased live tracks on
protest anthology along with strange
fruit to be young gifted in black and
the infamous Mississippi goddamn the
elections have made me lose my rest
the collection came out this week but
don't look for it in stores as it's only
available digitally four more
collections of unreleased Nina Simone's
songs are on the way as well so stay
tuned
hey this is peter gavin of my pick this
week is Sun Kil moon they just released
their third album called April and
here's one of my favorite tracks called
Morristown
skinship
if you're not familiar with mark kozilek
well it's about time you check him out
he's considered the godfather of indie
rock twosome and he's put out six albums
with the Red House Painters several solo
releases and now he's sticking with the
name Sun Kil moon the new album features
guests including Bonnie Prince Billy and
if you listen to the high harmonies on
the track lost verses you'll hear Ben
Gibbard from Death Cab for Cutie
mark was just here at CNET last week for
a rare interview and performance
he doesn't do them very often so we're
honored to have him in check out that
podcast at studio C dot cnet.com and
listen to the new Sun Kil moon on our
site hey what's up everyone I'm Angie
and this week I thought I'd pick a local
favorite of mine his name is Edie Garo
and goes under the moniker UFO not to be
confused with the 70s metal outfit UFO
however after listening a few songs off
of Edie's record logic and lunacy I have
a feeling he may have had them in mind
check out the last few seconds of
elephone
euro is widely acknowledged as one of
the key players of the West Coast drum
and bass scene
you won't hear any drum and bass on its
new album but you will hear the German
based veteran explore VA Tories for the
first time check out the song we keep on
showcasing UFOs electro-pop vocals we
have the two songs have just heard plus
another bonus track for free download
just make sure you search for UFO with
an exclamation point at the end on music
dot down we got hot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
