phone world that same rule applies I'm
Bryant on from cnet com and today we've
got the light shining bright on the rim
blackberry curve 8310 from eighty people
talk iphone all the time but if you
haven't noticed it's really blackberries
that rule the world today we're looking
at the curve and it's one of the most
popular and rims line combining a full
qwerty keyboard in a sleek and smooth
design this quadband phone is uber
comfortable to hold and the rubbery
sides make it easy to grip it also has
that famed trackball that makes using
the device a pleasant experience so
let's talk features specifically for the
8310 model that's on AT&amp;amp;T service the
biggest goodie that separates this guy
from the other curve is the addition of
GPS it uses the TeleNav gps service with
color maps and real text to voice
direction now that's huge because you
can pay attention to the road without
looking down at the phone there is a ten
dollar monthly cost for unlimited use
but for people on the go it's well worth
it now outside of GPS goodness the curve
is one of the best if not the best
messaging smartphones on the market it's
compatible with blackberry enterprise
servers and supports Microsoft Exchange
IBM lotus domino or Novell GroupWise for
corporate email in real time you'll also
get pop or IMAP email support for up to
as many as 10 email accounts pretty much
every popular document is viewable
through the email client and you have
text messaging multimedia messages and
instant messaging it's a messaging
machine the 8310 is loaded with a 2
megapixel camera which holds its own
against other smart phones Bluetooth a
3.5 millimeter jack to use your own
headphones and pretty good call quality
now battery life was rated at four hours
but our labs pushed it out to five and
more is always better so what are we
missing in the curve well this model has
a great GPS package but there's a
trade-off because there's no Wi-Fi
t-mobile's 8320 model is loaded with
Wi-Fi but there's no GPS so in a perfect
world we'd
to them there's also no 3G support so
we're left with little edge 3g is where
it's at and we're still waiting and the
web browser is also pretty dated
especially compared to Safari on the
iPhone the 8310 has instant messaging
but you're limited to using blackberry
zone messaging service now t-mobile's
version allows you to chat with all the
big time clients like aim yahoo and
windows live messenger now this is still
a great phone but we wanted to point out
some of the differences between the AT&amp;amp;T
and t-mobile version there are still
places to improve and we can't wait for
the next generation blackberry curve but
it's still currently the most popular
smartphone on the planet and it knows
what it does best messaging messaging
and more messaging I'm Brian song for
cnet com and this blackberry smartphone
continues to stay ahead of the curve</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
