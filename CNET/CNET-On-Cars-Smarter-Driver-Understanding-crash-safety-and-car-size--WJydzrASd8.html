little nuance there's weight proportions
engineering and technology weight is
obvious a small car has less mass to
resist being accelerated in other words
drop-kicked by the bigger car it
collides with that in turn means things
inside the small car may be more
violently accelerated as well
then there are proportions a small car
means less car around you front and rear
in particular that gives engineers less
room to create crumple zones that
dissipate the force of an impact into
the bending of metal instead of the
bending of you effects is engineering
sophisticated design has overcome some
of the weight and proportion
disadvantage
hence some small cars get better crash
scores than bigger ones key is
structural integrity to reduce or
prevent intrusion into the passenger
cabin of either the other car or parts
of your own car and finally technology
it used to be that small cars were
cheated of things like anti-lock brakes
and airbags and stability control today
all of those are on virtually every new
car and more advanced tech like
pre-collision braking and airbags in
exotic places are no longer just the
domain of the hundred thousand dollar
Mercedes now most recently the IIHS
found that only one of eleven mini cars
tested we're able to get an acceptable
rating in the new small overlap crash
test
given how important such ratings are in
the showroom expect the engineering and
technology folks to at least narrow the
gap on this lousy performance a small
overlap crash can be devastating because
often the main structural elements of
the vehicle are bypassed if the vehicle
is not designed for this that can lead
to massive collapse of the occupant
compartment and a big reduction in
survival space
it pays to double check how a car you're
considering really does in crash tests
and not just rely on conventional wisdom</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
