the most powerful fully featured devices
ever made but is it really worth $1000
starting price or a Samsung just
greedily trying to out Apple the iPhone
10 the note 9 is a super phone through
and through it's got a beautiful six
point four inch screen with curved glass
sides and Samsung's signature shortcut
tools there's a 12 megapixel dual camera
with new AI for optimizing your photos
there was a headphone jack waterproofing
wireless charging Android 8.1 and a
micro SD card slot but the note lines
real value boils down to three things
its enormous 4000 milliampere hour
battery it's gigantic 128 gig or 512
gigabytes of on-board storage and it's
trademark s-pen with new built-in
bluetooth tricks the s-pen can still
write draw and navigate around but now
it also works like a remote control
thanks to a new Bluetooth antenna inside
for example you can use it to launch the
camera app switch to selfie mode and
take a selfie all with a few clicks this
was my favorite use by far you can also
open nearly any app advance your photo
gallery control a presentation and skip
a music track the remote will work up to
30 feet away for either 30 minutes or
200 clicks before it needs to recharge
inside the phone the Bluetooth s-pen is
clever no doubt but in the long run all
but the most enthusiastic power users
will probably forget this feature even
exists battery life on the note 9 is
pretty great it will take you from
daybreak to midnight hours which isn't
something I could say for either Galaxy
S 9 phone
that's fantastic in a pinch but you
should still plan on powering the phone
up once a day 2 hours through the note
lines fast charging cable is all you
need
Samsung says that the 128 gigabyte
version of the note 9 can store almost
550 movies in over 22,000 photos and the
512 gigabyte version that can store over
2,300 movies and more than 93 thousand
photos
this is fantastic because it means you
won't have to constantly worry about
deleting videos and chose to make room
for more fun at cheaper 64 gigabyte
phone with support for micro SD card
storage it's still going to be more
affordable in the long run than the
galaxy note 9
the note 9 is a beautiful fantastic
phone but it has a few sticking points
it's camera while very good is almost
exactly the same as the galaxy s 9 plus
camera only with a new scene detection
feature added in
unfortunately this is a little slow to
load also the placement of the
fingerprint reader is still too close to
the camera to feel comfortable and
natural in my hands and the phone's
price is through the roof the galaxy
note 9 is a great buy if you want to
upgrade from an older galaxy phone or if
you're seeking a large screen Android
device with all the things but you might
want to hold off if you're really
looking for a phone that has
cutting-edge 5g speeds and in screen
fingerprint reader and a 3d front-facing
camera remember the note 9 is an
investment phone this is something
you're going to want to hold on to for
years</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
