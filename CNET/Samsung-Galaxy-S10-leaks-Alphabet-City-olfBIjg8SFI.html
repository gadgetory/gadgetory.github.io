show that covers everything to do with
alphabet alphabet happens to own lots of
companies like loon X way Moe and Google
I'm your guide Aya's Akhtar and you are
the very patient audience apologies for
being out sick today we're talking about
fishing some updates and your comments
but first up it's time to talk phones on
to Android Avenue all about Samsung GE
posted several pictures showing off what
it says are the Galaxy S 10 and the S 10
plus these images are pretty on point
with all the rumors we've heard the S 10
would have an infinity Oh display with
one camera the plus would have a pill
shaped cutout on the top right for two
cameras on the back of each are three
cameras on the bottom you've got a
speaker USB C and yes a headphone jack
unless visual news ice universe says the
Galaxy S 10 features excellent battery
optimization and a more advanced cooling
structure in an older tweet ice universe
said the 10-plus will pack a 4100
milliamp hour battery that's pretty big
ice universe has been pretty reliable
when it comes to leaks so I'm inclined
to believe those tweets Samsung is
holding a Galaxy unpacked event on
February 20th Xiaomi showed off a
prototype foldable phone that I assume
is running Android take a look at this
folder this clip is part of a 51 second
video that shows Xiaomi as president
flexing the phone it features two hinges
that allow the screen to expand on the
left and right there are no mentions of
pricing or availability and in even less
exciting news this is probably the LG G
8 thank you according to xda-developers
LG might dump the earpiece speaker to
use the screen to provide audio sticking
with LG the company put up a teaser
video for some new tech the vid shows a
hand gesturing over a piece of paper
with one wave the words could by touch
up here with another wave the text
disappears
LG says we'll see this tech at MWC 2019
later in February this is anyone want to
increased gesture support on phones you
what about you me I don't know let's
make our way to uptown update
Google i/o will run from May 7th to the
9th this year Apple music is updated for
Android now
it handles Android tablets even better
all of those words sound really strange
together google voice users you'll never
believe it Google is updating voice so
VoIP calls will be available to all of
you just in time for some kind of
football game YouTube TV is rolling out
nationwide covering 195 markets
that's about 98 percent of US households
the other 2% we get YouTube TV
eventually alphabets jigsaw published a
quiz to see if you can spot a phishing
email when you see it and since we
talked about jigsaw every episode on
this show I don't need to explain to you
that the company tries to take on global
security challenges try out the quiz a
phishing quiz dot with google.com on to
comment code this is the part of the
show where we shine a spotlight at the
most amazing audience the world that
would be you Alexander says I don't know
why people keep hating on Android
tablets I'm watching this on one now I
love my Nexus 10 I use a pixel see now
not as great as the Nexus 10 but it's
still great my dad has a samsung galaxy
tablet and he really likes it I really
enjoyed my Nexus 7 devices I had the
first two the thing is app support is
and was not so great if folding phones
catch on I'd expect the apps to get
better for larger displays over time
Ross asks why do you have to explain the
alphabet city every episode well Ross
it's for new viewers sometimes people
find this show because of a topic and
not for the show itself that's crazy I
know thanks to everyone for writing in
if you've enjoyed your stay in Alphabet
City please like and subscribe
I my as actor I'll see you online
we've got a post online at CNET with the
headline Galaxy F would be a terrible
name for Samsung's first foldable what
do you think would be a better name
galaxy x galaxy a flexi thing doubt
