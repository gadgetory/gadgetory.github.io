molly wood and welcome to the cnet tech
review where we collect our hottest
videos of the week and tell you what's
good and what's bad in the world of tech
plus offer some unique tech wisdom in
the form of the bottom line let's get
started with the good for the
uninitiated South by Southwest is a
collection of conferences and festivals
held each year in Austin Texas to
celebrate the convergent worlds of music
film + interactive content last weekend
brian Tong and i made the trip out to
austin to check out the show tape an
episode of our buzz out loud podcast in
front of a live audience and hit a few
of the parties here's a little taste of
our visit to South by Southwest
hey guys Bryant's on here I'm Hollywood
and we are here in Austin Texas at South
by Southwest 2011 there's a lot of
action going on outside behind us inside
in the common center but how do you
explain this thing yeah sounds like oh
this is totally weird it's this
interactive music film festival most
people say it's really about the parties
go it's impossible to explain so we're
just gonna try to show i'm gonna show
you the best way that we can to check it
out are you really here for the panels

definitely you can't ignore the music
effects and the parties that are going
on but one hundred percent came for the
panels are set for most what did you

party party over here party over there

and trust me between the paddling and
the bull riding Ryan was walking a
little funny the whole rest of the
weekend you can find buzz out loud in
all of our podcasts at cnet com / live I
have to say it's been a busy week before
I left town for Austin I had a few
minutes to fill in for a vacationing
Brian Cooley for the latest edition of
the scene at top five this week we're
counting down the best laptops see if
you can guess which one comes in at
number one
say what you will about tablets being
the future this is the present and
laptops ain't going anywhere I'm
Mollywood in for Brian Cooley with a
cnet top five the best five laptops you
can buy right now so why buy a laptop
when tablets are the future of media
consumption well maybe because laptops
are still the future of getting some
damn work done already if you still like
typing you don't like grease smudges on
your touchscreen and you could use a
little more horsepower than an oversized
smartphone chip here are the five
laptops that are cnet editors say are
the best you can get coming in at number
five is the HP pavilion dm1 the main
thing we love about this guy great
battery life and the AMD fusion platform
it combines that power efficient
performance with better graphics than
you would normally see in a budget
netbook because it also costs less than
500 bucks they've been word for that HP
bloatware it would be love at number 4
we're going the opposite direction
price-wise and size-wise but we're
sticking with HP it's the high-end HP
Envy 17 the envy line is HP's premium
laptop brand in the envy 17 is a sleek
aluminum macbook pro clone with a
beautiful display high-end audio plenty
of power and performance and even USB
3.0 for around 1,500 bucks plus trust me
I actually own the HP envy 14 and
believe me when I tell you it's real
Purdy in at number 3 the 11-inch MacBook
Air the first macbook air came off like
an overpriced toy for annoying wanna be
CEO types the second macbook air came
off like i got a habit by some reports
air sales topped 1.1 million in the
first three months after launch the 11
inch model is the stunner to
unbelievably light and thin instant on
performance and very impressive battery
life although with a thousand dollar
price tag no SD card slot no backlit
keyboard and a pretty outdated processor
the macbook air is still a little more
flash than value but i dare you to use
one and not have to have it
in at number two you'll want to check
out that cnet editors choice toshiba
portege r700 5 but maybe don't buy just
yet this laptop is described by our
editors as being as close to a perfect
balance of design price and performance
as you'll find in a windows laptop so
what can make it better sandy bridge the
are 800 series is coming hopefully very
soon so considering how much we love the
are 705 the more powerful and efficient
sandy bridge processors will make the
Newport OJ's a total must have and
before we get to number 1 i'd like to
hear your opinion on whether reports of
the laptops death are greatly
exaggerated Gartner research reported
this week that tablet sales will grow
from 15 million in 2010 to 54 million in
2011 and that laptop sales will tank as
a result but I want to know what you
think what are you more likely to buy in
2011 a laptop or a tablet tell us in our
poll at the cnet TV blog over at blog
sina TV com ok now it's time for the
number one best laptop as rated by our
cnet editors no surprise here it's the
macbook pro in any size you want the
15-inch MacBook Pro is a cnet editors
choice thanks to its new high-end
processor options great graphics and the
new Thunderbolt i/o port and the 13-inch
model may not have the graphics
horsepower but the 2.7 gigahertz core i7
processor it's serious business and the
battery life is amazing I know some of
you were hoping for a redesign with the
new models but come on it's not like the
macbook pro is ugly and there you have
it the five best laptops available right
now or coming soon happy shopping
everyone i'm molly wood and you can find
all the scene at top 5 videos at Cena TV
com
I actually own two of the laptops on
that list the HP envy and the air can I
pick them or what no matter which laptop
you pick odds are you're gonna need a
web browser to get any real use out of
it and when it comes to browser experts
look no farther than our own seth
rosenblatt don't believe me here's his
first look at google chrome ten google
exploded onto the browser scene with the
open-source chrome in September 2008 and
interest in the browser has continued to
skyrocket Chrome's hook has always been
its speed but there's far more to the
browser than just fast rendering hi i'm
seth rosenblatt for cnet and in this
first look video i'll be taking you on a
quick tour of what's what in chrome 10
there's a lot going on under that
minimalist interface so i'm going to
talk about just the key features check
out cnet's how-to videos for more
in-depth look at how Chrome's features
work google has been touting chrome 10
as sixty-six percent faster than chrome
9 even with its limited hardware
acceleration implementation there's no
doubt that chrome benchmarks at
incredibly fast speeds full benchmarks
are available at my download com review
of google chrome what's almost as
important though is that it feels fast
page load times especially when only a
few tabs are open feel like there's less
than a split second delay from hitting
enter to when the site is usable i have
noticed though that chrome does tend to
slow down noticeably with more than two
dozen tabs open your browsing habits may
vary but if you're a tab junkie like me
that can be a really big problem can
often lead to crashes too although
that's actually one of chromes better
features plugins like adobe flash are
sandboxed so when they crash they only
take down the tab and not the entire
browser chrome also comes with its own
task manager so you can see the impact
of each tab on your system when you fire
up chrome for the first time it will
take you to your preferred search engine
you can change this in the options menu
to your new tab page which is where a
lot of chromes action happens the new
tab page has links to Chrome Web Store
for chrome based apps
thumbnails of your most visited sites
and a list of recently closed tabs you
can tear off tabs to make them their own
windows and drag them back into the
browser right click on a tab to
duplicate the tab pin it permanently to
the left of the tab bar get multiple
close tab options reopen a closed tab or
bookmark all your tabs at once the
interface is simple and extremely
effective navigation controls live on
the left Google's unified location bar
and search box which the company calls
the Omni bar quietly displays search
results from your preferred search
engine your history and instant URL
lookups extensions get added to the
right as icons you can toggle always
displaying the bookmarks bar or having
it show only when you open a blank tab
in options Chrome's extension gallery
has grown dramatically since its
introduction and now has more than
10,000 extensions and themes both are
restart 'less which means that when you
install them you won't have to restart
the browser sync is a big part of Chrome
and if your life is heavily tied to your
gmail account you're going to find
chrome extremely convenient you can sync
apps autofill bookmarks extensions
themes passwords and preferences and you
can set it for a lower level of security
using your google password or set up
your own higher security sync passphrase
on the safety front chrome allows you to
disable JavaScript cookies images and
will auto block websites that are known
for promulgating phishing attacks and
malware threats or are otherwise unsafe
the usefulness of this depends on
Google's ability to flag websites as
risky so it's recommended to use an
add-on like the web of trust there's
also the incognito mode for private
trackless browsing although there's no
options menu choice for always opening
into incognito chrome now comes with a
nascent Google Cloud Print which will
allow you to print from the browser to
any printer over-the-air a useful tool
when it works for those few times when
you have to print and you're not near a
printer you think Google would be
greener than enabling you tree killers
but what do I know the Downloads menu
isn't particularly robust but it does
expose the download source link
opens in its own tab keeping the browser
tidy over all chrome speed remains the
kingpin feature along with growing
support for future web tech like html5
hardware acceleration and advanced
standards support people like the
browser because it's fast well supported
and automatically updates frequently
with new features potential concerns
about Google privacy and data mining
can't withstand the juggernaut of
convenience and for a deeper look at
some of chromes new features be sure to
check out the how-to videos at seen at
tv.com with your first look at chrome 10
i'm seth rosenblatt frisina you can also
check out sets review of the latest
incarnation of microsoft internet
explorer IE 9 over at cnet TV com
alright we've covered a lot of ground
already so let's take a quick break but
we'll be right back with more tech
review right after this
welcome back to the cnet tech review our
weekly video digest of all things good
and bad we've seen here at cnet TV
continuing on in the good so do you have
your ipad 2 yet if so you might be
trying to figure out what to do with
your iPad 1 well before you turn it into
a coaster Eric Franklin has some tips
for transferring all your data over to
the new one hey guys eric franklin here
and for those of you looking to transfer
data from your current ipad to your
brand new and hot ipad 2 you're in luck
for two reasons one you get to look at
this mug here for the next few minutes
and 2 this is a very simple process
which is probably why they chose me to
do this one huh alright anyway first
step connect your old iPad to your PC or
Mac itunes should open automatically but
if it doesn't simply open iTunes your
iPad may begin to sync with itunes
however if it doesn't simply locate your
iPad under devices in the left menu
window right-click or control-click it
then choose back up after a few moments
of running through a number of steps the
syncing process will end you'll know for
sure it's ended when your iPad no longer
states sync in progress unplug your old
and busted iPad and plug in your new
hotness iTunes will then ask you to
register your new iPad if you haven't
already then iTunes will prompt you to
either set up as a new iPad or restore
from a backup choose restore from a
backup and select me back up you just
created which should have your iPad's
name as well as the time and day in
which it was last synced click continue
once the restore process is complete
your iPad 2 will reboot iTunes should
Rida tect it and will then begin to
transfer settings and data to your new
iPad now to be absolutely sure you have
all your apps
movies and music select the iPad in the
menu just like before now in the upper
nav check the type of data you want
transfer to your new iPad like apps
music movies and so on then click apply
your iPad will sink again this may take
a while depending on how many apps you
have just be patient and once it's done
your new iPad should have all the same
data as your old one you can then throw
the old one away and a way to repeat
this process when the ipad 3 launches
once again this is eric franklin and i
hope you enjoy your new hotness as for
your old ipad might I recommend selling
it at gazelle com or you can donate it
at the apple store for Teach for America
but it's a good use in the classroom and
on that good deed note let's turn our
attention to the bat this week I mean
bad as in badass among all the nifty
things the ipad 2 can do one of the
coolest has to be the ability to create
music with the new version of garageband
jason parker is here to tell us why it
really is one bad app
welcome to tap that app i'm jason parker
and this is the show where we cover the
hottest absent on mobile space along
with the release of the ipad 2 on march
11th Alper released an ipad version for
popular mac app GarageBand GarageBand
already has a long history on the Mac
letting people use intuitive controls
and a huge library of instruments and
pre-recorded loops to create songs but
with the iPad version Apple needed to
come up with creative ways to record
music using only a touchscreen interface
and we think they did an amazing job
just as a general overview GarageBand
offers several touch instruments guitar
amps and effects 8-track recording and
mixing more than 250 loops to play with
and you can export AAC files of your
projects through email or add them to
itunes you start by creating a new song
then choose your first instrument
GarageBand offers instruments you can
play in real time like their real-world
counterparts but you also have the
option to play smart instruments that do
most of the heavy lifting for you one
neat feature is that every instrument
has its own specific theme giving all of
them their own feel as you play using
the smart keyboard for example lays out
all your chords in the chosen key this
means that just about whatever you press
will probably go together in a song you
also can change the key by touching the
wrench in the upper right corner using a
combination of bass notes on the bottom
and chords at the top it's easy to
create a nice sounding song even if you
have very little musical experience
similarly the smart guitar offers a
different layout that lets you play
chords with a swipe of your finger you
have the ability to play individual
notes and actually Bend guitar strings
for your big rock solos all the smart
instruments also come with a few
pre-recorded segments so you can just
tap the key and let the app play for you
drums can be played manually and you can
choose from both standard drum kits and
drum machine type layouts or like the
other instruments you can choose smart
drums to make things easier simply place
drum set items on the grid to experiment
or hit the dice icon for a random layout
once you've been inspired by some of the
instruments you can record a couple of
tracks then look at the track layout
section to add or remove tracks manage
track volume and play with effects like
reverb track panning and echo as you
become more advanced you can also use
quantization tools to match up complex
tracks to cover up
you're less than perfect human rhythm
but maybe I'm just speaking for myself
the track screen is also where you'll
find garage bands pre-recorded loops
once you find something you like by
instrument genre and other descriptors
just drag and drop the loop onto your
track screen to add it to your song i
created this song on the way to work
this morning in carpool frankly with
tons of uniquely designed instruments a
smart touch interface and tools that
make song creation easy it's a miracle
to me that this app is only 499 and
there's plenty more we haven't shown in
this video so far I can't get enough of
GarageBand so I definitely recommend you
tap this app and tap it and tap it again
but try to tap and rhythm guys how are
we ever going to make it as a band if
you sorry I got a little caught up in
the moment like I said GarageBand is
only 499 in the iTunes App Store and
definitely worth your money even if you
only have a passing interest in creating
music that's it for today's show but if
you have any suggestions send them to
tap that app at cnet com i'm jason
parker thanks for watching that is a
pretty catchy tune the jason composed
not too shabby mr. Parker alright let's
go ahead and check out this week's
bottom line
when the ipad2 went on sale on Friday
Donald Bell immediately awarded it the
honor of an editor's choice
recommendation but I'm not going to talk
about that right now instead I want you
to focus your attention on an editor's
choice award winning mouse yes I said
mouse hi I'm rich brown senior editor
for cnet com today we're going to take a
look at the editors choice winning mad
catz cyborg rat 9 so this right here is
one of the most expensive gaming mice
we've ever seen it comes in at a hundred
and fifty dollars so it's definitely for
the more committed PC gamers out there
that said this is also on the most
customizable my soup ever seen and it's
also a great performer we recommend it
to anybody looking to spend a lot of
money on an input device for gaming so
the rat 9 comes with a lot of features
we expect and high-end gaming mice these
days as a 50 600 DPI laser sensor that
means it's very fast and very accurate
now this is a wireless mouse but mad
catz does sell wired version for a
little bit less now this button right
here lets you move through various DPI
settings so you can make the mouse more
or less sensitive as you're playing you
can also use the included driver
software to customize those settings so
you can really tweak the feel the mouse
to exactly how you'd like it let me flip
it over you can see down the middle here
there's a series of weights that come up
on this post you can actually unscrew
this cap here take the weights off and
set the weight of the mouse how you want
it that's actually a nice little feature
and it really helps sort of improve the
overall feel the mouse the cap of the
post actually doubles as an Allen wrench
which lets you adjust various points in
the mouse to really make it feel good in
your hand down the thumb side of the
mouth so you can use the allen wrench to
move this piece here either up and down
or you can loosen it so that it comes
out at an angle that gives you a better
position for your thumb potentially on
the two side buttons as well as a red
button here now this red button is
actually something we haven't seen
before the idea is that when you're
playing a shooting game you have a
sniper rifle so you want to run around
really quick to get a position you want
to have a nice fast cursor control so
you can see where you're going but then
when you zoom in on somebody you might
want a little bit better control so you
push that button you lowers the DPI the
laser sensor a little bit
you get better beat employer you're
trying to track now when you get to the
pinky side of the mouse you'll see that
there's another screw here you can use
the allen wrench to take this piece off
and mad catz includes two other pinky
pieces you can put in they have
different textures and different sizes
so lets you customize that side of the
mouse as well madcatz also includes a
carrying box so that you put all the
various pieces that you're not using a
side now for the last point of hardware
customization you can see the wrist rest
here there's a little tab on the bottom
push it in and you can slide the wrist
piece right off you get two other wrist
piece options two of them sit up a
little higher on this track once it's
closer to flush what's cool about this
track is that you can not only slide in
new risk pieces depending on the kind of
feel you want there you can also set
them to be longer or shorter so if
you've got a bigger hand or smaller hand
you can adjust the wrist piece so it
fits perfectly now rounding out the
mouse you've got a lateral scroll button
here that's actually serve an awkward
design it's not the most natural feel
kind of like logitech subversion where
there's a lateral scroll wheel built
into the main scroll to reveal a tilting
function but one thing we love about
this mouse is it actually comes the two
batteries so you can charge the second
one while you're using the other now it
comes with a charging station that also
acts as a USB receiver pop the battery
in there and this hole up here holds a
cylinder that holds extra weights when
you're not using them so there's a lot
going on with the rat 9 it's one of the
most customizable mice we've ever seen
it's got some features we've never seen
before and it also has great performance
it really sort of justifies $150 price
tag which is why we give it an others
Choice Award so I merge Brown this is
the Mad Catz cyborg rat 9 wireless
gaming mouse
the bottom line this week that is
awesome I don't even know what else to
say except I have to have one mouse all
right folks that's our show will be back
next week with a brand new edition of
seen at tech review until then there are
tons of great videos available every day
at cnet TV com see you next time and
