CNET's cracking open where we crack open
some of the best technologies that you
can find most interesting devices most
interesting stuff and we show you what's
inside so bill what are we gonna crack
open today yeah so today we have the
Polaroid snap touch instant digital
camera it's kind of a mouthful to say
right but it's a really cool device
basically we have a camera that's stuck
to a printer that allows you to get that
instant gratification after you take a
photo at a little bit and print out one
of these really cool I think 2 by 3 inch
prints that so you can hand out to your
friends
print multiple copies put them in a
scrapbook whatever you want to do it's
really kind of neat and we wanted to
find out how do you actually marry Oh
camera at a printer so now this takes
you back to that 1970s experience it's
where you have the instant gratification
of I've got one little device click the
shutter and immediately I get a little
print so we're gonna look at how they've
pulled that off right yep so on the
Polaroid snap touch this one makes what
makes it different than the Polaroid
regular Polaroid snap camera is it has a
touchscreen a little digital touchscreen
LCD on the back if we to start cracking
this open what we're gonna do and this
is how you load the paper we're gonna
open up the touchscreen here pappa so
that touch screen lets you edit the
photos that's right you can apply our
new filters you can select how many you
want to print out there are some minor
edits that you can make inside the
camera and we're going there's one small
screw now luckily this is a Phillips
just a regular Phillips it's very small
so this is a double zero or a triple
zero screwdriver so you can remove this
small screw like that and once that
comes out what we can do is we can
actually remove this plastic housing
this part of the plastic housing so
we're gonna start around here and
luckily this is gonna pop up it's gonna
pop open we're gonna be real gentle with
the plastic you can kind of see it's
already started
loose in there now that we have one of
the screw released there's just a single
screw and then we're gonna pop this
around again we're gonna be real pretty
gentle gentle and precise remember Bill
has the hands of a brain surgery and the
patients and mother Teresa so you gotta
really take it easy there we go not
force it and with that we can lift off
this piece of plastic housing and once
we do that we can see there are more
screws here here around the outer edges
of the cameras plastic shell that we can
that we need to remove so we're gonna go
ahead and remove the four screws one on
each edge and once we do this we should
be able to remove the front cover part
of the last eggshell and start getting
to the inside you know it's what's
really interesting about this camera is
the zinc as e-ink paper so this cameras
helps put out by CA marketing the
company the company that actually puts
the camera out it's just licensed under
the Polaroid Polaroid name the Z ink
paper is really kind of cool the
crystals that are embedded in the paper
actually clear and what happens is as
the printer applies heat they turn and
there there are different levels within
the paper yes they they turn different
colors based on the amount of heat
that's applied in the area and supplied
in so that's how it's able to print the
you know to print the pictures now once
we have the screws removed we can remove
the front cover again we're gonna be
real careful here I'm just using my
fingernails because mine are just pretty
strong and I'm not worried about
breaking them because they're they're
not really long so we had the plastic a
front cover separated here we've got it
separate from the print and we can just
lift that off and right now we get I set
that aside for right now and we get our
first look inside the camera and we can
already see some of the components
standing right out here we of course
have the battery pack over here we can
see the actual camera sensor right there
we can see the printer mechanism over
here on the left side here the camera
and we can see a few of the chips
already on one of the circuit boards
that are in here so excellent so we're
gonna go ahead and the first thing one
of the first things I almost like to do
with these devices is disconnect the
battery this is a fairly large battery
of course it has to power or store
enough power to power the flash the
capacitor that powers this flash but the
battery has to be kind of beefy we're
gonna be real careful not break the
battery we're gonna remove this first so
we can lift the battery right out like
this and then we're going to I'm gonna
stomp it out in I don't like to pull on
cables too much so I really want to get
close to the connectors we're going to
disconnect the battery here this one
actually happens to be an 88.1 for what
our 1,100 milliamp hour battery it's
seven point four volts pretty good size
battery we're gonna go ahead and we're
gonna start removing a few more screws
inside the device here virtually I'm
gonna try and take apart is we're gonna
remove the screws here from the main or
from one of the system boards that are
in here right while you're doing that we
could talk a little bit about what
people you know could use these devices
for this prints on two by three sheets
of paper as we've talked about and these
things again you don't have to buy any
ink no no ink you only buy the paper a
30-pack of these sheets is about 15
bucks on Amazon so here's about 50 cents
a photo which isn't bad considering
people are using these for marketing
purposes as well so if you have a
company event you can take a bunch of
these photos of people they're your
clients and then create a nice board
that you could have in your office after
the event we've seen some really
creative things that people have done
with these um this device retails at
about a hundred and eighty bucks yep
right but the regular time is about a
hundred bucks ninety nine this 179 Lux
and it's a 13 megapixel camera on great
when compared to a 10 megapixel camera I
believe on the regular snap okay it's
not the greatest of
cameras but it's good enough and it did
some fun pictures it does and that's so
that touch this device gets you a little
bit higher megapixel obviously a little
bit better quality camera and the
ability to not necessarily print
everything every to really be so more
selective of which things you want to
pray what printing beforehand that yeah
that's really what's helpful like you
said do some filters as beautiful
filters so where we got some of the
screws removed from the from them from
the camera what I call the camera board
here where we have to be really careful
there are a few of these what are called
flat flexible cables here and
unfortunately with these connectors
there isn't really a gate to flip up or
anything like that that I found and so
they're just sort of pressure fit in
there yeah got to be I want to be very
careful I don't want to tear the cables
I don't want to rip the cables so I use
a pair of yes these safe tweezers to
grip the cables trying not to grip it
trying to use my fingers or not grip it
in a manner that would fracture the
cable that we cut one of the wire leads
inside the cable be real careful and we
always learn a lot about these devices
when you do them but you're being
careful because we always try to take
them apart with an eye of putting them
back together in working order because
we know a lot of our our readers our
users viewers that they want to do the
same thing right that sometimes they're
taking these things apart to repair in
this case you know there's not really
you're probably not taking this device
apart to repair we're taking it apart to
learn more about the device and
understand it and I just wanted to see
how do you marry a camera and a printer
together into a single device right oh
that was really kind of cool sometimes
it's kind of like you know what is it a
Reese's Cup peanut butter and chocolate
together we want them to figure out that
you smash together a camera and a
printer this you can see here we've got
what I call the printer board out
because this is what's connected to the
printer printer assembly and it has the
control chips on it for the printer
assembly this is a synaptics what they
call their imaging smart
system-on-a-chip printer controller and
image processor and then it also has 64
Meg's
of ddr2 sdram on it as well so this is
the circuit board that actually prints
those images out to the printer assembly
which hangs off and a little bit below
that if I can turn it like this we're
gonna remove this here now if this is
the camera board below that and that's
what's responsible for taking the actual
photos right you can also see on here a
little memory card slot right there so
this does have I believe it has a little
bit of internal storage but obviously
you want to use a little micro SD memory
card there's we're about more storage
for photos so I've got the screws
removed and now what we're gonna do is
we're going to see if we can't lift the
camera control board out of here I might
have to I might have to remove the
printer module first make it a little
easier
so with this out of the way we can lift
this up I can also get to there we go I
can also get to a few of more flat
flexible ribbon cables where I was
talking about those we're gonna go ahead
and disconnect those so we can remove
the board there's one this one goes up
this one right here goes up to the the
flat are the the button and the flash
assembly up here the button control
assembly and then ah here's one
something that's really interesting
about this device so if we flip this
over this is the cable for the LCD
screen I'm going to take this apart and
I'm gonna separate it just like that
now a little admission here yeah I
actually crack this open for the scene
the upcoming summer episode of the C net
magazine and so we'd already cracked
open one of these and this is one of the
things that's really interesting about
cracking these open so this cable if the
cameras can get a really tight a close
shot of it this cable here ghost runs to
the LCD screen and it runs from the
camera board to the LCD screen on the
other camera that I took apart for the
CNET magazine there was a separate
contact that ran along the outside of
this cable that was soldered to the
board and so we actually even have the
solder gun sitting behind me that I was
ready to use to take this apart because
I kind of knew what was coming
this camera same camera Polaroid snap
touch
yeah there's no solder connection on it
so they had no clue so somewhere mid
production process the manufacturing
process actually changed they got a
different supplier they got you know a
newer version of this LCD screen which
didn't need that solder point yeah which
obviously is probably cheaper during the
manufacturing process because it takes
less time to do that kind of soldering
so anyway that's really interesting to
find that there's no solder point in
this magazine and that's one of the
reasons what we we've been doing this
all these years because even within the
same devices sometimes you find you
learn new things all right so with that
yellow we have the camera control board
pull off this little bit of sort of sort
of yeah thermal sticky there and there's
a couple of things that are really kind
of interesting we have the camera if I
want I can use one of my little plastic
tools and I should be able to I don't
think it's it's not soldered down to it
so we can pull this right off but right
and so you can see the camera right here
a little 13 megapixel camera this camera
shoots I think at it'll shoot 1080i
think I'll shoot 1080p
yeah it'll shoot 1080 Full HD video to
this obviously can't link the video but
it'll camera that would be very
innovative yeah if you can print a video
and here on the attached to the camera
control board here we have a couple
things they're kind of interesting to
talk about right here this is an eye
catch
technology camera sock or
system-on-a-chip there's another hundred
and twenty eight Meg macron ik's NAND
flash module that's up there
this this this internal storage lets you
store up to ten photos without using the
micro sd look like I said you need the
micro SD card if you want to store any
more than that and so some of the
smaller chips that are on here they're
really hard to see over on the back if I
flip this over here there is a is the 16
78s bluetooth dual mode sock on this
there is a speaker so you have a speaker
at the at the bottom you also have a
microphone here
that's pointed to the front to record
video and the microSD card slot for the
external memory card micro USB port yeah
and then you have a contact for the
reset button so they pack a lot onto
these little circuit boards because
that's the that's the brains of the
camera really right there and as you're
alluding to with this camera it's not
just for printing photos you can
actually save photos and video with this
device to watch later so it is a a
functional digital camera basic digital
camera as well and so we're now gonna
remove I open the back door so he it
comes out a little easier I was catching
on this little metal contact here and so
we're gonna remove the printer assembly
so here all as one piece we can actually
see the little zero ink printer assembly
as you were talking about yeah this is
basically a very printer assembly it's
essentially the same or training similar
to the one that's in the other Bluetooth
printer that just doesn't have the
camera mounted to the top of it yeah and
Polaroid zip which is also available for
$100 it's just basically like bill said
it's a bluetooth printer for your for
your phone pictures or tablet all right
so here we have another one of the
components that we have this is the
power button slash shutter release a
shutter release button contact yeah that
will set aside and then the last thing
to remove if you really want to you can
actually if this is the LCD screen right
here um when you see the last cable here
if we want to remove it it actually has
just two little pins in the side here
that I think they just pull out they're
not screws or anything they just pull
out like that one out you pull one of
them out and you can separate the LCD
here from the plastic body there's a
couple of springs
it'll fault that hold it that helped it
pop up yep and then the other pin is in
the other side they're just sort of
pressure fit with a little bit of a
little bit of an adhesive there to kind
of hold them in place and there you go
that's it that's all there is to it it's
yeah it was a really fun
because it was really interesting to see
how you can take a digital printer and
how you can marry that to a camera put
it all on together one package and
create a fun little device to use it's
cool because if you think about it you
know camera printer right there the rest
of this is sort of some brains to help
it function and pull it together you
know the touchscreen to help select your
pictures do a little bit of editing and
as we talked about their fun personal
uses even some business uses co-op with
this device as well so another
successful cracking open alright
remember you can find cracking open
photos for all of the devices we've torn
into on TechRepublic and you can see all
of our cracking open videos of all the
devices that we've done on CNET and cns
YouTube channel so leave us a note in
the comments if you have a device you'd
like to see us cracking open we're
always looking for something new to take
apart and learn about alright thanks for
watching we'll see you next time
