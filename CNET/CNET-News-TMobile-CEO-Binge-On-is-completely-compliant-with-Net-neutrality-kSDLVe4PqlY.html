raised and what this announcement was
yeah is this if this comply with net
neutrality is this comply with the
principles of which call for the equal
and fair treatment of Internet traffic
right so what do you say to those who
complain that this announcement isn't
necessarily you know doesn't really work
with net neutrality the answer is yes it
does it's a completely compliant our
position as a company is completely
supportive of free and open Internet and
jokingly I would say is the same people
that raised that think that breathing
the air is you know a violation of net
neutrality you're kidding
this is a I really look forward to
having this topic I think that t-mobile
and all of what we do probably the most
pro competition innovation Pro net
neutrality things and remember in this
case especially no one's paying squat
the subscribers aren't paying the
companies have we're not slowing things
down and there's a little switch there
how can consumer choice be any bigger
than yes no and so music I think the
bigger issue is you know the technical
requirements to be compliant with your
program is it something that's feasible
for a small business trying to get into
the video absolutely yeah all we need
from a potential collaborator here's a
little bit of information okay I guess
the technical requirements while they
might be you know a page-long
boil down to this we need to be able to
reliably understand what's video and
what's not so that we can zero rate the
video and so it's going to be a pretty
light touch it's just like music freedom
and you know when we started music
freedom we had eight providers now we
have providers representing more than
95% of all music being streamed in the
United States so over time we were able
to touch companies large and small right
and integrate them but we expect it to
be the same here I'll just add to what
John said which is you know on this
issue our company just really believes
passionately in the power of the
individual and in protecting that
individual from you know the the greed
of the mega corpse and if you think
about you know the internet is supposed
to be free and open it's supposed to be
something where everybody's got a level
playing field where they can access
content from companies large and small
those those are the principles behind
net neutrality so we're you know we're
doing this because we believe in that
you know democratization of access so
you know I play a favorite time binge on
is all about access and openness do you
know who I think can meet the technical
requirements anybody that wants to I
mean really it doesn't that easy
yeah and by the way if if it if it was
proven not to be a we'd adapt but yeah
III think we believe it's anybody who
anybody who wants to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
