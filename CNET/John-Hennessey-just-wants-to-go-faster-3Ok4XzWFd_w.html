mean there's so many neat cars that come
from the factories whether it's in
Detroit or out of Europe or Japan and
many of these cars interest me
personally from the standpoint that you
know if the new Corvette comes out with
460 horsepower than 6 50 or 70
horsepower would even be better almost
all of our clients come to us for
horsepower that's they want their car to
go faster they want to have a better
sound they want to have a more exciting
vehicle to drive and I know there's a
lot of shops out there that do other
things but all about the power and
performance that's something that that
inspires me and gets me excited and and
that's the same thing with our clients
at any given time we have about 60 cars
in a shop I'd say a third or forward
products a third our GM chevrolet
cadillac products and a third or just a
smattering of everything else and then
the venom is something that's completely
different than then the 10 cars a week
that we modified
the story in the venom is back in two
thousand seven road track magazine did a
cover story called speed kings and it
was a shootout to see which supercar
could go from zero to 200 miles per hour
in a shortest amount of time anyway so
the variety of cars also be gotti event
on their 16.4 not the super sport and at
the indian we brought a twin-turbo viper
venom 1000 viper at the end of the event
we were about four seconds faster the
tuner miles per hour and we beat the
Veyron in that particular competition
and afterwards we thought hey this is
great but I thought what's next what can
we do to go faster and I thought just
adding horse powers and all this always
the answer what can we do the build a
lighter car so we joked about well if we
took like a lotus elise or neck siege
took out the little 4-cylinder engine
out of the back and put that thousand
plus horsepower twin-turbo viper engine
in it the v10 I passed a joke along to
an artist i said look once you sketch me
up something i want to see what that
looks like you seem to give me the
sketches i'm like wow i think i think we
could build that car that's really cool
so not really having any game plan on
how to market or how to tell people
about it we always at the SEMA Show and
I had some prints of the of the
renderings and a guy from Jalopnik came
up and suck a camera in my face and says
hey Hannah see what's new and I pulled
out my renderings and shut him to him
and they went on the internet a few days
later and so this is like seven years
ago and two weeks later some guy from
the Middle East calls me up and says hey
I want to order a car by the time we
couple years later when we delivered the
car he paid his million for the car but
it cost us over three to develop it so
we so we got into a situation where I'm
like you know now we're fully committed
if we have to sell more cars and so
again there was no real business plan to
this there's no marketing plan to it it
was just kind of a crazy idea that it
turned into a reality once the card
became a reality then I'm like you know
I want this car to be the fast it's not
just to talk about being the fastest or
I want to have maximum horsepower
minimum weight so the venom has 244
horsepower weighs 12 and 44 kilo such a
little over 2,700 pounds
and we recently set the world's fastest
record for a road-legal vehicle at 270
point 4 miles per hour the idea all
along was not just to build a cool car
powerful car but but to but to show that
the venom is the fastest
from 0 to 60 it does that in under three
seconds but the car really shines from
60 to 200 plus because it just gets her
so incredibly quick you're definitely
have a power and attraction ratio
limitation so you know veyron super
sport is going to be the venom the 60
and it would probably be fairly close
even to 100 miles per hour but beyond
100 there's just no there's just no
competition from the standpoint at the
venom the track the vehm has traction
control so the traction control does not
stop working at full power till about
140 miles per hour if you watch our 270
run you can hear the car you can hear
the traction control just fighting to
keep the keep it the tires hooked up and
right when you pull into fourth gear and
hit it in the fourth gear you've got
enough downforce on the back of the tire
to where you don't have any more
traction control at that point you have
full power the venom and 140 miles per
hour is pulling one point four G's of
acceleration the Veyron Super Sport from
a standing start with all-wheel drive
pulls 1.1 g of acceleration at five
miles an hour and 140 we're pulling a
1.4 geez
the guise of you gotti I mean they've
got the resources or I'm sure they'll
come out with the car that just as fast
or faster at some point so it's a it's a
good thing we I had a really nice chat
with the Wolfgang door hi Marie
yesterday at the quail and the the
chairman and president Bugatti and and
where I guess we're kind of like we're
friendly competitors but we're kind of
kindred spirits that I told him I said
woof getting we will we were only able
to do what we did because you would set
the bar so high you know and so it's
kind of fun for us to be a little bit
ahead of them and knowing that they're
probably going to come back and and in
you know raise the bar higher so you
know to for the bar to go higher and for
cars to go faster you have to have the
competitive rivalry and the guys at
mclaren ferrari porsche they build some
incredible cars with the p1 the 91 a la
ferrari but those manufacturers have
said Thomas P doesn't matter to us and
that's okay and they build great cars
you know but for our brand and for the
Bugatti guys there's something special
about being able to say you're the
fastest so we'll take it as long as we
can as we can hold that up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
