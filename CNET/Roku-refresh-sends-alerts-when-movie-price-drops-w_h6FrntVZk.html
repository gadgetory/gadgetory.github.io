Carey and this is your cnet update the
roku is Cena's favorite video streaming
machine and two of the boxes are getting
a revamp and there are also some new
software features the new roku 3 is
available now for one hundred dollars
and with it comes the ability to search
for shows with your voice using a
microphone on the remote control you
just have to press a button to activate
the voice search and the system will
hunt for titles across 17 different
services it lays out the results by
price voice search is only available in
the US for now the new roku 2 for
seventy dollars has a speed upgrade so
it'll run similar to the roku 3 but this
version doesn't have a remote with a
headphone jack and that lets you watch
TV without the volume bothering anyone
else in the room but only the three has
that another software perk that comes to
all current models is something called a
roku feed you can follow a new movie
title and get updates when that movie is
available to stream and if the price
drops you get another notification
that's something no other streaming
device can do and if you have an older
model roku and you want voice search you
can still do it but through your
smartphone using a Roku remote app for
iOS and Android and that's not all in
streaming news HBO now the new fifteen
dollar a month service for watching HBO
without a cable subscription is offered
by sling TV so it's not just Apple
gadget owners that can stream from the
app in time for the game of thrones
premiere on sunday to watch it on sling
you have to also subscribe to the
twenty-dollar base package of channels
and then pay another fifteen dollars for
HBO sling is accessible from your
computer the roku Amazon fire TV Xbox
one as well as Android and Apple mobile
devices but sling may have some trouble
keeping up with demand the company's
Twitter account posted an apology to
customers that couldn't watch the march
madness basketball semifinals do too
choppy or broken feeds sling says it was
due to extreme demand but that engineers
have been working to handle the load
even as it works out the kinks sling
continues to expand its offerings a few
days ago it added more than 200
international channels in 18 different
languages there's a new form of
technology that's coming to televisions
that's perhaps better than these
streaming devices I'm talking of course
about the new domino's app for samsung
smart tvs you can reorder something
recent or place a preset easy order from
the couch and you can see your Pais
progress to your door with Domino's
tracker on the bottom of the TV screen
Domino's also has apps to order a pie
with your voice from your car with ford
sync or you can use an app on the
android wear and pebble smartwatch and
this is clearly the best reason to own a
SmartWatch that's your tech news update
