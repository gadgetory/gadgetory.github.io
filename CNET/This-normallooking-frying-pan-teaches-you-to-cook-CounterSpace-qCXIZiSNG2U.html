New York Times story from 1983 reached a
conclusion that a good cook requires an
abiding passion for the task courage to
go out on a limb and an impeccable sense
of balance I think some people have a
natural knack for cooking and others not
so much you guys needed a moustache long
haired hipster for this cooking shoot so
I'm here
but what if technology could bridge that
gap between passion and expertise the
technology exists in ovens apps and even
a frying pan
it's called pant elegent the inside of
the pan there's a temperature sensor
essentially what it does is it connects
to an app with bluetooth and that app
will tell you when you need to raise the
temperature or lower the temperature of
the burner on which you're using the pan
telogen the goal of it is to maintain a
really even steady temperature and in
the end it results in near-perfect
dishes
smart kitchen equipment like pant
elegent want to make it easy to make
complex staples so things like risotto
salmon and state can be something that
any person can cook for a weeknight
dinner skin side up that's weird
I saw that on there on the upcoming
steps and I thought it was weird but I'm
gonna do it
it really does go a long way in terms of
teaching you just how to be aware of
what you're cooking how important
surface temperature is when you're
cooking those are the things that are
important to learn how to do before you
move on to the more complicated stuff so
pay intelligent can give you a little
bit more confidence to try to cook more
if you come out with something that's
awesome
you can't really take that much credit
for it because I didn't really do
anything she just tells me to turn a
knob up or down that's small increments
but on the flip side of that I feel like
the next salmon I cook without this pan
will be better pant elegant did a great
job at making this somewhat complex dish
really easy for an average cook but it's
expensive 130 dollars is a high price to
pay for a frying pan even if it's smart
not to mention it's pretty chatty
however cooking confidence is priceless
in which case smart learning devices
like the intelligent might be worth the
splurge good there we go here's I'm
cooking right now I'm just gonna turn
this BAM I'm a chef now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
