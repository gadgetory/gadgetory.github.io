company's newest flagship tablet finally
replacing the infinity tf700 from 2012
the new tablet looks a lot like the old
one with only a few small refinements
that most people probably won't even
notice it's still a well-designed tablet
but honestly feels slightly dated with
it's extra wide bezels and it's
relatively hefty 1.3 pound weight at
least compared it to a few recent
tablets still includes a microSD card
slot micro HDMI port a 1.2 megapixel
front camera and the 5 megapixel rear
camera the front camera is pretty grainy
but the rear one isn't bad but it's
definitely not the best I've seen
recently however I do appreciate some of
the Samsung inspired features included
in the camera software the keyboard dock
will cost you an extra 150 bucks and
includes a USB 3.0 hole size SD card
slot and an extra battery however it
feels a bit cramped to type on compared
to say the Microsoft Surface tues type
cover the tablet ships with Android 4.3
and includes a few useful issues only
customizations like its custom pulldown
menu as well as a Sears branded apps
like splendid which lets you adjust
screen color temperature saturation and
cue other issues apps like file manager
and app Locker which adds password
protection to your apple choice are
useful as well the screen has a high
2560 by 1600 resolution and makes texts
and games look sharp however the screen
unfortunately doesn't get as bright as
previous tablets in this line even with
the extra bright mode turn on
there's a 1.9 gigahertz Tegra 4 inside
so gaming performance is definitely
smooth also navigating around the OS
delivered no hiccups or pitches and apps
loaded pretty quickly the 701 T starts
at four hundred and forty nine dollars
with 32 gigabytes of storage that's a
pretty good price for a tablet that's
pretty much running pure Android has a
sharp screen great performance and a
bunch of useful software and features
sure its design feels a bit data at this
point but the performance and features
kind of make up for that check out my
