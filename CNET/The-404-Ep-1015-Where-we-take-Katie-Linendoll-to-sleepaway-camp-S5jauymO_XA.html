for sure that's really cool I love
awesome guest right I love Austin all
the difference for sure not clearly look
what's happening now and everybody's a
geek now so you can pretty much have
anyone you want on the show you were
telling us before we started today that
you have a very geeky past which i think
is awesome yeah I want to hear more
about your geeky past like catches up to
speed we're how did Katie get here I've
been a nerd my whole life yeah so I had
my networking certs at 17 oh really it
was actually really bad so like in high
school like all my friends were like you
know in glass blowing class and like
cheerleading squad I was like on the
civil war club electrical wiring hurting
my network soldering you know and I was
just like I'm just doing my face yeah
always been involved in more of the
hardware side for sure and I got my
degree in IT new media from Rochester
has to technology was big into coding I
can still heavily code really you still
do that now it's hard because I've moved
so consumer-focused she's like I say now
it's a full-time job and you know this
to stay on top of Technology and all the
sites like forget it yeah just in the
consumer world alone full time job but
yeah I second code and go kick it I'm
impressed me although the chat room is
freaking out right now I think they just
want the camera on you full time with
you it's gonna do that MIT we have to
forgive us our chat room is you know
they they're a little aggressive that's
why we you know have limited access to
areas can't you know will will censor
that whole thing your arm that's really
cool what uh so you've done a lot of
work with the other outlets before so I
after school after I got my degree and
IT I started working for ESPN 2 i've
always been huge into sports in tech i
might be a boy I don't know what's going
no I'm pretty sure that's nice it's not
cake but i'll have a lot of boys
interest yeah so i started hosting a
show on espn2 in New York and then from
there I became fascinated with the
production side of things so i went to
ESPN headquarters in bristol connecticut
right I worked with ESPN for four years
I worked I toured with Sports Center all
over the country it's awesome I was
cutting highlights for berman on and if
the live NFL primetime outside the lines
on be a fast break baseball tonight I
worked on all those shows yeah for years
yeah um and then I went I kind of got
the experience and needed watched
learning from likes to Scott and Berman
about what and what not to do on camera
I knew that I had to work behind the
scenes to get back on air right like
learn from the best and then go back on
air for sure so then eventually I worked
after working for ESPN for 25 years I
went and hosted a show on A&amp;amp;E called we
mean business I did tech makeovers real
I was kind of my parlay back here so how
did that work I worked you Bill Rancic
bill really honest Giuliana Rancic yeah
news yeah he and I hosted a show on A&amp;amp;E
it did really well was emmy-nominated
what yeah he did all the business side I
did all the tech side and then my friend
Peter gursky did all the interior design
so we went into some
businesses did huge makeover and it was
so interesting ease our for struggling
companies that were you know trying to
live this American Dream and a million
dollars quarter million dollars in debt
and we were trying to read I do is
redoing all their technology and Dell
was a sponsor of the show so I had
access to anything that I needed that
was an amazing experience from there at
this is the crazy one in my career I
went to HSN for two years I swear their
story I one is their gadget girl and
sold electronics and like they brought
me in to do like a more softer
entertainer e-type sell yeah and ice kid
you not dirty let me tell you something
let me lighten you with how the home
shopping network works go on it's really
hard what yeah five cameras you're
somebody in your ear at all times yeah
and you see this sign of when people are
calling it in buying things I was
selling everything for GPSS two TVs two
routers to you name it cameras digital
camcorders and you see when people are
calling in and you have no script you
your script is in your head yeah don't
the dome you'd be like selling your soul
out for like a new gateway computer it
would be like four in the morning like
sold five haha I mean it would be like
for like what did I say to have somebody
for children returned like somebody
called back within the 30 said you know
what this Katie persons time me no thank
you exactly it was crazy to me so best
on-camera experience ever all live I
think there's any money's gonna fill to
write a million dollars what a nice
sauce something there I was run at my
runway they call it a run rate i was
making like twenty eight hundred dollars
a minute whoa not me personally but you
say they were selling that much while
you were on air right and that was like
an average so at last count so anyways
from there i did that i was doing a nu
back and forth then i went to CNN where
I've been for last two and a half years
for two to three days a week yes cover
everything very vast from robotics did
you know so do you know our buddy mark
million I think I've never met him I
think he did leave CNN yeah you see me
there he was there for about two years
yeah yeah the tech editor yeah he's very
cool I always read a lot of good people
but great people yes you know for sure
CNN's to the early show for two years
right a little late Burke is little here
and they
our own our own little CBS come they're
very cool good dirty circle no and then
the last stop on your road to success
the forum where you hit rock bottom man
that's awesome oh wow I feel like we
don't need to read the book now yes I
know every that's awesome this is really
cool we got guess we got the whole story
I'm very excited uh there's a few things
you want to talk about today yeah and
our little rundown let's get right into
it Angry Birds Uub crutches that with
the gift for us that was awesome angry
birds space is on the horizon come in
this week and uh it's interesting
because actually had an astronaut
preview the game yeah is that correct
yeah i think it was uh Don Pettit he was
like the nasa flight engineer that was
too gimmicky I thought it was a little
gimmicky but just to see the antigravity
it's kind of cool really cool yeah i
mean you didn't really make me want to
play the game is thank you that's a
great question though is it gimmicky are
you were you see an astronaut yeah wrote
isn't he supposed to discover the cure
for science I got on a planet somewhere
you should be busier than that yeah well
uh so anyway whether i don't i feel like
nasa has become one of these entities
where they're just like so desperate for
residence what did it deep through a
mass effect up in space today yeah they
did something like that too i think they
did they launched it into space and
whoever got it whenever kicking down all
right i got it straight all right there
really are we brainstorm with the next
one is they have a good PR team though
because i remember last year we talked
about how they sent up their last
consumer flight uh up into space their
last shuttle i think this is something
that will maybe get kids a little more
excited about nasa put it in their heads
whoa if you get more astronauts later in
the future how did nasa screw this up
though think about it every kid in
kindergarten what do you wanna be when
you grow up an astronaut would it be
cool bet i don't know i want to be vodka
you know they want to be a reality star
yeah that's what it they want to be some
sort of junkie that's not a lot of it uh
yeah i don't i don't know how did they
lose that how did they lose the pure
imagination of a child right and now
NASA is just sort of in the dumps
blocking my mind more is that angry
birds is still hugely popular that's
what blew my mind yeah
jeck turi was my namita because here
Angry Birds I'm like isn't that a little
played out yeah isn't everybody done
with that Ashley it's on the up-and-up
yeah 700 million downloads 6.5 million
alone on Christmas Day that to me is
mind-numbing and then I was showing you
that angry birds cookbook yeah is a
snapshot of the much bigger picture 200
licensees right movie set for 2014 an
angry birds theme park so there is a
movie coming there is a movie cut and
they've actually tapped a lot of the
Marvel crew so they got people behind it
allegedly I'm not mad at the movie
because i think the Angry Birds brand
bake like once you give these guys
voices you know it's gonna I hope it's
you know funny people like make I don't
know who to make up the red bull guy but
I'm just saying like yeah you know what
I'm said like they could do it good i
feel like Jack Black's gonna be one of
them will be like will be like the bong
guy you know I mean I I just feel like
insert real big celebrities into these
and it'll work and then the pigs are led
by like I don't know John Lithgow yeah
you know I mean I don't know if the
rovio brand has jumped the shark yeah
yeah I did it definite I mean in terms
of still growing like that that's the
craziness that's I feel like part of
jumping the shark is that jumping the
shark while I feel like you and I we
understand it to be like okay it's
headed to run it's no longer cool but
that's not for the rest of the world you
know what I mean like the rest the world
has yet to have their time there's also
never been another iOS game I feel like
the life cycle for those games are like
they're so easily digestible that in
another week you know something new is
come out like words of friends that's
gone awesome now it's drawn something
you know like I'm surprised that angry
birds has been out for so long it's are
you gonna download it tomorrow he comes
out right 20 20 seconds I can I think
yeah cuz you said you got a new iPad I
do have a new iPad and it's gonna look
really pretty on that side hey who's
busy pretty crispy on that HD yeah I
don't know though I I don't know I think
so there's new gameplay obviously with
all zero gravity thing right oh I was
reading this morning to that walmart if
you purchase merchandise at walmart
they'll give you little unlocks mmm
exclusive to walmart oh my gosh so now
you have two hundred licensees but now
you're also pushing people to go to
walmart to try to unlock levels
uh it's but hey at the end of the day if
you had an estimated worth of what 1.2
billion right no no for sure the proofs
in the pudding let's be honest people
people can't get enough these angry
birds I remember we're at CS one year
they had like an angry birds board game
example ever met it resembled like
mousetrap yeah that sort of deal I've
also been seeing a lot of angry birds
branded candy in Bodie around knew you
guys seen that a little bodies what
that's so crazy to me that it's expanded
into all different markets it's
unbelievable uh let's move along Airbnb
your GV which we covered we covered a
story from airbnb I was a four months
ago over the guys that like trash that
oh yeah this is last summer 2011 yeah so
uh they buy crash patter its largest
competitor in the UK what does this mean
I mean you have experience with Airbnb I
do have experience I again I think just
in terms of trajectory I don't I was
surprised at a consumer level and in
talking with people that a lot of people
still don't know what Airbnb it yeah I
feel like I don't really have that much
of a marketing uh did I don't know Brian
said were they auctioned off their set
for I think you guys all those women
just rented it out slept there overnight
big that's all they did they didn't have
a party around an empire they literally
just left there while the show was not
doing this is poor decision yeah I'm not
comfortable at all but I do feel like
more and more people are starting to
figure out what Airbnb is I kind of like
hopes I mean by the numbers yeah yeah
192 countries frightened cities five
million down of 5 million nights nights
that's five million guest nights
downloaded yeah that's our brains were
sisters if it's not a tech buzz word I
don't know that's not a 0 or a 1 4g LTE
3d that's all I know so what was your
experience with there being but I
actually like Airbnb but I actually like
it for there's two things I like it for
when i do on air segments i like to
touch the quirky cuz you can rent at
pretty cheap you can rent an island in
fiji for 350 night oh there's a mushroom
dome in california that i will mark my
words be staying at ninety dollars a
night it's nothing castles in ireland
for like 300 400 at night castles all
over yeah the quirky side of it like
boats and that you can actually stay
first day or a week or a month whatever
you want to me is like that's an awesome
officer like really cool if you're going
on like a date or something whatever
with your dude your girl whatever I like
the quirky side of it but I've also used
a deluxe I go back and forth from San
Francisco like all the time yeah and i
use it out there and it's actually
worked out really well so i sublet a
place um it's pretty cheap compared to a
hotel the only thing it for me is like
the downside is you have to check in and
you're checking in with this random
person that you don't know what you're
up against right in like cha cha cha cha
attention and I'm like a to be yeah I
don't want to chat like never gonna see
you again right just tell me where the
shampoo is salad yeah also there so
that's that's only downside to me it's
like the pizza delivery guy want to like
hang out for a little bit like my bid
good party that is also that the per the
host wants to know who's gonna be
staying in their house with that stuff
like it's kind of in the interview yeah
well and I feel like that's where the
profile comes in I like that there's
profiles and reviews on both sides but i
have to tell you the one time i was
staying there and the chick calls me and
she's like um PS i gotta come back i
forgot something like three days in and
I'm like okay hey lingo mean yeah this
week this has been my place for 72 hours
yeah no go like this is weird yeah so I
yet I love the pluses but I also see the
minuses yeah have you rented your
apartment out to other absolutely not I
feel like everyone's done to stay that
someone else's but that was never I know
people that are making like five g's a
month yeah B&amp;amp;B so will your kiss oh yeah
for sure yeah that makes George stop
yeah so many gadgets like forget it I
don't want anybody touching it and mess
with my business I heard a lot of people
made money in Austin last week dirty so
I'm sorry I'm writing up their lines an
Airbnb hell yeah I would literally have
to glue everything to the floor take
pictures of every solution that skeeves
me out well you have 50,000 insurance as
a host not as I got enough no no no it's
not even the money for me it's like I
don't want you need you touching my
stuff on the OCD yeah sure you know junk
in my junk well I'm in my bed yeah what
you sleeping in my bed what you doing
what you do I'm not
yeah me to do in my bed my dungeon i

three friends every single day uh-huh
and then fifty percent of everything
wait time out is that like the same
thing with the little uh the beeper they
give you to cut the line in the rides
and kaplan I've I have not graduated to
that level to know about the beeper do
you know about that sort of stuff i
dunno some conspiracy stuff but whether

you don't cares anymore that's funny
guys well this is real 22 I know you
2015 that's way too long very much
expect it might be out on in 3d blu-ray
by that yeah he knows they'll have a
reboot by then oh my god speaking of
reboots have you uh you you know the
controversy with teenage mutant ninja
turtles yeah you guys are really upset
yeah we seem to be upset about that we
kind of pick and choose what we get mad
at so a caller actually let me play this
call because this is totally appropriate
for the conversation we're having sort
of calls us out and he's not totally
wrong good hey guys California finish on
your left a pleasure talking about the
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and tigers
are just displayed with Michael Bay's um
new idea of making them aliens but I
thought it kind of interesting that uh
you guys are getting all worked up and
saying oh it shouldn't happen when you
know you talk about a video game and
then people do the same thing for that
because like all I know they stick to
their artistic licenses and these people
need to get alive all right now there is
a different historical context thank you
explain I mean what you were talking
about with the whole mass effect
controversy right right so ever all
these people are up in arms out by our
change the ending no you don't change
the ending like we said that's like
asking Christopher Nolan to change the
dark night right you know no you can't
do that and mass effect isn't a 30-year
franchise that's been you know it's
garnered music fans across the world
exactly a little bit different scale
hundred percent ninja turtles are an
established story that everyone has
agreed on right who's the sewer the
mutation you would abuse what ya weeks
probably no no no I'm listening I went
into panic mode when there was a caller
first off
my HSN experience I thought somebody's
gonna ask you about the process or the
cost of the product how many colors it
comes in so I kind of spaced out
allotted use credit cards and I space
back in and now I'm listening okay sorry
to throw you off like that right now
it's all good so that's really funny so
uh I mean what he's like art do you
understand it Charles fan growing up I
was a big april O'Neil fan oh yeah that
says anything oh yeah yeah I guess I
guess you guys are very passionate about
it yeah well he's just trying to call us
out and he's saying oh how can you
complain about mass effect 3 not
changing when you're upset about Michael
Bay changing Ninja Turtles and it's
different because people bought the
video game first and then we're upset
with a sanding selling we're going to
the movie and asking for a refund made I
mean look our track record at judging
things before they come out pretty bad
yeah we're real bad we're about we're
about you know not joking with the
avatar yep we thought I would talk
seriously said that like you thought
those you see this pile of garbage we're
like oh look at this movie looks like a
halo cut ya knows it I mean I like
shatters it like just shatters
everything completely change i Gress too
much but how about beetlejuice coming
back at ya we match that's siamo and not
a reboot right that's why we said we're
okay with the Katie because it's going
to be an F 26-year evolution right and
that is fine and you're gonna get Tim
Burton behind the reins and also uh
Michael Keaton right come on it is bad
the fact that it's not a reboot I don't
think we'll take away from the original
movie for sure it's not gonna it's like
you can't destroy Beetlejuice one if you
make a crappy beetlejuice 2 yeah that's
what I'm gonna just lie to myself and
tell myself that's how I'm gonna sleep
at night I mean man you see Alec Baldwin
and Beetlejuice and you see him on 30
rock how is that the same guy yeah it's
not amazing I mean he's still
devastatingly handsome but I just think
like it should look like two different
people boys good boys it took me a
second after I've seen it like 42 dude
yeah that's him how I mean Adam Maitland
right how old is he and build you yeah
oh no 30mm right that movies about 26
years old yeah so he's gotta be in if
he's got to be close to 50 maybes a
little younger I don't know man oh man
still good look crazy stuff eat any way
you slice it makes us feel old yeah
that's all it comes down to
with you on that you know all right Girl
Scout time girls and girls go bringing
the girls go finally can I do before we
get to the Girl Scout the story of
actual content okay have you seen the
girl scout cookies this year yeah or
there's a new thing right well there's
the Savannah Smiles like the healthy
option yeah what is it like like with
that I'm gonna table that for 26 letters
it's just lettuce with chocolate on it
organic grass-fed what would I explain
it the portion size of the box this year
is like it's like hey America you're all
fat yeah I mean no wonder the girl
scouts have unlimited funding like for
thin mints yeah like the Samoa Oh three
boxes yeah put those in the refrigerator
and destroy that do minute Ella but the
tagalongs do taxes the peanut butter
ones those are good look at me like i
have ten heads crap dude peanut butter
and chocolate are the is the greatest
combination in the history of flavors
although i will say they're better than
like the shortbread you know that the
tree oils there is anywhere hammering
there's a warehouse somewhere before
where there is all those shortbread jobs
is that no one's ever bought because no
one gives a crap about that made out of
the cardboard box it comes in are they
made of real girl scale no but seriously
tagalongs where it's a good I mean let
let's be on and all other small ozark MO
kinda girl FEMEN is good after dinner
break I gotta use the end you know
there's a nap yeah the girl scout cookie
finder I boats about to bring that up
macho I used it as I was I thought it
was gonna be an actual Center where you
could buy girl scout cookies from girl
scouts it took me to a business on the
west side it was seriously like an
office and I guess anybody can sign up
for this and say that they are selling
girl scout cookies for their daughter
yeah yeah and so I went it was in the
back of this corporate office and I had
to just go through all these we actually
went through it I went through it
because I couldn't find any places on
tenth Avenue and thirty seventh street
in a corporate office and I way through
that is so we buy it from a dad like an
individual guy like how you're in the
fabric district really bad girls get
some bad really worth it really worth it
why is that though the eight girls yeah
yeah
and the girl scouts are using they're
not using square but a comparable what
they use it I don't know Oh her to pay
yeah I'm telling you there buddy went
high-tech film rebe thumbprint can you
Thelma's twenty dollars back to tag
along the reason we bring up the Girl
Scouts is because there's a new badge
called the netiquette pledge badge love
that portmanteau yes for the past
hundred years the whole scouts honor
thing is now redefined right what
exactly are these people saying is
appropriate like what are the
requirements for acquiring the
netiquette bad so they basically need to
take something called an Internet safety
pledge is about that for an internet but
the national center for missing children
so it's legit important that kids
understand the same for glory Kevin
Friday's coming good come out like a
segment nothing good can come you I
don't know started rattling off like a
positive statistic you're a god so
stupid are you so dumb yeah myself holy
English people yeah alright so such as
well try and find the one glimmer of
hope in this artist do me a favor turn
off your mic while we're talking so this
is similar to the internet Scout badge
for Boy Scouts that we talked about last
year but this is basically five tenets
that these Girl Scouts need to follow
one is I won't spam other than I just
gotta buy this is actually really good
advice yeah I understand what time out
that's number one that's wrong number
one is now shall not spam but here's the
thing you know all right the whole basis
of selling girl scout cookies is
spamming people like a good spamming
people in real life to buy things sure
might not necessarily want your point
right its total advertising it should
say in parenthesis except every year
when it's freaking girl scout cookies
BAM we yeah number two number two I will
not bully nor will I tolerate bullying
perfectly the angle I can jump on board
with that yeah I'd be positive no no
boys I am NOT a bully you would never be
a Girl Scout in high school of school
like grade school wasn't a bully no
didn't stand for bullying of course not
turned in hockey I'm not the bully guy
on the team I'm like get along let's get
along and have fun and play hockey to
God well that's like the wrong place to
be the ghetto yeah exactly there's
nothing else
hockey everybody wants to fight all
right maybe but um you know I see the
silver I'm not over there let him finish
the commando sorry the scene that bully
giving everyone know jeez around the
office give everyone oh man can you go
on number three I will follow the rules
of internet sites including those based
on age of use these don't look at porn
parental approval and knowledge and
public laws all right that that's kind
of someone right out of that one but go
on number 4 i'll never agree to get
together with someone i quote unquote
meet offline it's good without first
checking with my parents or guardians
okay oh we're googling their name for
itself yeah number five I wasn't a
person my picture anything else without
first checking with my parents or
guardians those are the five
Commandments of the Girl Scouts like
snoozefest I don't know I feel like
numbers three four and five are all the
same yeah don't talk to anyone online
but once they've passed this and they
take this pledge right they get the bed
yeah we've added something to this no I
wouldn't have at it I just feel like I'm
all for Internet safety girl scouts why
can't we make it a little cooler okay my
god sounds really nerdy to me okay so
what are your single I i I'd have to
brainstorm about a badge for like
getting more girls involved in like
mechanical engineering or like coding
put IT certification IT certification
like are you sure you nitey like yeah
I'm interested in science and technology
lets not like I don't know I'd come at
it differently oh i'm with you i think i
think your idea is better but uh I mean
look I don't have an a solid idea right
now I'm just stating my opinion with
like this is a nerdy approach this is a
very like predatory kind of like
paranoia inducing yeah that have rules
to write there's meant to scare girls
automation be scarcely in fear mongering
going on uh I don't know yeah I do not
know oh I like the Boy Scout so I think
last year we talked about their
geocaching badge and I guess they would
be given gps navigation Zand they will
be taught how to geocache I think that's
a more interesting way to go about
teaching people technology not yeah like
doing something yes let's teach
something for billions on let's do it
were you a girl scout I was a growth no
no I was a brownie ah that's where we
girls of brownie
pre girl scout all right that's what the
wii blows for the Boy Scout write the
Weibo yeah it's called that you worked
for those badges too yeah can I just
like interject for a second year me
making me think about like that badge
earning that was intense like when I was
little kids are gonna iPads now ipod
touches they get like expensive stuff
like i had to win like six science fairs
get like 64 kranz with a built-in she
liked it or brought a brownie batter
right what a problem nowadays yeah that
was the pinnacle of achievement oh my
gosh my mom would sew it on yeah all
proud and whatnot what happened yeah I
don't know if these damages don't want
that badge they want that in the
computer yeah yeah a trapper keeper
isn't gone drew is what do you do you
think that's doing to us I think it's
good and bad I think that's like a whole
other conversation because i will tell
you working with like younger kids with
the ipad and some of the games that
they're playing and really getting an
education he would sound so cheesy i
have seen it firsthand and i'm amazed by
it yeah but in terms of this entitlement
in want like I'm all against that that
urn sure yeah like do you feel like
that's changed a little bit it's a whole
other conversation sure I mean I do
think I do think it's okay for parents
to incentivize their kids sure because
that's how the real world works and you
get rewarded if you do good stuff so I
think that's cool um but I'm not like
these big sort of thing you know like if
I was 11 with an iPad like week I can't
even imagine that just all that my
biggest you know possession was like a
JanSport like back then you were like I
was the you were the crap like you
that's where you were a pencil box are
you kidding me you know that was the big
thing it was like stationery why was it
stationary why are we it's all like if
you had like status symbol gold and
silver crayons you're like yes yes happy
in fact the iphone is the 64 crayon box
of our time it totally is that's well
put number it had like the pencil
sharpener in the mag DePiano who was the
best yeah kids don't know these they
don't know what they got kids don't
appreciate anything no they all i gotta
do is tap a crayon and then they're
drawing with their finger and that's it
let's get a life oh when I hate kids I
hate children let's go beat up a girl
scout let's let's get
a few of our uh rest of our calls today
we got some and I know Katie wants to
talk a little bit about the ipad so one
of these will lead into that show the
love a jig 6404 cnet all right calls
from the public time don't worry no
one's buying anything okay was so Sifl
and Olly if that's all hey somebody got
it yes calls calls calls from the public
nobody nobody ever gets on that River
I'm just doing even saying i clap right
here for the 80 you just killed your
cred right there man not to you well
played well played ah first let's get
into the ipad stuff our buddy calls up
says he's a little let down by the new
ipad is lado from Shannon I'm called to
talk to Jeff about via knew I had I have
the ipad 12 the three above them all on
launch day a new iPad is the first iPad
that did not impress me when I brought
it home couple of first things I noticed
was very was heavier than the ipad 2 and
usually it started to get warm in the
bottom left-hand corner after about five
minutes it also takes longer to charge
through the ipad 2 and the incredible
screen that is so i def it doesn't stay
consistent with the colors like the old
ipad it's kind of like looking at an LCD
through polarized sunglasses have you
ever done that and the colors seem to
jump all around look at a new ipad
screen bring up Google and bring it up
on an ipad 2 and then just kind of move
them around and see if the colors on the
new ipad don't seem to shift for more to
cool that's so weird okay so you have a
new ipad i have a new ipad i had it a
few days in advance below retail that's
like all i've been covering on air on
especially on the CNN side so trying it
out testing it out from everything he's
speaking to here's the way I group it I
say if you haven't had an iPad you've
been holding out which I think there's a
whole category of people on right
perfect time to get one for sure if you
are using your iPad a lot is your go-to
device and you have an iPad 2 is it
worth the upgrade probably you think so
I do if you have an iPad 2 if you're
using it I think he'd the barometer is
like do you are you gonna be looking at
photos and video a lot are you using it
as your go-to device like people I know
like executives is
the ipad is ur go to yeah right but I'll
but you've i mean i don't know i have a
tough time telling somebody who just
spent 500 bucks I'm not seeing it please
no I know right but that's what you got
a factor that in I just I don't know I I
think from one to three is ok I also
don't think the two at 399 is a horrible
pricing screw anybody looking for it's
awesome I have to say in showing it
around to just people around this oh the
bureau and the studio I personally with
the retina display I was putting it next
to the two and playing with things I
noticed the most in text but also in
photo I mean like you can see the
clarity in the red shirt why they were
more mind-blowing than I was about it
immediately when they were popping up
video because it supports 1080p right
they were that's the first thing they
caught onto which I was surprised by so
for some it seems like the retina
display is this resolution airy factor
for me it wasn't the huge default I do
notice that it's faster and I was on 4g
over the weekend it was fast yeah four
G's real thing to have the hotspot
capability as a traveler that actually
to me to me subjectively speaking from
somebody that does a lot of business
travel as we lose their hot spot I mean
one day at a hotel is worth it for me
right I don't know I just I feel what we
did a story the other day where people
literally couldn't tell the difference
yeah they went to an apple store and
show the two and the three Empyrean tell
they were there like I got all really
yeah I think they were just scrolling
through the home screen fine just on the
home screen probably would be able to
tell you i got my obvious I'm 1080p
video to like really small text for
obvious they're deaf oh the batteries
for a great tablet I think ipad 2 is
great here's the way I always put it in
any article I was running as well ipad 2
was the best tablet on the market you're
not gonna ask any tech expert that's
gonna disagree with that right ipad 3 is
like a bonus it's the more polished
version for sure it's the best tablet
while markets still mm-hmm if you want
to save a hundred bucks you go to yeah
if you want everything and you want to
be future proof you go 3 yeah if you
want to burn your legs by the third
version have you noticed that on Harris
I'm not that kind of crazy look every
time apple releasing degrees every time
Apple releases something people you know
people got out come out with with the
you know the pitchforks and like all how
can we tear this thing down right is
like antennagate antennagate and now
what are they calling this like hot
aight i have no idea warmth gate
whatever it is uh you know yeah it gets
a little hot but show me a high powered
device like a laptop right that doesn't
get hot they all get hot your phone gets
hot and you know what 95 degrees that's
really not that hot considering it's
less than your body temperature yeah so
you know cry me a river is out don't you
know maybe you can cook with it whatever
it is but it's not the big the eric
franklin did a test on his own and it
wasn't burning any holes in anybody i
pat down for a little bit let it cool
off you know that could be a good sign
side yeah go outside total digression
but i love the ipad rumor mill because i
see you could brand yourself as like an
apple rumor expert yeah time job we have
a separate podcast just for roommate
absurd yeah but I was like the sites cuz
when it starts to really heat up and you
know like an announcements coming and
invites coming like the sites thatís be
like bling bling supertech biz yes they
have one and they're like according to
an anonymous source like I'm obsessive
like finding those articles right
leading in it's pretty funny we should
definitely just start rumors you for
that you can and we you have a source a
platform to do it you have anything you
wanna miss chinese source ira the iphone
