the buzz report and now for the gadget
of the week the gadget of the week is
this orange backpack now I come to see
yes every year I get a lot of swag and
every year Toshiba and the Consumer
Electronics Association give away some
big bag sometimes it's a Rolly bag
sometimes it's a giant messenger bag but
this year it's awesome it's this huge
backpack tons of stuff padded laptop
case here it's got padding on the back
cuz let me tell you CES makes your back
hurt it's a pretty stylish orange and
the logos aren't too tacky plus it's two
bags in one it's got a little laptop
strap hidden right here and you can
actually zip this part all the way off
and have a standalone laptop bag genius
actually I'm still using my backpack
it's like the best thing ever
plus I can put all my cool CES stuff in
here like I got this cool pen from this
digital Hollywood party and oh I have my
CES badge holder in here and then this
other badge from this other party it's
pretty sweet and I got this pirate
necklace and I got this cool t-shirt and
I have some other this is pretty dorky
huh yeah I'm really embarrassed right
now hmm
let's just move on shall we and now for
the news speaking of hangovers the
iPhone honeymoon certainly ended quickly
didn't it in the latest news some
Australian programmers have created
downloadable skins for Pocket PC phones
that mimic the iPhone user interface
Apple is of course sending its lawyers
after the creators of those skins and
after the bloggers and journalists who
post screenshots of those skins apple
says the designs violate its patents and
trademarks on the iPhone hey yeah you
know who else knows a little something
about that Cisco
there's word this week that Swedish
file-sharing site The Pirate Bay is
planning to buy Sealand
a former British naval platform located
in the North Sea Ceylon was declared a
sovereign principality by its founder
Prince Roy Bates but now law experts say
that Ceylon isn't a legitimately
sovereign nation and that actually UK
law applies to the platform and even the
Spanish estate agents representing
Ceylon say that the Pirate Bay might not
be able to buy it because they'd be
acting against UK interests so it looks
like the pirate bay is dreams of
sovereignty might be over unless dudes
you're pirates
just go take it ninety-nine copies a
board out on Pirate Bay ninety nine
copies of Borat take one down pass it
around still 99 copies of a oh that
pesky high-definition DVD format war now
even porn is caught in the middle at
last week's ABN adult entertainment expo
the co-founder of one prominent porn
distributor said that Sony was pushing
his studio away from blu-ray and on to
HD DVD but now this week the blu-ray
disc Association is making it mighty
clear that there is no porn ban
whatsoever oh no let me paraphrase
listen folks anyone can publish anything
on blu-ray honest even adult
entertainment content that content will
not be exclusive to our competitors HD
DVD in fact oh god please don't say
there's no porn on blu-ray please
