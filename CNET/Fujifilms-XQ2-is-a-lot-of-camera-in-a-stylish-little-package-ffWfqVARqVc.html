your smartphone's camera or you want a
pocket camera to compliment your SLR or
you just want an actual camera that
takes nice photos an advanced compact
like the fujifilm xq2 is the way to go
it's essentially the same as its
predecessor the xq1 which in this case
is a very good thing the image sensor in
here is about double the size of what
you'd find in an ordinary compact camera
or smartphone which gets you better
image quality especially in low-light
which is really where it counts these
days the bright f-18 lens helps out
there too and it's fast to focus
regardless of lighting conditions since
this is targeted at enthusiasts it does
have a full assortment of shooting modes
beyond full auto and scene selection and
you get direct access to important
settings through the e function button
and the lenses control ring it has
built-in Wi-Fi too for transferring
shots to your smartphone or tablet but
unlike other cameras with wireless
there's no option to remotely control
the camera with your device other
potential strikes against it are that
its lens does get slower as soon as you
start to zoom in so you want to be
careful about using the zoom in
low-light and it's video quality is just
okay so if having a camera that pulls
double duty is important you'll probably
want to look elsewhere you can read the
full review on CNET comm but basically
if you can afford the $400 cost this
will get you better photos than your
smartphone or an average point-and-shoot
without weighing you down
I'm Josh Goldman with CNET thanks for
