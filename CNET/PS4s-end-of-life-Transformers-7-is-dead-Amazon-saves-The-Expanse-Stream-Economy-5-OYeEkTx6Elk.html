welcome to stream economy I'm ashley
Esqueda and your time is money
and that's why we're gonna look at the
news across film TV and games and tell
you whether to buy or sell your fan
investment Oh guys I have some bad news
to start off the week it looks like the
Allspark powering the Transformers
franchise has run out of juice
paramount has officially announced
transformer 7 is no longer on its
release late now it used to be scheduled
for June 28th 2019 that is no longer the
case sad sorry transformers fans
Hasbro though is saying that they're
going to reset the franchise and the
company plans to have a much more
involved role as to the creative
direction of what's going on there so
I'm really curious about that as for
Michael Bay well sorry Michael Bay fans
he's taken himself in that cloud of
locusts that follow him around over to
Netflix where he's gonna make a movie
with Ryan Reynolds there is some hope
for transformers fans though and that is
the bumblebee prequel that's coming out
later this year that is directed by
Travis Knight who if you're not familiar
with him directed Kubo and the two
strings so Kubo and the two strings was
a really cute movie so I'm gonna go
ahead and say you've got a buy-in on
that bumblebee prequel cuz I actually
think it's gonna be really good
now as for transformers old guys that's
a sell it's a sell because we don't
really know any details about their
future transformers so until we hear
more sorry guys cut it alright boy I
bailed us there's some hope for the
expanse The Hollywood Reporter says that
Amazon Studios is in talks to rescue the
expanse and give it at least a fourth
season the word on the street is Amazon
CEO Jeff Bezos is a huge fan of the book
series that the show is based on which
is probably a good thing considering
Jeff Bezos could fund making the expanse
until we are swallowed by the Sun so why
our rescue well the first three seasons
of the expanse are already available to
stream on Amazon and on top of that
services like Netflix Hulu and Amazon
have the ability to keep genre shows on
the air a little bit longer because they
don't rely on the same types of metrics
that cable and broadcast TV does so what
are you waiting for guys if you haven't
seen the expanse it's a great show and
Amazon if you're
listening toss the expanse this
beautiful lifesaver save them because
they deserve it it's a great show
seriously guys buy it buy it all day
long now we're gonna move from TV to
games and I'm sad to say PlayStation 4
is dead long live the ps4 playstation
CEO John Coderre said the console was in
the final stage of its lifecycle at
Sony's corporate strategy meeting whoa
before you start your boycott Sony
campaigns and throw your ps4 pros in the
trash it's actually true the PlayStation
4 is at the end of its lifecycle because
we can look at annual sales and it
proves it right here fiscal year 2013
that was when it launched 4.2 million
units then you got next year fourteen
point eight seventeen point seven twenty
million in 2016 but then you start
seeing the downslide so 19 million and
then next year they're saying at the end
of fiscal year 2018 which is in March of
2019
that they'll have only sold 16 million
units this is a clear bell curve now the
CEO did say that they're gonna hunker
down for the next three years and focus
on services that PlayStation offers you
so we'll probably see the next iteration
of whatever PlayStation is working on in
about 2019 2020 maybe a little sneak
peek at e3 in the next couple years but
at the end of the day the PlayStation 4
is still a great investment so I say
it's a Buy and also get your gotta Wars
your horizon zero dawn sand all the
other great great games that are
exclusive to ps4 so enjoy yourself uh
you know on the show we have our
wonderful mark Searles talk about things
and usually he hates them but this time
he actually liked something
you can't help I usually just come on
here and I just poke a ball that hangs
out here my sweatshop things that either
like other things I'm like God actually
get usually when you watch Netflix
Chilika we're supposed to look kids up
to these days which said Disko John's
day and I love him as if she saw him
claiming with punching foot in the face
and all that no oh man I screw a pasta i
scoring past at two documentaries these
aren't playing books I like I like all
the brainy stuff right so you ever seen
like where where West where we're
country well I
well we're country then one was sure oh
man Sheila chica then she man I wish
 always my mom she's got that I'm
mental but also I'm quite interesting
also I'm quite funny also I see tough
techies all the same mom and Sheila

watch that one Sheila's growing Polish
Pope Beulah
look out Han Solo there's a new rogue in
town a Nissan Rogue this is a custom
Millennium Falcon theme show vehicle
made for the red carpet premiere of solo
a Star Wars story we got an exclusive
look at the building of this vehicle
from start to finish over the last two
weeks let's take a look
so we gave ILM and the design team over
there just really a clean sheet of paper
and said what vehicle could we showcase
from the movie solo a Star Wars story
and so they gave us all kinds of options
to choose from
everything from hans-peter to swoop
bikes but at the end of the day if
you're gonna do one vehicle you have to
do a vehicle based on the bloody of
Falcon the fastest ship in the galaxy
you've got a windshield that's custom
fabricated to look just like the cockpit
of the Millenium Falcon a custom hood
you've got this front bumper that has
been put together I mean they have
worked so hard on this car over a
thousand of man-hours to be exact
obviously you need to have a cannon on
board to be able to win those dogfights
out in space custom hubcaps help
complete the look along with an
absolutely beautiful custom paint job
that really brings this show vehicle to
life but the one thing you haven't seen
yet is the inside guys you've got to see
this previous Star Wars show vehicles
that vehicle effects have put together
haven't had accessible interiors until
now so we did a really cool rear panel
setup though so when you're sitting in
the car you get a nice backdrop it looks
very on point with what the interior of
the Millennium Falcon is and we also did
some custom interior elements Lando's
yellow in the rear seats and so forth
are represented and then there's lots of
lights and buttons and switches honestly
the only thing missing is a wookie
copilot oh my god this car is amazing
the back of the car is where the
Millennium Falcon theme show car comes
to life not only do you have a radar
dish and a 1500 watt Bose sound system
you also have a subspace hyperdrive
units spanning the entire back of the
car that not only looks amazing it
sounds amazing too
that's it for me here at vehicle effects
see you to galaxy far far away that robe
was so amazing you guys it was so fun to
sit in I love checking it out big thank
you to Nissan and vehicle effects for
letting us go behind the scenes and
check out the build process and of
course thanks to our sister's life
roadshow for cutting us that beautiful
video and you can check out more about
the car on the road so calm that is it
for us here at stream economy next week
we are going to go on the campaign trail
for one Lindsay Bluth and talk to fans
of Arrested Development about why they
would vote for her in office you don't
want to miss that
of course you're on YouTube like comment
subscribe and ring the bell because I
love that sound so much it actually is a
Pavlovian response now it just makes me
burst into tears of joy Oh before I
start crying find us on Twitter I'm at
Ashley's together you guys tag stream
economy and we will see you next week
