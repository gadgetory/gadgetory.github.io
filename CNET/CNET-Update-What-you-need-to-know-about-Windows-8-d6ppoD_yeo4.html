Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update it's almost time for the arrival
of the new windows 8 operating system
and its radically different from any
windows you've ever used Microsoft is
pushing this as the system that will
sync across other windows devices giving
you more mobile freedom it looks like an
interface for a smartphone or tablet and
it also works with both a mouse and a
touch screen because of that you'll be
seeing mini tablet laptop hybrids
hitting stores but before you upgrade or
buy a new computer you need to know the
differences between Windows 8 pro and
Windows 8/rt if a computer is being sold
with Windows 8/rt that means you cannot
load any of your old Windows software on
that machine RT only works with the new
windows apps the RT version of the
surface tablet is already on backorder
but if you live by one the 23 Microsoft
stores in the United States you can
reserve a surface for pickup on Friday
October 26 but you have to pick it up
before noon that day if you're thinking
about downloading the forty dollar

to check if your system is compatible

Start menu button and the options are
hidden in a sidebar on the right called
the charms bar if you have a touch
screen swipe your finger to pull it open

the cursor in the upper right corner or
the lower right corner to trigger it if
you're ever lost just remember go to the
charms but windows 8 isn't the only
thing we're preparing for Apple will

cash for your old gadgets sites will
