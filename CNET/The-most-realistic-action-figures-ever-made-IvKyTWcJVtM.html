cnet.com DC comic book movies today I've
got Iron Man The Joker and spider-man
and they're all courtesy of Sideshow
Collectibles so hot toys the Chinese
manufacturer that specializes in
fantastically detailed true-to-life
recreations of some of the most beloved
pop culture licenses now the first
figure we're showing off today is timely
enough because of you're a fan of The
Avengers you're going to love this Iron
Man it's a construction version from
iron man's mark three suit from the
original Iron Man movie look keep it on
if you recall Tony Stark repairs his
suit in that film and hot toys made an
exact sixth scale replica complete with
working LED lights and a working lit up
chest plate this piece retails for
hundred and fifty dollars up next is
your friendly neighborhood spider-man
the exact way he appears in 2014's the
amazing spider-man 2
the detail on this piece is unreal check
out his costume its real-life spandex
and it's actual clothing then check out
all the accessories you can recreate
scenes from the film like when Spiderman
wears a backpack and beanie the kit
comes with everything you need to
fashion him the way you want from the
movie and this sixth scale spider-man
goes for 230 dollars
finally my favorite hot toy I've saved
it for less it's the second version of
Heath Ledger's Joker from The Dark
Knight's opening bank robbery scene now
I have version 1 of this but version 2
includes a brand new head sculpt and an
interchangeable bozo mask that really
dark clown mask he wears and a brand new
tailored outfit version 2 of Heath
Ledger's bank robber Joker is 270
dollars it's crazy when you take photos
of these hot toys they look like
production stills from the actual film
that's the level of detail we're dealing
with and also the price I'll have more
items from sideshow toys to showcase
very soon but for now head over to
sideshow toy calm for the latest
available figures I'm Jeff Bakalar for
