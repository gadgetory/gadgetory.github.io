our cars but what do we really want we
say that what really separates great car
infotainment from I'm Brian Cooley with
the top five great attributes of
excellent car electronics our data comes
from GfK research one of the largest
consumer research firms in the world
that's recently asked us Japanese German
and Italian customers these are four big
car making cultures what they really
value in car infotainment systems beyond
the specific features here's what they
learn see how well it matches to your
gripes and delights
number five is Believe It or Not
waterproofness I think Americans
universal habit of Nursing a damn cup of
coffee or a bottle of water every second
they're behind the wheel is spreading
around the world in particular US and
Italian drivers were really vocal about
waterproof car electronics expectedly
those Tidy Germans cared the least about
it they don't even trust cupholders yet
number four replace ability in other
words can you upgrade the text that
comes in your car we used to do this a
lot back in the 70s and 80s with new car
stereos today this could be either
another better head unit for your
vehicle or lately it might just mean a
tablet sitting on a slick car mount we
started thinking about what's going to
be better tomorrow thanks to how good
our phones are today and tomorrow number
three is colorful this may sound silly
but it's not hop into a car with a
monochrome or a two color display then
get anyone with a full color display and
you get it instantly it's not about
pretty colors per se it's about how
information design really falls into
place when color is well used by
designers to delineate functions and
features on the screen now consumers
don't put in those terms but they get it
number two is easy access this mostly
refers to how easy it is to access what
you want the system to do now some folks
laugh at recent chrysler units for
almost looking kind of cartoony in their
simplicity but don't laugh too hard
because they also score tops on consumer
satisfaction because no one likes a
system they can't figure out no matter
how many things it could do if you just
knew how number one is enter
operability interestingly enough
globally more and more consumers are
saying I want tech in the car that works
with the other stuff I already own my
phone my tablet this is outranking
almost any other attribute whether you
have an iPhone or an Android phone or if
you're one of those nomadic tribes still
using blackberry or using a Windows
Phone this is fascinating because it
underscores how much the carmaker's and
audio format makers are now the tale
that gets wagged our mobile devices are
what we want our car to wrap around
high-tech cars and modern driving that's
all we do at CNET on cars comm i'm brian
