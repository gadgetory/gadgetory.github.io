windows-based mixed reality headsets we
saw way back at CES 2017 now the final
version is even closer to release and
it's called the Lenovo Explorer at its
heart this is pretty much the same as
the recent mixed and virtual reality
headsets we've seen from Dell Acer HP
and others they're all based on the same
Microsoft reference design which means
they all look and behave roughly the
same despite small differences in color
and design like the others the Lenovo
Explorer has two built-in cameras right
in the front which act as positioning
trackers that's different than the
oculus rift HTC vive or even the PS VR
which all use external tracking sensors
or cameras that makes this potentially
simpler to setup and less expensive the
cameras built into the Explorer can also
capture what's happening right in front
of you and send that signal to the
internal screams that's the mixed or
augmented reality part of it a
collection of Windows Store app will be
supported as well as a bunch of Lenovo
specific apps from its own branded
entertainment hub with a newer Intel CPU
it'll even be able to play some VR
content mostly simple stuff like 360
videos without needing a separate
graphics card in your laptop or desktop
these Lenovo Explorer is expected in
October at 349 or 449 if you add a set
of handheld motion controllers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
