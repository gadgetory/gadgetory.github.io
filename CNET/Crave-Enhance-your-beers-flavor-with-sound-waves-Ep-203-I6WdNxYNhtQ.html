here's is happening this week on cnet
scrape block in honor of may the fourth
otherwise known as Star Wars day to
thousands of nerds on this planet wired
magazine's Battle Damage team known for
their gadget destruction videos spent
hours and hours building an
eight-hundred-dollar Lego imperial star
destroyers and then crash it into the
ground remake in the end scene of Return
of the Jedi complete with miniature
characters hanging on for dear life on
board do ship the video was shot at
1,000 frames per second super slow
motion video and was titled episode 15 a
new smash
an advertising agency called ogilvyone
he's teamed up with the better seed dogs
and cats home in England to experiment
with a new approach to adopting pets the
agency handed out flyers to shoppers at
East London's westfield stratford mall
advertising some of the cute dogs they
had up for adoption the Flyers contain
to chip in them that would trigger an
adorable video of the dog in this case
barley that was being featured on the
flyer as the shoppers walked through the
mall ogilvyone produced the pet videos
to look as if the dogs were following
the shoppers through the mall begging
them to adopt them there's a very
innovative way of getting the dogs in
front of people which has proven to be
more effective when it comes to pet
adoptions in barleys case the experiment
worked and he was adopted to a new home
as a follow-up to last week's headline
the russian progress 59 space capsule
that went out of control last week while
delivering supplies to the International
Space Station could crash back down to
earth this Friday according to the
Russian space agency engineers have no
idea where the capsule will crash and
the supplies on board will be a complete
loss because the craft is expected to
burn up and break apart on re-entry into
the atmosphere so keep your heads up
this Friday physics is a futuristic beer
pouring system that not only enhances
the flavor of your beer but helps
control the fluid flow of your beer into
the glass physics is the tasty
brainchild of three beer fanatics known
as the physics group Phil petracca david
mcdonald and roger and the three of them
figured out that the head of a beer is
the most essential part of the beer
enhancing the texture and the flavor of
the beer making for a more enjoyable
beer drinking experience so they
designed a thermos / pitcher looking
device that takes this idea into
consideration physics uses a digital
micro controller to control the speed
and flow of your beer if you simply put
the beer into the device and insert the
tube physics then uses sound waves to
break up the carbonation which creates a
thick and creamy head
the top of your beer that enhances the
aromas and the flavor of any type of
beer you might be drinking physics is
currently raising funds on IndieGoGo
could be yours for the price of a
hundred nineteen dollars alright guys
