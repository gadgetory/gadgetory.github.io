coming to you live from the cnet stage
at CES 2014 we are going to run down all
the smartphone news and trends for you
at the show I'm Jessica Thal court
joined by Brian Bennett Lin LA and kent
german your cnet mobile experts well
this was a very interesting show for a
lot of reasons first of all all of the
big names in smartphones pretty much
took a hiatus this year we didn't see
Samsung we didn't see HTC Motorola nokia
not much from LG either but there were
still phones so Lynn you've got one here
why didn't tell us about what you saw I
have the LG G flex fortunately we were
able to see this before CES 2014 but
they really emphasized it here and along
with like their folk a 4k TV this bone
is on sale right now worldwide yeah
that's available it's going to be on
AT&amp;amp;T Sprint and t-mobile that's what the
news that they announced this year so
I'm really looking forward to then so
the most interesting thing about this
phone of course is that it's got a
curved screen and you got a chance to
actually review the phone do you think
that this isn't exciting or interesting
phone for the US market what do we feel
about having it on three carriers it's
definitely an interesting form factor i
mean samsung also has something similar
to it except it curves the other way and
this one's it curves and it's flexible
but the fact that it's coming on three
carriers i was really surprised about
that and it's like something that's very
exciting fruit especially for eighteen t
who announced are their phones own this
year so so it sounds like LG is really
commit committed into making the curved
phone and maybe even a little bit of a
flexible phone can you give us a little
demo there i don't know like right here
press down i don't know if you guys
there was no one I was afraid of it the
first time I did it but now I could
really like a little nervous you're
suddenly yeah it except something like
90 pounds of pressure yeah i think
around like 88 pounds of pressure who
would stand that much
yeah so you rightly could sit on it and
it not crack right that's the idea it's
in your pocket Kent will you give us
another little dent there hey put it
down like this oh you just have the
spirit not to do it you think of
something bad and then it a and weary
with a with those scratching on the back
oh yeah that's like a self-healing
coating that that they say that is
featured in like cars to for like their
paint jobs and you could scratch it's
written usually daily wear and tear and
stuff like that so it's not really used
like if you have like an exacto knives
it's definitely going to cut but you
know if you throw it in your purse so if
you just sew it on the table definitely
will not accumulate the kind of general
scratches that we normally see if you
have it i use in your pocket then i
think a nice thing about it too is you
know the curve isn't just a gimmick
because it does help with the viewing
angle of the watching watching any
movies or video on the screen there's a
lot of this with TVs to soak roofing is
definitely going to be something we see
no sediment oh yeah you could sit on the
side its like it has like oh really it
kind of like bends the reflections away
from what you're looking at to write it
improves the visibility that way as well
and then we've got no pricing or
availability on this yet right the
carrier is the disclosure unit and now
it's all about information I'm Brian
you've got a phone right here at SU
that's right so dive right in
essentially this is the know if you guys
can see this is the xperia 10 1 s and
this is the basically the US version of
the xperia z1 that was shipped globally
but now it's on t-mobile and it has
basically all the flagship components
that you expect has fast processor huge
screen and as a matter fact about 5
inches its 5-inch full-hd and the
cameras 20-megapixel it is also water
resistant and dust resistant so you can
drop it in you know up to three feet of
water for 30 minutes i believe and
you're fine it has you know water tight
if you can see this here but it has
watertight seals around each of the
ports so much a lot of the Xperia phones
it was pretty
high-end to like the build quality on
this looks nice yeah it's definitely it
definitely looks nice it's very shiny
it's very sleek very thin so you can see
here the little flap here covering one
of the ports it I think it comes with a
lot of memory has a pretty nice camera
so this is a really good attempt by Sony
to get back into the smartphone game
which is I gotta celebrate that
waterproof thing is something I still
can't get used to though and the good
idea of like I can dunk it in water I'm
even put it in the sink and turn it on
and it's ran into the bottom of people
aren't really going to Duncan and water
it's more like you don't have to freak
out I think you'd be a cries no I think
yeah just go for a dive in the pool
alright well actually that you know if
cell phones have ruined throwing people
in the pool a pool party yeah that is
just a dude I demand that we changed
this before was just your wallet your
keys now it's like your phone is going
to be really actually there is a company
here that has kind of a cool thing they
say that we're doing things backwards
with the whole seals instead of worrying
about the rubber gaskets and things like
that but you should be doing as water
proofing the internals so they've worked
on a coating to do that oh yes kind of
cool yeah definitely a lot of people who
do that after the market you know you
can give them your phone and they will
like pump it full of some sort of nano
coating which will you know lock it all
down and make sure that there's no water
damage at all so pool parties safe again
for pranks okay that's good to know so
t-mobile has this phone AT&amp;amp;T also
announced that it was going to carry a
phone that's been previously released
globally this is a trend right global
first and then at CES announced that yes
I boy dance yeah you take a look at that
one right yeah so in addition to the g
flex 80s going announced that asus
padfone exits it was basically a phone a
smart phone that you could plug into the
rear side of a tablet and the tablet is
powered by the processor from the
smartphone and we took a look at it at
me in a luke westaway from cnet UK took
a look at it and it's basically a really
really nifty device we couldn't touch it
as per 18 tease request but you know and
there's a mini version that's coming out
there's no availability but also gonna
be 18 heroes a lot of global
announcement for the mini version ya
know we um its global we don't there's
no us availability information that they
gave us at that point but the mini comes
in a lot of colors
like this really cool soft touch sheen
material that we were that we really
like and I believe it's a four inch
smartphone into a 7-inch versus a five
anytime iphone into a 9 inch allen the
others say they other pad phones you had
that you had to kind of put it in and a
little door closed looks like this with
the slides in the back yeah not that
smooth but like you kind of you know you
shove it in it connects and then it
powers up the tablet the tablet has its
own battery source so and you can use a
tablet to power the smartphone but you
can't but it doesn't have you know it's
process ringing but you couldn't touch
it and I couldn't touch and we wanted to
just I'm not a big my day they've
companies bring these things to the show
and you were supposed to stare at it
what are you supposed to do just stay on
there oh I bet I bet you could have
snuck a little we wanted to just lick it
and just put our finger on interested
but we know we can't do that because you
know then they'll never put a post-it
limo yeah they remove the glass for us
though oh wow well that's very nice for
them what you really exciting to me
about this announcement is that we've
seen these before Kent you and I have
seen them at Mobile World Congress in
Barcelona and this phone has never come
to the US market and it's really cool
Lynn and I also took a look at the sous
Padfone infinity earlier this year and
we had in the office and we're playing
with it and it is so cool and is such a
great idea for people who are interested
in a tablet but kind of want to cut
costs a little bit because sometimes you
know you use your phone when you're out
and about and then you use the tablet
when you're at home because you want to
play a game or just have a larger screen
or share it with somebody this is like
the zip off backpack from the
backpacking backpack no yeah you're kind
of like an obscure example or like zip
off pants or something man that becomes
a choice modular you bring it on these
manatees ready what can I say I'm a 90s
girls well you know that all this
modular you know smartphone design seems
to be a real trend you know you've got
motorola with their ARA project you've
got CTE yes you see just they showcase
it here it's there eco mobius modular
phone concept design is another it's
cool i'm a better work it's a it's they
just displayed it we weren't able to
like take a really good look at it it's
just a concept design came out of the
R&amp;amp;D program and there
it's just something that it's exciting
that another manufacturer is also
working on a mantra phone concept it's
pretty cool so you basically just like
build your phone like like you know a
stack of Legos or something yeah you
know as long as you don't drop it and it
all falls apart into like all these
little pieces I won't let go to make a
phone I think you build your own phone
they may have Simpsons house this week
so they can probably make a phone I
think so I mean it's really how hard is
it to make a phone really um I took a
look along with eric franklin at the
Samsung Galaxy Note pro this is a 12.2
inch tablet now why are we talking about
tablets arose we're talking about
smartphones because um it's really
important to keep an eye on that on the
Samsung tablet space because what
happens on the note tablets usually
winds up in some form or another on the
note smartphone so what was interesting
about this is that Samsung is really
making a push to go pro especially with
tablets you know they want their tablets
to replace your desktop but what it
means is there might be a trickle-down
effect with the new magazine interface
design is basically just redesigned with
widgets and things like that that really
aims to put a lot of productivity front
and center and Samsung this massive
juggernaut has also come up with a lot
of partnerships with content providers
so we can see that may be coming down to
the next version of the note smartphone
where it comes pre-loaded with all this
stuff and with Samsung really trying to
make a play for offering you a corporate
productivity experience on the
smartphone so it runs on Android but
then the magazine UX just sits over that
so it's yeah similar to similar to
TouchWiz right way that it works but
different it looks different and that's
that's really a failing of tablets right
now but it's sort of like keep an eye on
this because you might see it appearing
so I almost sounds like Microsoft and
Samsung are gonna go head to head and
like that the enterprise sort of
production and pro tablet kind of
surface well Samsung wants to rule the
world yes I'll take on any way Google a
little Microsoft you're down right uh so
we saw a lot of themes here at the show
that don't relate directly to
smartphones but they build off of them
and one of those is wearables Brian you
took a look at a boatload of wearables
yeah definitely there are a ton of
wearable products here it would
seemed like the the major theme of the
show we saw what we saw the new pebble
steel which is a brand new watch from
the you know people who innovated the
entire you know whole segment of the
category it's very nice it looks it
looks beautiful it's expensive it's $249
but it looks like a real analog watch
that does not look like a SmartWatch at
all until this little old LED strip on
the bottom starts to roll in with like a
ticker-tape style of smartphone
notification so you see text you see you
see you know social media meetings all
the stuff you want to see at a glance
and it also does this crazy thing where
it actually will buzz with haptic
feedback the way you want it to so when
you get an alert you can have it like a
little like a mini Morse code kind of
thing to say like dot dot dot like long
long short short short short and long
long long or long short long I mean it's
crazy all this stuff happening on your
wrist and no one will know does it
actually talk to you like a marshal no
darlin I know it doesn't though the big
joke is they should have come up with a
watch name that the Martian Chronicle
you know that would be grabbed ah like
that but no it's it's a it's a it's a
really interesting product it's a very
low price you know it's like I think
it's a 129 try so actually really nice
remarkably low especially when you
compare it to something like the Samsung
Galaxy gear that only works with oh yeah
the samsung phones and not even all of
them yet right true that's true so um so
this connects to your phone via
bluetooth and it gets all of your
contacts and notifications through your
phone that way yeah they have they
basically have two at they have two
versions of say map one for Android one
for iOS and you can figure all all of
your notifications directly there and it
all gets pushed to your phone as a
matter of fact what's really cool is it
will support apps that aren't even out
yet because as long as you get a
notification and any sort of app you
install gets you know sent to the
notification area on your phone it will
self populate and basically now send
those alerts to your to your watch you
know if you want to or not so you know
whatever software is out there it will
figure it out
so means you're always quit my chicken
at your watch to look at texting your
phones what about dinner and someone's
going on top of Morse code no no yeah
you just keep it on the side look at it
you just it reads it out you know and
then if you get my emergency alert then
then you have to check your watch have
you seen any smartphones at this show
that actually is built for like a
woman's wrist cuz I'm waiting for that
other part much more watches no and
that's a huge that's a huge hole in this
thing because I have yet to see one
smart watch that is targeted at at you
know or a woman female yes no matter how
small does anyone who has a small wrist
mean it's true I put on the Galaxy gear
and they have this pretty rose closer
and I like that but it was so
uncomfortable just fitting over my phone
I didn't think I was really designed for
anyone yeah I mean it does look that
that device looks it looks sleek and
it's interesting but it's so futuristic
looking you know you definitely look
like you're kind of like the cyborg from
the future and a guy you know or woman
you know it's it's definitely people
will look at you if you have it on your
wrist and that's not what you want you
want a watch I think that just looks
like a watch and it has an elegant kind
of sophisticated style yet you know
people won't even know that it's giving
you all you don't I'm looking like one
of those calculator watches with all but
we're so big and clunky but but those
are actually pretty cool please come
back please strap your phone to your
wrist oh yeah so I would smartwatches I
mean do you think that this year last
year was sort of everyone getting
started this year we've had a lot of
version 2 point 0 but it's not really in
a lot of traction are we going to start
seeing this actually getting picked up
I'm is pricing really important or I
technology well pricing is getting there
it's getting lower but I also think that
the technology is starting like
especially with Bluetooth 4.0 getting
into a lot of phones now and the
bluetooth low energy that and you know
it natively will support a lot of these
push notifications on Android and iOS
already has it so it you know you've got
a lot of now the ecosystem is kind of
building and its building momentum and
it's a lot easier to actually create
products in software so and everyone has
one of these
and it seems like and you don't want to
be checking it you know 200 times a day
it drives you crazy yeah it drives
people that you go to out to eat dinner
with they all right sitting there for us
table and you're like well you will
definitely pay attention to me if I
should have to dinner wearing my smart
glasses because I tried on for days and
Scott Stein tried on one and these are
all google glass alikes I'm gonna call
it massively their rivals um one of them
was specifically for a camera used like
you put it on I'm you could slip these
mods on the end to extend battery life
or do cool things and then developers
can create an app and you can press the
button maybe look around and it takes a
panorama and uploads it a lot of these
are Kickstarter and IndieGoGo projects
there's one that actually looks kind of
like glasses it looks like a cycling
helmet there's one I tried on that was
just like absolutely insane it looked I
mean it has like pivot wheel it just
looked like it was taking over my entire
as the face right is that the pivot um
it's called the aura s AR eyewear and it
is actually hung twister rolls off the
tongue and I'm looking at myself in
these ins like you know it's just like
high school all over again with my big
old glasses on my face um you will
definitely get notice wearing these and
I've seen a lot of google glass around
the show as well like a ton of it and I
think that right now smart glasses are
probably we're smart watches were two
years ago right um they are not a
practical solution yet they are all just
pure development and they do rely on
your phone quite a lot and I know there
are some smart contact lenses that makes
stat from news looked at really that's
that's very amazing like you know I'm
going to be assimilated if I put one of
those um so there's definitely a lot of
net next wave tech coming on Brian you
took a look at iris scanning yeah yeah
it seems like you know wearable tech and
biometrics you know these devices that
pay attention to your body it's a huge
thing and this company called I lock
they actually announced or they're
showing a demo of basically a device
that would scan your iris and know who
you are based on your individual
patterns and it works like lightning
a suspected really quick and it's it's
no stretch of the imagination to see it
actually going into smartphones as a
matter of fact yesterday there was some
buzz that perhaps the Samsung Galaxy s5
may have some iris scanning technology
built into it is that going to use the
camera for optics uh yeah because what I
believe how this this whole thing works
is it uses the front-facing camera or
you know on your laptop and it will
basically shoot I are like infrared
beams into your eyes and record the you
know the little patterns and you're in
the color part of your eye the iris and
matches that against a database that
lives up there you know though of course
it's all I think it's all local so you
have to worry about your your
fingerprint or your I print or your iris
ID you know kind of living in the cloud
somewhere it's all like local but it's
supposed to be really you know tight
security and really fast and it's very
futuristic yeah I mean we have face
unlock but that doesn't quite work the
same way does it no thank you try to
face on Lachlan you've tried it yeah but
the thing is you can use a photo like if
you play some could be I guess you know
if you had someone that kind of looks
like you can unlock your phone I mean
this is a unique thing you know
somebody's somebody's irises which is
definitely unique to them like their
fingerprint not so much a face in some
ways but so it's a little bit different
there are companies that are also
working on voice unlock as well right so
they they pattern your voice they call
it the voice matrix and then you have
like an unlocked passphrase that only
you would say like the quick brown fox
or I hate passwords or something like
that it's a little bit longer and that's
supposed to unlock your phone so another
thing that I took a look at that may
also be on the samsung galaxy s5 I'm
guessing this is totally uncomfortable
art phones have gesture technology in it
and they use that's been around for long
yeah they use optics through the camera
or some other devices use infrared and
this one uses ultrasound okay yeah
ultrasound so it uses normal microphones
but then these ultra sound speakers so
when you turn it on it sends out these
sound waves that you can't hear and
you'll basically wipe your hand over the
phone
doing any number of laboratories and it
will bounce back now what's cool about
ultrasound is that the space isn't
limited because you don't have something
that's looking at you it's it's setting
out these sound waves so you can use a
wider field I guess of space and you can
use more elaborate controls like moving
your hand in a circle could turn up the
volume or turn down the volume so it's
like something out three dimensional
yeah you know you can you can make like
different things with your fingers or
whatever some kind of strange shape and
it was a very cool I don't know what
this thing's a lotta fun I do you think
like this amazing I mean I just love the
way in that video how you're just you
know moving your hand so many of these
phones that it's so particular you have
to be so close you have to do is very
certain thing I mean you're just going
like this your other to the side of the
phone yeah and it's working no I think
this is really interesting the only
problem with that is that when I was
shooting the video there were a lot of
false positives and negatives well a lot
of false whatevers because I just stick
you late a lot I'm so it's up to the
device makers to actually constrain that
and define what it means to do thee to
do these things but the app makers can
also start integrating that into the
apps when that happens and we have been
assured that that is going to start
showing up in tablets and smartphones in
2014 so I think the big theme of this
phone of this phone show this show here
at least is that we're going to see a
lot more from phones in the future in
this year it was quiet here but we've
got Mobile World Congress coming up at
the end of februari into early March
yeah the three of us are going to that
the quieter CES is for women the bigger
mwa that's really don't know that's a
big show in barcelona spain every year
and it's been growing and importance
every year for we've been going since
2008 and its really where cell phone and
smartphone news really happens now it's
kind of taken over the show in that way
I mean the smartphone still are here but
we'll see new smartphones there more
than we did here that's really evidenced
by the fact that Samsung didn't have our
presence noogie well nokia getting
bought out by microsoft will know more
about that by then there should be a
phone either from nokia or a new windows
phone whatever that's going to be
branded as i'm expecting that we're
going to see that there and of course
seeing it will have great coverage about
will congress so at last week of every
seemed to turn into US and
bring you all the news these guys will
because they will be there and you will
be there in spirit I will be building
slight shadows back exactly so again
thank you so much for joining us you can
find out all of the coverage about every
product we talked about and every
product that cnet cover doesn't hold at
CES cnet com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
