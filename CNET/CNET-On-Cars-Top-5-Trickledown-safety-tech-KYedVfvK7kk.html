their expensive cars get all the tech
toys first but lately we've been getting
the last laugh as all that tech trickles
down to our cars and does so faster
every year
I'm Brian Cooley with my top five car
safety technologies that used to only
protect rich guys but now is keeping us
alive - we're gonna rank these by a
combination of how common they are and
how commonly you will likely use them
let's go
number five is adaptive cruise control
and this is the technology that doesn't
just maintain your speed on the highway
but also the distance between you and
the car ahead it debuted in Japan on the
high-end mitsubishi diamante in 1995
didn't come to the US until 2000 the
Lexus LS 430 today it's fairly common
you'll find it on cars as affordable as
the Mazda 6 even the Mitsubishi
Outlander and look for big growth here
largely because the same parts and
software that make this system work also
enable forward collision avoidance tech
it's kind of a twofer number four is the
rear view camera go back to 1956 to find
the first on the Buick Centurion a show
car but there it was way back then then
it just went away we never saw one again
till the early 2000s when LCDs began to
show up in the dash and that gave the
camera image a place to live today
almost all cars at least offer them but
there's still too often optional
equipment even on a Bentley Flying Spur
the feds have repeatedly balked in terms
of making these required and so they're
still typically optional number three is
the airbag the 74 Olds Toronado was
perhaps the first production car with
what they then called the air cushion
restraint system had a very low take
rate so it kind of drifted and went away
then an 81 Mercedes put it front and
center on the new s-class and you know
their reputation for safety by 1989
front airbags for the driver were
required and by 1998 across the front
row today you can hardly count the
number of airbags in most cars 10-11-12
is quite common
number two ABS anti-lock brakes March of
1969 ABS arrives on the Concorde then in
1970 Ford made it optional on the rear
wheels of Continentals and in 1971
Chrysler made it available on four
wheels in the Imperial the EU has
required it on all cars since 2007 but
get this the US still doesn't some mumbo
jumbo about how to accurately test its
effectiveness as of 2012 however I think
I stopped seeing any cars sold without
it in the US regardless of regulations
before I get you to number one here a
couple technologies that won't be that
Lane keep assist and blind spot
monitoring that's because so far
insurance industry data shows rather
tepid improvement in driver safety with
those technologies they just start
making a big difference yet the number
one trickle-down safety tech has got to
be ESC electronic stability control it
first shows up in really polished form
on the big Mercedes and BMWs of 1987
then as of model year 2012 it's now
required on all new cars in the US
simply put stability control is
unbelievable it reduces fatal rollovers
by 70 percent and reduces all fatal
crashes in cars by 14% and double that
in SUVs in many ways it's kind of a cure
for the lousy driver
for more technology like this all about
high-tech cars and modern driving that's

a lot of top fives await you there i'm
brian coulis thanks for watching
