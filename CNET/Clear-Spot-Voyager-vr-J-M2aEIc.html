this is the clear sparked Voyager this
tiny device is actually very powerful it
offered the access to the Internet to up
to eight Wi-Fi devices and this is a 4G
only hotspot meaning that it works only
with the 4G network of clear if you go
out of the coverage area it is useless
on the side here you can see that it has
a power button and a three LED light
that showed the status of the device now
these two I have different colors for
example the power light here is Amber
meanings that the batteries is about 80%
to more than 20% it is rad is mean it's
only less than 20% left and it should
charge the device suit and a two green
light here they are solid green means
that you have a Wi-Fi divide connected
to the router here and the other light
mean that you have 4G connection when
plugged to a computer apart from
charging the router here will also work
as a 4G modem for the computer the clear
sport Voyager come with a built-in non
replaceable battery they'll give you
about six hours of battery life actually
in my testing it offer about seven hours
the device doesn't seem to go into sleep
mode when there's no Wi-Fi if I connect
it to it so the only way you can save
battery life is to turn it off when you
don't use it as the best thing about
this mobile hotspot is income with
unlimited data plan to start at $35 per
month the divided cell cost $125 without
a contract that make it a very good deal
or more all mobile hotspots and the
monster</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
