here at the review of the Whirlpool WNC
five zero five two two a s microwave as
you can see this is a really really
large countertop microwave it has 2.2
cubic feet of interior capacity this
model retails for two hundred and
seventy nine dollars so you can find it
cheaper on other second party websites
two hundred and seventy nine dollars may
seem like a lot to pay for a microwave
but let us assure you that puts it
squarely in the middle of that mid price
range another important thing to note is
that this is a 1200 watt microwave which
means its high power cooks your food
faster and more efficiently and
manufacturers also say that the higher
the wattage the more evenly your food is
cooked so you can expect a better
quality product they claim when
assessing a microwaves functionality to
establish and determine its worth the
presets are definitely something that we
like to look at and those are kind of
where we centered our tests even though
all popcorn manufacturers say to never
ever ever ever use a popcorn preset on a
microwave we threw caution to the wind
and tested it anyways because after all
what are the presets they're for if not
to be used with the popcorn test the
preset functions really well leaving on
average about 70 kernels unpopped this
may seem like a lot but the average
standard sized bag of popcorn includes
more than 440 kernels so to leave 70
unpopped fell within our expected range
other presets that we tested that works
really well were the potato preset the
skin got crispy and the insides were
easily mashed with a fork we took this
as a sign at the higher wattage was
working for us but it seemed that the
higher wattage sometimes goes a little
bit too far as with the case of frozen
dinners the frozen entree preset works
it will cook your food but in the case
of our Stouffer's lasagna test it
overcooked it and our taste testers said
that it was more lasagna soup than
lasagna the same was true when we tried
to reheat day-old pizza the microwave
took it just a little bit too far but
since the frozen pizza
was really the only preset that didn't
work quite as well as we expected we can
forgive the whirlpool that all of this
brings us to the ultimate question when
you're trying to make one of these
purchases which is is it worth the $279
price point while that tag definitely
places it in a reasonable range within
the categories pricing we definitely
would recommend that if you're looking
for a microwave that's gonna give you a
little bit more bang for your buck that
you look at the Panasonic NSD 997 s its
inverter technology in advanced sensors
make it a better value and it's only
twenty dollars more than the whirlpool
but if you like this model in particular
and are intrigued by its appearance
and/or function you can't go wrong and
it will do all of the things that you
expect it to do as a microwave and
kitchen appliance with the Whirlpool WMT
five zero five to 2a s microwave I'm
