conference you're going to have an
incredible week Apple CEO Tim Cook
kicked off the keynote for the company's
worldwide developers conference better
known as WWDC the two-hour event in San
Francisco covered a wide range of
product upgrade announcements but
culminated in unveiling a new operating
system for iPhones and iPads it's a
great thrill that I announced iOS 7
ios7 will offer users a completely
redesigned look with upgrades to users
favorite features and apps now your
camera and iOS 7 is for cameras in one
you can just swipe from your video
camera to your photo camera to your
square cropped camera to your pano
camera and when you're taking stills you
now have access to live photo filters
also integrated in iOS 7 is the brand
new iTunes radio and once you have a
station you love you can just tap the
eye and you could share it with a friend
or even create a new station based on
this artist or song when iOS 7 is
released to the public this fall it will
also offer a feature called activation
lock to better safeguard your phone if
it gets stolen or goes missing and now
with activation lock if a thief tries to
turn off Find My iPhone or if they even
wipe the device entirely they will not
be able to reactivate it because they
don't know your iCloud username the
other moment of big applause at WWDC was
the unveiling of the new Mac Pro tower
that apple says is smaller faster and
with better built in graphics than
previous models this is without doubt
the future of the pro desktop it is
coming later this year it said as a
sneak peak it is designed by brilliant
engineers in California and assembled
here in the USA other announcements
included a revamped operating system 10
for max called Mavericks faster MacBook
Airs with better battery life and a new
voice for Siri hi what can I do for you

Francisco I'm Kara Tsuboi cnet.com for
