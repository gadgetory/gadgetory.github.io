long way since the days of dial-up but
it still drives you crazy
one minute is blazing fast in the next
minute your Netflix stream looks like an
8-bit video game Donnell Bell and this
top-5 I'm gonna count down the best ways
to make your home Wi-Fi faster and more
reliable starting off at number five
change your channel most existing
routers out there working that 2.4
gigahertz band which is crowded by
microwaves and baby monitors and your
neighbors routers within the 2.4
gigahertz band the least crowded
channels are 1 6 or 11 so give those a
shot and see if things improve better
yet if your router has the auto mode for
channel selection this will
automatically pick the best option for
your environment better yet try number 4
use the 5 gigahertz band if your router
and your devices support 5 gigahertz
then dish the 2.4 gigahertz spectrum all
together any 802 dot 11 n or AC router
will have this option the air is much
less crowded here and includes twenty
three non-overlapping sub channels most
of these routers will also let you
broadcast simultaneously in 2.4
gigahertz if you're feeling nostalgic
coming in at number three change your
placement I seen a lot of routers and
they either look like a time capsule
from 2004 or like a chunk that fell off
a spaceship either way I can understand
why you may have hidden yours in the
back laundry room
unfortunately it's killing your
reception the ideal spot is in the
center of your home mounted on your
ceiling but that's probably a no-go for
a bunch of reasons it was a compromise
just tell me that you'll get your router
off the ground out of the cabinets and
in an open area that's closer to where
reception matters and number 2 I a new
router it may sound like a cop-out but a
modern router offers a ton of features
we just didn't have a few years ago
I'm at less crowded 5 gigahertz band I
mentioned at the top most 802 dot 11 n
or AC routers also use an antenna
technology called beamforming that can
detect devices in your home and
concentrate the Wi-Fi signal where you
need it most and finally at number one
add an access point if changing the
router doesn't help well maybe your home
is just too damn big in this case is
best to invest in an extra access point
and put it at the other end of your home
if possible connect the existing router
and the access point using a network
cable or a pair of powerline adapters by
the way many routers can be made to work
as an access point just by changing the
setting so that old router you just
replaced might come in handy so there
you go five ways to speed up the Wi-Fi
in your home compiled by CNET senior
editor and networking guru don't know
you can find something it's current list
of the best Wi-Fi routers over at
