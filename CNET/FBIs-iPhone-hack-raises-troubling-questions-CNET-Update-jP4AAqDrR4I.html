iPhone hacking drama we're left with
more questions than answers I'm Bridget
Carey this is your cnet update the legal
battle between Apple and the FBI may be
over for now but there are many
questions left unanswered in a court
filing the US Department of Justice said
it no longer needs apples help to break
into the iphone 5c used by terrorists
Syed Farook and that the FBI was able to
get the data off that iphone with the
help of a third-party the FBI was
seeking a court order that would force
Apple to create a back door to access
that locked iphone but now the FBI is
saying well nevermind we don't need to
continue this battle in court we did it
ourselves but the FBI is keeping
tight-lipped and not answering any
questions about this supposed hack how
did they hack into the iphone what data
did they get off the phone who was the
third party that helped will they even
tell Apple how they did it or will this
hack work on other iphones we get no
answers and no proof that it ever even
happened other than the court statement
and consumers are left wondering how
good is Apple's security if it could be
bypassed so comforting right and that's
not the only drama in the tech world
Instagram users are up in arms over
changes coming to the social network but
some popular accounts are spreading
panic and wrong information here's what
you need to know Instagram which is
owned by Facebook is going to change the
feed to be more like Facebook so instead
of always seen the most recent post up
top you may see the post that the
algorithm thinks you care more about
first so it'll no longer be in
chronological order but unlike with some
accounts are warning the change is not
in effect yet Instagram says there are
weeks or months of testing to do before
it rolls out and popular users are
panicking because maybe you may miss
their posts heaven forbid their urging
users to turn on push notifications
right away so you'll never miss their
post but to get a ding every time
someone posts a photo yeah that sounds
awfully annoying Instagram says you will
still see all of your posts
but they will just be in a different
order so you don't have to worry in fact
you may just want to chill out and
distract yourself with a new social app
arriving this week Nintendo's first
mobile app me tomo is landing in the US
and several other countries on thursday
you create a meet character and use it
to socialize with other Me's it's
available on Apple and Android app
stores that does it for this tech news
roundup but there's always more to
explore at cnet com from our studios in
New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
