how to contributor today we're going to
discuss how to use the built-in
dictionary app on iOS 5 this is a
feature that's built into the iOS and
some users may not even be aware that
its built-in or that it's available you
really have to kind of look for it at
times and other times it's right in
front of you but you may not realize
what it is so what we'll do is anywhere
you can highlight text or select text
you're able to pull up the dictionary
app so i have a tweet pulled up here and
we're going to go ahead and select the
word android and see what the built-in
iOS 5 dictionary has to say about
android so we have copy delete which we
can't delete this text and then we have
defined tapping on define will open the
dictionary app and give you its
definition for the word you have
highlighted in this case it's Android
and nothing here about Google not a real
big surprise Android is a robot with the
human appearance it's become so much
more than that Apple will go ahead and
press stop press on done not only can
you highlight and get a definition for
static text text you can't edit yourself
but you can also get tech or a
definition for text that you're entering
yourself so I'll just enter a random
word and then we'll select it now you
don't see defied on this screen or on
this pop-up you'll see cut copy paste
suggestion if you want to use a
different word than technology or you
could hit the over arrow and there's
define go to tap on that and then
there's a whole bunch listed under here
for technology so that's it it's pretty
simple straightforward it's not there or
it's there if you you know what you're
looking for and if you don't know what
you're looking for it's not there make
sure to come over and join us on how to
cnet com we have a lot more great tech
tips about iOS 5 android anything else
you could imagine come and join us
