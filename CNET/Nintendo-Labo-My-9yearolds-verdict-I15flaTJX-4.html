kit that came out Nintendo lab oh and
it's gonna be this cardboard
construction idea for the switch and we
got to play it before anyone else and
what did you I know what I think what
did you think about it well I gotta say
that the building is really fun and get
to you play it is like awesome what do
you like the most because we built about
we worked on it for like two hours I
think and we built and we played and
it's meant to be like parent-child where
we get to work together what was really
awesome about it what did you what do
you remember the most Wow the robot was
really cool so what was that like you
you put on the put on these backpacks
mm-hmm and we put these things on our
feet and hands and we could move in the
air and we were doing this crazy
punching and stepping and kicking and
with this visor that brought us in to
look like a first-person visor mode and
I'm like yeah not actually checking
stepping stepping right not actually
kicking stepping and it was his backpack
like you tighten the straps and you did
it yeah would you I mean is that was
that your favorite thing or your
favorite experience or was it I think my
favorite was a fishing fishing game yeah
that was great when they're reeling in
it actually looked right so I get after
it looked like it was going into the
screen yeah that was incredible
that the rook that the fishing rod was
going into the screen yeah that was
something we were like I remember I was
trying to get you to walk away for a man
you still wanted to keep playing it
almost felt like like a arcade game like
Dave &amp;amp; Buster's I mean you were we were
holding the fishing rod it's a game
where you have to like weigh a lot so
what should you do all your waiting have
a snack oh well I figure might bite any
moment it's true it's like real fishing
has like real fishing and you have to be
really patient so you also got to play
the motorcycle game
there was this crazy interactive house
yes I love that like there was this
thing it was kind of like Mario where
you're in this no Mario there's like
this game and then I played where it was
I guess other than game and I played on
the Wii U where you're on a minecart
near would jump over the thing they were
like bombs in the after I jump over the
bombs collect the green emeralds and
that's what it felt like to you yeah
like you're looking through the window
and doing stuff yeah it was really fun
yeah different things you you attach
like a faucet you would turn it and then
like the house and start filling up with
water
yes there was a button that you like
could pop things any I was interacting
yeah there was the piano which was a oh
yeah working yeah weird piano actually
made sounds that was crazy
mm-hmm there's a gold toy piano with
different sound effects when you plug
little pieces in and we also did the RC
cars yeah
controlling them was fun you were like
bebop and they went and there was a
setting on them that we're like they
could like follow your hand like oh yeah
follow your hands like yes there it also
follow like infrared stickers yeah that
was pretty amazing so they ended up the
infrared camera in those controllers
you're gonna be pretty key for a lot of
things in Nintendo labo where there it
was it was enabled said it could follow
your hand body heat he could follow
reflective stickers and then Nintendo
said that the the piano worked like that
too they opened it up and showed
reflective stickers yeah that the
infrared camera was reading and that was
how it was reading the musical notes oh
yeah and the robot wars like that - yeah
the robot that's that's where like the
things pulls like little magnets in the
backpack that sorry little cords and
like weights and the infrared sensed it
when it went high enough and it made the
robot on the screen punch so here's the
question would you would you definitely
want one of those kits of course would
you buy one of those kits if you didn't
save up your money for
yes would you if you didn't have a
switch would you want to get a switch
just to get one of those kits or only if
you had a switch because it's like $300
plus of course maybe a parent's game
this for you but it's a curious yeah
well if I were to get a switch it
wouldn't be just for a Nintendo lab oh
it would also be for other games for
those other things but that's like a
Queen's a great bonus if you also had
that mm-hmm do you think you get
competitive with people I think would
you want to like take turns or like be
like hey I want to try that now or do
you feel like it's really good it was a
fun for us to work on it together yeah
it was really fun it was cool we did for
like I was really bad at the you were
good at the car I mean how were the
instructions like how putting it
together did you feel like it was pretty
easy to do I felt like it was like
normal yes hmm I felt like it was just
like normal just folding out paper yeah
since they do a lot of origami and
minecraft papercraft for instance it was
a long as long as yeah kind of like
minecraft papercraft or origami was it
bit like Lego in terms of the
instructions kind of a little bit yeah I
like the instructions I thought they
were like pretty easy to read any
problems with that they're really good
instructions yeah they were good um are
you curious about the programming like
yeah that stuff they said at the end
about how you can customize and do these
extra things yes I think really like to
connects and stuff like let's say the
piano
did you watch to use the RC car to make
the piano work with the RC car yeah like
you press the end key and it makes the
left one move vibrate and you press the
right key the rightmost key and it makes
the right one move and you press them at
the same time and it moves forward
that'd be cool really musical RC car
yeah like it would make sound at the
same time too I like that what do you
think what do you most want to see oh
yeah what if you could drive the car
with the fishing rod
how'd that even work like reeling it to
make it go forward to do that or who
knows yeah reeling it to make the left
on vibrate reeling it up to make the
left or vibrate reeling it down to make
the right on vibrate and then keeping it
still to make them go forward what if
you go fishing for RC cars Oh like the
RC cars are moving by and you're like
trying to fish for them like they're
moving around and then you're like let
them moves closer to you oh I mean if
you reel it then they move closer reel
it in reel it out they move closer but
when you reel it in they drive away so
if they're like right there and they're
gonna get tangled then you reel it in
coz they can't move away so you do some
programming like scratch and a lot of
other things so like you you really want
to see this be like totally customizable
yeah it would be really interesting and
what like so there are a couple of
things all right now and the in the in
the kit are there things that you want
to make that aren't in the kit yet that
you want to see next like what your
Nintendo be making next to it maybe like
a bow and arrow when you pull it back it
like sense it maybe would have like an
infrared sensor like over here and when
you pull back it senses the infrared and
on the screen it creates an arrow and
then you shoot the arrow and tries to
hit moving targets that's a good idea
mm-hmm but that in the next version
that's aggressive I want to get my line
mm-hmm
well that's like I mean if you have
questions about Nintendo labo we played
it's coming out April 20th and like what
else do you want it what else did you
want to do with it that we didn't get a
chance to do we only get so much I would
have I would have tried to cast a shark
in the fishing game although that would
have been like really really hard
because it sharks so lowdown and you
guys like mm-hmm you guys are like
really didn't speed of light any bike
yeah alright well hopefully answer some
questions yeah talk soon
once we're able to review it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
