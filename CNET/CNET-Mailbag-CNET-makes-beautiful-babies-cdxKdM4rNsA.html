the cnet mailbag the show where we read
your feedback open your snail mail try
to answer questions about the things
we're doing and often just create more
work for our podcast producer Jason
towel let's start with a follow-up to
last week's show now after all the
complaining that happened about our
video ads I honestly thought that you
guys would go crazy over the ipod touch
add on our front door this week but no I
got a bunch of emails like this one from
Brendan gotta say I think the ipod touch
add y'all are running is actually quite
cool with the navigation not spinning
and twirling and do dad what not just
wondering did see that make it or apple
either way it's nito nito i did not
expect that but I am happy also yeah
Apple made it they're good next up a
technical question which was apparently
happening a lot last week old new thing
says the Balmer interview keeps asking
for a flash upgrade which I have chrome
IE and firefox all the same Ballmer
equals fail that seems kind of harsh
apparently that problem happened to a
lot of people though now in that case
the upgrade your flash message was
happening because the requested video
wasn't found in our database basically
the Balmer video was accidentally
promoted before it was published because
we were really excited about it and we
will also fix the whole mistake in flash
error message which some of you are also
seeing and thanks for the heads up also
here's a quick update on the cnet
conversations podcast situation it has
been added to see you at TV under tech
shows so for right now if you want it as
a podcast or an RSS feed just go to see
net TV choose it from the menu and then
click subscribe you can subscribe in
iTunes or you can just paste the link

just kind of complicated right now and
now to your snail mail first up the
mystery of the glitter letter it showed
up a couple of weeks ago but I didn't

lives in Malta and his card says that he
is seven years old so grant you are
pretty good at card making and thank you
