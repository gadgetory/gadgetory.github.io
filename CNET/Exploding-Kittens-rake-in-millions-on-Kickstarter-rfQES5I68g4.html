mean it's been the kind of thing we're
like I'm so excited about this project I
don't sleep like I lay there at night
like just like vibrating with joy of
what's happening well when we're playing
the game bomb squad the whole game
you're worried about the bomb where is
it like who has the bomb am I gonna get
the bomb there's all this stress and
fear of a bomb and I thought it'd be a
lot funnier if you're just fearing a
kitten cuz then the conversation playing
the game is fine where's the game no
please don't like to hear the kitten
like and I love that um so we kind of
struggle with it because the title is
funny but we're also like blowing up
cats which is not people aren't super
into that so I know you guys had some
moral dilemmas of that actually we
didn't at first when I was drawing the
cards i made the cats the bombs
themselves but it looked kind of like an
angry birds game because you got these
cats with like fuses coming off of them
and then I tried the cats just being
suicidal and just blowing themselves up
but that still didn't really like feel
right yeah and your heart it not as easy
sad cats just killing themselves it's
gonna work somewhat finally ended up
working was the cat's just killing
themselves out of negligence so in a few
of the cat cards or the kitten cards the
kittens are doing things like they'll
run across the keyboard in a submarine
and launch nuclear bombs for like not a
stick a dynamite blow up a pirate ship
so they kind of are doing it doing
things that kids naturally do can you
walk me through the process the creative
process of coming up with some of these
action cards I know there's some classic
open your characters like that Vera
dactyl but you have like that farts and
cheetah butts and i guess my real
question is what were you what were you
on when you were creating these action
cards well like a lot of them fell into
place because of the kitty theme like
for instance if you have a bomb car if
you draw it you can defuse it and you
don't you're not out of the game and you
would diffuse the kit and using things
like laser pointers and catnip
sandwiches and like cat yoga so those
kind of fell into place because they
felt the theme the rest of them just
sort of i am like an endless supply of
non-sequiturs i'm like a non sequitur
machine and i can just pull them out of
nowhere so i just start picking some of
my favorite animals and turning them in
don't like
a nice versions of those things and it
all kind of happened I have seen so many
Kickstarter's where you back the project
and then instead of getting the thing
you asked for you get two years worth of
email saying oh it's coming it's coming
we just this new thing is broken or we
the shirts were printed wrong or
whatever so we're really hesitant to
like add things that are complicated we
just want to add like more cards more
game we kept the Kickstarter really
simple we didn't want to do any complex
reward tier because like t-shirts and
things like that mostly we just wanted
this principle of if you give us money
and we give you a game if you give us
more money we give you more game so now
that we've hit this milestone were kind
of like well what should we do next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
