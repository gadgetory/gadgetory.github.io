welcome to the Apple buy for everything
good and bad inside the world of Apple
let's get to it and the big story this
week comes from a Bloomberg report that
says Apple is talking to Hollywood
studios to get early access for movies
on iTunes 20th Century Fox Time Warner
Warner Brothers and Universal Pictures
are confirmed to be looking to offer
higher priced home video rentals of new
movies just two weeks after their debut
in theaters it would be a huge change
from the normal 90 days or more window
that studios have typically given
exclusively to theaters and a big boost
to Apple and iTunes and I know there's
plenty of you that would love to stay at
home be able to talk during a movie you
know get all cuddly and flirty on the
couch while you're in your jammies well
you're probably doing that right now
watching the show hi now according to
the report premium price to online
rentals could be somewhere around
twenty-five to fifty dollars and the
report says this service is likely
happening in the next 18 months the
biggest concern is to make sure these
movies cannot be pirated and there's a
fear that footage and spoilers could be
leaked online but come on those same
issues have plagued movie theaters for
years now I'm a fan of this idea it
would make Apple look good by just
giving consumers another option but you
know what I'm still going to a theater
to watch row 1 they are requesting a
call sign it's um
Rogue rogue one till I get that 75 inch
4k OLED TV which is not happening
anytime soon
all right in the latest iPhone rumors of
the week Mac o Takara reports that
Apple's updated iPhones next year will
be called the iPhone 7s and 7s plus and
they will not get with the super cool
iPhone X name that really they should
just steal from us for its 10th
anniversary now Mac o Takara says the
next iPhone will come in an all-new red
color alongside the current lineup
it also refutes KGI reports and claims
the next iPhone will still retain its
aluminum body and won't be glass and it
will not include wireless charging now
this is also the same site that said a
glossy white color was coming but we
haven't seen it yet and this is also
what we call a rumour story okay we're
getting really close to the official
release of iOS 10.2 after the 7th
developer and public beta version was
released we've already talked about the
new Unicode emojis the new TV app and
you can even get these three new
wallpapers at this link right here
thanks to nine-to-five Mac if you're one
of those people that just likes to get
that stuff early so you know what you're
welcome and billboard reports Apple
music has just passed 20 million paid
subscribers 18 months after the service
was launched in June of 2015
Spotify still leaves at 40 million paid
subscribers but it's also a service that
launched back in 2008 now apples growth
has been impressive they've launched the
number one albums including Drake's
views Frank ocean's blonde and DJ
Khaled's major keys and you know what
that deserves a good Apple okay Tim Cook
thinks things are going pretty good for
the Apple watch as well after he
responded to a Reuters email and said
during the first week of holiday
shopping our cell through of Apple watch
was greater than any week in the
products history we're on track for the
best quarter ever for Apple watch and
see that sounds all great in all Tim but
just to remind you Apple still has never
released actual sales numbers for the
Apple watch like never ever translation
we brag about all of our big sales
numbers
unless they aren't big enough to brag
about and let's keep you all updated on
some of the issues that MacBook Pro
touch bar users are facing users are
complaining on Apple support communities
and reddit that they aren't getting
anywhere close to the 10 hour battery
life Apple has promised for the 13 and
15 inch MacBook Pros now some users are
reporting numbers in the 3 to 6 hour
range of battery life yikes
now battery estimates that are displayed
are one thing but people are reporting
actual battery life that is
significantly lower so we'll have to see
when and how Apple addresses this plus
the new MacBook Pros of ultimen giving
some users these unwelcome graphical
glitches on screen
see that's not modern art it's random
red bars that some users are seen
including other things like carrying
transparency issues and see this this
isn't a rave that's a new MacBook Pro
it's not affecting everyone leading
people to believe it might be a hardware
issue but according to a posting by
Craig federighi the graphical glitches
have been fixed in Mac OS 10 point 12
point Tuesday deceit that will
eventually roll out to everyone when it
goes live so again we will wait and see
but let's leave on a good note with this
new Kickstarter project if you're
looking to give back all the
functionality that your MacBook Pro lost
you probably want to check out the hyper
drive hub for the new MacBook Pro it
will only cost you 49 bucks
it uses two of the USB C ports and you
get back to Thunderbolt 3 USB C ports a
microSD and standard SD card slot for
media HDMI output for video and 2
standard USB 3 ports you know those
rectangular guys that almost all of your
accessories still use it pretty much
fixes everything that's wrong with the
MacBook Pro and you can check out the
details here on their Kickstarter page
and hyper team you get a good Apple for
apples bad apple
alright that's gonna do it for this
week's show you can email us at the
Apple bite at cnet.com or tweet me at
brian tom thanks so much for watching
we'll catch you all next time for
another bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
