welcome to f8 and I want to start today
by talking about protecting something
that is really incredibly important to
all of us and that is the integrity of
our elections in 2016 we were slow to
identify Russian interference we
expected more traditional cyber attacks
like phishing and Malware and hacking
and we identified those and notified the
right people but we didn't expect these
coordinated information operations and
large networks of fake accounts that
were now aware of so I sat down with our
teams after this and we said we will
never be unprepared for this again and
since then there have been important
elections like the French presidential
election the German elections the
Alabama Senate special election last
year and we've been more prepared we
deployed new AI tools that successfully
identified and took down tens of
thousands of fake accounts before they
could do anything
we've traced the fake account network
back to Russia and taken down their
network we're doing more we're requiring
everyone requiring I'm running political
and issue ads or running large pages to
be verified with a government ID we're
making ads more transparent so now
you're gonna be able to see who is
running a political ad who they're
targeting how much they're spending and
most importantly what other messages
they're sending to different people that
is a higher standard of transparency
than TV ads then print ads or anything
else you will find on the Internet by
the end of this year we will have 20,000
people working on security and content
review at Facebook now this is an
important election year not only the big
US midterms that are coming up with our
major elections around the world in
Mexico and Brazil there are elections
coming up in India and Pakistan and more
and we are focused on this in your web
browser you today have a simple way to
clear your cookies and clear your
browsing history right the idea is that
a lot of sites need this data to work
you need cookies but you should have the
ability to go in and clear your history
at any point that you want so we're
working on a version of this for
Facebook to
it's a simple control where you can
clear your browsing history what you've
clicked on the websites you visited and
so on and we're gonna call it clear
history and we're starting with
something that a lot of people have
asked about recently and that's the
information that we get from websites
and apps who are using Facebook's
advertising and analytics tools so you
can you're gonna be able to use this
tool to see the information about the
apps and websites you've interacted with
you'll be able to clear all this
information from your account and you'll
even be able to turn it off having this
information stored with your account
going forward this is the kind of
control that we think that people should
have so we're building this and we're
gonna have a lot more like this to talk
about soon so today we are announcing a
new set of features coming soon around
dating
it's gonna be for building real
long-term relationships all right not
just took ups it's gonna be in the
Facebook app but it's totally optional
it's opt-in if you want you can make a
dating profile and and I know a lot of
you gonna have questions about this so I
want to be clear that we've designed
this with privacy and safety in mind
from the beginning your friends aren't
gonna see your profile you're only going
to be suggested people who are not your
friends who have opted into dating who
fit your preferences although I can't
promise that you're gonna get emai it's
a tough world all right Chris Cox will
come up in a bed and walk you through
this in more detail so this is Jennifer
she's just moved to Chicago she's
interested in dating
she likes running and college football
so she this is her facebook profile she
would see in the upper right a place she
can tap to go to dating home the first
thing she would do here is set up a
dating profile this is just her first
name it is not visible to her friends
it's only visible to folks using the
dating service and it doesn't show up in
newsfeed or anywhere else once she's
done that she can go browse events and
groups this will let her see things in
the city and groups related to her
interests so let's say she sees a grew
an event she wants to go to she can go
and unlock the event so unlocking the
event will mean she shares her dating
profile with other people who are going
to the event are using the dating
service and have also unlocked it then
she can browse people who were there say
she wants to talk to Jay she'll start a
conversation with a photo from his
profile this will encourage we hope a
more meaningful interaction then if he
wants to respond they'll do so in a
private messaging inbox connected to the
profile this is text only as a safety
measure and it's not connected to
messenger or whatsapp because folks
wanted this to be in a separate space
and not commingled with the rest of
their inbox so we hope that this will
help more
folks meet and hopefully find partners
we're excited to share a lot more on
this over the next few months with
oculus go we're introducing three
flagship experiences for social
entertainment in VR a brand new version
of oculus rooms and two entirely new
social apps oculus TV and oculus venues
let's start with oculus TV you get this
ginormous virtual TV in your living room
that's equivalent to a 180 inch screen
in reality and it works just like the
best Smart TVs out there use the
controller to change channels navigate
around and choose between live and
on-demand content and starting this
summer you'll be able to invite friends
cousins and grandparents to have a watch
party in VR wherever they are in the
world
oculus TV launches this month and we're
adding tons of great content partners
over the next few months including ESPN
Netflix Hulu and Showtime another
awesome way to spend quality time with
friends in VR is oculus rooms and today
we're launching a totally new version of
oculus rooms that gives you even more
funds to more fun things to do with your
friends in VR we built a new environment
that is even more inviting with things
we know people love to do together you
can watch 3-d movies or listen to music
while hanging out and playing a board
game together and speaking of board
games we're excited to announce a new
partnership with Hasbro to bring some of
the world's most popular board games to
oculus rooms we're starting with boggle
which goes live this month and soon also
monopoly and Trivial Pursuit experiences
these are super fun games that people
love and that you can now play with your
friends in the r and feel like you're
there together
next is oculus venues which is going to
be your ticket to live social events in
VR like concerts sports comedy nights
and movie screenings check this out
you get to sit in this awesome VR
amphitheater with thousands of people
and watch premium events together like
soccer live in a hundred and eighty
degrees you can see and hear the crowd
and really feel the energy in the room
it is great and
the summer session in oculus venues
kicks off with our first event a live
concert from Vance joy on May 30th we
have a great lineup of live event
partners coming to oculus venues live
concerts from AEG
live games from the MLB and the NBA
movie screenings from Lionsgate plus
comedy nights and tons of entertainment
from next VR for $1.99 you get access to
over 1,000 apps and games tons of
experiences to broaden your horizons in
some of the most exciting social
entertainment today we're also launching
a version of oculus go with double the
storage memory 64 gigabytes for 249 so
our goal here is to create this real
feeling of presence right like you're
right there
with someone even if they're halfway
around the world and you know this idea
of being physically your being feeling
like you're there with some even you
can't physically be there someone we've
talked about a lot today with video chat
but over the long term virtual reality
and eventually augmented reality we're
going to take this to a completely
different level or it's not just going
to be about you know being able to see
someone's face on a on a small screen
I'm you're gonna actually be able to
feel like you're there with someone so
here's an example of how compelling I
think that this is gonna be you know now
if you have some photos from your
childhood home we can now use computer
vision to fill in the gaps with this
pointillism effect and recreate the
rooms of your childhood home where you
grew up so you're gonna vote to go into
VR with your family and visit and feel
like you are right there it feels like
you're in a dream it is wild so this
work of mapping out immersive spaces is
just another important step on the path
to creating this real feeling of
presence so we've been preparing oculus
go for
and the big news I have to share today
is oculus co is shipping today starts at
$1.99 it is the first really affordable
stand-alone virtual reality headset it's
launching with more than a thousand apps
and it has the highest quality lenses
and optics that we have ever built into
a VR device oculus co is going to be
it's the easiest way to get into VR and
we think that this is going to be how a
lot of people experience virtual reality
and virtual presence for the first time
so it turns out that a lot of people are
using live video basically just to hang
out when you can't be physically
together or it's amazing how much of all
of our use of these social tools is just
to get as close to feeling like we're
there with someone when we can't
physically be there so today to make
this easier we're announcing video chat
and Instagram you're gonna be able to
just tap on a new camera icon right in
the top of any direct thread that you
have and you're gonna build a video chat
one on water with groups you're gonna be
able to minimize the video while you're
chatting and using Instagram and and I
think that this is gonna be a really big
deal and people are really gonna like
this we are also building more creative
ways for people to share an Instagram
and a last year at f8 we announced the
AR camera effects platform and today
we're bringing it to Instagram
so now anyone is gonna be able to build
face filters and effects when you go to
your camera you're gonna be able to see
effects that are relevant to you and
from the accounts that you follow if
you're browsing stories and you see a
cool effect you always be able to try it
on so we're excited to get this in
people's hands soon and more than 200
million people use Explorer on Instagram
every day since we launched hashtag
following and just last December more
than 100 million people now follow
hashtags so we want to make it even
easier to find the communities for the
things that you're interested in so
we're launching a completely new design
for Explorer that is going to organize
the content around topic channels now so
now your Explorer is gonna be even more
focused on the things you're interested
in
now when you're messaging you really
want a simple and fast experience so
we're taking this moment to completely
redesign messenger to focus on these
ideas and here's what the new messenger
is going to look like now I mentioned
earlier that we are bringing the AR
camera effects platform to Instagram a
really fun way for people to use
augmented reality to connect with their
family and friends privately and in real
time now I don't know about you guys but
um but my daughter's when um what I call
them when I'm traveling you know they
they love these effects right
Priscilla will be there and actually go
look mama dad does a bunny or an ogre
this year were really excited to
announce em translations for the very
first time you're going to have the
ability to talk to almost anyone you
want in the world at an unprecedented
scale even if you don't speak the same
language and this will power connections
that weren't possible before and all
kinds of different circumstances and
definitely make the world a lot smaller</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
