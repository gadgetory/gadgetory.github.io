NFC tags to automate your life this week
I'll show you how to step it up a notch
and really integrate NFC into your
day-to-day life we're making a DIY phone
dog that not only charges your Android
phone but also uses NFC to automate
things you do before you go to bed so
Molly I already made this one you can
have it slightly drinkie and I'll go
ahead and make a new one with my
practice and I'll show you how to make
it so you can follow along too so to get
started I'm just gonna take this one
apart you're going to need your USB cord
a hardcover book with a sleeve but you
don't mind murdering a box-cutter with a
brand new blade this one is nice and
sharp you'll need a pencil a ruler and
of course an NFC tag okay to get started
take the sleeve off of that hardcover
book and we're going to need to cut a
small rectangle in the cover use your
ruler to cut a rectangle pretty close to
the spine
it doesn't have to be perfect it just
needs to be big enough so that the court
can actually go through it now grab your
box cutter and get to work this is where
you're really gonna need to bring the
muscles out because this hardcover is
actually a lot tougher to get through
than it looks so okay I think we're
almost there
and don't worry about making this really
pretty it's gonna be covered with the
sleeve anyway it looks like we're almost
through all right that wasn't that hard
now comes the kind of tedious part but
it is kind of fun ripping a book apart
because you know your parents never let
you do that when you're a little so the
first time I did this it really made a
mess so be prepared to bring out the
vacuum what you're doing is making a
tunnel you're really digging out a
tunnel so that the court can run through
it it needs to be about an inch thick so
for me that's gonna be pretty much
through the entire book all right here
we go for the first few I'm going to use
the ruler to make sure it's a nice clean
line if you need to take a break at some
point go ahead because trust me
your arms are gonna be a little sore
after this project I need a garbage can
if you mess up a little bit it's okay
the book will be closed since you really
can't read it anymore can you confetti
for the next party you throw
halfway there arms are so sore
I need a glass of water I'm sweaty
things we do in the name of technology
oh alright now we just want to clean it
up a little bit you'll never really open
this but I do like to keep my projects
pretty clean okay let's see if it's deep
enough to hold our cable actually that's
perfect let's see how it sits that looks
pretty good to me now if you want you
could just keep it raw you don't have to
put a sleeve back on you could use a
hard cover without a sleeve but I like
the really clean look because I want
this to be a stealthy NFC dock oh and
speaking of NFC we still need to put our
tag in there so I'm just gonna take this
tag and slip it in the corner here cover
goes back on and right where's the USB
cord is pushing on the cover I'm gonna
cut a little slit okay
there we go your NFC Talk is done now it
wasn't easy I can't say it was easy
because my arms are sore and I'm
sweating but it is so worth it so I'm
just going to take a couple of bucks
stack them on top and this will probably
end up going by my bedside table now
because of that I programmed this NFC
tag to do things like set my alarm
put Pandora on and put my phone on
silent so I tap the phone here all those
things happen automatically with NFC I
put my phone on the dock it charges and
you're set okay Molly I hope you enjoy
your NFC dock as for me I need my
much-needed drink of water
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
