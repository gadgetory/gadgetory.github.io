we are at CES 2014 we're taking a look
at the I lock ID iris scanning security
solution and it is basically scanning
your iris so you don't have to use
passwords to unlock your laptop and it's
very interesting a little solution very
convenient and we're gonna get a quick
look at how it works so how does this
actually happen here so I like ID uses
iris based authentication technology
created by eye lock and what we're doing
is we're taking rapid motion video of
your iris which is the colored part of
your eye
we're using our algorithms to locate the
480 points of each of your irises and
then we are creating a very long
template which is unique only to you and
I've already enrolled and associated my
identity with this computer so when I go
to log in to this computer right now I
will no longer need to enter a password
it will simply look for a match of my
template and if it finds me and
authenticates me it should let me into
the computer okay so you base is just
like stare into the the scanners and so
I'm just gonna look at the video camera
which is right here in the bezel you'll
see a state change on this LED light and
it's gonna go dark blue means it found
me as a live person and not a video or a
photo of me and I do have access
privileges so it's literally just unlock
the computer without a username and
password wow that was pretty fast so
essentially this is a it's more than
just a proof of concepts going to be
hopefully coming to some partners by the
end of this year maybe early next year
in 2014 early 2015
but so far looks pretty interesting so
there you have it folks
I'm Brian Bennett at CNN and we just
took a first look at the eye lock ID</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
