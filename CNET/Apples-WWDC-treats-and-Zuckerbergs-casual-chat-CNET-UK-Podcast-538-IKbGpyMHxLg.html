what Apple had in store for us at this
year's WWDC and whether the new Jurassic
world movie is worth your time yes all
coming up on the scene at UK podcast
hello and a big welcome back to both of
you
hello and to everyone hello yes and
we're back
yeah not only back yeah we're not live
but we are but we are back and we're
back in video form it has been a while
Cindy numbers in video it has yeah it's
been a while since we had a podcast
we've been taking a break recharging our
batteries going along holidays a long
bath a lot of traveling a lot of yeah
getting ready and one inside of revamp
the podcast into a better form and this
is that better form I wonder if it's
possible to see how much we've aged
horribly in the two months or so clearly
there's still some way to go a little
bit of a little bit of ways to go but
we're gonna kick off straightaway by
handing over to you Katie because he can
of traveling you've been yeah you've
been all over where have you been
globe-trotting what have you been well I
don't want to overstate it I did go very
very long way all across the English
Channel to Paris international travel
are we yes I went to Paris a couple of
weeks ago now actually to see Mark
Zuckerburg speak at a conference called
viva tech actually went and I saw a
number of other people speak their ABC I
was a Satya Nadella from Microsoft and
the French president Emmanuel macron was
there you know lots of kind of big names
and but I was primarily there to see
Mark Zuckerberg now obviously Zuckerberg
hasn't been speaking publicly that much
over the past few months ever since the
Cambridge analytic a scandal practice of
embarrassment
yeah oh well I I think you know for PR
reasons as well probably that sounds fun
the the the president of uber Mark
Zuckerberg who else was appearing some
dictators just like everyone who had to
apologize and just people who were
having a real terrible time sounds like
a really bad supergroup isn't it
Mark Zuckerberg on sax well I mean
actually I was kind of a bit gutted when
I when I was actually there because so
the person that was interviewing him on
stage is the CEO of publicists the PR
agency so it was it was very very very
gentle he looked this bad your average
Sunday
yeah what's your favorite color you know
like he's over the past few months he's
being used to speaking in front of
Senators Congressmen
and members of the European Parliament
he's really been kind of trying at least
to grill him on the issues that matter
and there was not even a single mention
of Cambridge analytic well recently
person the person who does Facebook to
PR and they're just like no let's just
have you know he'll be on stage with
only if our own PR team does the
questions so like I say just a total
fluff piece what's your favorite type of
pasta mark yeah Oh in the Far filleted
himself to to talking about to bringing
up some of the issues in the interview
just wrestled integral yes no no no mark
no no he kind of focused on like you
know he really opens as well by saying
you know like we've been doing this that
we'd be making changes and sort of kind
of you know there was no kind of apology
there was no he seems much more relaxed
much happier you know talked about a lot
of his other ideas and you know sort of
things he has coming up so one of the
things that he's going to do that he
talked about is create a kind of Supreme
Court for Facebook and what this is
gonna involve is so at the moment if you
if you have something that's taken down
on Facebook you know somebody complains
about something that you've posted
there's no kind of there's no where to
redress your like issues and say you
know redress your grievance that
grievances and say actually I think this
should remain up and this is why and
what he's trying to do is create a
system where where people can do that
they can challenge decisions that
Facebook's made about what can be posted
and what can't and I think this is
primarily I think it's so kind of almost
like a free speech issue because
Facebook doesn't want to be you know it
wants to be on the right side of the
free speech debate but at the same time
it doesn't want to be allowing hate
content at the terrorists content you
know content that you know a lot of
people would find objectionable so well
they I think what they're gonna do is
try and create this sort of Supreme
Court that's not made up of people who
work at Facebook it's
gonna be external people that have an
understanding of what Facebook's values
are and what its aims and what its
mission is but who ultimately is a kind
of like you know there's a bit of a
there's a line drawn between the people
that work internally at Facebook and
this these are the people so would that
be if if they you said like if you you
have something taken down you can
challenge say whether it should be left
up but presumably can it work in the
opposite way if you've asked for
something to be removed and then they
just said they say no this is this is
fine can you then challenge that because
I've had that yeah many times
with because I have there's a photo of
me which for some reason as we know has
a very very high Google ranking and is
regularly used people will take that
picture use as their profile picture
they will also then search for that
picture find other pictures of me and
I've had Facebook accounts where it's
just full of pictures of me and
catfishing people catfishing people yes
basically that's what they call it yeah
and you know people going around looking
for I don't know I don't know what
they're probably for tinder I I guess
and almost maybe right but when I report
I mean this is a video podcast you're
not gonna get away with that right I
know when it was an audio form I can get
away with being this young handsome man
and now the cameras are on it he's this
chubby thirty year old but when I
reported that to Facebook the questions
have to answer is you know I'm are they
pretending to be me and and technically
they're not they are presenting to be
they have their own name they're just
using my pictures and then so the only
thing I could potentially say is well
that that's more like intellectual
property thing that using images that
I've taken without permission but that
isn't Facebook's issue in the same way
as our Instagram there's no easy way of
if someone reposts your picture without
crediting you is no easy way of getting
that taken down you're going to go to a
whole other place to report that you can
report it as being inappropriate as in
they've posted porn or something or that
it's spam and it's just like a box
that's annoying but there's no way of
saying this account has stolen my
picture hmm
and that's kind of the issue that I have
with Facebook so I'm hoping that their
Supreme Court
would allow for this set for the same
thing where I can go and say well
actually this is what they've done and
that's a real problem well I mean he
hasn't elaborated on that but I would
also hope that that would be the case
too and I think just I think we can
expect to hear a lot more of this from
him over the coming months he's
mentioned this this idea twice in these
words now which means that you know he's
kind of planted the seed and I imagine
that will help you kind of keep bringing
it up and it's something that we'll see
Facebook established in their
not-too-distant future and hopefully
that will be one of the features but you
know overall I think Mark Zuckerberg he
he's really really had a really nice
time in France command did he go running
as he goes running that was a bit of a
thing that he did a few years ago it was
a special project he has he has these
kind of special projects and one of them
was running in lots of different cities
all over the world and then the Supreme
Court idea is another one and you know
for another one he tried to learn
Mandarin I don't think you did learn
Mandarin very well and he tried to build
an AI Butler for his home ok is he still
killing some million eating only the
things he project I'm not sure is there
gonna be a is there gonna be a UK show
in this tour that he's doing of going
around apologizing to people well
interesting you should ask that because
actually the politicians over here
really hope that he comes to the UK I
spoke to him you know he don't waste
he's provided evidence now to Congress
in the u.s. to the European Parliament
and you know they we have a fake news
inquiry currently ongoing in Parliament
hearing it's according to the quarry
into fake news yes no they thought
inquiry the dissipate news yes just so
clearly yes and he this Enquirer has
been going on since last July say way
before that Cambridge journalistic a
scandal broke obviously Facebook has
always been a kind of central component
to it but ever since we found out about
the
you know dead Facebook personal user
data being mishandled and it's become
even more pressing that they would
really you know they've spoken to other
people at Facebook you know the CTO Mike
Schroepfer
came over here and gay
evidence to Parliament but they really
very they think that there are only
questions that Mark Zuckerberg can
answer and the buck does stop with him
and he said that and his colleagues have
said that and I spoke to Damien Collins
who's the MP no relation
he's the MP he was the chair of the
committee
that's Manning this inquiry and he he
told me you know that he thinks that
Zuckerberg has a duty to come to the UK
because you know this is where the story
broke it involves British researchers
British universities British newspapers
British a British company Cambridge on
the list ago is based here after
something to be proud of who said we're
not important on the world stage yeah
and also potentially could influence
breaks it exactly so you know he so so
Damon Collins is adamant that Mark
Zuckerberg should come here and he's
still considering you know potentially
issuing a formal summons for him
it's just poking come on this friend
requests been ignored so that interview
is on you interested any concept you
want quick access to its pin to the top
of my Twitter feed at the moment so you
can go in there and have a look to see
what he says he's really kind of quite
dynamic politician at the moment making
lots of headlines so yeah well sounds
interesting we'll see what else comes
out of that but for now we're going to
move on to WWDC which is of course
Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference
by worldwide I mean only in California
so much more exciting for us because we
didn't actually have to go so we're not
cynical about it no yeah I didn't even
watch the keynotes on the first on the
handle in a while I was no we watched
every minute of it we were very excited
about salmon day we picked it apart we
discussed it on Twitter with our
colleagues
I was stroking my cat I noticed that it
was loud it was about just some little
things no major announcements it was
more about polishes that are you really
much great existing products a bit
better yes basically so the thanks rich
there the theme really of WWDC this year
was not about big major updates we
didn't see any no new hardware of
any kind often we will see some bits and
bobs coming home pod year we've had
watches and an iPad to match something
we've had nothing this time round
instead it's been about sort of smaller
changes to refine what's already there
and I think well a few things for
example now I'll see how groundbreaking
you find this ok me moji me mochi mochi
that's like emojis mama it is exactly
like whatever that thing is you just
said it's basically an emoji which Apple
brought out last year which is the
talking faces that uses the front their
face tracking tech on the front of the
iPhone X - turn to animate this emoji as
you're talking but now basically you can
create your self in an emoji form you
can create the hair and you can sculpt
it to be one of you look like basically
what Samsung did with an emoji on the
galaxy s 9 to a launch nd BC but
crucially hopefully it's not crap you
know let's not forget the original
source of this idea which clearly was
bitmoji which is now owned by snap oh
yeah with the moji yeah which I still
think you know I haven't actually used
I've used Samsung's version of this
feature a are emoji and but I haven't
haven't tried apples yet but to be
honest from what I've seen I still
prefer bitmoji in the same way but maybe
you'll like me merging than in that case
because Samsung's version we use it
quite a lot MT BC and there is a couple
of videos that we made where we we
turned it into a game show I think you
were on on that game show actually where
I would create a celebrity in anime in
in a are emoji form it's so catchy yeah
if I can't remember which of the emojis
did things and and seeing people can
guess them and it is quite difficult and
the face tracking on the sampson didn't
really work all that well so i'm looking
forward to kind of seeing what Apple
does it looks like you can customize
yourself a lot more some other stuff
that they've got on FaceTime you can now
have FaceTime or you will be able to
have FaceTime group conversations with
32 people at once oh I've just been
waiting for that
- for so long well I don't have that
many friends but what about they can
just what about remote working yes
that's that's what I think is exciting
about this is that it gives you the
option of because we all have bosses who
are all around the world yours is in New
York mine's in New York yours is San
Francisco I think yeah so it's in Dublin
yeah all over the world it means you can
have these meetings where you're face to
face I mean yeah time zones are still in
issue so if haven't been find a way to
somehow time shift these meetings using
time travel presumably then great but
and yeah go for families as well as big
families extended families people who
got it around the world I'm on board
with video chat I have no idea what the
the kind of the bandwidth requirements
would be on the quality I think quite
low I mean because FaceTime already is
quite low I think maybe like a minimum
of like one Meg right I say maybe not
even that much and I think the idea is
that having more people on that call
doesn't mean something you need 32 Meg
in order to do it because it's done it's
handled in different ways so I think the
demands shouldn't be much more the
demands are largely on your up plates
for you to put in your right face out
there rather than receiving the ones
coming in other things we've got as well
is there more pushes on a are kits which
is Apple's own development platform for
augmented reality things with a Orkut to
basically to make it more easily usable
by developers surfing's coming in
MacBooks
both of you have those I'm saying there
is a new Mac OS Mojave of course named
again after areas of California which is
what they're doing after High Sierra etc
Tim Cook himself said that we're excited
to take the Mac a huge leap forward I
don't agree versus usually so we've got
dark mode which basically gives it a
dark look if you're using it at night so
you don't have a bright screen staring
at you I don't get that all I mean if
it's an accessibility feature if it's
people with vision impairments or
astigmatism or anything like that then
fair enough then that's definite feature
that should be offered if you just want
to lie in bed with your laptop so go to
bed yeah to sleep it's it's late you've
been on your laptop for too long it's
hurting your eyes it's time to put
if you're in college just go to sleep
we'll take this clip cut this clip but
that Apple should just have this clip
appear on phones at 10:00 p.m.
are you one of those people that has the
phone on at night when you embed it and
it's glaring at you interface yeah oh
yeah yeah I do try I do put it on night
mode you know change the screen color
and trying to turn the brightness down
but you know it's still quite intrusive
I think yeah so we've had also some
other interface tweaks episode refreshed
app store which is going to have some
like curated content kinda like they've
done with the iOS App Store
which I think it's kind of nice I don't
say no hardware but I do want to touch
on the fact that there is a promise of
quite a lot of iPhones coming later and
how many well potentially three or more
on iPhones be gone say you want three or
more because that's how many it might be
for a perfect this prediction that's how
many it might be um because we may have
the iPhone se - now the SE remember is
the the smaller version basically the
iPhone 5 body but with modern specs
whether a couple of rumors about that
phone firstly it may be look exactly the
same the exactly the same casing screen
size everything but just we've beefed up
internal stuff and prolly bought a
camera but also we may see you the
iPhone X S II so the iPhone X style but
with but as a smaller form factor phone
so basically think stretch screen so
tiny bezels with the knotch
but but a smaller phone well they just
call it the X even I don't know no you
can't put yeah and then we may also see
the XE sort of the iPhone X plus so that
would be a much bigger version
potentially up to 6.5 inches which was
the biggest iPhone with with ever seen
it would be unnecesarry potentially but
it would make it a much more more of a
rival to me like Samsung's Galaxy Note
which is particularly important because
there are rumors that that phone would
allow for Apple pencil stylus support
which is a rumor we've had before on the
iPhones but that one could well be the
case if is that big you know it will
basically make your phone like a little
notebook and you can quickly do some
notes that could be quite nice and I
presume they may also do a maybe a
half-size version of the Apple pencil so
you can easily slip it in your pocket
even more likely to you to lose it yeah
yeah so that's pretty much sure and
that's that's it for Hardware upcoming
wise so I think there's a lot to look
forward to for Apple later to you and
that's what we'll see in September as
always because that's when it does its
main iPhone launch September there's a
cup of it there's a couple other things
there's the intelligent tracking
prevention which is all about stopping
social media buttons and widgets and
commenting the systems and that kind of
thing from tracking you around the web
which is quite cool obviously very very
topical but I think probably my favorite
has to be the that some some iOS apps
can now work on on Macs yeah
which is kind of cool to get like a
little kind of cut down almost like a
widget II version of the app but they
started with stocks like people have
been trying to get stocks to delete it
off their phones for 10 years and now
they're like no we're not gonna let you
do that but now you can have it on your
computer and it's a default stocks is a
default upon all my cell phone oh yeah I
don't think you can I think they brought
in like a couple years ago they were
like yeah finally you can delete stocks
I just want to know like what the
because they must have done some market
research these companies on why they
should have by default this stocks out
but I've never believed some people must
use yeah and if otherwise they wouldn't
be nothing what have I been emptying
well I wanted to do a quick nod towards
the 1 + 6 because it's a phone that has
launched since we last podcasted and it
is currently what we would say is
definitely the best sort of mid-range
phone around that it's the usual thing
of extremely them right now you have
someone hamster must have given that to
you points to himself catfished by
someone you do get catfished it one yeah
someone
intend to look like me I got a phone out
of it yeah with all / six yet is again
like great phone great performance and
cut down price but I took it with me to
to France to photograph the bugatti
chiron which is a three million pound
hypercar one of the fastest production
cars in the world which is amazing I'm
doing a whole feature about the Bugatti
which you'll see on Sina at a later date
but I did this piece on how to
photograph the car using just the phone
and which has been really really popular
on Sina and I've sort of wanted to kind
of point out that that is there because
it was a really cool really cool shoots
of how I use the phone because basically
to take a rolling shot of the car you
know the sort of the image will put the
image on screen so people who are
watching it can see it but in audio form
I'll describe it in that when you see
the car on the road the road is blurred
so you put the car is pin-sharp a real
sense of motion that dynamic shot of a
of a performance car really speeding
down the road but to do that you need to
use a slow shutter speed and you can't
do that with phones without it going far
too bright because letting in too much
light little trick you buy a piece of
neutral density filter paper which is
basically like sunglasses for a lens
cuts out a little square and just
duct-tape it crudely over the lens I
mean you can do in manual mode that slow
shutter shot and I still get the light
it cost 50 P for that little piece of
stuff to put over and it let me take
this really awesome shot of the Bugatti
which I'm the sort of shot that I would
never thought I could take on the phone
and the how to do that is in the article
it is in there who can you actually get
little sunglasses are they like little
squares they're all kind of I imagine we
like big green novelty sunglasses that
you put on your phone yeah but that's
basically that's what you're thinking
yeah and it's got the fake nose and
mustache relate as well so you could
disguise your phone as some thanks I'll
let some good tips in there it's a great
photos yes you have a gun have a look
thank you
and I also shot the rolls-royce dawn
with that phone so ever some cool shots
in there of kind of what to keep in mind
if you're interested in taking photos a
podcast one of my favorite things about
that story is that is it the rolls-royce
one where you kind of
drove up into the mountains on your own
where no one knew where you were and
then climbed on wet logs to take some
photos that actually was the McLaren 572
when I was because I was driving a road
trip back from Switzerland and yeah I
think that's really dangerous because I
climbed on this bit I would agree I I
eventually managed to persuade Andy to
share his location with me on his iPhone
right and because he was you know he was
all over the place so he wasn't really
in contact much and didn't have loads of
signal and and I was driving my phone
somebody needs to know where he is I
think I think little free sort of danger
is what made that story even more
interesting for me but they go key tips
the danger is also taking a quarter
million pound supercar on snow-covered
roads through mountain passes and power
sliding on corners that's funny
I'm not no we'll pass it over to you
rich because we need to touch on the
culture going riddles and excitement
why do how about we go to a theme park
for the dinosaurs well we can't but what
we can do is we can watch Jurassic world
fallen Kingdom which is out this weekend
so yeah and I quite enjoyed it it's
quite fun it's the I think I liked it
better like the first Jurassic world
which was itself a reboot the original
Jurassic Park and yeah fallen Kingdom is
good it's a it's quite good for us if
you're listening in the UK because it
comes out it's already out here and it's
not coming out in the US for another
couple of weeks so if you have any
American friends you can go and see it
and then lord it over them with your
dinosaur is so exciting and excitement
remember the days when films used to
come out in the u.s. six months before
they came out here now we're having our
revenge yeah exactly this sort of gets a
secondary but just quick you're talking
about Jurassic world I liked it a lot
it's um it's it's got this kind of
interesting
almost like key change in the middle of
it it starts off as a Jurassic Park
movie they have to go back to the island
again and they go to the island Chris
Pratt Bryce Dallas Howard some some
nerdy scientist go to their the famous
island and they run around in the forest
and they're chased by dinosaurs and
there's a scene where they've got her
like go into a bunker and flip a switch
and there's a dinosaur chasing luminous
I'm over the furniture and all that kind
of you know that kind of excitement and
action-adventure and then Will Smith
comes in and the aliens arrive and it
suddenly men in black yeah I'm anyone
starts rapping oh yeah it's great
everybody forgets everything that's
happened up to then no they did there
actually is this like we're change it
becomes a very different movie they kind
of were giving too much away going too
much into it they kind of they leave the
island and and it becomes a very
different almost horror movie and it's
an inch it's it's like something I don't
think you've really seen in Jurassic
Park movies before or at least it's like
focusing in on elements of Jurassic Park
that we haven't had a whole movie based
around like suspense in tension so has
always been there but stuff that was
certainly missing from the first
Jurassic world movie so if you if you
didn't think the Jurassic world had
enough kind of scares and tension and
suspense and this is where we gonna be
the feel for you but do you think people
if people are going you know diehard
fans of original Jurassic diehard fans
okay fans yeah of original Jurassic Park
yeah and classic grassy park are they
going to like this sounds like the sort
of thing that they would complain about
you know oh it's not this is very
different sort of thing they might like
it more because it's moving away from
the original and not trying to replicate
something that can't really be
replicated well yeah one thing that's
good that's kind of that's sort of
struck me is the on paper it's very very
similar to the first Jurassic Park
sequel which was the lost world
like it has a very similar sort of
stretch to it but it's done in a very
different way and what are things I like
about it is with this kind of change
halfway through the movie where it kind
of transitions into a different kind of
movie and then leads up to a big ending
that kind of that takes the franchise
forward in a way that none of the
previous sequels ever have that the
sequels have always previously been they
go to the island there's a new dinosaur
there's some slight different people in
it that's kind of it at the end of it
it's basically the same as what happened
what's happened by the star like the
world they exist in was basically so but
this is more like something like the
recent Planet the Apes movies or an or
even the last Jedi in the way that it
kind of turns the store at the franchise
upside down and the series upside down
and
well yeah whether you like that or not I
know where we original fans go for that
or not I don't know but it does mean
that when they go for Jurassic world 3
which is not gonna be for another three
years so your long long way to wait but
that is going to be a very very
different movie and that will definitely
be a movie that is unlike anything
you've ever seen in the Jurassic world
drastic park is the Chris Pratt still in
it Chris Pratt isn't it does he do that
you know hand out to the Raptors yeah
whoa boy whoa yeah chill yeah just take
a breather have some ice over this
there's one and he's us there's one
particular bit of it again coming so
going to too much there's a bit of
physical comedy in it which is one of
the weirdest and possibly funniest
things I've seen in a summer blockbuster
for quite a while so I so look out for
that I really enjoyed a lot of Chris
Pratt's physical comedy in Parks and Rec
you know there was some real kind of I
mean there was real moments there so if
it's anything like those I can imagine
it jarring quite a lot but at the same
time anything that brings more of that
I'd be happy to see yes Chris Pratt
seems intent on sort of reimagining
himself as serious action hero rather
than lovable Andy Dwyer ya know they
said this doesn't take itself
particularly seriously although having
said that there is some subtext there is
a majestic Park was always about kind of
the intersection of science and humanity
and but the original movies they were
that you know that was that famous line
they were always so concerned with
whether they could they didn't stop to
think when they should talking about
scientists like where they write to to
interfere with genetics and then but
this by the time this movie's coming
audience always has this kind of like
nihilistic take on it which has moved a
step past that which is not that is it
right to do these things but this does
happened and we've got to deal with it
so it kind of plays into climate change
particularly because the way the movie
is about some climate change stuff going
on there but also just generally the
idea of like you know going back to
Facebook and going back to all these
things that they weren't supposed to do
what they did but now they have so how
do we fix it unintended exactly how do
we deal with these unintended
consequences which is I mean it's not
done a particularly heavy way it's not
like it's gonna bore the kids but it's
kind of an interesting again a step on
from the original original early movies
the kingdom which is apparently fallen
as per the title is that the kingdom of
the dinosaurs or the kingdom of men I
mean I would say that is probably one of
those things where they think of the
title first and then they announced that
the release date in the title and then
they write the script because I would
have to wonder there's probably all
American if at all
there's no Kings there's no but there's
a bit of I mean some stuff falls off
some other stuff there's also loads of
dinosaurs in this one as well actually
just I mean just from a similar dance
just yeah there's probably more
dinosaurs because they've come in there
CGI so you might not love them as much
as like the original animatronic ones
but there's so many which might stuff
and let's just loads them loads dancers
running around loads different diets I
don't say for Jurassic Park movie yeah I
think if the original Jurassic Park and
there's only something you actually what
if you actually count it there is
something like 17 minutes of dinosaurs
and it was another 17 minutes of CGI or
something probably they they lean a lot
more heavily on the anticipation yeah
yeah they're kind of the noises and the
sound effects in there hmm and it makes
you think that it's more than that yeah
you can when you see the whole dinosaur
in in that when you counting those
minutes or does this a bit where you
just see that velociraptors clawed sort
of doing does that not count because
you're only seeing like 0.5% of a
dinosaur yeah CDC lot a lot of dinosaurs
in this which is nice and sometimes
those that I have no idea what their
names were just kind of running around
to having fun I'd get presumed they
don't know because are they still ones
that they've created is the original
Jurassic Park there are real dinosaurs
and it was all about how great they were
and then Jurassic world comes out and it
suddenly I know no real dinosaurs aren't
good enough no one likes them they're
boring so we've we've created some
stupid a race yeah
very there is a bit of that
unfortunately booked them anyway and so
that's drastic world that I quite
enjoyed it yeah that's what I had a chat
to Colin Trevorrow the guy who wrote it
as well interesting enough and he had
some interesting things to say about the
kind of the experimental structure of
writing up like a summer family action
based blockbuster that actually is a bit
experimental and that has this weird
structure like halfway through it okay
it takes an interesting left turn then
becomes unexpectedly different movie so
you can look out for that on cnn.com and
but yeah also we're so going back to
what we talked about before about the
gap of being able to lord it over
americans with their with with our
jurassic world
spoilers no don't don't spoil jurassic
world don't don't tell them coming up
soon we're all very excited to see the
next model movie ant-man and the wasp
but it's coming out in the US on July
the 6th and in Australia on July the 5th
and it's not coming out over here until
the 3rd of August we have to pick a
month we have to wait a month because
the World Cup because Owen about you but
I can't watch two things at the same
time in the same month and not be and be
sufficiently thrilled by both of them
I'm appalled by this I think we should
start you go petition I mean I I mean if
they're a huge crossover audience I
guess this is a really big film so there
probably is but you know the people that
are really really passionate about it
probably they might not be also been to
the World Cup i I think you know at some
point you're probably gonna want to take
a break as well so also why not delay it
altogether because currently from wrong
but the US and Australia are also in the
world they're also in the world and
therefore relevant to the World Cup well
there you go for some reason Disney is
just like nope so that can happen you
can wait a month so yeah sorry ant-man
and the wasp fans in Britain who are not
football fans you will just have to
pirate it you just have to work I think
it's because watching the World Cup is
mandatory in Britain it is actually
compulsory for school yeah yeah it's
part of our education how to drink tea
and watch the World Cup and I only
really got one of those things down see
if you can guess which anyway so yeah so
but there's also more movies coming up
Mission Impossible for now all that kind
of stuff so look out for those we'll
have reviews and that kind of thing
coming zing you also have do you see
early man which I'm everything out for a
long a long time I'm not bringing this
up for like recent season the newsworthy
stage but largely because I'm really I
haven't seen it but should I idea and
it's a delight and the thing about that
actually that was another movie that was
that it came out at the start of this
year so it came at the start of the
World Cup here and it was it's about
cavemen who play football and it just
seemed like the most of his wealth carp
cash grab but from paper bag its
delightfully its Nick Park directing
it's a great movie it's you know if your
kids want a fun movie about football
then then it's great because it is about
Kevin and it also has this like there's
a whole bunch of really I'm not gonna
get to it but there's a whole bunch of
really like mad surreal gags that just
don't really make any sense but in the
context of the film they just keep
repeating them until they become funny
so yeah I feel that that for me is a
good compromise of watching some
football this summer season they're not
actually watching the football there you
go yeah that's perfect
cool and there the other things that are
coming up at the moment III is going on
that's the massive big game show in LA
and all of games were out there and all
our other friends who write about games
all right there loads of big things
expected to come out of that so I think
you can probably expect a gaming special
probably the week after next when the
dust has settled on that so if you are
into your games which you should be
those games are good but not football
not against a football no no no you know
what you be the World Cup I just wanna
be able to watch Ant Man as well do you
think England's going to lose pretty
much immediately as soon as England go
out then Ant Man gets released that's
like the tree that's what could happen
okay well I'm not no I think we should
probably end though where can we find
both of you online and we obviously see
net but let's get more specific let's
talk about social networks
okay well I'm at rich underscore Trent
home

me so I don't do that I am at Katie
Collins on Twitter had to remember that
changed my twitter handle a while ago

Instagram and I am act battery HQ on
everything so go find me there and of
course you can also email the show with

if you're listening on itunes don't
forget to leave us a review yes I stars
five stars best podcast ever yeah at
