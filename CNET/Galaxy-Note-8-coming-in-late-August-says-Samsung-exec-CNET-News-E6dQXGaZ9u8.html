no surprise since their new galaxy notes
every year however samsung's president
of mobile communications business
DJ Co said Samsung would introduce the
newest note at the end of August that
lines up with reports that place a note
8 event on August 23rd Co did not give
an exact launch date he did say that the
note 8 would be available beginning in
September or October depending on region
there was concern that Samsung would
have been in the note line after the
note 7 was recalled twice due to battery
issues Samsung quickly went on the
record to say the note would be back
there have been tons of rumors as to
what to expect from the note 8 Samsung
may have shown the world what the note 8
could look like in a tweet from July
13th the post is promotion for Samsung's
mobile processors but the picture shows
a processor on top of a phone that is
definitely not the galaxy s 8 then again
it could just be a mock-up because a
processor by itself can appear less than
exciting the note 8 is rumored to
feature a screen larger than that of the
galaxy s 8 plus with dual rear cameras
it can also place a fingerprint sensor
under the display like the vivo phone
