affordable pair of slates with matching
specs and sleek minimalist designs at
first glance the two tablets look cool
in high end but a closer look reveals
their budget tablet status for cnet I'm
xiomara Blanco and this is a first look
at the LG G pad 7 point 0 and 10.1 their
designs remind me of first generation
google nexus tablets which is a
compliment the jeep ads have comfortable
rounded corners that melt into your
palms and a smooth matte back that feels
good against your fingertips but doesn't
provide much grip support spec-wise the
tablets are twins they sport 1280 x 800
pixel resolution displays and house 1.2
gigahertz quad-core processors one
gigabyte of ram 16 gigabytes of internal
storage and a microSD card expansion
slot both tablets have a pair of power
and volume buttons a 1.3 megapixel front
camera 5 megapixel rear camera and ir
blasters for universal remote
capabilities there is no ambient light
sensor so you have to manually adjust
the screens brightness when switching
environments the screen resolution looks
better on the 7-inch then on the 10-inch
the 10 incher screen looks obviously
pixelated but both tablets consistently
suffer from laggy touchscreen response
especially when waking up from sleep the
LG G pad sport a redesigned interface
with cute icons dual window capabilities
and a tile-based approach to the recent
apps key other cool software features
include the qslide apps which can float
above open apps for quick access and
useful preloaded apps like Q pair which
syncs your smart phone to your tablet
starting out 149 the 7 inch model fits
into the current landscape of small
budget tablets and is a good deal if you
can't splurge on the 229 dollar google
nexus 7 at 249 the 10 incher is a
slightly better deal since most large
tablets start at around three hundred
dollars however it's pixelated screen
and touch screen lag might warrant a
bump in budget for more information on
the performance of the LG G pad's check
out my full review again I'm xiomara
Blanco Kristina and this has been a
first look at the LG G pad 7
plano in 10.1
