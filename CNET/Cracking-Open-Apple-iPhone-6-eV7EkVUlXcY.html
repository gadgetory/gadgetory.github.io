the iPhone 6 is Apple's first major
redesign of their phones exterior since
the iPhone 4 but they also made lots of
changes on the inside which make the six
faster able to store more data and as
I'll show you easier to open and repair
I'm Bill Detweiler and this is cracking
open unlike the similar looking iPhone 5
and 5s there's no mistaking the iPhone 6
for one of Apple's previous handsets
it's 4.7 inch display is larger than
anything Apple has released before its
case is much thinner and the rounded
edges give it a distinctive look now
unfortunately they also make it harder
to hold them any other iPhone but I
digress now thankfully cracking open the
6 is actually easier than opening
previous iPhones now you still need to
remove the two pentalobe screws along
the bottom edge with a special
screwdriver but Apple relocated the
ribbon cable on the home button which
means you no longer need to worry about
carrying it when popping open the front
panel now with the front panel open the
first thing we're going to do is to
remove several metal plates which cover
the connectors for the battery front
panel and other components then we'll
disconnect the battery and remove the
front panel the overall hardware layout
is the same as on the iPhone 5s there's
a speaker and lightning connector
assembly at the bottom battery along the
left side motherboard along the right
and the camera assembly at the top now
attached to the front panel are the
display front camera and sensors
earpiece speaker and the home button
there's also a new metal plate that sits
behind the screen while I would usually
begin our teardown by removing the
battery I'm going to leave it in place
as I remove the other components this
will keep me from having to glue it back
in later so the first component to come
out is the new rear facing camera it has
the same 8 megapixel count as last year
but with improved autofocus and exposure
control a small antenna is next and then
removing a few screws and standoffs and
attaching the remaining connectors we
can lift out the motherboard now
unfortunately the shields that cover the
iPhone 6's motherboard are soldered in
place obscuring our view of the new a a
processor a mate motion tracking chip
and it's NFC chips as I want to put this
phone back together in working order I'm
going to leave the shields in place the
last pieces to come out are the speaker
assembly and the vibration mechanism
which is different than the one in the
iPhone 5s still attached the case are
the headphone and lightning connector
assembly volume buttons ringer switch
power button and a slew of connector
wires now most of these components are
held to the case with both screws and
adhesive if any of these components were
damaged removing and replacing them
wouldn't be too difficult but I don't
want to risk damaging them during
removal so I'm going to leave them where
they are
despite its bigger screen and new case
design if you just looked at the iPhone
6 on the outside you definitely miss
some of the most interesting design
changes Apple made and I'm glad that
Apple actually made the phone easier to
open and repair kudos for that now if
they would only settle on a single size
screw for attaching the internal
components I'd really be happy for a
complete list of specs pricing and
real-world performance tests check out
