cnet.com and this is the Apple watch
sport and we wanted to do an unboxing
fresh from the shipper fresh from Apple
so I'm just gonna get into this bad boy
and we will start with this pool tab
here and do the honors I know I just
want to see what it smells like okay
here we go so I'm gonna pop this open
make sure you guys can all see this and
then here is did I just drop that the
white box it says here if you can see
I'm gonna try and find that angle it
says watch on it Apple watch right there
just a white rectangular box okay and
then because I'm a little anal when I
open these things I like to take this
little pin the thumbtack and I just work
it across the seam because I'll be
honest with you I like to resell a lot
of my stuff and I want someone to get it
just as if its brand new so we're just
gonna kind of run this thumbtack along
the edges so the plastic is perfect all
right here we go and then I'm gonna do a
little do a little shaky shake I work
out all right here we go this is what we
have inside right now
this plastic rectangular box this again
is the Apple watch sport I'm gonna
remove this this kind of plastic
covering oh here we go
there's a little green tab here I'm
gonna pull that break the seal open it
up and again here we got an Apple logo
and let's just pop this open here we go
this is the Apple watch sport we know
this is the aluminum version I'm just
gonna kind of unwrap this plastic here
there you go
sexy there's the heart rate sensor on
there it's an ion X glass surface so
this is not the sapphire crystal surface
on the front but uh that's that's a
looking at let's just dig into the box
as well to show you what else comes in
here we have the MagSafe the magnetic
charger right clinks right on there it
actually drop it on there holds into
place so see you look look at that look
ma whoo
all right that's there and then you have
your standard power adapter plug it in
the wall and I believe that's all we got
let's just check out here manual eyes we
also because this is the sport version
of the Apple watch they they actually
include two different lengths of a wrist
strap here so one's a little longer
one's a little smaller and you can see
that here this is its own separate piece
that comes along with there but again
these this watch starts starts at 349
and I have this all laid out this is
what you guys gonna be doing at home but
there is your first look at the unboxing
of the Apple watch sport</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
