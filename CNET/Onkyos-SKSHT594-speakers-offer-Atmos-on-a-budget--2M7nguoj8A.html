home theater then a receiver and speaker
package is a quick and easy way to get
everything you need right away the onkyo
SK sh t five nine four is one half of
the equation a five point one point two
speaker package with integrated height
channels for use with next-gen sound
formats Dolby Atmos and DTS X by itself
it retails for five hundred ninety nine
dollars but is available with a
decent-looking receiver for only $100
more the front speakers are one of the
stars of the show with the small fabric
cap hiding an up firing three and a
quarter inch driver used for overhead
effects in new movies these are tall
bookshelf speakers at eighteen inches
high and you need to put them on
suitable stands or AV furniture the
other hero here is the large 10 inch
subwoofer which for a speaker in a box
set is actually really well constructed
and even attractive it can go down to 25
Hertz which is plenty enough for most
movies the rest of the speakers aren't
all that exciting and while they do come
with wires in the box there's bigger
terminals are spring clips which adds to
the budget feeling you get the speaker's
aren't quite finished there is some
exposed wood and they are as sturdy as
the cheaper pioneer SP PK 52 surround
speakers the onkyo s don't sound as good
as the Pioneers either for why they do
add high defects in the handful of
movies that support it the pioneers
sound better with everything else
whether it's TV
Netflix or music if you really want up
my speakers though these are currently
the cheapest option but you're probably
better off paying the extra 100 bucks to
get the onkyo HT s 5800 system with the
Atmos compatible receiver as well if you
don't want at most the Pioneer speaker
set is the superior and cheaper system
