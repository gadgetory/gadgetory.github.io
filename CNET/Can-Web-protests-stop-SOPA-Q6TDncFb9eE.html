Bridget Carey on sina com and it's time
to get loaded some of the web's most
popular websites like Wikipedia
craigslist even Google have modified
their home pages today to protest the
SOPA bill encouraging visitors to write
to their representatives to kill the
bill SOPA short for Stop Online Piracy
Act was created to stop rogue websites
from stealing copyrighted material its
controversial because it gives the US
government broad power to say what
should be censored on the web Wikipedia
is blacked out for all of wednesday in
protest but you can get around the
blackout by searching for a cached
version of a Wikipedia topic through
google and if you're looking for humor
you also find several web comics I'm
joining the blackout like the oatmeal
com yahoo co founder jerry yang has
resigned from the company he built 17
years ago and has given up his seat on
the board of directors many have wanted
him to resign after yahoo rejected
microsoft's 47 billion dollar bid to buy
yahoo it's been reported that yang was
one of the biggest opponents to the bid
not wanting to see the company he
created be sold All Things D is
reporting that more board members could
soon follow yang out the door yang said
in a statement quote the time has come
for me to pursue other interests outside
of Yahoo there's been a recent increase
of iphone sales compared to android in
the US according to research from
nielsen a folks who got a new smartphone
in the past three months about
forty-five percent said they chose an
iphone compare that to october when only

owners use androids but the recent rush
of iphones show the gap could be closing

shopping tech of
mara has been on display the national
retail federation conference in New York
City this week I got to scope out the
show floor yesterday and some of the
more visionary highlights includes self
checkout lanes that don't require you to
scan a barcode it knows what you bought
by the look of the box until showed off
touchscreen vending machines that show
nutritional information of your Oreos or
whatever snack you pick and it can also
detect the agent sex of a user for
promotional purposes and later this year
some stores will use Microsoft Kinect
cameras to let you try on clothes in a
