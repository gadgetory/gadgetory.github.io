cnet.com and we are at Mobile World
Congress 2013 and we're taking a first
look at the mio Alfa now this device is
a SmartWatch one of the many products
like this to hit the market basically
what it does is it has a heart rate
monitor built in and it communicates
over Bluetooth to your smartphone via
any number of fitness apps like Matt my
Ron
so as you see here it has a screen that
is LCD it what's good about that is you
can read it in sunlight and in outdoors
which some smartwatches have problems
with you also have a little LED
indicator on the side here on the bottom
that will tell you when your heart rate
is in your golden zone or if it drops
below your normal resting heart rate or
if it goes above it and you're kind of
in the red zone so you have that there
you also have this rubber strap that
it's basically silicone around the whole
watch and as a matter of fact the whole
watch is water resistant so you can go
running with it you can even swim with
it but the readings probably won't be
quite accurate
now inside the watch on the underneath
on the bottom side are two very strong
LED lights basically what they do is
they shine into your skin and there's a
sensor here that will measure blood flow
and similar to other products on the
market like the basis fan but the thing
about the mio alpha is that it offers
very high degree of sensitivity and
accuracy so it this device is designed
for one thing right now it is all about
measuring your heart rate accurately in
workouts
now the Amelio alpha watch is available
now for $1.99 so there you have it folks
we just took a first look at the mio
alpha
