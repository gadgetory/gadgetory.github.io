Ben fax ribbon and I'm Alexander abled
the Google home hub reviews are out in
our own Andrew Gephardt is really liking
this smart display works well it's a
photo frame a smart home control panel
and digital assistant and surprisingly
blends well into your home that you're
the you're the smart display guy what I
write about them I'm a guy so you're the
guy tell me about like how does it stack
up against the echo show if you're
really into watching youtube videos
which granted like you're you're
probably gonna be like standing up in
front of the kitchen counter watching
them but still if you want to watch
YouTube videos this is probably better
for that but for video calling it
doesn't have a camera so you're just not
gonna be able to do video calling it
also what's interesting about what's
going on with smart displays now is that
there's at least some level of selection
in the market you can choose between
different things which is which is
interesting and then maybe somebody out
there maybe we'll buy the Facebook
portal that would not exist right yeah
well you told me your you're an echo
person you've got a whole bunch of those
devices is the Google home hub enough to
make you I guess jump ecosystems yeah so
I'm obsessed with all the Amazon echo
devices I'm obsessed with Amazon like in
totality but the but I really like the
home up because it doesn't have a camera
and that's a pause for you it is and
then I have an echo spot and I really
like it but the camera is weird and I
feel like it takes up a lot of real
estate and so I feel like the fact that
this is so small and it can just really
like blend into my kitchen is like very
exciting to me is that where you put it
the kitchen because they kept
positioning is like a nightstand
accessory I mean that's what I would use
it for it because then I could just ask
Google like for tasty recipes or
something like that and I wouldn't have
to worry about like accidentally getting
like ugly selfie camera you know that's
always like something that has concern
the echo spot though is marketed as a
nightstand thing so they like Amazon is
very directly failing with the camera
with the camera yeah telling people like
hey it's fine put the camera in your
bedroom it's not gonna be a problem so
that's their posture this is what you
get when Amazon
hasn't had to deal with the privacy
issues that you know it's other tech
brethren have have had to deal with
absolutely
all right so the razor phone to exist
exist
I just don't understand because every
phone is now built for gaming so what's
the point of them spending resources is
that true like every new phone look at
the 10s max or the 10s or even last week
when Bridgette was had the hand sewn
with the ten are like I feel like all
the new phones are built to play video
games right there's like no point you
got the pixel three XL yes God the
Galaxy Note nine I mean there are tons
of these big phones that all play video
games that I'll talk about it obviously
this one is you know they tout this one
is more optimized for games better of
screen refresh rate which is relatively
unique administrative on the razor phone
to creatively named ads ip67 water
resistance wireless charging and a
brighter 120 Hertz screen yeah it's I
feel like it's not nothing special at
the price where it's kind of at the
iPhone 10 our level it's a little
expensive for some for a one used to
I've also seen people are having trouble
just testing it like last week I saw
that the screen was all jumpy and you
couldn't touch on it so it's like spend
your resources on making a better gaming
tablet or even just a better gaming PC
it's not what Razer is known for
shouldn't that with yeah the doubt
alright lastly want to call out our new
series crossing the broadband divide
this is a look at the challenges of
connecting everyone in America we focus
on America really this is a cool the
problem connecting everyone to the
Internet and you would assume you know
time what we're talking about 5g and
connecting everyone to blazing fast
speeds there are lots of pockets of
America that still don't get access our
own short tip Ken went back to her home
state of Iowa to get some in-depth look
into this problem and this series will
be running the entire week so definitely
check it out
for our full coverage follow us on
SEANET I'm Roger Cheng I'm Ben fax or
even I'm Alexander Abel listening
oh boy oh boy
four minutes sure does go fast thanks
everybody for joining us for the
recording of the audio podcast oh my
lighting is really bad today I'll work
on that
here see me you look good you look like
a vampire it really kind of depends on
the day of the week in my mood anyways
now it's time for you out there in the
chat to send in your questions and
comments about everything we talked
about today I'm interested to hear more
about the the rural area in yes project
just because that's where I come from
Nowheresville upstate New York real
upstate western New York if you will
please but employ the Bronx the Bronx is
an upstate tshe until then let's talk a
little bit about the Google home hub
there's definitely some criticism coming
out this one Emily's going on a tirade
seems like that'd be more useful and can
be picked up and carried around has a
camera no good speakers just like the
Google home it feels like that this
thing is completely pointless why not
just put a tablet on a stand so what
really is the sell point what's gonna
get somebody to invest in this very very
single-use device I wouldn't call it a
single-use device I think specifically
the the idea with a smart display just
like with any smart speaker is is that
you're getting the voice assistant and
if the voice assistant is something that
is useful in your life and you like the
idea of having a voice assistant you
want to like while you're washing your
dishes play music and not have to like
go and fumble with your phone or
whatever then that's why I'd like
millions of people have purchased these
types of things so the idea of adding a
smart display is is that it's called
multimodal now you can use voice and you
can also tap and touch and you can see
the visual so maybe that'll help with
voice shopping maybe that'll help you
just see the weather more clearly or
just like go through news headlines but
it's I understand the idea with these
products I don't know that a lot of
people are buying them though so I'm
explaining all these uses but
I don't I don't know a lot of people
that have them in their home I mean I
think the two examples that I saw at the
Google event it was like the the step by
step cooking directions they like being
able to like call out to your tab like
alright I'm ready with this next step
and then having either to gather the
ingredients or like the step-by-step
instructions that would useful also the
idea that this was this also double as a
digital picture frame which those things
kind of died out really quickly not only
that like you could get one for cheaper
than $150 yeah
so yeah now that I'm a dad I like a Sam
else app and I like seeing my kids
photos pop up don't start crying like
random you know random part of the
kitchen is kind of peeling to me but I
think that I mean Emily was saying what
why don't you just put a tablet on a
stand like you can if you have a tablet
I do have a tablet and I have standards
actually yeah but does it have voice
like would you be able I know the Amazon
tablet oh boy the future of it you know
when I first got my dot I didn't think I
was gonna use it as much as I did and
yeah especially the spot now you really
didn't think I was gonna use it I got it
as a present and I was like whatever
I'll just set it up and now it's like
it's in my everyday life so I think it's
just more about like integrating I think
there's just a level of comfort that
needs to be developed with these
products just like the I mean the the
original micro speaker and all that that
was kind of a novelty and it got to the
point where it was widely accepted I
think that's where we are now with the
these smart displays real kind of like
what what do we need this for yeah I
would agree also the hundred sixty I
mean it's cheaper than a tablet that's
the thing like if you don't have a
tablet you start from scratch this is
you know an okay option this is a viable
option there it is but it's stuck in
your house it's a definitely cheaper
option than like buy a full-blown tablet
and stand right the tab will run you
five hundred bucks
however for people that are really used
to mobile devices whether it's a tablet
or a phone a lot of these smart home
things they only work if they're plugged
in all the time so you can't take them
with you and the only way that like any
of these voices systems work is if you
buy
multiple different stuff which I guess
is really good for the tech company yeah
so like if I won
Amazon's voice assist and in my car I
have to buy an additional thing for that
yeah if I want it in the kitchen I got
to buy another one for that so yeah
they're upselling an extension of if you
already have like a little smart home
you know if you already have the mini
and you have everything else it's just
like one more thing to make it just your
entire smart house like well that's the
thing like yeah if my question is for
folks who are like committed to you know
Amazon or Google like whether or not any
of these parts are gonna convince myths
which like if you've already invested in
like four or five Amazon products will
you go to the Google home hub or the
home in a year I'm intrigued by it I
mean if somebody if it was like on sale
or somebody gave it to me as a present
like I would definitely play around with
it
I like Alexa and I'm used to Alexa but I
think that were in a situation with the
Google home hub I would definitely
Alexandra we're not allowed to use that
word here yeah don't say oh yeah I've
been I've been like a call me I've been
like really try every single time I like
so many times really they're not viewers
that complain about there are viewers
for the viewers that watch the show all
I may have triggered some people on
Twitter do it that's proof that that the
entire Smart Home Hub thing has really
becoming ingrained in the ecosystem at
least in our little niche audience oh
yeah I mean it may be it's not far and
wide and showing up in your granddad's
place but it's so normal now that you do
have to be careful like well I feel
really bad for anybody whose actual name
is that oh yeah
all right yeah I used to go by Alexa
when I was younger today if we keep this
up nice alright next question is coming
in well it's really more of a comment
but it kind of bridges off what you were
just
talking about with people and their
loyalty Timothy do says pre-ordered my
home hub can't wait to use it with my
hello Ness now that's definitely a good
point to bring up is like that that
ecosystem being completely ingrained in
and wanting all of your stuff to work
together seamlessly
Timothy also goes on to ask can the
Google hub connect to an external
battery pack Oh interesting
maybe we haven't heard anything yeah
that being developed I've seen that I've
heard of a lot of people hacking this
stuff I mean to make it portable yeah
why would you do that because people
take it out of beach when you're talking
about smart home stuff a lot of the like
the really forward reaching folks are
basically in the maker community yes so
they want to take this thing and then do
whatever it is that they want to do with
it so I could imagine that you could
connect it to an external battery I'm
not saying it would be easy yeah I mean
I guess it means uses a USB port you can
just plug into can you I don't know
there's enough generic ones out there
that are USB or even AC that you could
probably tap I just need port no it
depends on the adapter that they include
with the right the the device because if
it's not that significant I guess you
can swap it out with the I don't know
and then take it with you like a boombox
but it doesn't come off are you gonna
say anything else is that what you're
gonna do bad it's mine but the audio
audio is not great so even if you stood
out like stood outside hold on hold on
the audio is not great compared to what
though it's all relative like if you
really compare you know if you're gonna
go or the Dex interesting okay yeah
alright so you're gonna lease you're
gonna compare the other smart to the
market have superior audio right cuz I
definitely hear like for instance with
the echo a lot of folks complain that
it's tinny especially the dot and
whatever I'm like okay well what are you
comparing it to are you conveying it
comparing it to a Bose or no no's no
because I'd be like that okay
I mean it's basic physics the speaker's
not gonna be great in its trying to feed
something else that's right
alright let's move on to another
question actually now that you guys are
talking about comparing it can
trusting what's the benefit buying the
home hub versus other google smart
displays Joseph Gauss says how does
Google home have compared to the Lenovo
smart display looking into buying one of
these which one would you recommend now
we already talked about the audio
fidelity but what are there some other
factors that kind of weigh in on on
buying options on these okay the Lenovo
smart display is obviously a bigger
display and I the speaker looks a lot
bigger too so you might get better sound
quality out of it it's also more
expensive I think it's at least a
hundred dollars it might be a little bit
less than a hundred dollars more than
the Google one and also if you have any
interest whatsoever in video calling the
Lenovo one has a camera where as the
home hub does not so you would save a
little bit of money other one does have
a physical shutter there right correct
yeah so that's kind of nice if you kind
of want that camera for specific uses
but you don't want on all the time it's
kind of nice to have that physical
shutter yeah yeah Alex Mitchell is one
of those guys it says as much as I
appreciate not having a camera I still
want one for video calls when I'm
cooking
give me a camera cover so it looks like
the home hubs out on his wish list
serene joy says can't Google just
released an upgraded chromecast with
smart capabilities that would convert
televisions into smart displays or photo
frames that would sell out fast I do not
think you're wrong on that one stern joy
I think I'd be more interested in that
myself being a longtime chromecast user
what do you guys think I mean you
wouldn't how many people have like a TV
in their kitchen I think I'd be more apt
to invest in a cheap decent-sized LCD TV
and mount it on the wall next to my
fridge or something and then smart if I
it then I am to put a little guy that's
gonna occupy very valuable kitchen
counter space that I have in my tiny
apartment oh that's me I don't know I
don't know that you're saving that much
money at that point you're buying a TV
and then you're getting a chromecast and
I know a chromecast isn't really that
expensive right and now you're putting
the whole system together the idea with
the smart displays is you don't have to
do any of that stuff just give us your
money and plug this in plus I'm really
lazy when it comes to stuff like
mounting things and installation and and
work
general so that's using a lot more work
than just slice right to your point
about eliminate kitchen counter space
I'm right there with you that's like
that is a constant battle that I have to
fight is figuring out how to put
everything everywhere like we've got
always small I mean yes it would take up
valuable real estate but I can have a
toaster there you could you could with
something along the lines of a coffee
maker I mean that's that's a valuable
space like real estate wise it's pretty
much the same space as a coffee maker
you could put it on a little shelf by an
electric yeah yeah like just go to Ikea
and you can like build layers you know
right right that's still that's still
effort that sounds like that's difficult
timmi they do brings up a good point can
you mount this thing by the looks of it
it doesn't have any new mounting
hardware you do put up a shelf or
whatever there's also the speaker is in
the back of it so if you mounted you
closer to the wall that's not good it
could cause like a really weird like
sound quality problem so any displays
mountable so pretty heavy that would
kind of be a little worried about now
yeah yeah yeah I mean if if you're
interested in a smart display but think
they all look kind of ugly which is me
wait like maybe 2 to 3 years like a
couple generations from now I personally
think they're gonna look a lot more like
smartphones but right now they're all
kind of like too big and plasticky and I
know the echo show did a much better job
in this next generation but they're
still not nearly as polished as a lot of
smartphones and and granted that's not
the most fair comparison because
smartphones has been have been around
for more than 10 years and smart
displays is like a new product I feel
like there's gonna be a point where a
smart display and I've
phone are gonna look exactly the same
and but which is I mix them I in my hair
make foldable the phone is foldable you
unfold it paste it to the wall oh my god
I love the future yeah like unscrew it
and like paste it to your face whoo yeah
they just talked about it LG is also
working on the scroll phone right now by
I decree cooler but not terrible all
right be nice we don't judge here we're
not prejudiced all tech is beautiful at
CNET okay before we wrap up this
conversation when is Apple getting into
the smart display game great question
see Google releasing a camera version as
a response next year okay I can answer
that second question we actually talked
to Google executives it was rich brown
spoke with them at the event and they
said look we want to test this out in
the market and if they're really if
people tell us that they would prefer a
camera we're not against doing that
they're not in like some philosophical
like they haven't boxed themselves into
like no we're never gonna have a camera
as far as Apple um I would love to see
them be a little bit more experimental
with coming out with different product
designs but like they're really slow
with doing any of that kind of stuff
well you know your money on that iPhone
I mean that thing they tried to be
experimental with the air power and it's
been a year and we still I mean Apple
has a formula it works and then I don't
think they're gonna straight for well I
also looked at home pod I don't know
hope hasn't really been that
well-received so I don't know in terms
of like I think they're trying to work
on that before they get to smart
displays no I would like to see them
have come out with a home pod mini or
totally home pod micro dot I don't know
what they look
but they kind of work on Siri to open a
no go home pod nano that would be really
cool that's a naming convention that
Apple would have come up in years well
that's yeah iPod Nano right that's Apple
is just way behind on all this stuff and
the home pod was just a first step but
we just talked about the Nano they got
to work on Siri yeah it would be nice if
they came out with a smart display but I
think you're right that it's just really
far from now yeah I think before they
work on a smart display they they have
to make Siri better I mean it's yeah I
could absolutely awful
hmm it's very frustrating how awful it
is when you have oh yeah I mean I
struggle to just ask I ask Siri for the
weather for some reason that's like a
two minute affair for me you know yes
all right we have run out of time but
there's still great questions
full-flowing in most notably the the
philosophical question has high in
smartphone market reaches Plateau almost
every high in phone specs are the same
nowadays attributing to Alexandra's
comments about the razor phone too
you pick your favorites you sit with it
nobody shocks you anymore welcome to
modern technology well the phone yet it
doesn't exist
yeah just like the wireless power Apple
it will exist I'll buy it when I see it
you said you're right I did say I said
the exact same thing last year so you
know I feel like now you 24 the
operating systems
maybe not the specs but you buy the
phone cuz you're too lazy to switch over
and Bri buy all your apps that's true
that means real pain but so yes that's
what that's a valid thing okay for real
though we are out of time I wish we
could have talked a little bit more
about this rural internet initiative I
want to hear more about this Roger I'm
gonna need you to stay after class
but until then we are going to say
goodbye for the day thanks everybody for
