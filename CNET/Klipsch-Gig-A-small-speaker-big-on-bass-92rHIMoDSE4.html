cliffs gig which is currently the
smallest modeling Klipsch is a line of
wireless Bluetooth speakers I'll tell
you what I like about it first
for starters it's got a nice sturdy feel
to it and by that I mean it feels
substantial even though it's compact it
also has a removable wraparound ban the
clip says is both protective and serves
as a style statement it also allows you
to prop the speaker up in a vertical
position that band is easy to swap out
and comes in a variety of colors though
only one comes in the box as far as
extra features go the gig has
speakerphone capabilities as well as app
tech support and NFC tap to pair for
smartphones that offer those features I
also like the way Clips designed the
controls the power button is on the top
or side depending on how you orient the
speaker and that's where you'll find the
audio input for non bluetooth devices
and the microUSB charging port to juice
this thing up battery life is rated at
12 hours which is better than what you
get from a lot of these speakers and
basically takes you through a full day
of music listening the battery life
indicator is on top of the volume
control knob which also doubles as a
one-button remote allowing you to pause
and play tracks as well as skip tracks
forward and back and all I thought this
was a very well designed speaker I also
thought it was sounded decent for its
size with his bass response its biggest
strength it goes deeper than many of the
very compact portable speakers in its
$200 price class including the UE boom
and JBL pulse and it's close to Bose
Soundlink mini however the gig isn't as
detailed or natural sounding as those
speakers so you do give up something on
the clarity front which is too bad aside
from that shortcoming I like the gig and
think it will appeal the folks who
listen to more bass heavy music whether
it be Technol or hip hop overall it's an
appealing little speaker with good
features in a strong design it just has
a lot of competition and some of it
sounds a little better despite not
having as much bass I'm David Carr noise
and that's the cliffs gig thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
