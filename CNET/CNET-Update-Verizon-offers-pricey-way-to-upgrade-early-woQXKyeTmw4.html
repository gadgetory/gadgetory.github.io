if you'll pay for full price phones I'm
Bridget Carey and this is your CNET
update Verizon is the latest carrier to
jump into the early upgrade game with a
newly announced edge plan basically if
you pay more for that smartphone you can
upgrade it early now there are some
slight technical differences between
this and the 18 t next plan but the
bottom line is that you are really not
getting a good deal with either of these
methods they just sound cool because
everyone wants the latest phones if you
want to save money you are still better
off sticking with the two-year contract
then just reselling the phone on eBay or
gazelle now if you're someone who just
has to upgrade every year well you have
to pay the full price of the phone which
is like 600 or $700 and this Verizon
edge plan and the ATT next plan well
they take the sting out of that big
one-time fee by splitting it up over
monthly payments that's all this is also
if you go with one of these early
upgrade plans you better upgrade after a
year or you are losing money and
essentially paying twice for the phone
and that's because carriers work in the
high price of these phones into your
monthly service bill so you didn't
really just pay $200 for that new phone
you're kind of paying for it in the long
run they just fold that into your
service plan t-mobile has its own
version of this but it's a different
model to compare because t-mobile has a
much lower service charge and it's early
upgrade program also works like an
insurance policy Netflix made television
history as the first streaming service
to get Emmy nominations for its
exclusive shows including house of cards
starring Kevin Spacey the comedy
Arrested Development and the horror
thriller Hemlock Grove Netflix shows
snagged 14 nominations in total and time
will tell if that gives more people
interested in signing up for the monthly
service back in 2008 the Emmy rules
changed to make the internet an eligible
platform to qualify for an Emmy
nomination seems everyone wants a mini
version of their phone these days
HTC just announced the HTC One mini but
with a 4.3 inch screen it's only mini
compared to the monster sized screens we
have today it'll be out in August
but we have an early look now on CNET
and before we end a quick correction and
the previous show I mentioned the
instant messaging app whatsapp could be
used on the ipod touch but in fact the
only iOS device it works on is an iPhone
sorry about that confusion but if you're
looking for a multi-platform chatting
app that works on the iPod touch check
out WeChat Kakao Talk line or you can
use a social networking hybrid apps such
as path that's your tech news update you
can find more details at cnet.com slash
