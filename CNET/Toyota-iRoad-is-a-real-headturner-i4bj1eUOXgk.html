rode electric car actually like a car is
maybe not quite the right thing to say
this is really a three wheeler and it's
very unique three wheeler it actually
turns it's got two wheels in front one
wheel and the rear and when you go
through a corner
it just leans over as you steer you
don't actually have to lean yourself it
does all the weaning for you it's a very
unique kind of style and that helps it
keep traction helps it handle the turns
very easily I'm really blown away by how
this car handles when you're turning
slowly the back end sort of comes out
for you and it makes you feel like
you're a very smooth driver and then
when you go faster in the corners it
does this graceful leaning over thing
it's really really amazing they tell me
it's got a little bit of traction
control work then if you're on a
slippery surface and also when you're
going too fast in the corner it'll
actually got to vibrate the steering
wheel and slow down a little bit for you
too to be honest it's not that fast
either it only goes about 37 miles per
hour and it's got a range of maybe
thirty miles it's a fairly small
electric battery pack it's got two
electric motors in the crown wheels each
is about two kilowatts
and so long take off really really fast
it's a small vehicle it's kind of a one
plus one seater and the idea is that
it's a last mile transportation or
neighborhood electric vehicle cleaner
isn't selling these in the u.s. yet
actually they're not selling them
anywhere yet they've got some test
markets they've got a test market in
Grenoble France they're testing them in
Tokyo and they're thinking of testing
them in the United States and that's why
they brought them here for us to take a
look at and try out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
