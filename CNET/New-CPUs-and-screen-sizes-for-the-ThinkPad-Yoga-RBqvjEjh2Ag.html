latest versions of Lenovo's thinkpad
yoga now the way the thinkpad yoga
differs from the regular yoga's is that
it's got a clever bit of mechanical
slide of hand here we're in a regular
yoga if you fold the screen all the way
back you still have the keyboard and
touchpad right here and your fingers can
clack against the keys even though
they're deactivated in the thinkpad
versions there's actually a little panel
that rises up as you fold the screen
back and locks into place right here
from behind the keyboard trait so the
whole thing is is essentially flat you
can't press the keys anymore and they
seem to be at about the same level as
everything else there so there's
basically almost retract and then once
you fold it back your keyboard comes
back to life and that's what makes the
thinkpad yoga different from the regular
yoga's so to update these models is now
the 12 inch model there's a 14 there's a
15 inch model they're all going to move
up to Intel's new 5th generation core i
series processors also known by the
codename Broadwell and the 15 inch
version is super interesting because
you're going to be able as an option to
get Intel's new realsense camera that's
kind of a fancy webcam built-in that can
you know scan objects in 3d and do more
sort of a detection of objects in the
real world so you could use a lot of
hand gestures and stuff like that we're
starting to see that in a few systems
we're gonna have to test it out some
more to see what the capabilities of
real sense really are so these two guys
the 12 inch and 15-inch are going to be
available in February in the US at nine
ninety nine and 11 99 the fortunate
version is coming later in the US in may
also at 1199 I'm Dan Akron at CES 2015
