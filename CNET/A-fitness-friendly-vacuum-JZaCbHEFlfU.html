we're gonna be taking a look at the $349
GTECH airram lightweight vacuum this
vacuum falls within the lightweight
category which also includes stick
vacuums as you can see this isn't
technically a stick vacuum it's kind of
the hybrid between your more traditional
upright body design with this larger
cleaning head down at the bottom but
also has a lot of the features of stick
vacuums that you might really appreciate
such as lightweight easy maneuverability
and storage this is a relatively small
footprint and you'll have no problem
finding a place to store it
the $349 sticker price definitely
elevates the air ram into a different
category of vacuums given the fact that
you can buy a full-size upright for less
in addition to the fact that you can
also buy a lightweight stick vacuum for
Less both of which would outperform this
it's really hard to justify that three
hundred and forty nine dollar price the
air RAM unfortunately never lived up to
my high expectations for it it never won
a debris test and in many cases was the
worst performer especially with pet hair
which it really struggles with due to
the nature of the brush roll which
tangles really easily and I spent a lot
of time cleaning pet hair and human hair
out of the brush roll after our tests
while its performance is lacking GTECH
has imbued a lot of nice features into
the air in that you may appreciate such
as a data bridge which connects to your
computer and tells you what the health
of your battery is like the general
health of the vacuum and also calculates
how many calories it approximates that
you've burned while vacuuming one thing
I will say about the air RAM is if you
do decide that this is a vacuum you're
interested in and you think it would be
enough vacuum for your lightweight daily
cleaning I will say that it is extremely
maneuverable and you will have no
trouble navigating the area around or
under any furniture so while it may be
lacking in performance it's definitely
not lacking in power and while it hasn't
run away with the competition it
certainly may run away from you for
seeing that I'm Kati Bonita</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
