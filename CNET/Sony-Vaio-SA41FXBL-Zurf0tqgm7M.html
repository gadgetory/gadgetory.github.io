cnet and laptops are in a funny place
right now because there are newer Ivy
Bridge processors that are somewhere on
the horizon meanwhile we're starting to
see some laptops of bumped up specs from
last year that are a little better than
what you had before but maybe not that
fantastically better great example is
the sony vaio sa 41 FX / BL that
incredibly arcane name boils down to the
sony vaio s is a 13-inch laptop that
comes in two different flavors the essay
is a more expensive variety that's
geared a little more towards small
business and the SB which probably one
you want to buy is not this one it
starts at seven ninety-nine that's a
pretty palatable area the problem with
the essay is that for its feature set
while it is impressive a 1600 x 900 13
inch display that's higher resolution a
fingerprint reader in the middle it's
also got optional blu-ray drive a
blu-ray reader if you want to pay up for
that and SSD storage as a whole the
laptop is a bit expensive the starting
price as a thousand 29 it does have
built-in graphics AMD graphics that are
actually pretty good for gaming so this
isn't really a gaming laptop and the
size is it in between ur it's a 13-inch
that has an optical drive it's lighter
than a macbook pro it's about 3.5 pounds
but it's not as thin or as light as an
ultrabook although super thin no optical
drive laptops that you've seen all over
the place costing also about a thousand
dollars which brings up the question why
would you want this over an ultrabook
definitely the graphics performance lots
of nice features but the battery life
built in battery lasted about four hours
that's really not great now for laptops
you can get a slice battery for this
that will upgrade the battery life to
double that roughly but it costs 150
dollars and it bulks up the thickness so
what do you really want to do I mean I
would prefer using integrated batteries
and paying up for the battery life a
macbook air is I get seven hours of
battery life and you know when you have
that out there it's hard to deal with
four hours internally now let me make
fun of this vaio laptop it is clean-cut
looking but it's kind of a bit
throw back the lines on this for me are
really angular almost feel like a like a
laptop from a couple of years ago plus
Sony loves these buttons there are a ton
of dedicated buttons on the top of this
laptop including this weirdo switch that
says stamina speed you can flip it to
speed or stamina I bet we both want
stamina and speed right but you can't
pick both really what this is is just
the ability to turn dedicated graphics
on and off going from AMD to integrated
Intel of course you have no idea what
that means when you see stamina speed
classic weird switch that you wouldn't
see on a lot of other laptops that have
that feature built-in otherwise it's
actually a pretty nice laptop just a bit
expensive and the battery life can be
better i'm scott stein and as a look at
the sony vaio sa 41 FX / BL thank you
very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
