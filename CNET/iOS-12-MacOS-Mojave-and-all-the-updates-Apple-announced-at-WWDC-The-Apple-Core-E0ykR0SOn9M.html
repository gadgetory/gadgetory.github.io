shortcuts automatic workout detections
in dark mode we're cutting through all
the fat and getting to the good stuff
from WWDC right here on the apple core
now let's be honest this is not the most
exciting Developers Conference at least
in terms of announcements we had no new
hardware and no major redesigns to their
operating systems however Apple did
deliver on some requests from both users
and developers starting with iOS 12 now
this was an important update because it
focused on performance improvements
something much needed after iOS 11 but
it's obviously to be expected what's
important here is that it doesn't
discriminate against older devices
according to Apple iOS 12 will come to
all the devices that had iOS 11 updates
and will make them faster and with less
bugs now that's TBD but it's a step in
the right direction in Apple
acknowledging that it made a mistake by
making our older devices slower another
boring one important update is screen
time controls now breaking news we're
spending way too much time on screens
and on our phones this from the phone
manufacturers that made us addicted to
phones in the first place but that's
besides the point with iOS 12 you will
be able to set app limits and be able to
see a rundown of how you're spending
your time which may be horrifying for a
lot of us and though we may be too far
gone now it's not all lost for our kids
because parents will also get the same
controls to monitor and set time limits
for their kids wait wait wait a second
first they give us the tools to make us
less addicted to our phones and then
they give us meme oh geez those are
animal Gees of yourself now featuring
tongue tracking that's a thing now this
is kind of like what Samsung tried to do
with their avatars but they made it look
a lot less creepy than Samsung you can
now use them in messages and FaceTime
and I can't believe I'm reporting on
this but the more exciting news about
FaceTime is group video calling of up to
32 people now I don't need to talk to 32
people at a time and it looks kind of
messy on the phone but for people that
would be great
and one of the more impressive iOS 12
updates was a our kit - with a rumored
multiplayer support now this is great
for getting your butt kicked by Scott
Steiner at this slingshot game but it's
also great at being able to render the
same graphics on multiple devices at the
same time it also includes 3d object
detection which is able to meld
real-life and virtual life like they did
in this awesome lego demo and a new file
format to share it all in making a are
more accessible to the masses but what
this all boils down to is Apple paving
the road for the hardware to come the
next big one was Mac OS will have a
Apple captain in California for this
year's theme but moved it to the desert
and now the coolest feature at least
according to developers was dark mode
but the feature that may have the
biggest impact if you're a Safari user
has to do with privacy Apple has
enhanced their intelligent tracking
prevention now that means that they're
blocking any kind of widget with a share
like or comment button that may be
tracking your information without your
permission
watch I was 5 also got some pretty major
updates my personal favorites were all
the new fitness features most
importantly the automatic workout
detection this means you won't have to
bother logging anything on the Apple
watch anymore because it will know when
you start and stop a workout runners
also got some cool features like a
gentle nudge when you're going above or
below your target pace and it now tracks
hiking and yoga other important features
include actionable notifications limited
web browsing series shortcuts I swear
we're getting to that a walkie talkie
app which is pretty self-explanatory and
the podcast app so that's great but the
bigger news here is that it now supports
audio for third-party apps like Pandora
and even Spotify if their game
but what about Siri Siri did not get any
smarter but that doesn't mean Ceres not
open to learning with the new app called
shortcuts users will be able to program
commands for Siri to work with
third-party apps now that may not be
enough to satisfy a lot of users like
myself but it's really not about me here
this conference was about the developers
and we want to see we've gotten them
excited I'm really excited about the the
series shortcuts I think as a developer
I see that it's really useful we want to
make it for patients using our app we
want to make it as easy as possible to
be able to do things on our app and I
think Siri is a great way to do that but
also as a user I can see real ways that
I would actually use that functionality
myself me I actually am kind of excited
about dark mode for for Mojave so I'll
be excited when the production version
of that comes out yeah I'm really
excited about like multiplayer
capabilities so you can have but two
people seeing the same thing at the same
time of same place so that kid you just
saw he's 11 years old already has 8 apps
on the App Store and is officially
making us all look bad
so that's it for today but in the
meantime you can give us some love give
us a like and subscribe or you can tweet
me with some of your favorite features
from this year's Developers Conference
and we'll be back next week with more on
the apple core</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
