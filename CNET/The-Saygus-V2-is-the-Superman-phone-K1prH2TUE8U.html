2015 and really what I have in my hand
I'd like to call it the uber super phone
this thing is really amazing now it's
coming from a company called Sega's
based out of Salt Lake City Utah and in
2005 they put out a phone that had a few
issues getting cherrish support but my
goodness I hope every carrier picks up
this one what this is this is called the
V squared and I'm gonna tell you some of
the things that really make this unique
all right you have a 5 inch full HD
screen that's fine but this is entirely
covered in Kevlar it's a hardened Kevlar
you'll see it on the borders of the
phone as well as the back some other
interesting tech that they've really
packed in think of everything you could
possibly have in a phone you'll have
this graphene antenna that's built into
the back of the case it's patterned
along with the Kevlar Casey also let's
talk about cameras you have a 13
megapixel camera on the front 21 on the
back both with optical image
stabilization
you know you photo junkies everyone uses
their phones for photos this is really
an impressive feed because we don't have
any phone out there that can do this on
both sides
another example here the power we're
packing a 2.5 gigahertz quad-core
Snapdragon 801 processor it also has two
micro SD card slot so you can put
back-to-back Storage cards up to 256
gigs of storage also 64 gigs onboard and
then we look here on the side of the
phone some other really cool bells and
whistles we have a fingerprint scanner
here on the side to slide as well as
wireless hdmi built-in on this phone
again like I told you this is this is
like the Super manifold that she just
call this the Superman but again this is
the saygus v-squared it's coming out
sometime later this year carrier support
will be announced later on as well as
pricing but there you go your first look
at the Sega's v-squared here at CES 2015
