thing in hacking ransomware I'm Brian
Cooley from cnet always in search of the
next big thing ransomware is I must say
a hot trend in exploits hacks what have
you the idea is simple attacking your
machine to get to your data but instead
of taking it and then going and doing
something nefarious with it you leave it
in place and encrypt it you lock it up
so you can't get to it until you pay a
ransom to the hacker that locked it up
this could happen to an individual small
business or to a large organization
infuriatingly if you are the victim of a
ransom or attack on your own personal
machine and they're fairly rare still
but growing there's a weird grey area
you may find yourself in the amount of
money and the scale of the crimes being
perpetrated it's probably not big enough
to get a lot of FBI attention and on the
other hand if you get stubborn and push
back against the person holding your
data for ransom the amount of money is
not enough for them to stick around
they'll just move on and leave your data
encrypted forever the great option you
do have is before the attack occurs and
once again backup becomes important but
in a special way really consider a cloud
backup because many of the ransomware
attacks can also seek out other data
devices on the local network and perhaps
attack them as well scrupulously follow
the usual skepticism about unrecognized
email attachments and make sure you're
running a firewall somewhere on your
network as usual hacking has generally
always been about financial game but
seldom has it been this directly so I'm
Brian Cooley know what's next at cnet
