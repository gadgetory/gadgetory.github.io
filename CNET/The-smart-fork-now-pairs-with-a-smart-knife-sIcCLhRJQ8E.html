smart Bluetooth Borak is back but this
time that's called the 10s fork
you may remember it two years ago as the
happy fork that was a different branding
but for the same device and now it's
back with new features the hope is that
you'll wait at least 10 seconds before
each bite that's why it's called the 10s
fork for the 10-second fork and when you
work with the nutritionist by syncing
your data it's able to detect well how
can you improve your eating habits and
how often you're eating all this
information is great when you're really
serious about changing your diet habit
but for most people they're probably not
gonna want something this vulgate it
have every meal with there's a button on
the fork itself you have to press before
your meal and then it measures how many
seconds between each bite if it's more
than 10 seconds you get a green light if
it's faster it'll vibrates and you'll
get a red light the original model had a
bit of a flaw you see when you took a
bite of food sometimes they thought that
when you stabbed your food it was also
you taking a bite it couldn't really
tell the difference of impact well now
there is a knife the knife and the fork
paired together so it can tell the
difference between when you're cutting
your food versus when you're stuffing
your face the knife and fork pair
already out in Europe for $99 but the
founders are hoping to bring it to the
US Christina I'm Bridget Carey at CES
2015 with your first look at the 10
second fork</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
