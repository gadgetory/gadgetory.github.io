CNN I'm standing with the LG L a sixty
two hundred this is a 47 inch LED based
LCD one of the mid-range models in LG's
2013 lineup there's also a 42 a 50 a 55
and a 60 inch member of the series this
is a pretty extensive series for LG the
LA 6200 s main step-up features are a 3d
capability we'll get to that in a little
bit it's also a smart TV but it doesn't
include LG's patented motion remote it
has doesn't have that Wiimote sort of
motion included with some of the
higher-end LG TVs with this you get a
standard clicker using that clicker to
navigate the Smart TV menu systems a
little more difficult than if you did
have that motion controller there's just
too many icons a lot of clicking around
but of course once you get to where
you're going you'll find those plenty of
functionality in the Smart TV suite
doesn't include Amazon Instant whoever
so that's one big mark against it
compared to the other TVs out there
all told however the Smart TV suite is
pretty good you do get an on now feature
as if you do buy that extra remote
however that allows the TV to interface
with your cable box and search local
listings you don't get that
functionality if you don't buy the
$80.00 remote so you might actually
consider investing in that step-up
remote for the ease of use as well as
the ability to operate these extra
features in addition to its brains this
TV also has plenty of beauty it's one of
the slicker looking TVs in its price
range out there when seen from the front
it's got a nice thin silver bezel the
stand allows it to swivel on that stand
also makes the TV appear to hover above
a table so all told a really nice
looking television when seen from the
side it's not as thin as some of the
edgelet LED TVs out there it's a little
bit thicker about the size of a standard
LCD TV that's because LG uses direct LED
backlights as opposed to edge lighting
on the celeste expensive model so it's
got the good looks and it's got the
brains but the 6,200 doesn't perform
quite as well as a lot of the other TVs
in its price range the biggest culprit
is lighter black levels that means the
TV can't deliver that nice pop and
contrast that you see on some of the
other TVs we've tested the blacks are
relatively washed out and that leads to
some less impactful colors and
especially if you're watching in a dark
room or watching a dark scene another
issue is crosstalk with 3d sources
that's a ghosting that we really don't
to many other passive 3d TVs was pretty
unexpected and results in some of the
worst picture quality I've seen on any
3d compatible television inputs include
three HDMI three USB in a component
composite video input four analog
sources also unlike some hundred twenty
Hertz TVs this LG doesn't have quite the
motion resolution so the image can look
a little bit blurry or if you're
sensitive to that sort of thing on the
flip side it does have very accurate
color and the uniformity again thanks to
that direct LED backlight is pretty good
so you don't get the hot spots
associated with some of the other LED
TVs out there
all told however the LA 1600 is a
relatively disappointing performer for
its price range so it's really not the
greatest value that's a quick look at
LG's la 6200 series I'm David Katz -
