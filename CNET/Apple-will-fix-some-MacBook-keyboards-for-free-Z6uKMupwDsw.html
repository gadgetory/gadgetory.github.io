faulty MacBook keyboards on the house
after three years of backlash and
multiple lawsuits over issues with its
butterfly switch keyboard Apple finally
seems to have given in users with newer
MacBook and MacBook Pro models complain
about unresponsive or sticky keys and
letters her characters that would repeat
unexpectedly when typing in 2015
Apple switched from the traditional
scissor mechanism to a butterfly switch
keyboard that debuted on its 12 inch
retina MacBook
this allowed the keys to lie nearly
flush on the computer giving the newer
models a slimmer form factor now the
company had originally suggested
cleaning the keyboard with a can of
compressed air as a potential solution
but that didn't seem to fix the problem
and a proper repair at the store could
cost up to $700 if the device was not
under warranty Apple published the news
of the free repairs on Friday stating
that the type of service will be
determined after the keyboard is
examined and may involve the replacement
of one or more keys or the whole
keyboard of eligible models with the
butterfly keyboard these include all
laptops released by Apple since 2015
users with affected devices can set up a
repair appointment at the store or mail
it in and those who've already paid for
repairs can contact Apple for a refund
