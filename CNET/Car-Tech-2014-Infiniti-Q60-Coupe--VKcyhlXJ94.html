sportcoup√© to the q60 the paraphrase
Shakespeare by any other name
the q60 would handle as sweet let's take
a look at the 2014 Infiniti q60 earlier
this year Infiniti announced it was
changing the names of all of its cards
this is still the same styling as the
d30 72 just has a different badge on the
back so we have these really liquid
looking sheet metal fenders on the front
this being the coupe the q6 t we don't
have any rear doors we just have the two
front doors and we get this really nice
roof line design it really comes back
nicely to the rear fenders here in a lot
of ways the q6 t reminds me of the
Nissan 370z both cars share an engine
and performance characteristics but the
q6 t is about a foot longer and a lot
more comfortable inside now let's take a
look at the engine
I've seen this engine before and facts
haven't seen it since about 2007 that's
when the iPhone came out and George Bush
was still president this side engine is
from Nissan's
VQ series it's a v6 it's got 3.7 liters
of displacement that makes it the DQ 37
vhr it's got a double overhead cams and
variable valve timing that gets at 330
horsepower 270 pound feet of torque
those are pretty solid numbers from this
engine but what you don't get here is
direct injection or turbo charging or
anything like that that's what a lot of
other automakers are using to increase
efficiency and power
I expect that infinity will be upgrading
this engines sometime in the near future
well let's get in the cabin and check
the tax
I'm seeing a lot of familiar stuff in
this cabin here like the engine this
infotainment system here is about five
years old
it works well but it's not the latest
cutting-edge technology so we have the
seven inch touchscreen here then we have
this set of buttons in the style pad
here why would you have a touchscreen
and this kind of dial setup it's
actually pretty cool so when I have like
alphanumeric entry where this dial and
buttons would be a little bit tedious
and slow to use I can go straight to the
touchscreen and start hitting whatever I
want when I have like menu items and
things like that and I don't want to
really be looking at the screen and then
I can twist this dial and move these
buttons it's really convenient and when
I go to navigation here so this is a
hard drive system and that means the
navigation works pretty fast there's a
full set of maps on here they do plan
view that's top down and all some
perspective view so I'm looking at
perspective view right now and I get
some landmark buildings here that's kind
of neat it's a nice effect and I can use
that to help me navigate when I see that
building in the distance I know where I
am and in relation to it on the map when
I go to the phone system I get my phone
book and that's for my paired phone here
I can go straight to a dial number pad
and here so I've got a keypad I can
actually use the touchscreen to enter in
numbers really quickly it's again pretty
fast I mean it I can choose what I want
I like that quite a bit when I go to
audio now this is the strange thing
there to actually have a single audio
button up here which they really should
instead I get these am/fm these really
small buttons here for radio and for
stored media there's no HD radio on here
by the way this is an older system and
that's really about it this car doesn't
have too many audio sources one thing it
actually lacks is any sort of online
music sources or online search for the
navigation system again this is an older
system it's it's a little bit primitive
that way musics playing through a Bose
audio system here and I like the sound
of the system it's got a lot of good
bass so when I'm playing you know like
bass heavy tracks really thumping music
I can almost feel it coming through the
doors and you know through my abdomen
it's a it's a nice feeling immediately
when you like that kind of thing on the
console here I have my shifter that's
for a 7 speed automatic transmission
that's standard and really your only
choice in this q60 coupe journey model
if you get the sport
mama'll you get a six-speed manual
transmission some people might prefer
that for more sporty drive more fun this
one's okay
it's a torque converter transmission so
not as quick to shift as some of them
can be i also with this transmission I
have these big paddle shifters on the
steering column a lot of cards you get
the paddles mounted on the steering
wheel so if you turn the wheel the
paddles going to go with it here you
always kind of know where they are in
relation to the wheel you know it's kind
of fun you can maybe brag to your
friends about it now let's take the spot
on the road really good to get behind
the wheel of a really performance car
again it's been a little while in height
but feel over powerfully the whole
suspension and interior and all that
feels really nice and tight also that
the q engine it has a really good
responsive dead delivers just really
good linear power and the engine makes a
really good sound to even any just
normal drive mode on the transmission
you get this nice light roar out of it
right
step into it now the thing about the
manual shifting in this car is the
shifts are just a little bit slow I mean
this is a torque converter transmission
so you know they're just a little bit of
hesitation so it's not quite as snappy
as say with a dual clutch automatic
transmission I think the sport program
actually is a little more satisfying to
use if you're really hammering this car
through the corners now one thing else
interesting here is I believe this is
one of the few cars these days you can
get with hydraulic power steering that
has a nice heft to it I mean this
steering has a really nice heft to it
sort of an old-school feeling but it
doesn't have that really precision that
electric power steering can have and
some of the better tuned ones do have
these days and that's what they don't
feel economy this car gets 19 mouths
gallon city 27 miles per gallon highway
those are okay numbers though 27 is
really pretty nice and I think
realistically you're probably talking
about low 20 so you sort of have to
expect that it's not a super fuel
economy type of car
okay base price for 2014 Infiniti q60 is
forty thousand four hundred dollars now
in journey trim we have the Premium
Package that's three thousand two
hundred and fifty that brings in the
Bose audio system and the sunroof we
also have navigation one thousand eight
and fifty dollars now in journey trim
Infiniti sort of forces those options on
you you don't really have a choice about
those but we also have the Sport Package
here that's one thousand nine hundred
and fifty dollars that's an option
brings in nineteen inch wheels
sport-tuned suspension and at a limited
slip differential those are nice things
to have that's kind of a bargain at that
price we also have the Technology
Package on this car that's one thousand
two hundred fifty dollars that gives us
adaptive cruise control and the set of
advanced climate control system Infiniti
does not sure about that last bit but
adaptive cruise control is nice to have
all in we're at fifty thousand two
hundred five dollars not bad for a sort
of old-school fully loaded sport luxury
car
