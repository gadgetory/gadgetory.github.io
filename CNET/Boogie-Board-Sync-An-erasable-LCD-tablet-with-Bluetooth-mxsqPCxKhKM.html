fantasize about having a pad that can
connect to your iPad or to your computer
and save everything that you sketch on
it the boogie boards sync is that device
it's $99 and it's coming out at the end
of the month boogie board has actually
made a bunch of erasable LCD tablets for
kids and families that are already out
there
the difference with sync is that it's
Bluetooth connected as you can connect
this again to your tablet or computer
and use it as a virtual whiteboard you
can have it save hundreds of sketches
directly to this device and then it will
sync over to your iOS device or Android
or whatever what have you and output
them as image files that you can
actually import later on send out as
birthday cards or just keep on file
you could also connect it to Evernote
via the app so you can save what those
sketches are if you're writing any to-do
lists or you just like drawing pictures
of a triceratops like I do the boogie
board is very lightweight and that multi
erase LCD screen doesn't require any
special tech here so it's a little
pressure sensitive and you can draw in
here and it's fun and it feels a little
more like a futuristic extra sketch but
one that is instantly transmitting right
over here as I'm writing on this pretty
cool and it feels like something that's
a hybrid between something a kid would
like but an adult would use too and
would find a way to stick around your
home it could be a fun little stocking
stuffer it is a hundred dollars but it's
a really interesting tool and a nice
alternative to other types of stylus
technologies that you may have seen I'm
Scott Stein and that's a quick look at
the boogie board sink coming out soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
