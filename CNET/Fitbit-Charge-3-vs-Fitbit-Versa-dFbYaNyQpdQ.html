and smartwatches to choose from we're
comparing two of the most popular
fitbit's the charge three and the Versa
to see which is right for you so who
does comparison I want to talk about the
real-world use of these not so much
about the specs even though I will cover
some of that this is about how it's like
to live with both the Versa and the
charge three and also you're probably
wondering why we're doing this
comparison now I mean they've been both
out for a little while it's because
Fitbit OS 3 has been loaded onto these
finally we just kind of brought them
more in terms of parity in terms of what
they can do as both smartwatches and
fitness trackers so let's start with
design the charge 3 is obviously shaped
like a lot of the previous fit bits it's
small it's more of a fitness tracker
with a monochrome touchscreen the Versa
is much more a SmartWatch and fitness
tracker hybrid it's got a color screen
it's a touch screen as well and it's got
a couple more buttons than the charge 3
obviously if you want something really
simple and easy to use in terms of just
telling you your steps your heart rate
and calorie burn the charge 3 can do
that really easily
I like the Versa a little bit more just
because it gives me a lot more metrics
on the screen and I find the button
system it's just a little bit more
intuitive than the swiping on this
charge 3 that being said you can use the
same sort of gestures on both so you can
swipe down from the screen to see
notifications metrics and also change
settings within the menus too now the
display on both of them is pretty easy
to see when you're inside the race to
wake works fairly well on both of them
as well that being said when I was doing
an outdoor workout with the charge 3 in
bright sunlight I found that the highest
brightness setting on the screen wasn't
quite bright enough for me whether that
was on the automatic brightness setting
or in the normal brightness setting the
first there is just a little bit more
bright because it has that maximum
brightness so for that reason I found
the Versa a lot easier to see outside as
well it's a lot easier to change the
straps on the charge 3 than it is the
Versa the charge 3 has are just a little
button that detaches the strap and you
can swap in another one
easily the Versa has a little metallic
toggle that you kind of have to pinch
and squeeze and then move the bar out of
the way it's a little bit more tricky
than the charge three which is nice and
simple both of them use Gorilla Glass 3
to protect these screens from bumps and
scratches I haven't been wearing the
charge 3 as long as the Versa the Versa
has developed a couple of scratches on
the edge of the screen something to bear
in mind if you're someone that does sort
of bash around the watch a little bit
ins very active maybe consider putting a
screen protector on it
so both of fitbit's have pretty similar
fitness tracking features you can track
your heart rate you can track your sleep
that being said you have to have a phone
in order to get GPS data if you want to
track your route on something like a run
or a bike both use connected GPS not GPS
built in both let you set goal based
exercises so you can get a notification
once you've reached your calorie
distance or time goal you can put six
workout shortcuts on the charge three or
seven on the Versa I like just having
one more on the Versa it's really nice
if you're someone that does a variety of
different exercises and you don't
constantly want to be going back and
forth to the phone to add new ones in
the Versa has something that a charge
three doesn't have and that's the coach
app that's onboard on the watch face
itself so this actually runs you through
a number of different workouts and
exercises and it shows you visually like
the moves that you need to do I really
like that that being said you can get
the coach app on a phone itself and then
you can just put the phone down and
workout alongside it but it's just
really nice having it on the watch face
itself when it comes to sleep tracking
you can actually do it on both as I
mentioned the Versa is probably a little
bit less comfortable to sleep with I'll
have to say just because it's slightly
bigger obviously with the biggest screen
it's a lot easier to see your workout
details when you're in the workout on
the Versa than it is on the charge three
and when you finish that workout you can
actually see a lot more details about it
on the Versa then on the charge three
plus you can go through and see a couple
of previous workouts from days ago
rather than the charge today which
really only just shows you what you've
just done and then you have to go into
the Fitbit app itself
I found the charge 3 was perhaps
overestimating my maximum heart rate so
when it was tracking it I noticed it was
saying my maximum heart rate was around
200 BPM which was probably a lot higher
than it's ever been tracked on any other
previous fitness tracker or the Versa
itself so there's just something to bear
in mind if you're really thinking about
accuracy here and for the ladies there
is women's health tracking on both of
these devices it's pretty much the same
across both you can track your periods
and then also predict ovulation and your
fertility window
so both of the fitbit's are compatible
with iOS and Android and you can get the
same notifications from your phone
mirrored to each of these watches that
being said if you are an iOS user you're
only going to be able to see messages
when they come through and cause you're
not gonna be able to actually respond to
them like you can on Android and you can
also then in Android customize the quick
responses that you want to send when you
get a notification come through they
also both use proprietary charging
cables which is a bit of an annoyance if
you have a couple of different fit bits
or different generations of fit bits and
the battery life you'll get with each of
them you're going to get around almost a
week on the charge tree I say almost a
week because they say up to seven days I
think in reality it's more just like six
six and a half depending on how many
workouts you do and how much you're
really pushing it the Versa on the other
hand will get you just around four days
and that's with normal pretty much
normal use with a couple of workouts
thrown in each of them also comes with a
so-called special edition and that gives
you Fitbit pay which is fitbit's mobile
wallet so you can essentially tap to pay
with your credit card or debit card
using an NFC terminal when you're out
and about the special edition also means
that it's special in terms of the price
so it does cost a little bit extra I
would love to see the Fitbit Versa to
just come with the special edition all
in the one level so it's all just the
same device that being said I don't have
any insider information about the next
Fitbit I'm just spitballing and telling
you what I would really like to see on
it and it would just be Fitbit pay just
brought in to the regular Fitbit Versa
to device please the Versa also has a
lot more apps available and then the
charge three in fact the charge three
pretty much has nothing you can change
the watch face and they're obviously all
monochrome screens and they're all what
Fitbit wants you to have at the moment
the Versa has a lot more apps to choose
from and a lot more watch faces
especially since the Versa first
launched around a year ago the App Store
has really built out quite a lot and so
there are a lot of different apps for
things that you might want to do from
fitness tracking through to say news
on you'll watch I don't know why you
want to read the news on your watch but
it's there if you do want it so that's
kind of neat when it comes to music the
only one that can store music is the
Versa it can store around 300 songs and
the process to transfer them from your
computer to the watch itself gives a
little bit cumbersome I would really
love Fitbit versa too if you're
listening to make it so you can transfer
songs that you have on your phone onto
the watch really simply and seamlessly
over Bluetooth and Wi-Fi rather than
through your computer you can also use
DZ or Pandora apps on the Versa to store
music offline if you want to use it and
go for a run or just stream directly
from there but that's about it it's
these are in Pandora there's nothing
else in terms of streaming services so
no Apple music and there's Spotify so
you're probably wondering why I haven't
talked about the price of these yet and
that's kind of deliberate it's because
since the Versa was released about a
year ago the price has changed and come
down a lot there's been a lot of
specials and so it's come more in parity
with the charge three so really the only
difference between them especially if
you're getting the special edition as
well is only around twenty to fifty
dollars so it's not a huge question
about price that's not as really
significant as whether you want a
fitness tracker or more of a SmartWatch
itself so I wanted to just run through a
little bit of a wish list for the Versa
tube the Fitbit if you're listening I
hope that this really comes to be
because I think a couple of changes
could make it a really really strong
device I would love to see if you could
transfer music directly from a phone and
add a number of different streaming
services to it I would also love the
special edition to not exist just to get
Fitbit pay in the regular Versa - that
would be amazing
and number three having GPS onboard that
would just make it a really fully
fledged
all-around SmartWatch I think that would
be a great competitor to the Apple watch
as well so that's a comparison between
the charge three and the Fitbit Versa I
would love to hear some of your comments
suggestions about what you want to see
in the future Fitbit models or any
questions that I didn't answer in this
comparison let me know in the comments
below or you can find me on Twitter and
stay tuned to seen it for a lot more
comparisons in
versus series</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
