com here at South by Southwest 2012 we
are at the second market recovery house
which is actually the brainchild fan
right here yeah we're joined here today
with Barry silver he's the founder and
CEO SecondMarket now when we first heard
of second market the company we know of
it kind of as the company where people
with let's say private shares and
Facebook are exchanging them so can you
kind of actually yeah that all honestly
no that's what you guys are you know
kind of over recognized and brought to
the forefront with but can you kind of
explain all that and other things that
second market does yeah of course that
so we're creating the next growth market
the next Nasdaq we're creating the
marketplace where all the fast-growing
startups spend some time the number of
years before they ultimately go public
or as an alternative to going public
going public nowadays it's really tough
you got to be a billion dollar company
you got to tell you it's hard to build a
billion-dollar company so we're creating
that that that spring training that
bridge to get companies to that stage
where they can allow the employees to
sell some stock at the right time they
can maybe raise some money and there's a
real real real need for this and so
we've had over a billion dollars in
transactions it cost about fifty
companies so far that's interesting i
like what you say about i'm interested
in what you said about if companies are
not going to go public so you can
actually allow a private company to have
stock options that are worth something
to employer group private investors
right i mean imagine that imagine these
options that we get instead of it being
a lottery ticket actually having some
real value so now it takes like 10 years
to go public think about the ten years
ago public no one plant staying at a
company for ten years back r angel
investors bad venture capitalists and so
we're creating this this this interim
step to give companies at least the
ability to get to be able to go public
or maybe as an alternative so one of the
things that we we think about when we
hear that also though is that does this
more benefit i guess the employees and
people that have the money to invest in
these shares because at the moment this
is not something i like someone like
myself could jump and say i like to buy
some shares of like someone from a
startup company right now right well so
we're regulated so we have to comply
with the SEC rules the SEC rules say to
be able to buy the stuff you have to be
like a high net worth in bed
I would love to see that change and I
want to make that change hopefully in
the next few years but for now it is
limited to high-net-worth investors but
I need to make him sell whether you're a
rich person or a just out of school if
you have this the private stock you can
sell to us right but so it's not for us
right now we're allies would be a public
thing which is not the purpose that
you're not your friend yeah you know the
SEC wants to protect kind of the
unsophisticated investors now why they
tie net worth a sophistication I don't
know but that's the SU I'm really smart
I'm just kind of brokering so but really
it sounds like in some ways at least for
those companies that are going to stay
private it's just a way for them to do
more better maybe better venture capital
raising in a way that can also benefit
employee it's great for employees
because it means that you can actually
get some value it's really good for the
companies from from raising money
perspective because being able to tell
potential investors hey you don't have
to wait five seven ten years to get out
you may be only have to wait one year or
two years that that helps companies
raise money more efficiently and
definitely a better valuation well what
does it do in terms of taking stock off
the market for a company that is gonna
go public like somebody already own all
the good facebook stock and all the good
prices I mean okay I'm not gonna be
naive i know that's already true but
what do you make it worse well think of
it this way actually think we make a lot
better because what what happens over
the growth of a company is you have some
early investors that want to get out who
would sell it the IPO were soon after
the company goes public but what we're
doing is we're helping companies
transition those early stage guys off
the cap table and bring in new longer
term investors who will not just hold in
the IPO but by after the company goes
public so we're actually taking a lot of
kind of the supply off the market and
bringing in value at investors it sounds
like that because facebook is the
extreme case you're really trying to
serve more of the startup community but
because Facebook districts and what I
kill that's the name that's associated
with right i mean that was definitely
like the catalyst that come out during a
lot of buzz but we have 20,000 companies
profiled on SecondMarket right now and
the thing that we're actually announcing
today we're rolling out today is we're
allowing all those companies to claim
the presence on SecondMarket get
themselves notice the investment
community so whether they want to raise
money or do some type of secondary
liquidity they can now have a
a showing to the industrial Republic so
you've already created these profiles of
company is it how do you create the
profiles of companies do you think look
promising yeah it's it's so companies
request it so it's really easy to go on
there it's free say hey credit profile
for me or if they've done a round of
financing whether it's angel or series a
we've probably created a profile for
them already okay and then they can go
in and say hey that's me that's me and
then what's really cool about it is it's
it's a way for you to basically attract
and track investor interest so even if
you're not raising money it's kind of
like your profile to the investing
community because we have a hundred
thousand investors on the system that
want to invest in just these types of
companies so you're like half linkedin
half Nasdaq yeah okay I finally get it
what that means you see a future then
when in which a lot of started cuz it
used to be at least you know in the boom
that going public was the holy grail
first startup or yeah do you see a
future when the majority of startups
don't try to do that III think at some
point in the future there's not going to
be a difference between public and
private and there really shouldn't be
what what is going to be is there going
to be different marketplaces where
second market we're all about being
company friendly we're all about giving
companies complete control over how
their stock trades so I'm secondmarket
you decide when your markets open might
be once a year you get to decide who's
allowed to buy and you disclose
information but it's only two people you
approve so you're not like having to
file all of your your silly your secrets
into the public see now but there's a
check and balance built-in in filing
your secrets to the public right so that
shareholder relationship creates a
fiduciary responsibility it creates
transparent
we do sandy downs I think nobody's
making able to keep all the secrets well
we're all about trust and transparency
and so we require information be
disclosed but just because we're not
disclosing it to the whole world doesn't
mean that it's not all the material
information I mean companies have to
file these long 10 k's 10-qs all these
filings that no one action really even
reads it really is trying to protect the
unsophisticated investor well the
journalists and investors and regulators
read that information like you said your
regulated by the SEC right so the SEC
still has access to all of the
stabilization absolutely okay and then
like if i did a Freedom of Information
Act request I would still be able to get
this information on a company give a
shot I well I mean you know where for as
much transparency as possible so it's
kind of interesting one of the exciting
things about Facebook going public for a
lot of users was ok now we get to look
behind the curtain yeah yeah why I think
I think you know the problem is as
companies should not go public into the
mature to the business model is mature
and when you see his companies I'm used
to be able to go public when they were
much younger the market the public
markets like the types of companies but
today and when you look at some of the
companies egg on public they've been
destroyed in the public market it's it's
very much a casino now it's high
frequency trading its people short
selling it's something that I don't want
to be a part of as a CEO so I want to
keep a company private and most
entrepreneurs I knew do want to do that
as well yeah no reason I know you guys
would kind of go beyond this you you
have some of the projects like investing
in local banks and what all right
helping them out as well right yeah yeah
so what we've done is we've created this
as I mentioned before this very large
network of investors so 100,000
investors that want to invest in unique
investments so what you're going to
start seeing from second market actually
very very soon is we're gonna start
making available to all these investors
unique investment opportunities things
ranging from special fun vehicles that
allow you to invest in certain types of
private companies to real estate
investments to fixed income investments
stuff that you just can't find elsewhere
we're going to deliver to you right into
your any bumps okay so and then are you
going to love you the SEC for
up to smaller investors I found the one
is like so rich people are getting
Richard I'm getting mad well so my idea
is I think there should be a test so you
can either have a lot of money or you
can basically take a financial literacy
test and I've offered thats the SEC in
fact we've offered to create it and I
think I think that will happen but it's
not going to be this year it'll be Bob
for that example okay and then now
before we let you go the other great
service that you do to the people here
of a suit in Austin and South by
Southwest visitors is this recovery
house that we're in right now how long
have you been doing this so I'm actually
a newbie to south why's this is my first
year and so I yes and I'm having a blast
already and so you know it's really kind
of all about bringing together lots of
great people we have some really cool
parties over the next couple nights and
we've got free coffee and free drinks so
I'll see you yeah and i gotta say Austin
wonderful town not good coffee so the
fact that there's like blue bottle
coffee here is same I can also tell that
this is your first off myself question
or you're still chewy cheery and trippy
right now but I think give it a couple
more days are the bags or banjo I try to
develop I'm gonna start moping in like
