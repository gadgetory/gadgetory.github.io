your health with iPhone apps I'm Bridget
Carey this is your CNET update Apple is
getting more involved in your health
care the company created a software
platform for apps to share your medical
information with a doctor it's called
care kit and four apps have just been
updated to take advantage of this
there's an app called start it helps you
track if your medication for depression
is working there's an app called one
drop it helps those with diabetes try
glucose food and medications and
activity data it also syncs data with
Bluetooth monitors and there's another
app that I've been using for several
months already
it's called glow nurture and it's for
logging your habits during pregnancy and
to be honest I've never really cared to
use this to log my weight and my blood
pressure but it would be helpful if my
doctor could just plug in that info
during my visits and I could supplement
the data once in a while usually the
only benefit to pregnancy apps is that
they tell you how big your baby's
getting every week comparing the baby
size to fruits and vegetables apparently
today my baby is the size of a small
spaghetti squash but I don't know what
that is I have to translate this into
gadgets speak so at 18 inches my baby is
about the length of a samsung galaxy
view tablet and at 5.3 pounds that comes
out to about three surface pros okay
well back to care kit there's another
one called glow baby and that can help
track my infant's growth and feeding
schedules eventually but it's not just
for me unless I can find a pediatrician
that is set up to monitor this data and
that's gonna be the biggest challenge
for Apple I mean some doctors can't even
get switched properly to electronic
records much less be ready to adopt a
care kit but if doctors don't upgrade
maybe some fitness apps could use care
kit to send data to personal trainers
meanwhile for those that could care less
about physical activity there is some
virtual reality news Samsung announced
that it is working on creating its own
VR headset and this would be able to
sense how you're moving in the virtual
space right now Samsung does have the
gear VR it created that with the help of
oculus and it's powered by a smart
inside the visor but during a
presentation a Samsung executive said
that in three years you could have
technology like a holodeck experience
where you can interact with objects well
at least someone's working on making my
Star Trek dreams come true that's all
for this technique is round up you can
