passport wireless from WD and this is
basically a my passport purple drive
plus a built in battery and a Wi-Fi
network the idea is not new even the
name is not new because before this here
I will have this Seagate wireless right
here or the Samsung wireless here and I
even have this low C feel now all of
these here they are the mobile wireless
immediate dry now the idea is you plug
this one here into a computer and put a
ton of content on it videos photos music
and then when you are on the go it can
actually stream that to other devices
like this tablet right here or the
laptop it comes with a mobile app to
facilitate that streaming and that's
pretty standard what is not standard
however is that it also comes with a
built-in SD card slot right here you can
use this slot right here to quickly back
up an entire SD card onto the drive we
just make it very good for a photograph
oh and let me show you all right so let
me insert this card in here right now
okay
now note that you cannot use the app to
actually directly view the content of
the SD card first you have to actually
copy the card content onto the drive
first and here we go the picture I just
took and the secret is out I've been
talking to nobody the hotel and by the
way by nobody I mean my camera man and
very important nobody that is apart for
mobile devices you can also connect to
this my passport while is here the way
you do in a server using fighter on a
Mac or Windows Explorer on a Widow's
computer and there's also this web
interface for you to manage the device
using a web browser
alright performance why this one is it
very well my testing as the portable
drive it offers the sustained real-world
speed of some hundred and ten megabyte
per second for reading or writing that
is really fast now the mobile apps works
pretty well my testing but note that it
only supports streaming for the file
format supported
natively by the device for other type
five formats you have to use some
third-party apps now as for the price
this new passport drive here is
available in three capacity 500 gigabyte
one terabyte and to tell by that cost
$120 $180 and $220 in the u.s. pricing
for the UK and Australia is not
available at this time but should be the
same vicinity I'm on the driveway check
out my full review at cnet.com you know
is one of the best wireless mobile media
drives on the market
why because I say so and that's because
I'm down low and this has been the first
look at the My Passport
Wireless 4wd</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
