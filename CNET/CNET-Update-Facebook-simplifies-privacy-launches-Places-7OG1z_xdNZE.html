after Spotify and Sony creates its own
TV service I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your cnet update facebook is trying to
simplify privacy settings the network
launched a new page called privacy
basics it has all the same privacy
settings as before but now the font is
really big and you can slowly click
through a guide to learn about each
setting because I guess larger fonts
make you feel safer Facebook is likely
doing this because most people don't
trust Facebook with their data well they
don't trust any communication company
really a recent pew research study says
nine out of 10 Americans believe they
have no control over personal
information and how it's collected and
used by companies while Facebook tries
to clean up its reputation on privacy it
also launched a new page that competes
with Yelp it's called Facebook Places
and you can search for things to do in
any city it highlights restaurants
hotels attractions and entertainment and
with those places you also see the
mentions and photos of those places
taken by your friends right now it's not
very good on mobile it's easier to use
on your desktop browser Twitter
announced it'll be making changes over
the coming months it'll have easier ways
to share video and there will be more
options to make a private comment on a
public conversation and to help you feel
like you're not missing out it'll show
you some tweets you missed while offline
because Twitter tracks what you click to
guess what tweets you may like to see
truth is Twitter's a messy complicated
network to learn if you're new at it and
there's so much noise it can feel too
busy to follow everything people use
other services like TweetDeck to manage
the Twitter madness I'm not sure if
these small changes would be enough to
keep users and bring in new ones but it
is a start in other news sony unveiled
details about its online TV service
called PlayStation view it will roll out
with about 75 channels with programs
from major networks and local broadcast
stations and you don't need cable or
satellite subscriptions to watch it's
the first multi-channel television
service that
runs completely over the internet but we
don't know how much it'll cost per month
more details will come when it launches
early next year and YouTube is launching
its own streaming music service for
music videos it's called YouTube music
key and on Monday you can get it for
about ten dollars a month right now
YouTube is the number one site for
people to go to for listening to music
but if you pay there are no ads and you
can stream offline another bonus pain
for google play music streaming also
gets you access to YouTube's music key
and vice versa so it's a two for one
that's your tech news update there's
always more at cnet com from our studios
