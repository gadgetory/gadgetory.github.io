is a first look at the Samsung are at
four to eight 9h ARS refrigerator as you
can see this is a really substantially
sized refrigerator there's a lot of
space inside of it it has 28 cubic feet
total capacity which is large it has a
freezer drawer that has really nice
features it's got a drawer that slides
in and out on top of the main lair
it also has a slot for 12-inch frozen
pieces if you use those a lot in your
homes perhaps the most interesting
actual refrigerator feature is the Flex
drawer which allows you to control the
temperature to four different levels
initially when I looked at this fridge I
thought that the Flex drawer would
detract from the overall space in the
main refrigerator body but it doesn't at
all as you can see the inside of the
main body of the refrigerator is
shockingly large it gives you a lot of
options for door height so you can
adjust those accordingly depending on
the size of the items you're storing and
you can also move the shelves to
different heights while those are really
basic features and can be found on many
refrigerators Samsung makes it very user
friendly in a way that others do not but
now we get to the high-water mark of
this refrigerator which is the LCD
screen that Samsung includes above the
ice and water dispenser one of the
things I really like about it is that
when you have it just in homescreen mode
it'll tell you the exact temperatures of
the insides of both your freezer and
your refrigerator so that if there is a
problem and you've lost power to one you
can always tell it also includes a lot
of apps such as Epicurious which allows
you to research recipes based on the
items you have in your fridge or items
that you are looking to buy from the
grocery store and if you do not have
those items already you can create a
shopping list usually based on a weekly
menu that you plan to prepare it also
includes news sites weather bug a
calendar app Twitter
well you can't actually tweet from this
fridge the Twitter app will allow you to
access your Twitter feed and stay up on
your news but perhaps our favorite up is
the Pandora app which allows you to
customize your stations just as you
would on your computer or your cell
phone and play music through the
refrigerator in your kitchen it also
includes a grocery manager app which
allows you to keep
inventory of the items that are in your
fridge we've made a how-to video for how
to use this app in particular so be sure
to check that out but the two apps that
might interest you the most particularly
if you have a family or a bit of a
shutterbug there's a photo app that
allows you to input your SD card into
the refrigerator from your camera and
download all of your photos to be used
as a screensaver along those lines
another great app is the memo app which
allows you to write memos and post them
on the LCD screen for your family to see
the LCD screen is a little clumsy to use
it is responsive but some of the apps
are not as responsive as we would like
but for it being one of the first models
of refrigerators to include an LCD
screen we're still pretty impressed with
the product with the Samsung RF 4 to 8 9
