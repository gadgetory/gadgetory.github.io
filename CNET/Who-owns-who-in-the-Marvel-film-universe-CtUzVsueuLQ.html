untangling who owns the rights to put
your favorite Marvel characters on
screen is a tricky affair here's who
owns who in the Marvel Universe let's
start with Marvel itself Marvel
Entertainment is the company in charge
of everything Marvel related including
comics and movies Marvel Entertainment
was bought by Disney in 2009 but in the
years before this Marvel had been
selling the rights to make movies about
its characters two other Studios for
example in the mid-90s 20th Century Fox
got the rights to super-powered mutant
GaN Xing
and has been making successful movies
about them ever since Fox also still
gets to make movies about the Fantastic
Four and the fourth wall breaking
Deadpool meanwhile Sony has long owned
the movie rights to your friendly
neighborhood spider-man but in a recent
Alliance decided to allow the character
to pop up in Marvel Cinematic Universe a
deal that it's thought will see Marvel
not taking a cut of Sony's own
spider-man's standalone films some
superhero movie deals specified that as
long as films about the heroes keep
getting made the rights remain which is
why Marvel is unlikely to get complete
ownership of spider-man and x-men back
anytime soon some heroes have made a
return however including Punisher Ghost
Rider blade and The Man Without Fear
daredevil who's currently starring in
his own Netflix series determining who
owns who isn't always so clear-cut
it's thought that there are
entanglements concerning Universal
Pictures and the ocean-dwelling Namor or
a standalone feature about the
Incredible Hulk while the super speedy
Quicksilver has actually appeared in
both x-men and Avengers films because
both 20th Century Fox and Marvel are
allowed to use him with new deals being
forged all the time however everything
could change we might get to see
Wolverine fighting Thor after all
although I'm sure Ironman would rather
magneto stayed out of his fictional
universe
