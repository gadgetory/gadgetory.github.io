today we're gonna take a look at the
Lenovo ideas Center a 720 so this is a
pretty high-end on one from Lenovo it
has a lot of touch oriented features on
it that make it kind of an interesting
system you can see it has a nice big
screen here it's a 27-inch display
although it's only 19 by 10 it's also a
multi-touch screen they can recognize up
to 10 different points of input at once
now on top of all that well Nova has
also designed a case so the screen is
really adjustable in fact you can drop
it all the way down so it sits flat you
can put it on a coffee table or some
central location and get sort of a party
atmosphere going around your touch
screen I guess there's a couple games
that come with the system that work well
like this particularly air hockey this
game is called wang and it sort of is
like pong actually the idea though is
that you use your hands to create two
different paddles and you can play
against an opponent and you'd hit a ball
back and forth object is to get the ball
across the other side of the screen so
the touch features work actually pretty
well and the fact that you can lie down
the screen flat seems to create some
interesting opportunities for how you
might be able to use this system the
problem though is that there aren't that
many apps available for it you can see
here sort of this idea touch environment
that lenovo has they've broken it down
into six different groups you've got
music files videos photos on with games
widgets and up here you get ebooks now
all those are media files you can feed
in and certainly take advantage of those
but in terms of specific apps you're
limited to what Lenovo provides you here
the biggest part of the Apple ever
though is the games so we blow that up
here we can see some of the titles are
familiar there's Angry Birds there's
fruit ninja air hockey certainly makes
sense and there's some other games you
may have seen before so by releasing
this system if she wants a head of
Windows 8 it really seems like the novel
is trying to capitalize on that touch
base PC demand the problem though is
that as soon as one of those eight
launches they're most likely going to be
other own ones out there that have big
touch screens so the best advice then is
probably to wait before spending a whole
lot of money on a big touchscreen PC
right now so another problem with this
system is that because it has this fancy
design and multi-touch input it doesn't
quite have the core computing features
we like to see in a system in this price
range so again this cost about 1450 for
this particular model and for that price
we expect terabyte hard drives
seven CPUs decent graphics cards this
system though only has a core i5 chip a
500 gigabyte hard drive and really a
budget graphics card from a video now
it's fast enough for everyday use and
you can play mainstream games on it but
it doesn't quite have that oomph we like
to see in a higher-end all-in-one
there's a series of touch activated
buttons down here in the bottom edge of
the display to give you volume display
controls as well as the ability to swap
the signal to the HDMI input that's a
great feature we've done over at a lot
of times before basically what it does
is it lets you connect an external video
source into the system you use it as a
standalone monitor note over here in the
spar side there's also a blu-ray drive
which is a great feature and there's a
couple ports that are useful
particularly USB 3 there's no digital
audio output which is a little
disappointing but overall it's a
well-equipped home entertainment system
all that said that I really can't
recommend the system because so much of
its value is tied up in its ability as a
touch PC and with other high-end touch
focused all in one's coming out closer
the launch of Windows 8 it makes far
more sense to wait before spending a lot
of money right now one more thing I'd
like to add is that have had a few
readers asked to put Windows 8 on the
system and write up that experience so
I'm gonna do that and there's not going
to be that within the context of the
review since when it was 8 isn't final
yet it doesn't actually ship on this
system so it wouldn't be quite
appropriate to incorporate that into the
rating but stay tuned and we'll have
some windows 8 based content on the
system hopefully soon so I'm rich Brown
