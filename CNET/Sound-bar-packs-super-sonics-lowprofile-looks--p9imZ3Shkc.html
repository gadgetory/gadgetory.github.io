we are taking a look at the speaker
craft cs3 this is a high-end sound bar
that's currently selling for around six
hundred dollars the speaker craft uses a
pedestal design which means it's
designed to sit under your TV rather
than in front of it that gives you a
really nice look as a sound bar tends to
just blend in with your TV cabinet plus
it avoids the problem that some sound
bars have of blocking the TV's remote
sensor the cs3 is also well designed
otherwise with nicely curved edges on
the front and a nifty removable speaker
grill that's held on by magnets
underneath the grill you can see the cs3
has quite a few drivers including 21
inch tweeters in 43 inch mid-range
drivers plus there are two subwoofers on
the bottom the one thing you'll notice
that isn't on the front panel is any
sort of display so you're not going to
get any kind of visual feedback when
you're adjusting the volume which can be
a little annoying unfortunately the
included remote is pretty lousy it's
just a tiny cheap feeling remote with
mushy buttons and a confusing layout now
you can always get around that by using
a good universal remote but you really
do expect better on a product that's
expensive on the back there are just a
few inputs one optical one coaxial and
an analog input that's not much but it's
really not an issue since you can
connect all your devices directly to
your TV and then connect your TV's audio
output right to the cs3 the real
standout feature is built-in Bluetooth
connectivity that makes it possible to
wirelessly stream music from just about
any smartphone any ipad and many other
tablets you'd think that Bluetooth would
be a standard feature in sound bars by
now but it's frequently missing
especially from high-end models so it's
nice to see it here now as much as I
like the way pedestal sound bars look
they generally don't sound as good as
systems with the separate subwoofer but
the speaker craft cs3 is an exception as
it's one of the best sounding sound bars
we've reviewed even with its pedestal
design resident audiophile Steve
Guttenberg listened to the system and he
was really impressed at how well it
handled both high impact action movies
and to channel music which most sound
bar straw
with it's not quite as good as Atlantic
technologies PB 235 but it is pretty
close and it this looks a heck of a lot
better the real sticking point with the
cs3 is the price budget-minded shoppers
will do better with the three hundred
dollars evox Z base for 20 which has a
very similar design but it doesn't quite
sound or look as good and it's also
worth pointing out that at six hundred
dollars you could get much better sound
with a cheap AV receiver and some
separate tower speakers but the
speakercraft cs3 is for those that want
a simpler unobtrusive home audio system
that still delivers excellent sonics and
on those counts it's a real winner
you'll have to pay a lot for its
combination of talents but the
speakercraft cs3 is a worthwhile
investment for a great-looking sound bar
that will serve you well for years I'm
Matthew miskovic and this is the speaker
craft cs3</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
