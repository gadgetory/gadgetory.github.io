Chromebooks i'm dan ackerman and this is
the lenovo thinkcentre chromebox now
chromebox is what you call a computer
that runs Google's Chrome OS but it's
built into a desktop chassis rather than
a laptop shape and that's what
Chromebooks are why would you want to
have Chrome OS in a desktop well that's
a good question its uses are actually
fairly limited because with chrome OS
you basically get a fancy version of
Google's Chrome browser a couple of very
minor kind of you know file and storage
options and that's really about it it's
meant to be an online-only device so
you're basically surfing the internet
all day every day now if you're at work
and that's what Lenovo ThinkCentre line
is for the basically work computers and
you need to access your company email
but it's a web-based email well that'll
work or use a cloud-based office things
like like Microsoft's Office online or
Google Docs that'll work also if you
need to do very specific things like
photo and video editing and using
Photoshop well that's going to present a
problem because you can't download and
install apps on a Chrome OS system you
can however use cloud-based alternatives
like Pixlr and polar for photo editing
those actually both work fairly well and
you can also use the cloud versions of
microsoft office so you can use Google
Docs whether it's a word processing
document or spreadsheets and of course
you can do media streaming on here just
fine things like Spotify work well as
does netflix the reason why you'd want
to get a Chrome OS desktop for you or
your employees because they're very
inexpensive this thing starts at about
two hundred dollars we have a fancier
version here that has an intel core i3
processor a very mainstream fairly
powerful processor and that's about $300
a little bit more a little bit less
depending on on who's selling them
online and for that you get the base
unit it throws in a wired keyboard and
mouse nothing special there you get a
antenna you have to screw into the back
if you want to use Wi-Fi instead of a
wired internet connection and this cool
little stand you actually don't need the
stand
if you want this thing to stand up
upright it'll stay fairly well you can
also lay it down flat like this or even
hide it behind your monitor lenovo makes
a special monitor that this will just
slot in it becomes almost like an
all-in-one computer or of course you can
put it on the special stand like this
and it holds it at a decent angle you
can get to the couple of ports in the
front around the back there's also a lot
of other ports two more USB threes on
top of the two USB 3s in the front
ethernet obviously hdmi and displayport
that's how you know it's a work machine
DisplayPort that very confident offices
not so much at home so if you walk into
the morning and you find one of these on
your desk this is the scientist or where
computer you're probably not going to be
too enthusiastic it's not the most
exciting computer in the world but if
you or your employees just need to
access online only tools and you don't
want to spend a lot to do it this is
certainly a fine way to get people
online i'm han ackman and that is the
lenovo thinkcentre chromebox</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
