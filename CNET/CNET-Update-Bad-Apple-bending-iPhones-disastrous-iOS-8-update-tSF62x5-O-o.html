updates it's not a good week for the new
iPhones I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your CNET update Apple released an
update to its iOS 8 mobile operating
system on Wednesday but instead of
fixing bugs
it caused bigger problems some iPhone 6
owners reported that after downloading
the 8.0 point one update their phones
could no longer connect to cell networks
it also broke the touch ID fingerprint
scanner so pretty much turned the iPhone
into an iPod this problem seems to have
only affected the new iPhone models and
Apple pulled the update shortly after
going live Apple released iOS 8 a week
ago and since then there have been
several reported glitches and problems
with battery life and Wi-Fi connections
this update was designed to patch some
of those bugs and if that wasn't bad
enough for Apple there's another
controversy sweeping social media
several iPhone six-plus owners say it's
easy to accidentally bend the aluminum
frame of the extra large phone photos
posted online show a slight warp in the
thin frame after people sat with the
phone in their front pants pocket of
course anything can bend and break if
you sit on it but with such a thin
aluminum frame the iPhone 6 models could
be more susceptible to damage let this
be a warning to use protection
put a case on your phone or instead of
jamming it into your pants there's
always the option of the hip daddy belt
clip or maybe you want to go with more
of an old-school holster and there's
another phone out there that claims to
not Bend so easily the new blackberry
Passport
blackberry is at it again with a new
phone but this time it's begging to get
your attention and win back your love
with an unusual Oso square shape since
you can see more on a wide screen it
hopes that you'll find Square to be hip
for doing more work blackberry fans
always love physical keys but it's not
as easy to type on this as older
blackberries and it's too wide to use
with one hand the keyboard does have an
interesting trick its touch sensitive so
you can use it to scroll the big problem
with blackberry is the lack of popular
apps that you know
we find on Apple and Android devices to
answer that problem you can download
Android apps from the Amazon App Store
but that still leaves you limited
blackberry has yet another twist if you
carry around a second phone or tablet
even if it's an iPhone or Android phone
it created this app called blackberry
blend you can check your emails text
calendar and other documents across
multiple devices but these days not many
companies are giving you a work phone
people are using their personal phones
for work and when you only get one phone
you don't tend to buy a blackberry times
they're changing that Blackberry is
still struggling to fit in with today's
mobile needs
