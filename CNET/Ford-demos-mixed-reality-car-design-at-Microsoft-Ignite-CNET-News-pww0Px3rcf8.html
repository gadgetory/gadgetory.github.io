doesn't just affect the look and feel of
the car it impacts safety the team at
Ford can now see the real-time impact on
visibility when adjusting the dimensions
of that sideview mirror historically
they need to create a full-scale replica
of the car and have someone sit in the
driver's seat to get that line of sight
on the side view angle but now they're
able to consider design changes as well
as regulatory requirements
well simultaneously seeing with the
driver would see essentially being two
places at the same time the team at Ford
is often working against tight deadlines
with teams all across the globe in the
future with Microsoft technology they'll
be able to join a call and enter the
same shared experience allowing them to
see their creations and to rapidly
review designs quicker than ever before
Terry's gonna bring Noah into the
discussion you'll see Noah on one screen
and a view into what Noah is seeing on
another screen as he's working remotely
Noah is wearing one of our new windows
mix reality headsets which will be
available starting October 17th now Noah
has a fully immersive view so as Terry
makes changes to the mirror Noah sees
those exact same changes live in virtual
reality our vision for the future one's
physical and digital worlds across
devices empowering people to collaborate
and the same shared experience from
anywhere around the world</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
