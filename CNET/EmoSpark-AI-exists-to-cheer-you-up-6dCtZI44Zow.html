PC net we're taking a look at the emo
spark a I it's an artificial
intelligence for your home let's
investigate
so the emo spark is a crowdfunding
success story and what it does is
basically can be sorted into two
separate categories so on the one hand
it serves practical function so you can
ask this thing to do things like look
things up on Wikipedia it can play music
through YouTube you can ask it the
weather or it can tell you notifications
from Facebook control for that all
happens through your smart phone it's
got an app with it and that monitors
your facial expressions too so that it
knows who it's looking at now that's
where the second and more interesting
parts of this product comes in because
this thing monitors your emotions and it
knows when you're happy it also knows
when you're unhappy and it will try its
best to keep your mood up so this has
been described as a learning machine so
if it shows you for example a Facebook
notification and you don't react very
well it might think twice about showing
you one in the future so as well as
building up a picture of you over the
time you could also be able to build up
a picture of the cube and that's because
you can actually influence the cubes
mood by how you treat it if for example
you're always really really nice and
polite to the cube then it'll feel good
and that will be represented by these
emotions that you can see on screen here
if however you are mean or say nasty
things or a just a bit rude it will
react quite badly and over time that
will impact how the cube talks to you
and how it treats you so to start with
this thing is more about the practical
side those things about sorts of making
the cube learn and developing its own
emotions are going to be longer term
things I'm told but it is quite
interesting if you say something mean to
this and you can see the sort of
emotional spike first say terror or fear
it's not a great feeling you kind of
want to be nice to this thing so
longer-term another use for this could
be linking up with home automation so
you could do things like tell the cube
to turn your home appliances on and off
now it is quite expensive to start with
it's going to cost three hundred and
twenty-five dollars to just get the cube
or if you pay four hundred and twenty
dollars you can get it with this
standalone camera attachment which could
for example sit on your mantelpiece and
monitor your facial expressions from
there so it's clearly very early days
for this product but it's a really
interesting idea and it's worth asking
would you welcome something like this
into your home let me know and check out
seen it
come from all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
