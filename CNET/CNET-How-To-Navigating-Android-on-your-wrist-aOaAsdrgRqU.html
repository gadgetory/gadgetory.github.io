operating system that is designed for
the next wave of smartwatches currently
the Samsung gear live and LG G watch are
the only Android wear devices available
while the Moto 360 is slated to arrive
later this year I'm Dan Graziano and in
today's how to I am going to show you
how to set up and navigate the Android
wear operating system I'm here with the
gear live when you take it out of the
box you will most likely have to charge
it while that's happening you should go
and download the Android wear app on
your smartphone from the google play
store open the app accept Google's Terms
of Service and select your watch in my
case the gear live will be on the list
for you it could be the G watch after
you pair the watch you will be required
to grant it access to your notifications
click notification settings and check
off the Android wear box your watch is
now paired and ready for use the Android
wear app gives you access to even more
options such as automatically silencing
your phone when the watch is connected
and even muting app notifications both
of which I went over in an earlier video
the Android wear operating system is
rather straightforward although some
features and settings are buried in odd
menus notifications appear in the form
of Google now like cards that can be
swiped from left to right to be
dismissed or from right to left to view
additional information swiping from the
bottom to the top will show you more
cards while swiping all the way to the
top will give you a quick way to mute or
unmute the watch if you're looking to
dim the screen simply cover the display
with your hand a long press on the clock
icon will give you the ability to choose
a new watch face while a single press
will open the voice menu from here you
can speak commands to access various
features or swipe down to see a list of
preset options at the bottom of the menu
is a start option for opening additional
features such as the heart rate monitor
on the gear live you will find the
device settings directly above the start
option in the voice menu or in Samsung's
watch with a long press of the side
button the first thing I
men doing is scrolling down to about and
checking to see if there's any software
updates available for those of you
advanced users just like on your
smartphone developer options can be
enabled on Android wear by tapping build
number seven times for more how to's
like this one be sure to check out how
to see calm you can also reach out to me
on twitter with any questions or
comments i'm dan graziano cnet thanks
