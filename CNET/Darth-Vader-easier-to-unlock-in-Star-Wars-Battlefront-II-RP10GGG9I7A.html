Star Wars Battlefront 2 officially will
be released on Friday November 17th
however people who pay for EA access
were able to play a version of the game
early here's what they found
unlocking a character like Luke
Skywalker would take 40 hours of
gameplay or you'll have to pay to get
him this did not sit well with players a
reddit post entitled seriously I paid
$80 have vader lot got an official
response from EA the games developer in
part the response said the intent is to
provide players with a sense of pride
and accomplishment for unlocking
different heroes this comment managed to
rack up six hundred and fifty eight
thousand down votes as of this reporting
this is also the most downloaded comment
in the history of reddit to mitigate the
backlash EA said it's making some
changes by reducing the amount of
credits needed to unlock characters like
Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker each will
be available for fifteen thousand
credits which is down from sixty
thousand credits that would mean it
would take around 10 hours of gameplay
instead of 40 to unlock those characters
Star Wars Battlefront 2 is also drawing
heat for the amount of microtransactions
in the game essentially it puts gamers
on an uneven playing field since some
people will just pay for more powerful
characters instead of earning them the
EA's changes satisfy you let us know for
