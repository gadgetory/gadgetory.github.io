internets tech eous campbell ingame show
where we round up the week's hottest
rumors and the bet our life's on them
not really this isn't the Hunger Games
it's just it's not a life and death
situation but we do bet on them and also
we take it incredibly serious incredibly
serious I mean more right now I just
wanted to point to the board that
because Instagram is coming to Android
first before Windows Phone i want to
point and now we are tongue tied up
which is actually pretty exciting yeah
because it's a cliffhanger yeah it is a
cliffhanger so it's like very new agey
like we're both winners yeah we get in
this game of life yes so right off the
top we got a great interesting awesome
tip from one of our fans who left us a
voicemail I'll called our tip line
called our tip line left us a tip and we
would like to play that for you right
now hello Kareem Emily and Stephen this
is chris calling lovely listening from
canada the Solstice me on Twitter so I'm
calling in with a rumor that I caught
wind of on Twitter actually so there's
been kind of visa rumblings going around
the interwebs and Molly would it
actually confirmed on today's episode of
buzz out loud that cnet live will be no
more now I would like to say that as an
unnamed source now but unfortunately but
unfortunately I can't because through
Twitter Kareem has confessed all but
confirmed that the future of rumor has
remained anonymous sort out I just
wanted to hear the hear the explanations
and to see what's going on to see what
is coming up from what is brewing I in
fact actually asked Kareem on Twitter
whether or not there's something I was
brewing in the works and she's so coyly
responded that we will find out in
today's episode therefore and just
calling in just to see you know what's
going on I think that you guys are great
I'm really sad to hear the shows
potentially
could be coming to an end soon and the
other awesome so I'd love to hear what
else is coming up talk to you soon well
Chris this whole despair thank you so
much for calling and asking that
question and yes we have to confirm
sadly today on this our penultimate
episode that in fact rumor has it is
dying and untimely death yeah it's dying
if it's the plug is getting poles I am
way before its time it's not even right
in its prime it exactly it's at the
primary player yet and unfortunately
olive cnet live except for the 404 is
going bye-bye and the 404 will be the
backbone of seen it live but we
unfortunately will be no more in this
format and I want we want to say we're
so sad about it we've been sad for a
Whitley we've known for a couple days
and we are devastated they are kind of
devastated lately and really make a joke
about it we love you guys we did not
intend for this to be a pop-up show yeah
just like 26 shows after a iphone 5
rumors died and then is leaving right as
the iphone 5 rumors are popping back up
I know just pretty ironic cuz like the
iPhone 5 is the biggest rumor that there
is around yeah it's probably good that
we're ending so we can stop talking
about the iphone 5s we never talked
about it because we were fused right
after the iphone 4 came and now it's
leaving um but we're so sad guys and we
love you we've had so much fun with you
we wanted really like our intention for
this show was to really grow from years
from now and we would be talking about
rumors about embeddable skin
technologies oh wait we're talking about
that on this show but we were gonna you
know we had grand plans but just because
rumor has it as a podcast is dying
doesn't mean necessarily that Kareem and
I and Stephen are going to be no longer
in your lives on cnet TV right so rumor
has it we might you know we're going to
try to get it back in a different format
we might try to get the three of us back
in a different format so just because
rumor has it as
live podcast is ending does not mean
that this is the last you'll see of us
you can still find us on Twitter of
course you can still email us the rumor
has it email address is still going to
be live i'm going to still keep the
rumor show twitter account live and
we'll tweet you from beyond every rain
every time that you read any article on
cnet you can know that Kareem is in the
background there with you because cream
coffee edits I read that article as well
read it and she has fixed probably a
missing apostrophe in an it's or saying
that's my main job so so anyway so yeah
we'll we'll always be here you can
always you can email us directly you can
tweet us like I said and you know maybe
some people were suggesting that maybe
we continue the humiliation day just
like once a month do a video and put it
on our YouTube page what you've been
doing so maybe we'll continue doing some
humiliations if we come up with some
good ones and we can tweet them at you
or whatever oh yeah and actually
everyone we need the fans to send us
good humiliations for the last show
we're gonna try to do as many
humiliations as we can yes exactly i am
them in videos in studio pod live

bit more explanation of why this is
happening before we get to our final and
last episode where we're going to talk
about rumors and bet on them seen it as
a whole is getting rid of all the live
shows but cnet videos are still going to
be a thing so what what's happening in
the department and with us is that
they're gonna there are going to be a
lot more new shows coming up that are
really exciting with a lot of the faces
that you know and in rather than being a
30 minute or hour long live show they'll
be shorter like buzz report which you
guys know and love right or apple pie
yes a little bit green and Steven and I
are hoping that rumor has it will get to
come back to life in a reincarnated
version like that in a like three
minutes snappy show or something but we
have to pitch it and get people to
believe that you guys want to watch it
so yeah I want to write in and tell the
powers that be that you love rumor has
it you want it to come back right or if
you want to just if you want to you know
send a note to rumor has it at cnet com
and tell them how much you enjoy a rumor

whatever capacity we can do it that
would be great we will you know keep it

the more emails we can gather like that
would be awesome to show it that people

sausage and thoroughly but we are hungry
yeah all the time hungry and we
love beer you want to do so but yeah but
if you guys want to email us or whatever
and try to save rumor has it in some
kind of capacity we can see what we
could do could see if that helps shells
yes and on that note let's get to our
first rumor we now we're actually going
to talk about rumors yes and our first
rumor comes from our original number one
super fan Carl Carl from the very
beginning has been watching every one of
our shows and afterwards and before all
throughout the week sending us tips
sending us tips and then also being like
that was a really great show girls like
you've been really encouraging like he's
our coach Angora agoura hills yeah
wherever that is somewhere in California
Southern California it's in the valley
so yeah it was just like Oh Carl he's
our little dad he is and we've actually
spoken about Carl's rumors a lot on the
show but we haven't always given him
credit but on this episode Carl gets
full credit he sent us last week I
actually think it was last Monday before
our last show he sent us a rumor about
which you guys have already I'm sure
heard if you've listened to TV or the
radio or anything recently about nokia
filing a patent for a tattoo that can
answer your phone karl was on top of
this me to send it to us send it to
thursday and then we were like almost a
bit until not sway because is not really
very pressing i'm only rarely me talk
about arenal but then our by waiting we
kind of missed the news cycle on it
because every news organization picked
it up wait wait don't tell me was
talking about it because everyone
thought it was so silly but here is the
gist it's what has happened this is
confirmed the rumor is what will they do
with it nokia you remember them the
struggling little finnish company who
used to be on top and now is on the
bottom and who's trying to come back
with the nokia lumia 900 which is going
to be on sale for one hundred dollars
i'm so you're gonna bring them back
really instead that's awesome like this
tiny amazing smart mark I can't wait to
see it so that company who is an old
fuddy-duddy and we remember as the ones
who had the long phones that you could
take the faceplates off of and you could
have like the green face plate and the
whatever that company has
filed a cutting-edge patent that is to
implant magnets into your skin that will
then hear a ring of a phone and or when
a phone gets a call it will hear that
signal somehow and the magnets the
ferromagnetism underneath your skin will
actually vibrate in a sort of haptic
feedback is disgusting and then you a
visit like you know the concept of
ringtones your tattoo can have ringtones
it can it can vibrate in different
rhythms right like if it's a if you call
me it can I can set it to be like duh
for like Morse code but if my mom calls
it can be like man or an urn although
there's no sound effects hahaha ah this
room another worse about this rumor so
also it can be either a tattoo or just
like a little badge in the images that
they filed with the Patent Office they
just have it as like it looks like a
little bar code which scary or QR code
or a QR code or like not like number
tattoos those are upsetting they're very
upsetting anyways I'm upset by some part
of this tattoo is really great i don't
like that it vibrates under your skin i
think that is so sick imagina shaken
melodia shaken um and you can have put
it in different places and you can have
multiple different tattoos so that like
you could put the tattoo from your lover
under your knee theoni and you could
have like your mom's tattoo on your
elbow you know because you would never
want your mom to tap to like be ringing
where your lover would ring the whole
thing is disgusting and then oh okie
also added in their patent filing that
it doesn't necessarily if you're someone
who hates tattoos which I know there are
a lot of people out there who think
tattoos are uncool and that I cannot be
buried in my people cemetery um you can
then have it be invisible yeah I mean if
it's just a magnet then it's just
implanted oh look guys if sure gusting
it's just like it's a little square I
mean is if you're
have that you might as well have your
google wallet and plan it under your
skin yeah I mean if it's just magnets
why don't they just you know put a
Bluetooth in there and then you could
just answer the phone from there and
then just talk to your hand talk to you
know talk to you think if they put a
microphone in there and then like when
your phone rang you went hello yes mom
oh hi yeah so I don't know that it's
just like it's nokia's trying to come
back and not be like this old they
should just put I got a HUD glasses like
everybody else is trying to HUD contact
lenses that's what I want sec um okay
but thank you so much for sending us
that Carl and we will see in years to
come if anyone gets these disgusting
Pharaoh mandating nasty put under their
plans that ring when your phone right
have you ever seen body modifiers who
put those balls those of like meatballs
under their skin and they have like
things coming out of their face yeah
they look like a lizard or whatever yeah
and then had horns yes horns the harder
ones I see that one guy when I got my
ear pierced here that one which really
hurt um the guy who did it had all of
those implants underneath his hand and
you could move them we're flying
fighting the scariest body modifier plan
to donate go to their head those are
mini bagels
oh thank for people just listening we
just looked at a picture of two men
whose heads are bulging like like the
implanted of bagel like they're like
they just implanted bagels into their
forehead this guy's worse oh yeah that's
the cat lady once look like a cat that I
look guy I don't know I'm here too ah
now we're looking at the scariest thing
I've ever seen which is a cat person
it's like Thundercats but a person and
really about that person's like not only
did they give them self fake cheekbones
fake lips to like make themselves look
like who's the little orange cat
Garfield's looks like a scary human
Garfield but then with that they also
added like a row of 50 spikes on the
upper lip what is that about I don't
know those are the whiskers those are
the whiskers I'm Thunder Thunder Thunder
Thundercats and the teeth look like cat
teeth and so I'm so over it that's like
if it was between that and a vibrating
tattoo I'll take the vibrating two cars
one is geeky and the other one has no
purpose I wasn't her if I um all right
shall we get on to be king of nerds
speaking of nerdy things Microsoft might
be working on a gaming helmet and I
we're just like the Google I where the
hood glasses that we bet on in a
previous show whenever that was so
according to a new Microsoft patent that
details how a compact display system
will work on goggles helmets and other I
wear this has been reported by the
website patent bolt patent bolt so
according to the patent the company
Microsoft has been working since q3 2010
on a gaming helmet accessory for its
Xbox console and a pair of glasses that
could be used with mp3 players or phones
or other portable devices whatever the
patent calls for a virtual projector
system that involves lasers
and that are used to beam images in
front of each eye because our eyes are
unable to process images that are too
close I didn't know that these images
would be shrunk such that they appear to
be farther away so you can can't focus
that's true I can't focus when it gets
their rights okay I know you're
cross-eyed so it'll be small so it'll
look like it's happening farther away
the other thing that is cool about this
is that the images will be partially
transparent so that users can see
external objects in the real world so
you're not like running into things
it'll just like yes pacifically you're
like ah meno universe of my own yeah I
me your own about but how there I mean
you wouldn't play it on the bus you play
with your connect I mean it's like yeah
it with your console I mean the glasses
maybe I don't know why you would be on
the bus wearing these things it's scary
people steal them people will steal
things on the bus but the Coyotes also
talked about the potential of creating a
stereoscopic stereoscopic stereoscopic
Thank You 3d effect by projecting
slightly different images concurrently
so it'll be like you're listen you guys
it's a helmet like the helmet I mean it
that it's a hell a whole helmet did you
see that picture of it like you look
dazed point out how crudely the pictures
driver I mean thanks Microsoft really
like totally like this guy I just drew
this and it is look at the one on the
helmet it looks like nothing it looks
like it I've drawn better draw something
picture like that when I my finger
diaper on my iPhone and so I mean think
about wearing this thing like I don't
wear a gaming headset because I don't
play Halo or any of the games that were
not necessitate that you know needing
one of the one of the units i love it
you in hood if you would have needed to
my the xbox like bundle that I got came
with one it was a connected one it's not
a wireless one but so I never use it
whatever I just couldn't even imagine
wearing a helmet like you know somebody
coming home and seeing you sitting on
the couches it's like full gear like
even at the arcade or loved one is like
that's my special lover yeah Emily a
boo-boo
so I mean they have that video game at
their arcade where it's kind of like
virtual reality you put your you know
the helmet on and I can't even play that
its cost like four dollars but like I
can't even play that because I feel so
foolish wearing the stupid element
around like shootin at nothin that only
I can see in my mind yeah it'll take
like the loneliness of intense gaming to
a whole new low I mean you're just
literally in a box by yourself you put
this helmet on you can't see it's dark
it's just a helmet I mean I can't wear I
um it male gay we're also excited about
those google goggles you know that are
like 3d technology and like have they
haven't had a determinate ray yeah and
like I I was actually at a dinner party
and this guy was like oh my god are you
excited by those goggles they're good
have so many real-world implications
like so many people can wear them and
it'll fix their lives and I was like I
guess I mean I actually think maybe
that's true there are therapeutic maybe
applications for these type of things
beyond gaming you know I through life
like this that's totally what its gonna
be like well that's it you'd be
ostracized whoa I mean when I was
guest-hosting on Android Atlas and we
were talking about it real quick you
know for a minute and I remember um
we're saying you know you put them on
you wake up in the morning you look in
the mirror it like runs down your list
you know as you're brushing your key on
your to-do list then you know you get in
the car it um you see a hot dude walking
by and it brings up their Facebook and
then you go you drive by our starbucks
and it pulls up like if they're having a
special or you know what the coffee of
the day is like the it seems cool but
it's like that is just too much like I
don't know that works what you're seeing
is awesome you're seeing all this
information in it so cool but what other
people are seeing is a person wearing
these crazy great thank you yet
everybody is gonna is gonna be wearing
them you know but in Matilda everybody
in the next 300 or brain until then
there has to be that one guy yeah and I
mean we're lucky that we live in San
Francisco that like nobody would look
twice at us wait on you were that banana
suit I mean it was like the most normal
thing in the world so I think that
wearing these glasses I'm like that's
like at least of my problems is wearing
this helmet outside
yeah everyone was like oh my god is it
banana suit day Sarah's just go so crazy
like they probably chew off a banana
suit day and I should probably just
started it and have a following of
banana suitors banana suitors I just

really good for all and also look at how
much we love I know all we did in that
whole clip show it was four minutes of
laughing yeah I mean I love kale that
like all of your favorite Clips had zero
to do with rumors nothing like the
people on YouTube would be so mad i know
they playing wii chitterchat my god
they're always like I can't believe this
is a 45-minute show about things that I
could have researched in three minutes
well you know what I researched in three
minutes to and that's oh now we are
going to talk about it for like 45
minutes and you'd like a lot to say
we're not making up these rumors we're
reporting on them around the nematic
experts yet I guess now we don't ever
have to deal with the youtubers again oh
now I'm gonna miss those me I necessary
so all right let us let us continue we
have a couple more rumors yeah we
promised we would never talk about this
and we went back on our promise iphone
to get a bigger Retina display we're
gonna talk about the iphone 5 because we
never really got to talk about the
iphone 5
yes so I mean we could do whatever we
want now remember gettin worried we're
gonna cancel it anyway so it's melee
funny because one of the other people
who send in a clip thing where we at one
point Emily said I'm so glad we've been
going on this long that we haven't been
canceled by Cena tv turns out emily is a
wizard because I actually say that clear
because I remember on our first episode
saying like bear with us guys were
trying our best and hopefully they won't
cancel us and like I was kidding I
thought they'd let us go to day two
months later they're like you're gunshot
you're canceled so emily is a
clairvoyant wizard we've discovered that
on the show so anyway so the iphone
might get according to this rumor a
bigger retina display so Apple is
purportedly already placing orders with
suppliers for a four point six inch
iphone retina display according to
Reuters citing a report in South Korea's
mail business newspaper mail business
huh malevolent maybe your newspaper down
over there Maria ma è il mail the fun
that's what it m EI e is from south oh I
see the phone is due in this all right I
don't want to wear my hat a half day for
you to the phone is due in the second
quarter according to the report which is
that's a little bit interesting so
that's a relatively massive screen for a
smartphone the 4.6 inch glass screen
would be a big step up from apples
current 3.5 inch Retina display and a
larger phone may also allow Apple to
include updated chips such as the a 5 X
which is an ipad ipad the new night new
ipad 3 3rd generation all rights
reserved that chip smart key feature is
quad-core graphics so maybe so a bigger
phone would allow a bigger processor and
that would be great yeah and I think
like um there had been some hesitation
about whether or not Apple was capable
of making a bigger Retina display and
they proved that they can't exactly so
now they can go do everything in between
yeah you know so well be the new Samsung
oh my
how do you heard it here first yeah
exactly so Samsung rotina deeply galaxy
note in 25 inches or less akad iphone 5
so four point six inches is really
really big um the actually speaking of
the galaxy note the galaxy note is five
point four three inches so four point
six inches is basic I mean you know
because it's it's diagonal it's not the
size of the so that 4.3 inches
diagonally four point six inches
diagonal it's really big it is i mean
the the galaxy note is hard to hold it's
so big in hurting me i mean you had to
come up with a whole new horrible name
to describe it tablet a phablet if parts
own part my little carney hands actually
can't hold that tablet yeah i mean it's
I don't have anything here I wish we
brought one in here's my phone like my
phone is just in my hand that's about
what I can hold yeah and I was like like
this much bigger yeah it's really big
and kind of distracting that I think to
hold but the screen on it is gorgeous
the galaxy note is pretty awesome I kind
of like the stylus whatever whatever so
the good thing about this iphone being a
little bit bigger even though i don't
know i kike the size of the phone now
but if it did get bigger i would become
a super duper expert at Draw Something
because my you know it would give me a
little bit more real estate to play with
yeah play on the ipad is a great idea i
just i don't have 3g on my ipad so i
would only have to be able to play it in
places where there's Wi-Fi and then I
realized that that's fine because it's
not like I'm playing this thing on the
bus because you're like so so maybe I'll
start playing draw something on um I
have a gripe with draw something and it
was drying popular and everyone loves it
yeah there's no chat that comes yeah I
kinda hate that but I keep getting the
same words and have to draw the same
picture are you paying are you playing
free are you playing to play the free
verse see you have to buy the 99 cent
they give you my word I know if it's a
buck it's a buck but it's worth it um
you know a lot of people on Twitter have
been asking to play against me and I
will but here's the thing i have 75
games going on right now i have like
seven words with friends games
had to delete scramble because it was
too much for me I have 14 not kidding 14
draw something because I hooked it up
with facebook for some stupid reason and
the only way to do anything you can you
can search by email an email and Twitter
and so I'm I just I can't I can't play
right now until some people drop out or
if I maybe I'll uninstall it and like
not and then I'll just find my little
nickname twitter friends yeah maybe I'll
do it the fake name because I just I
have OCD when it comes to stuff like
that and if there are any notifications
on my phone it freaks me out so I have
to clear it to have to play like 12
games of draw something at the same i
know i mean Kareem Kareem we have to do
work and she's like I'm doing work i'm
wearing my draw something famous it took
me an hour so i just i can't right now i
know front line and i know i think solsa
spare to wanted to play and I saw your
requests and I ignored them I just can't
my OCD heart can't handle it but I will
get to you soon well it's not because I
don't love you guys it's because I have
I'm I can't I mean ever need a bandage
and let emails you know hope people will
mark an email as read in their inbox and
then that makes them feel better Kareem
delete I have everything get them my
inbox has nothing nothing in it like my
trash is my is my like folder she came
over to my computer one day and saw that
I have sixty seven thousand emails and
of those like 20,000 or unread and she
had a panic if I had to take advance and
a shot of tequila because that was it
gave me chills hey like it's all just
pamphlets from williams-sonoma offering
me a deal i hate understand so I just
have to delete everything so anyway so
frontline solstice bear don't worry
we'll play a game soon okay how does my
discussion about the rumor of the new
iphone yes okay so our last rumor is not
apple related guys holy wow did you
would you have ever guessed it it is
concerning a little company you may have
forgotten about called sony Oh sony
chromebook may not be a unicorn
laptop review reports so um way back in
the Wayback Machine if we go back into
the past in March of a little year
called 2011 so a year ago there began to
be rumors that Sony was going to come
out with a tiny little laptop that was
running Chrome OS and remember there was
like a blip of a moment in time when
Chromebooks were exciting and people are
like you're gonna open it it'll be like
on on lately I manually like connected
to the internet and everything yeah so
it was weird i got different than her
computer I mean it was kind of different
but not that different and not different
enough for anyone to buy it and I
actually even knew someone who worked at
Google who had one and gave it to her
boyfriend as like a present and he was
like seems so awesome and yet nope it's
like a coaster I use it as a coach yeah
well I think um uh what's the same Seth
Rosenblatt uses a Chromebook oh he would
and then and they also give them out on
um virgin america flight oh it's a rent
you can rent yeah you can rent a
chromebook you can rent a Chromebook and
then they'll bring you a little ginger
ale yeah and the middle soluble round I
think the thing about is that they're
just like apps it's like a basically a
tablet with that's a computer and it's
all in the cloud you don't really store
anything on it and you know it's it's
just a different way of consuming the
internet at all times right um but so
Sony was working on one and people were
like cool Sony's working on one cuz I
think the others are from Lenovo there's
a lenovo Chromebook and i can't remember
her together maybe there's an a sous a
susan lenovo com book and but sony makes
high-end laptop so that was kind of
exciting it was like a mishmash of
high-end gear with like not that
Chromebooks are low end but they're
lower cost because there's a lot of
trade-offs around it um so they were
excited with a sony one and then nothing
ever having never showed up and then
suddenly now a year later the FCC
declassified the existence of this
patent for yes a sony chromebook running
chrome OS and there are pictures and
ostensibly it's going to come out
which is ridiculous like it's okay okay
it's a lie your look at it I know I was
like it kind of looks huge and well I
think it actually is really small that's
just the perspective is we're heck it is
what it is definitely ugly it's not it's
11.6 inches it supposedly will have a
1.2 gigahertz nvidia tegra two chip
which like will beyond those chips now
16 gigabytes of flash storage m 1 gig of
ddr2 ram dual core arm cortex a9
processor I mean it's fine yeah but what
a riot a year and literally like laptops
have the the whole laptop market has
advanced so much since then like this
was invented before they even had heard
about ultrabooks then ultrabooks became
the big thing and now ultrabooks are
maybe dead says dan ackerman he said
they are dead he said he tweeted that
the death of them was like this month I
think so well because they were like
this is what an ultrabook is we're gonna
define it in these terms it's XY and Z
and then they were like okay but this
one also has T and it also has s rare m
and it doesn't have X so what was that
is this one category yeah look it's just
a laptop they want to put as much as
they can in there um but what will be
interesting about this is to see if Sony
bothers to actually release this since
it's so old I mean there have been
plenty of examples in consumer
electronic history of a company working
on something for so long and for some
reason things going wrong in the
manufacturing things going wrong in the
planning and not coming out in time and
then when they min it's really important
that things get released when people
will appreciate them like Microsoft have
been working on a tablet for a really
long time before the ipad came out and
they miss their window and then they
didn't like by the time any of it came
out no one cared um and sometimes
businesses will then choose not to
release it because why bother so maybe
this won't actually come out it's just
been filed with FCC and we won't
actually see it um but we'll see and
with that we should do yeas or nades
yeah and then vote and then we have a
couple voice we have oh yes you do okay
yay or nay
you read I'll be described all right
will we get password free Wi-Fi yay I
don't know what that means oh so you
just won't need a password when you log
into your Wi-Fi well can't you always
notice a have Wi-Fi with no password no
you can just that password can be admin
or whatever but you need a password
stuff but you can have an unsecured
network but you still need a password
that's just not secure but sometimes
they're not okay all right there I mean
a pan but sometimes you like will see
someone in your building and their their
network is unsecured and you just hit it
it doesn't ask our password it just
joints but you can't really use it yeah
yeah you can okay this is something
different okay all right so I'm gonna
say nay cuz I don't know what it is and
I'm just gonna say make it a game has
before yeas are names guys just in case
you were wondering if we don't what we
do is we do not read the stories and we
go with our guts right off the headlines
its to automatically log into hot spots
you it's like edit like a when you go to
Starbucks oh okay yeah it's not like for
your home thing password free Wi-Fi okay
sure yeah that'll happen and it's
terrible idea okay um mm-hmm is the HTC
One avi slated for virgin mobile yay nay
okay 4g roaming coming to the US yay yay
I concur that one is also from Carl yes
oh and will soon release a 10 inch
kindle fire yay yay yeah I don't know
about this password free Wi-Fi thing let
me give it to the chat room and let them
look at it yeah you guys sell it tell us
what that it tell us about that um ok
now we're voting with is a real voting
all right wha um well tattoos that
vibrate when your phone rings make it
into our lives yeah and I hate it so
grown nenene okay is Microsoft working
on gaming helmets and I wear nay oh I
say yay oh yeah no will the iphone get a
bigger Retina display yay yay too ok and
will sony release a tiny old new
Chromebook I think they will oh wow I
think they won't I think that would be
dumb okay why am I still writing yay and
nay I don't know you're new alright so

this rumor has it fan has some questions
about seeing it live and let's see if

me um I am a new suppose two minutes
long just to press another watching this
podcast actually
the podcasting is the first I'm actually
start podcasting this year he's fun and
I love you guys show you guys just
showed one of the reasons why i first
started podcasting in the first place as
it were an inspiration well anyway I

a.m. pacific time 12 p.m. eastern time
they will continue on their show is
going to be changing format as well i
don't know if it's going to be
necessarily like the podcast that it is
now i think it's gonna be more I don't
know I think that Jeff has some ideas we
ought to make it since it's gonna be the
flagship live show I think it's gonna
have more news focus and it'll like the
backbone and they were tooling that a
little bit and then also we are going to
continue doing special event coverage
like you know like we just did that ipad
event and we're looking into may be
doing this HTC thing so we will always
be doing live content from here we're
also doing an event thursday night so

venture capitalist so yeah I mean cnet
TV is going to continue on mostly on
demand video so we're gonna we're
actually are working on a show we've
been throwing out ideas brainstorming
some stuff and you know we're gonna do
some video on demand stuff and see how
see what sticks and you know see what
works out and yeah when you guys see us
in shows and you like it let them know
because we might try a couple different
ones then we won't get canceled but we
might do like a one-off here and a
one-off there and if you guys see them
you know whichever one's hit strike your
fancy tell us we're looking for feedback
yeah even if you have ideas for a new
