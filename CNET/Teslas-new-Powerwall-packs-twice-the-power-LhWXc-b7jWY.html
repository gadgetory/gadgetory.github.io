Sun does not shine at night and the the
point that we're at right now is in fact
off their transition we're transitioning
from day two tonight it's dusk and so
what's happening is that the the houses
are transitioning from the roof
generating power to the battery pack
this that the power wool producing power
so during the day you fill up the the
battery and then at night and in dusk
and dawn you use the battery it's pretty
straightforward really it's like not
that complicated
you need you just need you need both and
but but if you have a great solar roof
and you have a battery pack in your
house and your electric car that's
something that scales worldwide that you
can you can solve the whole energy
equation with that so yeah obviously
next slide please so the pet so we'd
like to introduce the power wall to the
this is a big step above the power wall
one it has twice as much energy more
than twice as much power so it's a 14
for 14 kilowatt hour energy storage
seven kilowatts power output and just to
put that into in basic terms you can
take a four-bedroom house and you can
have you can get empower the your fridge
the sockets and lights for a day and if
you have solar on your on your hat on
your house you can power it indefinitely
so that's a foot one
and and then we're on the utility side
we've got the power pack to which
similarly doubles the the energy so it's
a turn ten kilowatt hour capability 50
kilowatt power output and this this can
scale to unlimited size so it's a in
fact we've recently announced the the
biggest utility battery installation in
the world which is going to be with the
Southern California Edison let's go to
the next slide so we have an 80 megawatt
hour battery installation that's being
built right now so and then we're nice
one earlier this year which is for
utility and Hawaii doing 52 megawatt
hours you can see a lot more of these
announced over time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
