Mercedes interface and if you know
Mercedes cars and have watched my videos
on them that isn't a Mercedes interface
it's got a lot of kind of a hip style to
it it's got these 3d effects the color
schemes completely different this isn't
fully baked yet for production but they
say it's a real strong indication where
they're going so this is your for lack
of a better term you're a young system
for your younger buyer who doesn't
normally get into a Mercedes for any
number of reasons this is one way to
entice them now what it's doing is using
the video feed through apple's ipod out
technology coming out of this iphone as
well as a metadata stream to actually
pull the raw data for what I'm about to
show you and pulling that up on the
screen it's not a literal translation of
the ipod or iphone screen you could do
that but that isn't good for a car this
they say is really good easily
digestible automotive representation so
i can go to google let's say and again
this is driving from the guts of your
phone this is not envision for a car
that has built in 3g you wouldn't need
that it would more be an in-car centric
system and i've got the ability to
search nearby look at my recent searches
and look at bookmarks again this is kind
of automotive strips down to be
contextual to driving Mercedes is really
big on safety so we don't want to make
this a distracting mess so you're saying
why is facebook in there what am i doing
staring at facebook in the car well
depending whether the car is moving or
not they will lock or unlock things like
checking a newsfeed of your various
friends here bunch the folks from the
development team in Palo Alto in Silicon
Valley I can go look at my friends here
by friend all the usual functions you've
got but again they've been stripped down
and they're contextualized to keep
driving in the car safe and by the way
all these functions are web derived
obviously they couldn't be done any
other ways is a fully connected vehicle
Oh check it out when I go to these reads
of my wall they're literally reads this
is going to be text to speech that I'm
going to hear these recent postings this
is all expected to be coming out next
year sometime in 2012 on a model to be
determined but it's not going to be on
an s-class that would miss the point
this is going to be on a lower class
more affordable Mercedes and again a
whole different look and feel that I'll
be interested
I out when it's actually in the wild and
at the show</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
