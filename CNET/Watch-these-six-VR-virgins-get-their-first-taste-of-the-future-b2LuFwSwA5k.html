actually drawing everywhere right now oh
that is so cool
Oh fun I touch it yeah this is my whole
easel the colors are amazing this is
really trippy
I feel like Harold and the Purple Crayon
remember that book I could see all the
doodles that I made to walk through it
Reese's threesies yeah my daughter would
love this what do you think this -
controller thing is kind of weird I'm
not even a an artistic person but I
could see myself playing with this a lot
this is cool I think the last time I
went mini-golfing was on a date in high
school not a good golfer guys hit the
ball guess I didn't hit it hard enough
I kind of feel like I'm in Super Mario
World
it's like about to walk into a wall yep
here we go
I'm standing on the wall I got it in oh
look at that champion he ain't come from
like oh hey just look this way I like
this game okay
Oh oh it looks like I'm on a spaceship
or a dock of the spaceship there's a
fire over there we should probably get
somebody on that Oaks - are they
shooting
whoa that was close you have to be so
aware of all your surroundings like on a
TV if you're doing this playing the
video game you're just looking ahead of
you this is the best one it's kind of
like laser tag I'm like okay this is
very stressful that's cool that's fun it
was really fun like that so much more
fun than I thought it would be I felt
like you were actually in it I'm not
kind of like one of those old arcade
games but much cooler the gun one that
one was really fun bullets coming at you
and dodging and just that was a lot more
fun actually seems like a good workout
the coloring one really blew my mind I
mean the colors were so bright so
vibrant back that you could paint
something to walk through it just blew
my mind
I think it's awesome I mean you read
about virtual reality but I don't think
you actually know what it is until you
experience something like that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
