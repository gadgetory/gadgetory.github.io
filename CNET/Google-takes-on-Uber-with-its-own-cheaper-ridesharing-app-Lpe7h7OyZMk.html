new ride-sharing service Google yep
Google officially launched its own ride
hailing F it's called Waze writer it's a
spin-off of the ways driving app the
twist with Google's version is that it's
more like a carpool you would book rides
to and from work from people who make a
similar commute as you do but as The
Wall Street Journal reports this was a
quiet launch it's only available right
now to the San Francisco area and unlike
the taxi style service of uber and lyft
Waze writer users are limited to two
rides a day just to work and back early
users report it to be much cheaper as
well Google has been testing this since
May and rolling it out to the entire San
Francisco area for several weeks now
Google and uber have a complicated
relationship lately when uber originally
launched Google invested 250 million
dollars into Oberer and uber services
are also tied into Google Apps for
example you can book a ride from inside
Google Maps but then uber started hiring
Google employees and uber started
testing self-driving cars just like
Google and now both companies are
offering ride-sharing services it won't
be long before these frenemies are
full-out rivals that's it for this tech
