lists did your favorite videos make the
cut the company name the top ten videos
in both trending and music video
categories YouTube's top trending video
of 2017 is until we will become dust
from a tie singing competition called
the mask singer on this show celebrities
wear super fancy masks to hide their
identities while they compete the mask
singer is really popular on YouTube but
this one in particular snatched the
number 1 slot with over a hundred and
eighty-one million views in just over
seven months
number two was a choreography video from
Kyle Han egami a Los Angeles based
dancer with a huge following on YouTube
his choreography video set to shape of
you by Ed Sheeran
is the most viewed choreography video
ever on YouTube with over 118 million
views the trickshot masters at dude
perfect made the number 3 spot with ping
pong trick shots 3 the montage of crazy
tosses has over 93 million views making
it the Channel's second most watched
video ever behind you guessed it ping
pong trick shots - also making the
trending list this year tween
ventriloquist Darcy Lin's appearance on
America's Got Talent at number 4 bad
lip-reading steak on Donald Trump's
inauguration at number 6 and that
hilarious video of Professor Robert
Kelly getting interrupted by his
adorable children in the middle of a BBC
interview at number 10 as for music
videos there was no question who the
champ was this year despacio is
officially the most viewed video in
youtube history not only did it smash
the previous record in just 204 days
it's also the first video to break 3
billion views and the only video with
over 4 billion views but I guess that's
what happens when you make a universally
catchy tune that reaches the top of the
charts in dozens of countries around the
world in 2nd ed sheeran shape of you
grabbed over 2.5 billion views that's
enough to be the sixth most viewed video
on YouTube ever and the songs popularity
probably gave a bump to that
choreography video in the top trending
list J Balvin and Willie Williams Meehan
fake crossed a billion views in 103 days
another massive banger for J Balvin who
has two videos with over a billion views
now he's one of the top 10 most viewed
artists on YouTube this year other music
videos that made the cut that's what I
like by Bruno Mars at number 5 swallow
by Jason Derulo and
eight and enrique iglesias at number 10
with Suba Madhavi oh did your favorite
videos make either list or do you think
something else should have made the cut
