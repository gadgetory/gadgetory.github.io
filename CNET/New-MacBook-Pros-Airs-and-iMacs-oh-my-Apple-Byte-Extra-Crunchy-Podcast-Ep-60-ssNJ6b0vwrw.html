byte from the Giant Bomb podcast studio
in San Francisco California it's the
Apple vide extra country podcast with
your host mr. brian Tong what's up beach
what's up welcome to the show everybody
it is episode 60 of the apple byte extra
crunchy it is our audio podcast that
complements our weekly video show it's
everything Apple good bad it's your
commentary your questions our answers
sometimes your answers to again this
show is all about you also you can
always call us at one eight hundred 61
62 63 eight that is the phone line leave
us your name where you're from your
comments or questions and we will get
into it in the show but again you guys
and gals I'll make this possible so we
appreciate it and let's just jump right
into it right off the bat Apple's
October 27th event it is official right
you guys know that Apple sent out the
official invite just a couple days ago
in fact it might have been even just
yesterday morning if I have all res
everyone was like when are we gonna get
this invite I knew it was just to happen
real soon I knew it was coming October
27th is a very special day okay so for a
variety of reasons but one of the
reasons is a apple's keynote everything
we expect this is pretty much the last
keynote from Apple that we're going to
hear about the new macbooks the new max
they gave us as kind of like semi apple
logo with a bunch of different like
splashes of color and I don't know to me
they're not gonna put out like a pink or
orange or yellow macbook but who knows
now just for some reference and I
tweeted this out for people that follow
me Apple has used this phrase hello in a
few occasions in 1984 when Steve Jobs
introduced the very first mackin
on the screen it said hello now in 1998
when Steve Jobs made his first return
back to Apple during their keynote it
was at the flint center at DeAnza
College the new Bondi blue imac right
this was like the rebirth of the imac it
was SJ coming back on the screen it said
hello and then in parentheses again so
the fact that they're using hello again
a third time around I actually think
that's not very creative yeah it should
have been the right kind of thing it is
throwback but why don't they just do
like hello it's me you're looking for
what they do hola something just
something different okay anyways we know
what's coming up October 27 so it's kind
of wanted to run down there's a lot of
rumors about what might be happening the
the product we know the most about based
on reports and speculation and rumors is
going to be the new macbook pros bruises
this is a product category we've talked
about before that has not been updated
in over four years and I'm talking about
an actual redesign change I'm not
talking about a speed bump the retina
display is awesome but an actual
fundamental design change so with these
new macbook pros we are expecting to see
a new 13-inch MacBook Pro a new 15-inch
MacBook Pro they are expected to be
thinner in size they expect to bring a
new touch ID sensor somewhere on their
USBC right that's the kind of almost
looks like your microsd it's a little
thicker it's reversible there will no
longer be these rectangular USB ports on
this machine as well as Thunderbolt 3
this is again for the macbook pro 13 and
15 we don't expect to see any larger
screen sizes so I'm sorry for all the
people that we're hoping to get like a
17-inch one that's just not going to
happen but the big feature here is going
to be the oled touch bar that has been
rumored and talked about we have seen it
in other pcs specifically the razor line
of laptops for gaming we've seen that
but Apple is going to pretty much
replace that function though that top
row of your keys on your keyboard which
is the function keys and it's going to
replace it with an oled touch bar where
these this oled screen
can be used like buttons but it will
morph it'll be able to do different
things like depending on the app you're
using it will be able to have different
contextual options or buttons based on
whether you're doing a media player
whether you're in Safari maybe if you're
doing like you know third-party
applications will have to support it but
wow what about quick quick key shortcuts
for things like video editing in adobe
photoshop they have to have software
that supports this as well I don't want
it to just be on Notes Calendar iTunes I
want to be something more than that so
that's that OLED touch bar that is
really going to be the feature that
potentially makes this laptop special or
not so we'll see what happens with that
also reports coming out of a mac
kodikara claim that the oled touch sorry
that the macbook air it will still live
but this is a 13-inch right now we have
the 13-inch macbook air and the 11-inch
MacBook Airs according to reports the 11
inch will be completely eliminated and
then the 13-inch macbook air will live
on in addition of and that will get a
new USB seaports on it the apple imac
has had rumblings really not much in
anything beyond the macbook pros and
laptops the imac has been told they
we've been told that it might get a new
AMD video card and the other big kind of
piece that was just a quick short
rumbling was that apple and LG are
working together to bring back an apple
display they haven't released an apple
display and man I feel like at least
three or four years as well I could be
wrong like a new one but this will be a
5k display that works with your your Mac
computer so that's kind of the big
bullet points again just to go down the
line the last time we saw really a
revamped macbook pros been four years
the mac pro that's the apples kind of
trash can looking desktop machine that
has had some issues with our staff quite
honestly when it comes to like doing
some video editing yeah like crashing
hangs like you know it's it's it's a
three year old machine it is all it's
all we knew but it's there I don't even
been any there hasn't been any major
significant upgrades to it it's right on
they locked into that very specific cool
sexy design but it's so unique and so
different
know if that's actually helped them out
as well as the mac mini that's been
about two years since we've seen any
upgrades so there's a lot that we need
to know about the max and as of now it
only looks like we know much about
macbook pros i think at the if you look
at this you know comprehensively though
i am excited because we don't really
know much going to this keynote yeah
that is probably the best thing that
could come out of it yeah people aren't
as rabid as they are for the macbooks as
they are for the iphones even from the
rumor mill side right yeah exactly i got
we don't see we don't see our homeboys
like my family in China go into the
factories and try to get the new macbook
pro like shell design yeah there's no
one left one sitting at a bar in San
Francisco or anything like that that has
not happened yet so we'll see again
that's going to be october the 27th that
is next week thursday it'll be at ten
a.m. pacific time so lock in apple will
be streaming the keynote we will be
there as well and the one last thing
that I want to know is will Apple have
the courage hmm to keep to keep the
headphone jack in them you got a how-to
you've got to keep a headphone jack in
the lighthouse yes but here's the thing
right there's plenty of real estate in
there here's the thing if it's a us if
there's USB seaports and thunderbolt
ports that would mean you would need a
dongle adapter to go into your macbook
to support apple's lightning headphone
cables really yeah that's a bummer
that's like why thanks thanks that's why
it's like are they going to even put a
lightning port on there just for your
headphones because they put it on our
there's times at work you do switch over
or even anyone on the road switches over
from their phone to their laptop your
laptop doesn't have a lightning port man
it's a problem we'll see we will see so
that's what's going on overall with the
macbooks and while we're talking here
I'm just going to take a little break
because we have another word from our

Salesforce okay let's jump into this uh
we know that the jet black iphone is now
pretty much in stock and both the
standard iphone 7 and 7 plus models
across the u.s. in most major stores
there's this really cool tool called I
stock now if you guys want to see that
that'll give you like a nice display map
of what's going on there but look as
time goes on sometimes you see like
flaws and things that happen with with
products and this one's this one shocked
me okay check this out a lot of us
protect our iphones with cases but some
of us use those skins because they want
a low-profile protection there that the
type of people that don't think they're
going to drop it which is fine right
well according to reports this is not
widespread but this has happened in
people that are using these skins a
small number of iPhone u owners have
found that when they try to remove the
actual skin the the logo transfer that
says like iphone the serial number the
FCC stuff some of that print actually
then transfers off of your phone and
onto the skin when you take it off Wow
like it actually just taking yoga it's
taking a faint off your phone staying in
the paint off people that that happened
with my iPhone 5 you know just having it
in a case it scraped off all that and oh
it did yeah i mean just having it inside
the case just for years
like all that stuff got scratched or was
it just eventually like k and it was
just gone you know like what can you do
yeah so this is an issue it's not
affecting everyone but there's plenty of
images and videos that show that uh this
is actually kinda happening to the
iphone 7 right now so um it's not the
biggest problem but it would suck it
would suck Brandt dude the phones are
wet like two weeks old and you're you're
you could I mean in a weird way coming
up in a weird way it kind of
stylistically looks really cool like if
you just have just straight up just
solid color iphone with none of that
stuff on the back to me that's actually
kind of cooler so you know what I might
take that back I'll notice I didn't
throw any bad apples out because I don't
think this bad apple just it's just it's
just there and it's not completely
ripping off its like some of the paint
will transfer over but again it's just
something to note to let uncle know I
kind of like it when people do that two
cars like they take all the branding off
their car you can't be away as you know
it's not i think that's cool it's fine
you take up the hood ornaments and stuff
like that i don't know what it is oh you
know the medallions whatever they call
you take up like you don't want it
people to know if you have a rolls-royce
or lamb but just just rip off rip off
that stuff i got a view this rip up it
looks like a you know looks like ana
paula it's a Buick okay all right this
one coming out of a recent conference
here this is vanity fair's new
establishments establishment summit that
happened here in San Francisco recently
Apple iTunes chief Eddy Cue sat down
with HBO CEO Richard plepler for an
interview with Vanity Fair talking about
you know the television industry the
partnership going on between Apple and
HBO and how TV will improve in the
future disclaimer we know that Apple
according to all sources and reports
have been trying to nail down some sort
of a TV streaming service but have not
part of that problem has been pointed in
the direction of eddy cue and their
hubris and their cockiness and their
demands of what they want and that's why
people aren't working with Apple look
just recently we know we have sling TV
we know we have playstation view of
services recently it was reported that
our parent company CBS is joining on
with YouTube's TV streaming service
which is expect to be called unplugged
some time for next year as well as other
networks Apple is not doing it okay so
this is
a quote these are quotes from eddy cue
according to this report during his time
at Vanity Fair now Eddy Cue says
television needs to be reinvented
because it's confusing hard to navigate
interfaces you live with a glorified VCR
he said you're still setting things that
to record there are nine hundred
channels but there's nothing to watch he
went on to say that there's incredible
stuff to watch but the interface makes
it impossible to find content again he
reiterates the problem is the interface
the ways you interface with it are
pretty brain-dead I sort of agree with
them i mean there's i do much content
and i watch maybe like two or three
things and a lot of that has to do with
just I guess finding stuff you know
having it in front of my face where I
just know I'm aware of it you know I
mean and I think that look the way that
networks don't want to do this because
it would shift away from the focus on
the network but what would be easier to
me and I thought about this is look why
not if there was a platform that allowed
you just to search by shows and forget
the network right when we look at our TV
cable boxes it's all broken down by TV
channels you got to scroll down guess
well we kind of know the shows that we
want to watch yeah it needs to be more
tile-based like a netflix like an Amazon
where you know the shows you want to
look for you can search for them and
when I say search look Apple is eluding
the fact that a lot of these things
don't have voice search but I can
guarantee you that comcast xfinity x1
platform that i have used has voice
search and it works pretty well for
networks and for shows and so Apple can
say that Apple has shifted their real
their interface more to like okay see
relaunch things use your voice on the
Apple TV but again if and they don't
want to do this if we move away from the
networks and the shows on the network
and really just focus on the shows that
in itself makes it so much easier to
find content yeah and that's kind of
what Amazon echo and all that stuff is
doing with amazon video content too so
you could tell it like play I think you
could tell it to play a certain TV show
and it'll play it on your amazon prime
if I think it's if you have to have a
fire you had they all have to be
basically interconnected Google's kind
of doing a similar thing
they only showed it off with their a
Google home to chromecast totally so you
know again it's it's about voice
integration and also look not everyone
is going to use their voice but that
makes it an easier more seamless way to
do it instead of dinking dinking around
on a navigational control and also just
for accessibility purposes you've you
know you not everyone can honestly use a
remote yeah and typing on those like the
netflix search engine or the amazon
prime search engine you have to like go
and pick each letter it's a big pin yeah
yeah I'm not saying to get rid of these
interfaces you have to have them exist
but the core interface should be voice
and it is moving that way so we know
that I think though for Eddy Cue though
to come out and be like oh these
interfaces aren't good enough like bra
you don't even got a TV service like I
couldn't even do that bro like really
right so don't come all high and mighty
when you are actually trailing in the
game that's that's what drives me crazy
like look we love a lot of stuff that
Apple does we also don't like things
that Apple does but when you are
trailing in the game when you're not
even in second place you're like third
or fourth yeah don't be cocky about it
it's the stupidest that you look stupid
it was also like just recently like they
released the apple TV without 4k
compound that you know stuff like that
like just no 4k compatibility but then
no ability to stream 4k 4k oh yeah yeah
it's so just small things like that just
show that they're behind you know so
we'll so we'll see how you know
innovative apples interfaces let's be
honest they are shifting more to the app
model again where you can call things by
voice but if you're telling me that
that's a game-changing interface like I
guess what people can already doing
remember Wendy doing that peoples are
people already doing that so please
don't don't make it sound like you're
like so I have a great idea everyone you
have a great idea if you could just say
what show you want it's it's getting bad
it's getting really bad uh for those of
you that wanted to really dream about
hey you know what I'm not gonna get a
Tesla I'm not gonna get a a smart bar
well I'm gonna wait I'm gonna wait until
2024 apples car because it'll be better
than anything else out there okay I know
there's people out there like that that
or that that do this I've talked about
on the show in the past how I put down
the one thousand dollar deposit for the
Tesla Model 3 you did yeah because it's
refundable and also I wanted to get in
the queue because by the time I make a
purchasing decision it's gonna be like
three years from that time right yeah
yeah totally like the queue is long it's
not like it's going to be easy to get
this stuff and I'll be in the market for
a new car by then anyway so I'm like
okay let's just do it okay for all you
20 20 years waiting for an apple car I'm
gonna tell you things are looking pretty
bleak right now according to Bloomberg
Apple has scaled back its plan for the
Apple car now that this is not just like
oh we're gonna like bring things back
this is significant okay we've known
historically through this project Apple
has changed leads for the program which
is codenamed project Titan for their
Apple car reports came out that they're
flirting about a car and sometimes I
think reports got a little ahead of
themselves as well to say Apple is
making an actual car they might have
have plans for that but they have now
drastically scaled back their ambitions
basically this the plans are not to even
build its own car that's no longer on
the table there according to people
familiar with the project this is based
on the Bloomberg report what Apple is
looking to do now is refocusing their
development of a autonomous driving car
system so what that would do we talked
abouts little while ago it would allow
Apple if they build this autonomous car
driving system maybe they could partner
up with a car manufacturer or return in
the future to designing their own car
but they're only focusing on the
self-driving system okay there's a few
companies that are doing this like right
now already trying to say Apple just
walk away like dude stop you're way
behind man just stop like we said from
the start it's not easy to build a car
it's you know you might have all this
money in capital on this idea that you
can change the world but building a car
is not like building a smartphone and
it's not like building a computer even
the margins right you're pretty much
time out like around even margins like
three percent margins Apple gets like
thirty percent twenty to thirty percent
margins on their products that they sell
cars
it's not that way it's just not that way
so what the Apple project Titan team has
been told is that they can go work on a
plan and propose what they're doing in
2017 so that's next year and the company
Apple will decide the fate of the
self-driving platform then this sounds
like it's coming unraveled oh it's
totally time not only that like wait
Hoover's got cars driving already we're
doing self-driving jazz personnel try
start driving cars right now and like
Pittsburgh in Canada and everywhere and
who else another company just announced
it to like Google's doing it every
everyone's doing it here's another
indication of letsa read the tea leaves
according to the report hundreds of
members of the car team which compromise
the car team itself compromises about
1,000 people hundreds of them not like
10 or 20 hundreds have been either
reassigned let go or left of their own
volition in the recent months the public
the moves aren't being made public but
the Apple car is more like a pipe dream
right now like it's it's a bummer and
again like uber Google look there's just
a report that Tesla is just Tesla has
the hardware in their cars today that
they can then basically eventually as
they test it out and roll out flip a
switch and they would I think they said
in about five years they'll be able to
have autonomous cars based on what's
already on their fleet totally and uh
Elon Musk said like you can be on the
other side of the country and hail your
car and it'll find you eventually no I'm
like are you kidding me no really yeah I
mean that's pretty awesome I know what I
want that I need I want I'm look you're
behind bro I can't say it any other way
watch next next thing we know apples
gonna be like we're launching apple
space program we're going to start
launching rockets in this space you it's
just it's really hard it and we said we
also said that from the start like that
this would be really hard yeah and then
I also said last year that we're gonna
see an apple car this year but oh yeah
questions well you shouldn't you should
have talked to no sir thomas
hahaha next question all right we have a
bunch of phone calls you guys and gals
are contributing to this show we want to
let your voice be heard so uh let's just
kind of check out what we've got cookin
and we'll get to them alright we go hey
guys love show quick question what do
you guys think about iOS integration and
the Amazon dots are the Alexa platform
is it worth buying now shouldn't we wait
to see what Apple has in store for AI
Siri integration should we hope to see
some more skills developed that are led
by iOS fanboys and developers what are
your thoughts this chris from Macon
Georgia love the show okay so here's the
thing with all these different AI
platforms we know amazon has their own
google is working on their own I amazon
is one of the few companies that likes
to make sure their stuff is everywhere
we saw that on the Kindle platform they
made their Kindle reader the digital app
available so I wouldn't be surprised if
we saw some level of iOS integration but
what they've done right now because I
have an ax I don't want to say the word
because I think it sets off people's
thing I everyone talks about it how
about a la unless they call it a lot I'm
gonna be very considerate okay but
because of they do have the ELA app for
iOS and you can manage some of the
content also the devices you can add
things to do list shopping stuff like
that so that's kind of the level of iOS
integration we have but Apple is doing
their own platform for smart devices
right they have their home kit stuff
they have a new interface in iOS 10
amazon is doing their own thing and
Google's doing own thing they might make
an app that's complementary available
but beyond that I don't expect us to see
much integration they want to there
trying to win that space an AI is the
next battleground right now big time
okay next call this is blair and west
holly weird about to comment about guy
eyes and his recent design mistakes
based on a book i'm reading called a
beautiful constraint it gives examples
of people having limited options money
resources and rules and how it drove
them to be more creative you for example
look at Star Wars the original were
great because George Lucas was limited
by budget and technology and the people
around and would tell him no a lot
George's ex-wife even edited the first
film which then caused it to even be
better arm but then the prequels came
out George wrote to everything and he
directed and it just came out really bad
so Steve Jobs used to limit and focus
Johnny odds so fantastic iconic stuff
was made but how that but now that Steve
is gone Don Ives doesn't have any people
around him to put constraints on him
hence the battery case in headphone
design so in my opinion jony ive's is
well on its way to introducing the I Jar
Jar Binks of apple products if someone
doesn't step in and stop himself I think
that was a great call it it hits the
point of like we said earlier no where
was the genius behind it but like like
this caller mentions like the
restrictions kind of force you to be a
little more creative and when you have
carte blanche maybe it's not as easy i
still think though no matter what if
you're one of the great designers you
know arguably one of the top ID guys in
the past 10-15 years you still should
have never made that Apple battery chase
like I just don't get that nice they're
just trying to solve a problem I still
don't get that I did it really baffles
me like other companies that made
battery packs look completely sleek and
it's like what is that do do like what
is that do too so I think that's a great
point historically how sometimes design
has been inspired by limitation so
that's a great call cool yeah for the
record I like I'm a fan of the prequel
Star Wars movies so I'm sorry oh I like
them I don't care what anyone says we
like how
big of a fan like okay I mean either fun
okay okay okay that no and you know what
I'm actually not a hater on that because
okay how about this real quick later
become evil that's cool that was cool
okay how about this I'm putting you on
the spot we had a lunchtime conversation
between like seven of the guys from our
group that's why I was late to the
beginning of the show yes we ranked our
order of the star wars movies prequel
you know the actual original core
trilogy and force awakens that's I'm
going to tell you my order right now I
know you have to kind of think about it
but I'll tell you my order right now
okay and people can disagree I actually
would like people to call in it's a
totally random tangent or tell us on
periscope and YouTube here's my order
five four six seven three one two ok
let's that's four so yeah empires new
hope return the Jedi numbers force
awakens you know and then three two one
of the prequels I think people are gonna
people if you know like going crazy on
this like seriously okay I'm gonna look
I'm gonna trying to say Return of the
Jedi was your favorite favorite no I see
from that was the one I grew up with two
and I was about to but here's the thing
as we get older and partially when
you're a kid and pressure strikes back
is like the lamest one but when you get
older to go watch that again oh my god
is Empire with the Ewoks no return the
journeys with the Ewoks yeah the Hoth
battle scene that's right snow yes yes
yes and other stuff that I want to spoil
I don't want to spoil the movies for
anyone that's listening that that that
is that's the gym yeah I was gonna say
30 wait wait you mean oh you mean for
I'm sorry okay start with no so
returning the Jedi would be six correct
so six five four okay and then the
prequels in their order or whatever and
that will actually no I think um yeah
the latest one what was the third one
when Darth Vader becomes our Vader no no
what was worth waking force awakens that
one comes before okay the Darth and then
Darth Vader one after that we're a big
it was that's really and then one or two
women probably 10 sea lion too yes yeah
one agrees to was kind of bad but they
had jango fett dog like Jango Fett was
oh yeah I can go fast he's by the hill I
mean once I got to the Coliseum and they
started like getting crazy with those
animals I'm like what am i watching
right now but ok so just to recap you
went six five four seven three one two
yes I believe that was right I blue is
correct excellent nice job alright so
should we get to our next class for this
stuff ok do we hear this one already see
this is a paper I and this is matthew
and my question is I have a late 2009
macbook that's the white one that I've
always used for school and starting to
die it freezes up and restarts itself so
should I order a refurbished current
macbook pro which I could get right now
for 16 99 or should I wait for them to
introduce a new one with the oled touch
bar okay thank you 1699 for refurbished
my my advice is no matter what you do
wait for the announcement those
refurbished ones will even go down by a
couple hundred dollars typically you
better buy it right after the
announcement right after they drop so
monitor it because it's really limited
but wait for the new keynote then wait
for the price to drop and immediately
purchase what you're targeting well
let's be TZ's shopping tips okay next
call hey Brian hey Steven this is more
health inspectors what do you guys think
about the Bluetooth 5.0 standard it's
supposed to have quadruple arrange
double the speed a data broadcasting
capacity increased by eight hundred
percent what do you think that means for
bluetooth earphones the air pod Apple
watch iPhones just curious where you
guys have think about it or have you
thought about it thanks love a show you
want to give your initial thoughts all
that sounded really good to me I mean I
i use bluetooth in my house and I walk
outside then my phone stops working with
my speaker it's annoying my kiddo like
walk in front of me and it stops working
yeah so uh so yeah I'm all for it man
like the Bluetooth spec just like the
Wi-Fi
back over time continues to get better
and better they do new technological
improvements on it the biggest advantage
that I see with bluetooth is going to be
obviously the range in the distance is
huge but we're in the era of the smart
home smart devices and it's only getting
better right we call it the Internet of
Things the IOT so having more powerful
Bluetooth connectivity for all of those
devices further arranged being able to
truly you know connect directly to them
is going to help overall just from a
text standpoint you you can't get
there's nothing wrong about getting
stronger and faster better signal so
it's just going to help everything it's
awesome and when is that going to come
out well technically i believe it was
supposed you know these specs take time
to roll out and then it also takes time
for manufacturers to incorporate them
but i believe the spec is rolling out at
the end of this year or like someone the
first half of 2017 hmm so um just look
forward to that can't wait till 2017
blue 250 okay last call hey Brian this
is zachary from billings montana just
once let you guys know love what you
guys just show I've never owned an apple
laptop my question is to you should I
get the one that's coming out Laird it's
October or should I wait out a couple
years also shout out to montana montana
montana why is he shouting out Montana
remember a career I think we were we
were dogging it a little bit well your
time how you're flying over it flew over
and all I saw was just white just
whiteness down there just what we called
out for Apple biters in Montana and like
North Dakota to give a shout-out
hollering representing so we appreciate
that yes thank you I mean what he s
about the matchbooks right kind of had
the same answer yeah probably have the
same answers the first it it is i mean
just beep look the best time to buy a
macbook quite honestly is when they
announced a new macbook whether it can
find the earlier the new ones come out
right yeah I'm sure they've been
released yeah I mean his other question
his other pointers questions like should
I wait a couple years I think also
whenever there's a completely new
redesign especially a completely new
feature like this OLED touch bar look in
general it should be fine but we know
what happens when you buy first gen
stuff of anything specifically Apple
they typically really fine tune it in
the
next generation if you're worried about
that that's fine but I i I'd be I'm not
gonna personally I'm not in the market
for a laptop right now but I'd want one
if I could yeah they do look if I was
ready to buy one or mine was breaking
down rose old and dingy i would i would
definitely go for the new one so mine
has so many dents and scrapes all over
that's your fault I would love to get a
nice because I dropped mine it's all
