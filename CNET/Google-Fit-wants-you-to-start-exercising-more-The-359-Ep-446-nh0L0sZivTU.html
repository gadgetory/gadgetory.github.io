morning to the 359 podcast it's episode
446 on Tuesday August 21st on dbg and in
the house you've got a packed one you
got Ben you got Roger you got rich Nieva
and this time we're late because not
Ben's fault because Roger's fault sure I
did
I was on time the truth my bad
rich thanks for being here by the way
we've got rich for only a few more days
our Microsoft B reporter bridge Nieva my
best friend need to get that one in
there since Alfred's not around to try
to steal you away very flattering we
have great John to talk about two
stories one a new google fit
announcement I wasn't even aware what
Google fit was so we shall explain what
that is for me we'll talk about
Microsoft identifying a new wave of
Russian hacking this time against
conservative groups and lastly we want
to talk about the Oppo find X a phone
that our colleague Aloysius Lowe calls
more beautiful than the Galaxy S nine
which itself is a pretty handsome
Android phone as always if you have any
questions leave them in the comment
section I'm gonna pick up the best and
we'll get them in three minutes in 59
seconds shout out to everybody tuning in
from Texas today we'll see you guys back
in the chat in three minutes and 59
seconds from 3:00 to welcome to the 359
I'm Roger Chang I'm Ben Fox ribbon and
with us is special guest rich Nieva rich
you're here to talk about some
announcements google has a as an
announcement too an addition to Google
fit basically this this program to help
motivate you to move more and be more
active yeah tell me about that it's a
little bit of an
overhaul of google fit and it's their
their platform to basically try to get
you to exercise more and it's an app
that you can find on like an Android
phone or an Android smart watch I'm so
lazy I didn't actually know google fit
was a thing yeah yeah I just don't like
to move so I think Google fit would be
kind of worthless well then you're
really gonna hate this new thing that
they tell me not today because it's
literally called it's called move
minutes and there's another thing that
they they know it's called heart points
and those basically like oh that's like
an RPG thing right are points are points
it's so it's it's a gamification thing
you know it's like it it's meant to
encourage you to like instead of taking
like an elevator then then take the
stairs okay or instead of like meeting
up with a friend for coffee they like
meet up with a friend and take a walk
around the block kind of thing this is
this stuff work like for instance you've
got the Apple why'd ya the Apple rings
yeah yeah well it also turns on like a
certain notification the like you
actually do that actually I mean I kid
about being completely like I will get
up and walk around for a bit when I get
the reminder it does kind of work I
don't know I don't know how much it
helps the timing is interesting because
we've got Aoife next year oh yeah sorry
my watch told me to stand we've got you
for next week Ben will be going there
we're expecting at least a couple of
smaller watching ounces right and
imagine google fit plays well into our
watches yeah yeah Scotland Skagen is
having an announcement that's one of the
fossil companies so we are expecting
quite a bit of SmartWatch news along
with smart appliances stuff so
definitely look out for the ephah news
as it starts rolling out I guess mid
next week and excited to be in Berlin it
looks like Russian influence over our
elections hasn't stopped Microsoft has
discovered a new wave hacking attempts
on sites belonging to - yes u.s.
conservative groups rich yeah what's
going on
yeah I mean I think the thing here is
that you know it looks like Russia's not
not done yeah right not done yet that's
interesting I mean initially that a lot
of the targets were with the Democratic
Party this looks like they're they're
going out to the other side right right
so I mean I guess the takeaway here is
that it's it's broader than then than we
thought and they're these sites are
posing as legitimate sites they're
they're stealing passwords and and
credentials reportedly the idea there I
guess is like when you look at it from a
democratic or conservative side it's
more like the idea to sow chaos as
opposed to and that was the same thing
in 2016 as opposed to really
specifically targeting just one side
which granted that was also happening
yeah we definitely saw that with the
internet research agency it was
definitely both sides it wasn't I didn't
take they didn't pick a party lastly one
little-known Chinese filmmaker may have
an Android phone that's more beautiful
than galaxy s 9
that's according to our colleague
Aloysius Lowe says the Oppo find X is
probably the most gorgeous phone he's
seen all year yeah no bezel no not full
screen it's gonna pop up camera so it's
not selling in the US unfortunately but
it does look really nice it's
interesting and in in Jessica adult
courts video about this she said even
though it's not going to arrive in the
US hopefully some of those innovative
designs do find their way into different
phones it is kind of cool but I think it
might get a little annoying after a
while that the entire back opens like
lifts up to allow you to take a selfie
you know you've got like a spontaneous
selfie that doesn't really work too well
it's it's from hash tag team anti notch
I celebrate this innovation keep in mind
a PO is owned by bkk which also owns
oneplus so given that we know that the
oneplus is coming t-mobile maybe we'll
see if phones with pop-up cameras and
all bezel or no bezel no notch phones in
the future all bezel alright
for more of the story shakes down Cena
I'm Roger Chang I'm Ben Fox ribbon I'm
rich neova it's listening
that's pretty good all right thanks
everybody for joining us for the
recording of the 359 audio podcast now
as always it's time for you to question
what we just reported on so we can keep
the comedy what it's everything we
should everything we say should be cool
I want all the time I went up against to
the chat so obviously we talked a lot
about notches and how notches have taken
over and it's basically if you have a
premium phone these days it's an I don't
have a notch so for customers that are
watching this would you prefer no not
but have this pop up camera thing
because it's not like that is a perfect
solution either I'd be worried that like
if you break it back to the bezel like
Samsung still has that frame above me on
the screen right you know the sides are
are bezel this but they they decide to
go no notch and like ya have an actual
you know strip across the the top of the
phone that has the camera right which is
which is that's the that's how everybody
used to do it so yeah I guess the
question is would you prefer a knotch
or a pop-up camera which one would you
go with so yeah we'll see what people
come back with you looking at me no no
we're oh sure yeah let's let's do that
well Barry says I'm guessing the rumored
pixel watch might have something to do
with google fit ooh that's a really good
guess what do you think really rich
knows something spill the beans I mean
yeah do you know that's gonna be called
a pixel watch or we don't know anything
I mean anything that Google can do to
expand the kind of the kinds of data
that it can collect is a good business
move for Google so sure and going back
to all this this this fit stuff I mean
it is it is another reminder of just how
granular the data that they can collect
on you oh yeah
well that's the idea with move minutes
for instance like instead of just
tracking something pretty rudimentary
like steps it can track a handful of
different things I know the Apple watch
like I met with the Apple folks a couple
months ago and the Apple watch tries to
do some of that as well
we're like it's that one was for
accessibility reasons where if you're in
a wheelchair it also tracks your
activity so it seems like these
smartwatches are getting better at
tracking different types of activity and
not just steps yeah like one one of the
examples Google gave is like if you're
doing yoga or if you're gardening like
it knows that your garden you know it's
know if I'm walking and holding my kid I
don't think my Apple watch knows that I
feel like I should get more credit
should get more points for that you're
holding like wait wait yeah maybe they
should give the kid an Apple watch and
then it gets tracked on the kids Apple
watch right so you really want track
your kid get him an Apple ID yeah yeah
definitely
Danny Green says my move reminders are
turned off and sitting if I'm sitting
that long I'm likely doing something I
can't walk away from at the time like
when I'm directing video for an hour or
45 minutes hour and 45 minutes on a
Sunday morning same Danny same from a
Michael Brown I'm curious how many of
you have a where OS Smart Watch tell us
if you do and what brand you own or if
you've owned one in the past let's go
ahead and expand it to that I don't have
one I I've tried one yeah I've tried
them because I cover right obligated but
I don't wear any Smart Watch actually I
actually really like like regular
watches oh wow that's weird
yeah wait you call yourself a tech
reporter I know yeah I mean I have an
Apple watch and I had a I mean I was
regularly using a gear
Garrus three the sampling garish but
that's also not where is right they uses
their own Tizen operating system so I
actually haven't
I mean I've handled and played with
where OS my watches but I've never
really been drawn to them yeah it might
be fun to get Scott Steiner on because
he does a ton on wearables like after
Aoife gods on a boat though Scott's on a
boat
when he's no longer on a boat we'll
we'll try to get him back on here and
like maybe do a show specifically about
wearables we can do that I don't know
that anybody would watch that show
probably not Michael Brown will be on we
will you will enjoy having you yes you
Michael yeah that doesn't sound right
it's only a matter of time before Scott
just looks like a comic book character
would like utility belts in the
Chewbacca Bell and just like all the
wearables
I want to see him just completely like
right down to the Nintendo Power glove
just Bilbao this like autonomous
Terminator looking you would be right at
home in a power glove yeah
it's so bad Jacob Lombardo it's obvious
Google is trying to look like the nice
guy with the experimentation of
increased development in digital
well-being and Google fit do you think
that the regular customer is looking at
this and taking it as a good look
towards Google motives or is it really
looking that they're saying that all of
these all the time are just trying to
farm more data on us yeah yeah I mean I
think both can be true yeah I mean I
think there's an overall trend with tech
companies I mean you're seen with Apple
to write to kind of push wellness as a
way to get you to buy these devices
right this isn't just a watch it's
supposed to save your life it's supposed
to get you motivated I mean Tim Cook is
actually your right heart heart monitor
yeah but but also in their advertising
they specifically mentioned the Apple
watch was like save people's lives or
something like some guy was having a
heart attack in the Apple watch like
we're just like alerted I don't know a
robot or something so I made up the last
but yeah it's it's yes if you're into
that kind of stuff I guess it's
something useful where it's more
granular information but at the same
time totally absolutely good analysis
that these giant tech companies are not
gonna have more in different kinds of
information about you which is what's so
great about this year is that we're
talking so much more about these data
privacy issues and you know how much
information an apple or a Google stores
about you yeah and
it's interesting to juxtapose like this
announcement against the news that came
out last week or Google was in hot water
for for its location services yeah and
and how it how it kind of attracts you
even though even when you turn off
location history yeah coming in from
Nalini what do you mean this time Apple
will collaborate with Garmin I'm not
sure who said that I don't recall I
don't think we said that didn't say I
never said that that might have been in
the chat that might have been in the
chat apologies I'm doing too many things
at once
all good let's move on to the Oppo it's
a cool phone is it a practical phone oh
Wilbury says I don't see a problem with
keeping a chin and forehead especially
if that means keeping dual front-facing
speakers there's a good priority there's
a good point you must be a fan those old
HTC boomsound speakers that those were
known for their large chin and forehead
I don't know that I feel like the trend
has moved beyond that like the idea of
having a bezel s phone like basically
all screen that's kind of where the
industry is going so if you if you miss
those days where there are like large
foreheads and Chin's
like you're out of luck or or I guess
you can buy a cheaper phone because I
think those are still something but like
the trend is like the rumors for the
next iPhones they're all gonna have this
bezel as' notch design so that's kind of
where things are going yeah and that
design might change in a couple years
but in in the interim like in the short
term that's what we've got I I totally
agree and yes I if I should like every
black like black mirror or whatever like
although all those phones are like
almost all glass or the I think the
industry is shooting towards that kind
of fictional feature of like basically
just glass right and one of the cool
things and this goes to Westworld is one
of the cool things that's expected to
come from Samsung what next year or
something or the moldable phone so if
you are kind of getting sick of how
phones look like or you don't really
like the the bezel free design then
there's an opportunity to get like like
a billfold phone would
could be really interesting I mean like
I'm certainly we've talked about that
for years and like MIT hasn't hit the
market yet well remember a couple years
ago when like scroll things like
rollable happen to that it's done that
to me is like kind of like a bridge or
it was like a step in their design
process to try to get to like a foldable
phone I don't think anybody really wants
like like a rolled-up burrito phone and
their burrito pho would be kind of cool
if you can so that you can say the
phrase burrito foam yeah part of the
issue was the they were able to get the
display to bend and fold but the problem
is the getting components to do that
right you know Apple's charging like
three times that joke was a good one
yeah that was solid you should file that
one thank you ouch I'm not sure if
you're serious never James Colin why not
embrace the notch that's another good
question just because we tease it we
make fun of it all the time but honestly
let's let's get objective it's all hell
right now
what's worse bezel or not ch
I mean the bezels worse and then I go
back to I have a 7 plus an a-10 I go
back to my 7 plus I'm like oh this looks
kind of and it looks old-fashioned I
guess the fact that it's got this chunky
part of the phone that doesn't really
have utilitarian purpose I don't know
so this is an s8 and it has like that
terrible bezel on the top yeah it's just
kind of like the little little yeah you
think on the top Moorehead on the top oh
whatever
fine it's got a little forehead on top
and I don't really care that much I
think it's totally fine I feel like how
much would be distracting but I don't
have an iPhone I've already said I'm
okay with
I would like the notch to be a little
bit smaller I know the one plus six and
a couple other phones have the option
where like it'll black out that part of
the screen so they're using a notch so
if you're annoyed by it there's sort of
a digital solution I think they kind of
split the difference since they still
put the time up there in like a
different color so it's like no not CH
it's kind of bezel but the time is up
there so we were also jogging around
before the show about the idea of having
like an in screen camera so you wouldn't
need I wasn't talking about that I think
that that's gonna happen in like a few
years like a camera embedded underneath
the display how is technology that
allows like this screen to like but that
part of the screen for the camera like
blank out or go blank and be able to
shoot out well that's pretty awesome
there are patents filed for a ready just
has it's been in development for years
I'm sure Apple has like a ton of people
working on that now yeah so we're gonna
have the in display fingerprint sensor
that's already hitting the market and
then maybe in display camera at some
point at some point you're just gonna
have a clean sheet of glass and then
maybe fold black mirror that's what I'm
saying it's it's coming it's coming
I mean it might take a while but we'll
say by and large the chat is against the
knotch I myself thank you I would prefer
a bezel because the way I like to hold
my phone and I can't tell you how many
times now that I have a galaxy si active
which I like like a lot but the edge to
edge and it's not even as edge to edge
as some of them out there but it's
closer than I'm used to I can't tell you
how many times I'm just trying to watch
a video or something like that and I
accidentally scrub backwards or
something stupid like oh yeah and I
don't want to get one of those stupid
little capper things you put on the back
of the case that's the whole reason I
got this phone so I wouldn't have to put
a case on it and for the record I got so
angry the other day I threw the phone
put a hole in the wall phone survived
Wow wait so there's a chat case or non
or anti case we haven't brought up case
yet we're just still talking notch bezel
and I haven't seen a single one anti
bezel so the s8 active by the way Brian
is that like the one party or hardened
yeah yeah it's not quite milspec but
it's like pretty it's a brick it's
pretty heavy
is the only real downside to it
I mean for you it's purple it's perfect
sorry how often you throw your phone the
bullet points on it specifically
mentioned like Brian you can throw this
it's totally totally fine I want to see
my testimony on the next box like the
next act of Rage throws another question
from Jacob Lombardo as we move on after
a few months of normal wear and tear the
battery of my wear OS watch the battery
wouldn't even last a day how our company
is going to change this you can't really
make it larger it would kind of defeat
the purpose of the watch all right go
ahead answer this question battery tag
huh I think this is a dilemma that all
filmmakers are dealing with or ice
makers ice makers is that how do you get
a watch that lasts longer but keep the
the size really small I mean you saw the
Apple watch the last type of watch where
the embedded LTE like the watch got
thicker like they kind of like made it
they kind of hid the bulk underneath but
it is thicker and so I mean I think
that's right now that without like a
huge jump in battery technology like
wholesale change away from like
lithium-ion we're just kind of stuck
basically just with a bigger battery if
you want to last longer I mean there are
little things you can do with this on
with the software fixes we're like you
can optimize and maybe have them not you
know have apps not do things in the
background right right or have your
phone just shut down on you which Apple
did was that thing sure please remind me
it was these four older phones right
mm-hmm where they would just slow them
down right so I think things like
Qualcomm got fast chuckle quick charging
so there are ways that kind of mitigated
like well I think wireless charging will
eventually help once you see charging
stations all around in public spaces so
it's not as much of a worry but yeah
it's that's just gonna continue be a
problem Maximilian Matthews is a change
in the pace on us wants to know when do
you think the Apple is going to send out
the September event invites ooh great
question and with that with the event
bring to us the mesmeric air
Matt oh that thing maybe I don't know
they keep pushing that thing back so I
think part of me is suspecting that it's
an issue with like the standards and
working with with the Chi and consortium
to kind of get all of that stuff settled
but in terms of the invitations I think
we're all like targeting September 11th
for the actual date but we don't
actually know but if you kind of work
backwards it's probably a week before
that so you can sort of see the invites
coming out either next week or the week
after but fairly shortly we should see
something or hear something soon there's
also a rumor that there's gonna be is
that there was a story yesterday that
there's gonna be an October event yeah
where the MacBook Air might actually
finally get wrapping on that idea and
like tell me some ways sorry oh really
I'm the last year has the chat been just
jonesing like where's the new MacBook
Air and it's free we take it with a
grain of salt though we just have
literally talked about MacBook Air
refresh like a real refresh we're
getting rid of the bezel and adding a
Retina display for at least three or
four years now yeah and the the idea is
is that the lowest tier MacBook Pro is
it was supposed to be a MacBook just the
MacBook or the MacBook either one of
those were supposed to be the refresh
but there were like 20 to 30 percent
more money so people are obviously
looking for you know just a slightly
better MacBook Air at the same price and
like Apple has so far refused to do it
so I'll believe it when I see it
although yeah here's gonna have a notch
it's gonna be the best how that's gonna
work like fitting that lineup since like
the MacBook is already kind of stripped
down with high resolution display like
how are they gonna justify how that fits
in with the product when it's like
basically the same deal right it's got
Retina display and it's got you know the
thinner bezel like how is that gonna
lightly it's a good question I always
saw the MacBook like the straight-up
MacBook as more of like experimental
because they just got rid of all the
ports it was like that's a thing like
that was like there that was sort of
their new take on the MacBook Air until
people ya know
they don't work no that's the thing it's
too expensive yeah so maybe this is very
I don't see them doing it even though as
we're talking about it that does make
sense to me I'm just wondering there
gonna be other things they throw out to
keep it at $1,000 mm-hmm like yeah
there's a Retina display and smaller
bezel but like there's no more keyboard
no trackpad is $500 yes exactly
the $200 accessories newest innovative
revolution no more screens all right we
are out of time unfortunately thanks
everybody for joining us thank at USB
for sponsoring the show we're gonna have
to close up shop and we'll be back again
