offers more options than Android
smartphones in a blink of an eye
Gingerbread seems as old as Froyo and
you have no idea if your Samsung
discombobulate will even play nice with
Ice Cream Sandwich I'm Donna Bell and if
any of that made sense to you you're in
the right place and counting down scene
this July 2012 picks for the top Android
smartphones starting off at number five
the LG Nitro HD this one's on AT&amp;amp;T and
if it sounds familiar maybe you saw it
in our top five smartphones under $50
it's a great phone with a beautiful
screen and it's a stupidly good value
you know what I like more than saving
money not having to worry about where I
left my phone charger that's why our
number four pick is the Motorola Droid
RAZR MAXX
this thing works 16 days in standby mode
the Kevlar on the back won't stop a
bullet but it won't shatter on impact
like some other problems number three is
the HTC One S this one's actually on
t-mobile it's also one of the thinnest
Android 4.0 smartphones we've seen and
that AMOLED screen is really really
pretty in fact the whole thing's almost
as nice as the HTC One X on AT&amp;amp;T it's
our number two pick and I think it's
just here to irritate t-mobile so the
HTC One S wants to be when it grows up
you get a bigger brighter 4.7 inch
screen and 4G LTE screen that big makes
the iPhone look kind of puny speaking of
the iPhone of all these great Android
options around you may be wondering
we're seeing that would rank the iPhone
if we mixed everything up together well
the overall best 5 cell phone list on
cnet.com currently ranks the iPhone 4s
at number 3
and that like Android Chicken Soup for
the Soul and that brings us to the
number one Android smartphone of the
summer for 2012 the Samsung Galaxy s3
what carrier is it on all of them
everybody wants a piece of this phone
the screen is a 4.8 inch high-definition
monster and assuming you have hands big
enough to hold it this is the Android
phone you want but don't take my word
for it you can find all of our latest
Android phone reviews over phones
cnet.com and while you're over there
head over top-5 cnet.com for more videos
like these I'm Donna bell thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
