for sea nuts daily podcast show the 359
out of the scene at New York studios and
here with me today I've got Roger Chang
and Ben Fox Ruben what are we talking
about today guys
more hot news yeah Amazon all bed
actually these are all bed stories we're
talking about in stories suppose for 79
some of the best stories out there so
thank you but so a couple weeks ago we
talked about the echo look the Amazon
echo look but yes is the newest echo
product well that was enough was the
news it was the newest echo product and
we we got it on the show you know like
an hour after it was released
we've got another one it's the echo show
and we'll talk about it yeah on the show
we're not actually showing up we're not
gonna show it off because we don't have
it yeah but yeah we'll be talking about
that and we'll be talking about
something called threat casting which
bed we'll have to explain to me because
I don't quite understand it right so as
always if you have any questions about
either topics or anything else leave
them at the comment section brian will
pick out the best and we'll get to them
in 3 minutes and 59 seconds from 3 to
welcome to the 359 I'm Roger Chang I'm
Ben Fox ribbon the Amazon echo family
keeps getting bigger the online retail
giant reduce the echo show a smart
speaker that now includes a 7-inch
touchscreen it will cost $230 that you
had the scoop on this before so give us
the details what is this about why
should I care so it's basically a giant
phone for your kitchen counter I think
that's that's what our headline was and
I was I was pretty happy with that
because this is this is essentially a
way for Amazon to get you to use your
echo even more
maybe it'll improve discovery voice
shopping different things like that you
can also like watch a YouTube on it so
it's kind of like the bringing back the
idea of you know like a kitchen counter
TV yeah yeah yeah no I like that it's
funny you say that because I I was at a
friend's place this weekend and I
noticed like me they had an iPad mounted
to a stand all the kitchen they
basically I use it to look up recipes
watch videos so I feel like the this
echo show is really meant to take that
place right it is yeah I mean like
that's essentially maybe it's like a
slightly better version of
or slightly worse if you don't like how
big it is it does kind of look a little
funky let's let's talk about that
because it's lookup I'll just be
straight with it it looks ugly to me
yeah I mean like a lot of people were
trashing leaked images of this last week
and they were saying uh you know you
gotta be kidding me this thing really
does not it looks like something from
like the 90s or whatever I mean like
look the screen the screen looks nice
it's also got Joby speakers so bulky why
is it so bulky I think it might be the
speakers I'm not really sure I mean like
before the show we were talking about
the fact that you were like I'll wait
for the 2.0 version that I probably be a
little bit this next year version yeah
like people are used to like having
their phones be like razor thin so yeah
this this does seem a little bit off off
key from that yeah okay so next up bad
you visited the army cyber Institute at
the West Point they're charged with
dreaming up crazy scenarios where we're
under cyber assault what you learn so
there's this interesting idea called
science-fiction prototyping where you
get in a room you start to consider what
the future might look like ten years
from now whether it's a cyber threat or
you know in certain cases for for
looking into the future what certain
technologies are going to look like and
then you reverse engineer those concepts
and you work back from there to try to
figure out what exactly we should do
today to try to get to the futures that
we want to get to as opposed to the
futures that we want to avoid so what
are some of the craziest scenarios
they've dreamed up the one that really
stood out in my mind that I opened my
story with was that a dirty bomb could
potentially explode in the Greater New
York City area because a bunch of smart
refrigerators were hijacked by
terrorists and they started asking for
milk at the same time so they could like
sneak a dirty bomb in if you like that
seems plausible now like that futurecast
a that is or threat casting that's like
we've seen botnets take over smart
devices yeah I mean like so that's one
of the issues with threat casting is is
that you you don't want to like be
surprised by certain things so we talked
about the stuff now and like it's it's
pretty worthwhile to at least try to
prepare for some of this stuff but at
the same time I mean like I talked to
some analysts and folks in
the cybersecurity world that said like
but in a lot of ways this kind of feels
like throwing spaghetti up on the wall
yeah that's me as a big skeptical battle
like yeah you basically just throwing
darts on the wall is basically just
blindly guessing and like are you
wasting resources building towards a
feature that may never happen sure but
one would argue that we're not as a
species we're not very proactive and
this is at least an effort to try to not
be so damn lazy all the time so
hopefully we avoid something you know
doing this I mean it's better than doing
nothing
yeah your breakpoints that even if they
do so prevent something that we may
never know how effective they are right
yeah that really cooked my noodle trying
to think about that all right four more
of these stories chicks on OC net a
Roger Chang I'm Ben Fox Ruben thanks for
listening take it we did it
what's with all the spaghetti analogies
spaghetti throw spaghetti at the wall
cook my noodle oh my god you know why
it's a weird some cops they get pasta
last night I know I had grilled cheese
but you know that's a good point I guess
I'm kind of hungry yeah if somebody
wants to like get me like a vicap ending
with chicken just so hits it off yeah if
somebody wants to get Ben a vodka go
right ahead
that too I would help with this podcast
all right let's talk a little about this
uh echo show okay people in the chat
excited about it was there like a lot of
judge largely yes people commenting on
how it looks
cuz I'm really curious about the
acceptance of this because it is good
it's like it's bulky it's just kind of
bland really in my opinion but I mean
we're looking for function not - Abed
hit though it kind of looks like it came
out of the 90s right it looks a little
know if you've got kind of like a I
don't like my kitchens like kind of
white it's got like high-tech stuff like
iPads or whatever I got imagine
eventually like I don't feel like I feel
comfortable having that fit into the
decorum well like like every every
Amazon echo product that's gonna roll
out in a beta phase right they're gonna
you know you have to get offered like a
trial period and I'm sure when this
thing actually hits a market market
there will be skins and different
options that could be dressing
if you put it in the corner to in like
your kitchen it's not like your phone
where it has to be like as thin as
possible
right right lock it so you put it in the
corner of your kitchen does it really
matter I don't know it's gonna be a much
thinner I don't have a lot of real
estate in my kitchen like it turns I've
got like kitchen appliances other stuff
on top I've got fruit bowls I've got
random stuff and like they have this big
bulky thing yeah that's why I like deco
dots this tiny thing I just searched and
that that has been their most popular
echo yeah the question is is like are
people really going to be excited for
this Jetsons future we're yeah you're
gonna do a lot of voice chats this is
this is like they've not only does it
have the touch screen but it's also got
the guys dilemma for because they really
seem to push voice chat video chat as a
real key feature and I think that's why
we have that's why I have my iPad on a
stand in the kitchen is mm-hmm it's a
place for like my family and I could
just sort of gather around we chat with
my my parents or my wife's parents on
that thing and it's just sort of a
central location but it's I have an iPad
I have that already right necessarily
need another device to do this live chat
yeah the the kitchen integration is a
great sell point um imagine soggy says
the echo show will be awesome for all
the recipe features that tell you the
recipes from the agreement you have
what's up imagine soggy I know
manatorian Xavier largely agree in
similar fronts III would have fun with
that because I'm similar to what you
guys were talking about earlier before
the show I myself took an old look that
wasn't doing anything because it's a
nook and I built a magnetic frame for it
and I stuck it to the side side of my
refrigerator now for recipes oh yeah but
now this is a multi-purpose thing that's
designed kind of for the kitchen design
being right term right but you don't
stick it on your refrigerator so we're
talking about it taking up counter space
actually I dare you to build a magnetic
frame for this thing yeah
is he gonna half pounds um where else it
might fit in the house could also be
interesting whether you want to put it
in your living room instead on a side
table I really don't think putting it
bathroom I can nightstand is a good idea
I don't think the bathroom I think that
is a terrible voice calls in the
bathroom I don't know rodeo view calls
the bathroom while you're the toilet
just Joe
children that's all I see happening yeah
yeah but that's that's really the
potential that Amazon tries to look for
the initial idea for the echo was they
wanted to create computer from Star Trek
so they're they're trying to get us to
this future but maybe maybe we'll get
there you know but not publicly idea I
think I like this idea I think uh
frankly the little bit sexy I probably
people are interested by it
that's why wait for 2.0 or 3.0 or
whatever actually start literally just
got announced like a boring like like oh
we get 1.0 let's just let's just skip
ahead
no burkhalter you'll recall that the
echo the original echo never really got
a 2.0 like they had they made it in
white it's now in white and black but
they never made it like any specific
terminal date they slip down exactly the
dot they had the dot that was kind of
like their their hit product it was kind
of it yeah but it was a different one so
I would I would hesitate to say that
this is gonna have like a similar time
schedule or cycle is the phone business
where there's next year go look dot -
Bry know where rolls right off of it an
echo dot with a screen on top Matthew
dacher says I'd rather use my laptop or
a tablet with okay Google in my kitchen
but he expands something that could
create recipes from the ingredients you
have would be a killer app maybe even
start syncing it with your smart
refrigerator that's uh yeah yeah the
failure is like that could show up on
anything like that doesn't have to go in
Amazon that could be on sure Android
tablet like an iPad you just pick up
your phone ping Alexa what do I have in
my fridge and smart fridge talks to your
show and then it shows you from the show
and then show show show me what I need
to pick up on the way home kind of thing
yeah okay you're right that there are
other technologies that can do that but
Amazon has proven that you know you get
a first mover advantage and you get a
lot of the market according to eMarketer
that just came out with this report on
Monday that um the echo controls 71
percent of the u.s. smart speaker market
right Wow the Google home controls
present 24 percent but it's like there's
nothing else that's why there's nothing
else in a while right and we'll see if
and when
comes out with one we've been getting
like more and more rumors about that
right yeah we're here about WWDC that's
the big rumor that they finally come out
with speaker we've talked about we've
actually read about the speaker for this
last year really so so the expectation I
mean from what I've been hearing the
expectation was is that Google home
getting uh the ability to identify
multiple users was a bit of a wake-up
call for Amazon and now they are you
know pushing out these pets maybe a
little bit faster that's a big deal well
that's a noise that's apparently on the
roadmap but I don't actually know when
it's coming out that you would be able
to have multiple users so apologies to
fresh vids 28 we set off the Amazon dot
in their home all right Omar Alexa all
right just spell the name out so going
back to what you're saying earlier about
competition Parker says with all these
different products from Amazon can
Google catch up with their Google home
array it's a great question and we'll
have to find out I think Google has a
very significant edge in the market
because they've been doing search for so
long Amazon is not a search company so
you can't really ask your Google you
can't really ask echo course leaving a
number that this has been their foray
into that mm-hm yep and it looks they've
got a huge market leadership with the
Android phone so with Android phones in
general so like tying them together that
gives Google much bigger advantage to
Amazon so truth yeah yeah so there is a
very very good chance that Google could
some at some point lap Amazon but the
expectation is is that Amazon is gonna
maintain its lead for at least the next
couple years likely I like this comment
from Michael ambarisa to remember the
Sony - yeah yeah we're talking about the
- it's this product that looks a lot
like this thing people were talking
about that there was also this thing
called like chumby or whatever
shiny yeah yeah the chumby was the
original before they called it the Sony
- I believe so what year was this thing
this so this was at least this was me
and this is running the chumby this
example from Wikipedia that we found but
I mean this isn't as much integrated for
a purpose in the kitchen this is just
your little video guide I think it did a
little bit it definitely did less but um
did have a voice assistant no no because
like voice assistants are like super new
like a crappy posted maybe it did I
never hear said I didn't have a kitchen
back then wait what
you don't know I was probably in college
when this game okay yeah like a crappy
dorm I don't remember this at all yeah
this was can you check when it came out
what could blue be added this let's see
this says you guys can read it better
than I can from here
announcer 2010 2010 2010 and see really
that long is the long ago introductory
price $1.99 so this one's slightly more
expensive pretty on what it does more
stuff yeah oh look I'm gonna be honest
with you I'm gonna buy this Alexa Alexa
don't sign I'm sorry sorry wrong our
audience either never coming back again
and yes they will it'll just come back
troll us again cuz that's that's how
YouTube works yeah that's how the
internet works so let's take a look last
few minutes and elaborate on this cyber
uh what's the term I'm looking for ed
cast cast casting we shouldn't laugh cuz
this is kind of a fascinating topic is
more than you were able to cram into
that you know yeah any long segments
it's like this this essentially like
it's predictive modeling and in in some
ways like what I was thinking about like
what it there's like this book called
like the wish or whatever do you know
what I'm talking about or the promise
when you try to like think about like
what where you want to be your life the
secret thank you yeah I was close yeah
um you like you like imagine a goal and
then you pursue that but just by the way
just totally underwhelming like that
secret is basically like if you think
and it'll come true right right but like
this is this is like taking you know the
steps today to make sure that you don't
have like a cluster cuss in you know
sometime in the future and it makes to
me it makes a lot of sense I came into
the story very skeptical but um you know
after I did a lot of research on it I
realized that this isn't the same thing
as like looking into a crystal ball you
try to imagine like what certain futures
are going to look like and to avoid
those types of problems you do what you
have to do today to prevent them and
there is a concern a bit of calculus
there's like a formula to this
just like yeah there's a guy without
thinking right no no unlike the secret
we just sit there and wait for it to
happen
yeah or whatever I never read the book
uh there's a guy named Brian David
Johnson he's now at Arizona State
University
he was Intel's first futurist and he's
the guy that came up with the idea of
future casting which was the precursor
the threat cast what companies use
actually to kind of like ward off
competitive threat to figure out how
they basically did it yeah exactly they
figure out what technology is going to
look like ten years down the line it's
it's actually a fascinating idea or like
at least an exercise to think like well
you know most predictive modeling is
like what's going to happen two years
from now what's gonna happen three years
from now right
the army is literally thinking what's
gonna happen ten years from now and what
that what that might look like there are
other things that I found in my research
that the Marines are looking at like
what's going to happen in like 2035 well
which could be I don't know this is like
we'll see if we're still talking about
the Amazon echo then or like will just
be amaz well if you are if you're
interested the subject actually this is
you know but there's the first part of a
two-part package that she has put
together Alfred a actually went
alongside with you to West Point and
he's got a story kind of look at looking
at how cadets kind of interacted during
a hacking exercise at the NSA so he's
got sort of a the you get at easily the
video today but you the full story
tomorrow so just a slow plug out for uh
that story come back and check it out
then that's a perfect place to end it up
for the day yeah thanks everybody
great if you liked anything you saw or
heard here check us on CNN our podcast
is also available on iTunes to knit
stitch your SoundCloud feed burger and
