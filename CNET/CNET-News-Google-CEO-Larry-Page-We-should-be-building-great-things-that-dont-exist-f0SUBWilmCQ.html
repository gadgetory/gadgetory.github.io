that people can get on with doing the
things to make them happiest in life
take search for example perfect search
engine Azam it mention is a star track
computer rights and understand exactly
what you meant and give you exactly what
you wanted and our knowledge graph which
you saw really brings that a lot closer
link google now gives you information
without even having task and it
understands the context of what you
talked about before so you can use
things like pronouns it's amazing flight
times your boarding passes directions
next appointment all with no effort you
know think about a really smart
assistant doing all these things for you
so you don't have to think about it you
saw how easy some of those experiences
felt I think we're all here because we
share a deep sense of optimism for about
the potential of technology to improve
people's lives and in the world as part
of that and I'm amazed every day I come
to work the list of things that needs to
be done is longer than the day before
and the opportunity of those things is
bigger than it was before and because of
that I think we as Google and as an
industry all of you really only a one
percent of what is possible and probably
even less than that and despite the
faster change we have in the industry
we're still moving slow relative to the
opportunities that we have and some of
that I think is doing the negativity you
know every story I read about google
it's kind of us versus some other
company or some stupid thing
and I just don't find that very
interesting oh we should be building
great things that don't exist right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
