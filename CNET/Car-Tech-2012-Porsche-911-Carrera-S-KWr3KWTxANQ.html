redone only three times since the early
60s this is one of them it's the new 911
on a platform designated nine nine one
let's drive this 2012 Carrera S on that
all new architecture and check the tech
okay before we go inside let's do our
spotters guide so you know when you've
seen one of these the easiest way is to
look out back those taillights are very
different into my I borrowed from an
Aston Martin up front great big eyes
with big bubble headlights with some LED
jewelry underneath them the whole cars
wheelbase is almost four inches longer
it has a shorter overhang there's less
body in front of the front wheels and
inside you immediately you're in a 991
because of that console welcome to the
new Porsche 911 cabin what draws my eye
is a lot more angular stuff going on on
the dash they've kind of taken some of
the curves out somewhat like on the
exterior of the car that's called the
PCM the Porsche communication management
head unit and that is stock on 911 from
a Carrera on up that means you're going
to get navigation touchscreen you've got
this knob you can navigate and click to
operate with the big thing that I'm
missing now it's telling of our time no
voice command optioned on this car if
you don't option it you don't have it at
all but note this it's a German car so
you can do all of this while driving
your base audio system here is going to
have its nine speakers and 235 watts you
can go up to Bose that's the middle
system we have that here it's 445 watts
12 speakers and a powered sub if you
really want to go nuts spend double that
$5,000 for the Burmeister sound system
that'll get you eight hundred and twenty
one watts still 12 speakers but now all
that sound goes out through 12 discrete
channels of amplification this center
console was first seen I think in the
Cayenne then Panamera now you've got it
here in this 911 it still kind of grates
me I find that it's getting away from
the traditional relatively Spartan cabin
of a classic 911 this is really modern
car excessively developed to me you see
the gear shifter we have this is for the
PDK the double clutch automated manual
it's a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission
this guy cost a little over $4,000 for
that option and this little PDK deal
here is only on a PDK equipped car it'll
show you a couple of things we have the
sport mode which will give you a light
that lights up right there or Sport+
which I'll explain later this little
button here is not a pair of binoculars
that's actually if you
sport exhaust system an optional exhaust
that content more noise out the tips if
you like it - almost three grand show on
me
we've done about 1,100 car videos here
at scenic this one has the least amount
of engine I can show you that's it it's
not really hit at all the engines down
here in the back but you can't see it
from the top anymore you're looking at a
3.8 liter flat six classic Porsche
architecture you still get 400
horsepower 325 foot-pounds of torque the
car weighs 30 to 50 it gets up to 60 and
4.3 seconds with a manual 4.1 with our
PDK gearbox or get the Sport Chrono
Package that makes everything more
aggressive and you can get it down to
like 3.9 all that while delivering 20:27
epa estimates on the MPG let's go see
how they blended that efficiency and
ferocity
they may have noticed this button down
here which is the auto start-stop
defeats which I'd wear that one out
there's one thing I don't need is a 911
doing auto start-stop but that is
obviously part of how they got this guy
220 27mpg anderson of strategy another
reason that they got to that pretty good
mileage estimate is that they've got
this 7-speed gearbox in here this PDK
and it tends to like most automatics
unless you stroke it it's going to seek
top gear all the time so I do find this
cars a little up a little flat-footed
when you're just tooling around town or
doing normal driving in standard drive
mode with no support engaged
however push this little button right
here or this one next to it sport or
Sport+ and everything changes now the
throttle response is a little more
ambitious the suspension gets firmer if
you've got the PD CC which is the
dynamic chassis control that kicks in it
really keeps the car flatter here's how
I put it though it really lightens the
car push one of these sport buttons and
you seem to take hundreds of pounds off
the wheels that's the real magic of a
911 if you saw my take on the GTS
recently you know that I really loved
that car even in everyday driving and
this one same thing however I was
expecting a little more of a compliant
suspension with the longer wheelbase
this car doesn't seem to ride any more
comfortably than the GTS it's very firm
and sporty day in and day out like most
owners are going to use this thing not
on the track it can be a little tiresome
ok this 911 is not a cheap date but you
knew that going into it ninety seven
thousand dollars base for this Carrera S
and the new car is only available so far
as an S or a base Carrera top of that
nearly hundred grand I think that only
pick a few options one of them would not
be the PDK saving me $4,000 sport
exhaust is kind of fun but $3,000 and
I'm okay with the middle sound system we
had on here the $2,400 ish Bose rig now
you're over 100 grand no matter what you
do on this car unless you take it
straight off the floor and I doubt
they're shipping a lot to dealers that
way
but this remains one of the great
refined automotive stories you can ever
get into</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
