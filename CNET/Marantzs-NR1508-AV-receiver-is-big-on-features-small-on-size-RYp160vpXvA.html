latest slimline receiver and its biggest
claim to fame
it really beefs up on music streaming
the marantz offers heõs multi room
music which means you can control
multiple speakers around your house at
once
heõs brings with it support for Spotify
Pandora Amazon music and iHeartRadio but
it may not be as useful as the more open
chromecast system or play fire as far as
connections the marantz includes six
HDMI ports with compatibility with the
latest video standards including Dolby
vision HDR as a slimline receiver it
doesn't have as much power as full-size
models but it is still able to output 50
watts per 5 channels this is great for
small rooms or for easy to drive
speakers such as those from clinch the
receiver comes with a remote that is
pretty easy to use even if the on-screen
display it controls is fairly
rudimentary what you're paying for here
is a smaller size and an extensive
feature count so compared against a full
sized receiver like the Sony STR DN 1080
which also has Dolby Atmos support it
can't quite offer the same level of
immersion
however the marantz sounds good
especially with music but is also still
able to offer excellent surround sound
performance
it sounds details and able to shake a
smaller listening room as required if
you don't need or want height speakers
in your house unlike the discreet looks
of the marantz that's one of the best
slimline receivers we've tested yet
especially at the money the marantz NR
1508 is available now for five hundred
and fifty dollars
