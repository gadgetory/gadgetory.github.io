levels of the companies included in
today's lawsuits concern that ebook
sellers had reduced prices worked
together to eliminate competition among
stores selling ebooks ultimately
increasing prices for consumers now as a
result of this alleged conspiracy we
believe that consumers paid millions of
dollars more for us some of the most
popular titles during regular near
quarterly meetings we allege that
publishing company executives discuss
confidential business and competitive
matters including amazon's ebook
retailing practices as part of a
conspiracy to raise fix and stabilize
retail prices in addition we allege that
these publishers agree to impose a new
model which would enable them to cease
pricing authority from bookstores that
they entered into agreements to pay
apple a thirty percent commission on
books sold through its iBook store and
that they promised through contracts
including Most Favoured Nation
provisions that no other book retailer
would set a lower price now our
investigation even revealed that a CEO
allegedly went so far as to encourage an
ebook retailer to punish another
publisher for not engaging in these
illegal activities we allege that CEOs
of the publishers the mound the wretched
999 price point one executive said that
the goal is less to compete with Amazon
as to force it to accept a higher level
than 999 and yet another we've always
known that unless other publishers
follow us there's no chance of success
and getting Amazon to change its pricing
practices our complaint also quotes
apples then CEO steve jobs as saying the
customer pays a little more but that's
what you want and he's referring to the
publishers that's what you want anyway
as you can see we allege that these
exactly it is
knew full well what they were doing that
is taking steps together to make sure
the prices consumer paid for ebooks were
higher I want to stress agreements
between companies that are reached
unilaterally generally are legal and
appropriate however let me be clear when
companies get together and conspire to
enter into agreements that eliminate
price competition it crosses the line
this kind of agreement is illegal and
anti-competitive that's when the
Antitrust Division will take action and
that's what we've done today</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
