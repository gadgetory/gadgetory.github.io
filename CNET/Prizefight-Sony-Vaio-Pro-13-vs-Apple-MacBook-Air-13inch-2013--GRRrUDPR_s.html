I'm Brian Tong and this is a battle
between two of the top 13 inch laptops
we're slim is in it's a prize five
punch-out between Sony Vaio Pro 13 and
Apple's MacBook Air 13 now our judges
for this fight our senior editor Dan the
man Akram and senior associate editor
Scott the bottom line Stein and Brian
can't go wrong Tom will take all three
judges blind scores and average them out
to the nearest tenth each round the
final prize fight score will be an
average of all rounds using the same
system let's get it on
round 1 is designed Sony brings one of
the sleekest blade thin windows laptop
designs with its magnesium alloy body
that's light as air and a carbon fiber
construction that may not be as sturdy
as a MacBook but is more than half a
pound lighter at only 2.34 pounds its
1920 by 1080 resolution screen best the
air and it has a thinner bezel but its
hinge is not as solid and it definitely
feels a lot more flimsy now the MacBook
Air is still a very classic and iconic
design with its sturdy aluminum unibody
that's rock-solid with zero flex and a
smooth superior hinge that allows you to
open it with ease it still feels very
premium but it's getting a little dated
with a thicker bezel around its 1440 by
900 resolution screen both designs have
their pluses and minuses and we're
calling this a tie at for round two is
features these two laptops come with
different levels of CPU and RAM
configurations and they're very closely
matched systems with the same USB ports
and SD card reader slots you'll also
find a multi-touch trackpad and backlit
keyboards on both as well but what
separates Sony Vaio pro 13 from the
MacBook Air is its 1080p display that's
also a touch screen for full windows 8
support and it feels more and more
natural to interact with your screen
that way even while web browsing there's
a native full size HDMI port here NFC
capabilities and they include an
addition
a USB port on the power adapter as well
now Apple has always been very selective
about what it includes and it hurts them
here with no touchscreen you'll need a
dongle to get any video out without an
Apple TV and yes the faster 802 11 AC
Wi-Fi is here but you'll need a router
that supports it
now one benefit is that you can install
both Windows and the Mac OS on an Apple
machine but Sony crushes them here with
the 4.3 and Apple gets a three after
averaging two rounds the VAIO Pro leads
by seven tenths of a point round three
is performance Sony sent us a 1.5
gigahertz core i7 CPU with eight gigs of
RAM for our review model and the MacBook
Air we're using is loaded with their 1.3
gigahertz Core i5 processor with 4 gigs
of RAM now we know that's not exactly
equal but both bring the latest Intel
Haswell processor chipset now in our
performance test you can see that the
MacBook Air just tore through our
multimedia multitasking test and also
perform better in the iTunes encoding
test while the viol pro took the
Photoshop cs5 image processing test and
it was pretty much a push in our
handbrake multitasking test bottom line
these machines perform pretty similarly
between the two you won't see any major
speed gains from last year's ultrabooks
and other third-party benchmarks have
supported that as well we're calling
this round a tie at for next round is
battery life in our CNET video playback
drain test the sony vaio pro 13 clocked
in at an impressive eight hours and 53
minutes now sony gives you the option
for a $150 additional battery add-on if
you want
compare that to the MacBook Air 13 which
clocked in at a mind-boggling 14 hours
and 25 minutes of battery juice which
just can't be touched and is the new
industry standard Apple takes this round
with the perfect 5 and Sony gets a 4 so
after averaging 4 rounds Sony still
leads by just a hair the final round
that decides at all is value
these two machines are really closely
matched with core i7 options but this
will ultimately come down to your
preference Sony's vaio Pro 13 base model
with a core i5 processor starts at 1000
$249 and that includes the 1080p
touchscreen now Apple's MacBook Air
decided to shave off $100 off the
starting price of a 13-inch air with a
core i5 processor at 1099 dollars now we
know your price can start adding up with
customizations but Apple clearly has the
value edge right out of the gates for a
machine that lasts over 14 hours the
MacBook Air gets a 4.3 and the viol pro
13 gets a 3.7 so lets average out all
five rounds and in a throwdown where
Sony LED almost the entire time Apple
fought back hard in the last two rounds
and just edges out the Sony Vaio Pro 13
for point 1 to 4 and the MacBook Air 13
is your prize buy it winner this
battleground is still fierce and the
real decision might just come down to
which operating system you prefer i'm
brian tom thanks for watching and we'll
catch you guys next time for another
