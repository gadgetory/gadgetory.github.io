first look video of a twenty dollar
speaker it's the Logitech Z 50 yes
twenty dollars or around twenty dollars
anyway it is a single speaker Logitech
says it delivers ten watts of peak power
so it's got some kick to it for a small
speaker and I was curious to note just
how good it sounded for twenty dollars
it actually sounds not half bad the nice
thing about it is that it's very easy to
set up it comes with a integrated line
out cord it has a 3.5 millimeter jack
so plugs into your computer or a mobile
device such as a smartphone or tablet
and it does sound better than the
speakers that are integrated into
laptops and tablets and smartphones it
also plays a lot louder than you think
for its small size probably the one
drawback of it is it just doesn't have a
lot of base it's a small speaker also
it's worth noting that the driver sticks
out of the top it's exposed to the top
so you don't want to drop anything on
this it does look a little bit like a
pencil holder or a coffee cup that's
been split off at an angle on the top so
you might have an urge to stick a pen
inside it but you shouldn't do that
however due to its styling it does fit
in well on an office desk and doesn't
take up a lot of room and that really is
the appeal of the speaker that it is
small is simple to use and delivers ok
sound first price and for a lot of
people it will be a satisfying purchase
for that $20 I'm David Carr noise and
thats the Logitech Z 50 thanks for
watching
