nearly a decade he relies on a
ventilator has 24-hour nursing care and
can only communicate by typing up
messages with his eyes I can talk with
visitors but I can also schedule their
visits I can manage my own finances and
healthcare outside of the physical
paralysis pit I am still nearly as
independent and potent as before
diagnosis but while his body has failed
him his brain has not technology
companies are working to take advantage
of that brain power to help ALS patients
regain some control over their lives
basically we are able to take your
brainwaves and I use the headset to do
mental commands these headsets from
emotive have multiple sensors to detect
brainwaves you visualize scenes to
correspond with commands like left right
up and down for example thinking of a
hot air balloon when you want a
remote-control helicopter or cursor to
go up you recall the same scene to
trigger the same movement the best way
to train the system is to think of
sensory experiences so for example I've
thought of a hot air balloon and I not
only think of it going up but I feel the
wind against my face Accenture has
developed software to link the headset
with Philips smart appliances your
brainwaves navigate the cursor through
an app that controls the appliances it
has the potential to turn the Philips
hue lights on and off turn a Philips
smart television on and off to request
emergency medical services through
Philips lifeline and to also issue
pre-configured commands
this project is still in its early
stages
Accenture says there are no immediate
plans to make the system publicly
available this kind of presents the idea
that wearables could be used for complex
medical uses ALS is such a complicated
disease that they really need to find
out more about how to help different
people with this type of product if it
were to ever come to market
Melora says the technology would allow
ALS patients to regain some independence
technology cannot only enhance abilities
but restore lost abilities due to trauma
or disease so until medical science
catches up technology is the cure for
ALS and a way for the Lord to have
comfort a voice and a connection to the
outside world in San Francisco I'm Kara
