you a quick tour of the LG tone ultra
this is also referred to as the HBS 800
and it is the third generation of LG's
popular tone stereo Bluetooth headsets
this models more of a departure from the
previous two models it has a new design
a couple of extra features and LG has
partnered up with JBL to give it a JBL
sound signature so it does offer improve
sound some of the key differences in the
design the headset now is bent a little
bit so it rests more easily on your neck
this is designed to sit on your neck it
is a comfortable headset it also has
different shaped buttons the previous
model had all circular button so it was
a little bit harder to operate by feel
this one has friends and say call answer
and button that is shaped like a phone
and last but not least the cord has been
thickened up a bit as well as the little
piece that attaches it to the neck band
all in all it's a more sturdy design and
the cords don't tangle up as much
another small design worth mentioning is
the size of the LED light in previous
models that was a kind of a bright light
that pulsated and bothered a lot of
people LG has reduced the size of it so
it's only a small tiny light one of the
key feature additions of the headset is
noise canceling technology you flip a
little switch and you're supposed to get
some noise cancellation didn't really
work for me I really didn't notice the
difference but that is a new key feature
this model like other tone models the
tips adhere magnetically to the front of
the headset when you're not in use so
they store there and that works well it
really is a nice design in terms of
sound quality is improved this does
offer bigger bass although a little more
clarity so on all fuller richer sound
not a huge difference but definitely
noticeable and it does offer good sound
free in-ear bluetooth headphone so when
you add it all up the ultra is
definitely the best version of the tone
stereo bluetooth headsets out there but
the only problem is it's price tag right
now at launch its
going for right near its list price of a
hundred and thirty dollars when you have
the earlier versions going for closer to
fifty dollars it's hard to justify the
premium that you get for the added
features and better sound and the better
design but when it does come down in
price this will definitely be a
recommendable stereo Bluetooth headset
