the letters WT &amp;amp; F I'm Bridget Carey
this is your cnet update Google is now
the company alphabet which is the parent
company of Google in a strange and
unexpected move Google just renamed and
reorganized itself to better separate
the big wild idea projects like robots
and self-driving cars from the core
Google consumer products like search
youtube and android the bottom line is
that this doesn't change what Google
does rather it just changes how it's all
labeled for investors here's a quick
breakdown of Google's new alphabet soup
larry page and sergey brin the
cofounders of google are now in charge
of alphabet it's a holding company page
is CEO Brenda's president Google sits
under the alphabet umbrella sundar
pichai who was in charge of Google
products now gets a new snazzy title
he's CEO of Google he oversees all the
googly stuff Maps YouTube Chrome Android
and all the other stuff like the
ambitious future tech projects are being
moved aside into their own separate
companies and those people in charge
also will likely get nice big CEO titles
so what are some of those other
divisions that spawn from google you
have life science projects like the
glucose sensing contact lenses in calico
the california life company which does
anti aging research there's the X lab
that works on Google glass and
self-driving cars and delivery drones
and the project loon internet balloons
sidewalk labs aims to fix city
infrastructure there's all the robot
research being done with Boston Dynamics
and the investment arms the Google
capital and google ventures are
separated under this alphabet umbrella
of companies the Google Fiber high-speed
internet service is another thing maybe
the new self service project 5 will be
managed with that and there's nest the
maker of smart home gadgets like the
nest thermostat and the nest cam the
exact corporate structure will be
revealed in a few weeks the URL for this
new company alphabet is ABC XYZ it's
clever but that's also because alphabet
tom was taken by the car company BMW and
the twitter name alphabet is already
owned by a man in Ohio but Google is not
the only company that knows how to have
a little fun with letters in the URL if
you go to ABC WTF it redirects to
Microsoft's Bing nice little zing for
Bing that's it for this tech news update
there's more to dive into its cnet com
from our studios in New York I'm Bridget
