at two new entries into Sheba's click
series we've got the click two and the
click two Pro now these are both
detachable hybrids in the click two
you've got an intel pentium CP you've
got a big 13 inch screen even though
it's a 1366 by 768 screen and you've got
the traditional sort of switch that you
move over and then you pop the screen
off like this and it's a little thick
and hefty but it's a lower-priced bigger
screen hybrid and you don't really see a
lot of those and the quarter that clicks
down on here and then you've got a full
keyboard and touchpad and of course it
can fold down like a laptop to carry
around with you I think much more
interesting is the satellite click to
pro this has got a full 1080p screen
it's much thinner it's lighter Core i5
or Core i7 and I like how the screen
detaches you just give it a little
gentle push down and then it comes up
like this and then you've got a
reasonably thin full 1080p Core i5 4
core i7 13 inch tablet that again just
pops right on here and then you have got
a keyboard and a touchpad and the more
expensive pro version the keyboard is
backlit and you can even get an optional
extra hard drive and battery in here if
you upgrade to some of the more
expensive versions and again the whole
thing folds down to you know a little
bit heavy but a reasonably sized 13 inch
laptop that you could carry around with
you now the click to starts at 586 and
the more expensive click to pro is going
to start a little bit north of $1000 I'm
Dan Ackman and that is the new Toshiba
click - and click - pro</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
