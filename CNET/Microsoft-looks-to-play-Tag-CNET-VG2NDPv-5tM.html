washington i'm here with brent ingram
who is a program manager with microsoft
tag britain what is tagged so tag is a
high-capacity color bar code that allows
you to link various information in the
real world over to information that
would be in the virtual world or on the
internet so for example is what you're
seeing here is various types of tags
that we use on magazines or products or
response cards and those sorts of things
so I simply take any smart phone or
camera enabled phone even down to a
feature phone wave it over the bar code
that's there and you'll see that it
actually will then take me to a set of
information that is related to the
product that I just scanned in this case
Windows Vista and discussing about our
red campaign that we have with Microsoft
similarly like I said it works with any
phone so you take a common phone that
you might see today such as an apple
iphone and you wave it over a magazine
article for example on golfing and golf
digest and what you'll find is is that
will actually go and load an immersive
experience that is on YouTube and so
therefore what it's doing now is
basically taking this article and making
its tend to a much broader and richer
experience with the consumer so suddenly
i can start viewing information that
Golf Digest can update in real time they
can change they can actually correct
things that were in the article all
those sorts of things and actually make
the immersive experience of a hard
magazine much more interactive and much
more changeable over time and where the
kinds of places you'd find tags today so
for example in Amsterdam you'll see tags
on train stops denoting information you
can get about the train as well as other
entertainment information while you're
waiting on the train in magazines and
turkey for example you'll see a common
magazine that's a very popular in Turkey
where suddenly they're actually linking
articles that they have over with tags
to interact with the consumer for for
example their local TV Guide and linking
that to various things that might be
about different shows that are on TV
where you can basically link over to you
know things that might actually discuss
more about that show and those sorts of
things and so basically all people need
to do is download
a small piece of software and then they
can scan tags wherever they encounter
them yeah you know we just saw recently
in people there was a an ad that was run
by Dodge where they were trying to give
away a dodge caravan and they're
wondering wondering who was interested
in that new one and they just placed
this ad and suddenly they had a direct
interaction with their consumers are on
that campaign great thanks for it thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
