and we're going to take a quick look
today at the Kyocera torque from Sprint
now the torque is a smart phone but it
combines Kia Sarah's rugged Duras series
so as you see it's a it has a rubber
exterior and it's ultra tough it's
waterproof so you could dunk it into a
meter of water up to 30 minutes
if fulfills military grade specs for
ruggedness and it comes with a 4-inch
Gorilla Glass vga touchscreen its kia
service first
LTE handset in the US and as you can see
it runs on android 4.0 Ice Cream
Sandwich on the bottom here you see
these two dual dual speakers they're
very loud and let's see an example of
how loud it could get right here TED
talks are recorded live at the TED
conference this episode features the
inventor of the World Wide Web so as you
can see it's very loud and it's a it's
very good because of when you use Direct
Connect which is right here for from
Sprint and you use push-to-talk you
could hear someone in a very loud
environment now if you don't want sprint
Direct Connect you could customize this
button to do something else like launch
certain apps it also comes with a five
megapixel camera and a 1.3 megapixel
camera in the front there's also NFC a
1.2 gigahertz dual-core processor inside
and a 2 point 5 ampere hour battery it's
set to launch in early March but the
price is unknown so that's pretty much
it this is the Kyocera torque from
sprint and I'm Lin from scenic</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
