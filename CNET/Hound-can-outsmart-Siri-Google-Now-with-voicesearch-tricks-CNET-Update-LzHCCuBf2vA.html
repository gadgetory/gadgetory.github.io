that could be smarter I'm Bridget Carey
this is your C net update it seems
another voice assistant is set on
outsmarting Siri Cortana and Google now
a new app called hound has some new
voice search tricks that blow Siri and
Google now away it's a free app made by
the company sound hound and what makes
it different is that it can handle
multiple layers of a spoken question
don't just ask for a nearby hotel ask
for which hotels are available in a
certain place on a certain day at a max
cost and if it's pet friendly try that
on an Android or iPhone and you can get
a useless search result this can be
applied to complex restaurant hunts or
you can also use it to request an uber
car ride and it'll tell you the distance
time and estimated cost of the trip
before you even book it but hound will
not be bused in every situation asked
for sports scores and Siri shines
because it breaks down the score by
quarter ask for directions and hound
loses because it does not have public
transit advice and for generic trivia
Google now speaks the answer whereas
hound just pulls off a Wikipedia page
and also on the topic of apps the Google
Maps just got a little better for
iPhones the Maps app now lets you add a
stop along your current route it was an
Android for several months now but not
all road adventures have been smooth
lately for Google one of Google's
self-driving Lexus cars is accepting
blame in a minor crash and it's the
first time the car itself is at fault
well partial faults at least the
accident happened last month involving a
bus the Google car was trying to move
into another Lane after signaling and
waiting for an opening it assumed a bus
coming would yield to let it in but that
did not happen
the car hit the side of the bus
meanwhile another Silicon Valley drama
the battle continues between Apple and
law enforcement over requests to unlock
iPhones on Tuesday Apple in the Federal
Bureau of Investigation made arguments
before a congressional panel regarding
the order to force Apple to help the FBI
break into the iPhone belonging to
one of the San Bernardino shooters FBI
director James Comey said his team has
done everything they know of in their
power to unlock this phone before they
took it this far
Apple argues that this issue should be
determined by Congress and lawmakers
rather than by the courts with a warrant
that's based on a very old statue but
what could help Apple's argument is
another case that happened the day prior
about a different iPhone a New York
judge ruled that the government had no
right to force Apple to unlock an iPhone
that belongs to a drug dealer and that
may strengthen Apple's argument against
doing it for the FBI that's it for this
