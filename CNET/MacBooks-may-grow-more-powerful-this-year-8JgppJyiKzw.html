year when Apple introduced its latest
line of macbook pros it definitely got a
reaction there was USBC everywhere and a
touch panel instead of function keys
then there was the news the macbook pro
topped out at 16 gigabytes of ram which
is odd because a pro laptop Jeff tons of
RAM to handle Pro tasks that limit might
change according to KGI Securities
analyst ming-chi kuo Apple will
introduce a 15-inch MacBook with 32
gigabytes of RAM in the fourth quarter
of this year quo did not save this
laptop is a part of the macbook pro line
but that is likely Cole also says the 13
and 15 inch macbook pros will get
Intel's latest generation of processors
in the third quarter of 2017 what about
that really really thin 12 inch macbook
any updates on that yep the analyst says
the 12 inch macbook is scheduled for a
refresh in the second quarter with new
processors and more RAM so what is it
likelihood that these predictions will
come true ming-chi Kuo has a very good
track record when it comes to this kind
of thing quote accurately predicted the
2016 release of a 4-inch iPhone that was
the iPhone se he also predicted the
Apple watch in two sizes in 2014 Apple's
Phil Schiller has explained the reason
why the current generation of macbook
pros do not have the option of 32
gigabytes of RAM he said it would
consume too much power kuo says the
15-inch MacBook would feature a
significant redesign put those two
things together and maybe a more
powerful macbook pro is in the cards
later this year for more information
