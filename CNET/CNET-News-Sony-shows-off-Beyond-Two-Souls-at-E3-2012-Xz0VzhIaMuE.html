Dream's next title for playstation 3 and
this new project is called beyond
death is the biggest mystery of mankind
what will happen after we die is
something no one knows we'll have our
hopes our fears our doubts but what's on
the other side remains unknown Jodie
Holmes knows a little bit more about all
this damn you and I as far as she
remembers she has always felt linked
with an invisible entity some presence
around her spirits or ghosts she doesn't
really know something living between our
world and the other side beyond tells
Jodi's story over 15 years of a life we
will see a growing evolving learning to
leave with a difference and discovering
more about what's beyond for the first
time in a video game we will leave the
life of a character go with us through
happy and difficult times and helped her
to become who she is we have much to
reveal about the game in the coming
months but today I want to share with
you a very important element of beyond

talented young actress someone who could
embody beyond lead role in a very unique
way I am proud to announce that Judy

game and of course everything runs in
real time man
