here with the Panasonic TCL e60 this is
a LCD TV actually it's one of the
entry-level ones in Panasonic's line but
it's the very first Panasonic LCD LED TV
in the last couple years that we can
really recommend this TV is available in
a forty to a 50 a 58 and a 65 inch size
this video review will apply to all of
them start with the design this TV is
extremely minimalist it really kind of
tries to blend into the room the edge
around the screen is exceedingly thin
like a lot of the modern LED TVs today
you look at it from the side the cabinet
is also really thin I also appreciate
the low profile that keeps the TV pretty
compact above the stand the stand
doesn't offer any swivel the only real
accent is a small strip of transparent
plastic all told one of the most
understated TVs we've seen the features
on the e60 are pretty middle-of-the-road
it does include a smart TV suite however
that has Panasonic's typical excellent
selection of content that includes
Netflix Amazon Instant Video and pretty
much every other major service except
for HBO GO which is a Samsung exclusive
wasn't a big fan of the design of the
Smart TV however it's a little bit busy
there's multiple pages but getting those
multiple pages isn't as intuitive as I'd
like to see you can design your own page
and put the kind of apps that you want
on that page the customization is really
nice but all told it's a step behind the
Smart TV Suites of LG and Samsung this
TV is also a hundred twenty Hertz model
that means it does have smoothing unlike
some of the other so-called hundred
twenty Hertz models on sale today in
addition to smoothing there's also a
wide range of picture adjustments
although we found that the basic
controls work relatively well in this
set on the side panel affined three HDMI
two USB and a single analog input which
is pretty typical for this range of
television the thing we really liked
about the mid-price East 60 was its
picture quality this LED TV delivers a
nice deep inky shade of black which
again among TVs at this price range is
relatively rare
we also appreciated the nice bright room
picture on this television if you have a
lot of light in your room it's screen
rejects reflections relatively well that
preserves those nice deep black levels
color and video processing we're also
very good although not great it does of
course suffer the off angle and slight
uniformity issues that plagued some LED
TVs but again not bad compared to the
crop of course compared to a plasma TV
the off angle and uniformity isn't
perfect but
again very good for an LED TV the one
flying this TVs performance that doesn't
have anything to it the picture is sound
quality it's really among the worst
sounding TVs we've heard but again at
this price you can afford to add an
external sound system and not be too far
behind that's a quick look at
Panasonic's TCL e 6 TL EDTV
