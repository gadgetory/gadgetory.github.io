outside but how about on the inside
let's find out I'm Bill Detweiler and
this is cracking open the Apple watch
comes in three different models two
different sizes and six different
finishes there are more than a dozen
different bands and prices range from
three hundred and forty-nine dollars all
the way up to the ridiculous seventeen
thousand dollars for the gold versions
our test unit was a 42 millimeter
stainless steel model with a black sport
band it measured 42 millimeters high
just under 36 millimeters wide and 10
and a half millimeters thick it weighs a
very light 50 grams now the front panel
on this model is made from sapphire
crystal compared to ionics glass on the
aluminum bodied sport model along the
right edge there's a digital crown and
side button on the back are the lenses
for the heart rate sensor along the edge
here we find the speaker and microphone
there are also release buttons for the
band and a diagnostic port is hidden
behind a small metal panel which is
visible only when you remove the band
now that we've looked at the outside of
the Apple watch let's get to the fun
part and crack it open to get inside the
Apple watch we need to remove the
display so using a microwavable heating
pad or other heat source will warm the
panel just enough to loosen the adhesive
between it and the watch body then using
a thin tool we'll gently pry up on the
display working our way along the edges
we'll be very careful here not to insert
the tool too far and damage the thin
cables to connect the display to the
watch now to completely separate the
display from the watch we'll need to
remove a metal clip that covers the
display cable connectors and then detach
the cables we now have our first real
look inside the Apple watch mounted
along the top of the watch next to the
digital crown is Apple's tactic engine
which provides the haptic feedback you
feel on your wrist hidden under the
display contact
is the speaker and along the bottom of
the watch is the lithium-ion battery
underneath all of these components is
the Apple s1 package and the sensors for
the heartrate monitor once it's
disconnected we can remove the battery
which is held in place with a tiny bit
of adhesive now at this point I'm going
to stop our teardown unfortunately many
of the remaining components are both
very fragile and glued to the watch body
the risk of damaging them during removal
is very hot and I want to put this watch
back together in working order and even
if I were to remove the side button
contact digital crown encoder or the
diagnostic port contacts we couldn't
really see the brains of the watch the
motherboard Apple's new s1 system in
package or sip and most of the other ICS
are encapsulated in a packaging compound
which we really can't remove likewise
sensors for the heart rate monitor are
mounted under the s1 package and there's
not a way to get to them without
destroying the watch so what does our
teardown tell us about Apple's new
wearable well for starters it's a very
well made device parts or machine well
the joints are tied and it just feels
very solid now second it's difficult but
not impossible to get inside the case
and some of the components such as the
battery can be removed and replaced and
I suspect it won't be long before
cracked screens can be replaced at the
Apple store on the flipside like most
Apple products these days the watch
wasn't made to be DIY serviceable and
there's really no way to upgrade it when
the new models come out next year if
they do this one is just going to be
outdated
lastly Apple used a lot of cool tech
inside the watch thanks to the analysis
of companies such as chip works we know
that there's a brand new
STMicroelectronics 6 axis gyro scope in
it there are also at least 30 components
mounted to the s1 sip which measures a
mere 26 millimeters by 28 millimeters
and the entire s1 package is
encapsulated which is also unique
now I'm not sure I would consider this
watch buying jewelry but it's definitely
a fine piece of tech now for more
