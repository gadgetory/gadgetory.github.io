iPhone need a vacation
well Virgin Mobile's here for you the
prepaid mobile carrier is selling one
year of unlimited service for just one
dollar that is if you buy an iPhone and
only an iPhone because Virgin Mobile
announced it is only going to sell
iPhones from now on oh and as for that
vacation that year of service now comes
with a free companion plane ticket on a
round-trip flight to the UK on Virgin
Atlantic a one night stay at a virgin
hotel along with other discounts on
Virgin related flights products and
events that's right
the phone company is offering travel and
accommodations and practically free
unlimited talk and data just to get your
business the cheap year of service is a
promotion that ends in July but after
that new and existing customers can
still get half a year of service for $1
just as long as customers buy an iPhone
buy Virgin Mobile going all-in on the
iPhone the carrier is targeting a
wealthier customer than competitors
virgin will also sell used iPhones and
the cheapest will be priced at $200 some
retail partners will keep selling
Android phones due to their existing
agreements but that's going to be phased
out this move also gets Virgin Mobile
inside Apple it's the first time a
prepaid carrier has been a choice inside
of Apple's retail store now to get the
$1 a year service deal you have to buy
an iPhone from an Apple store or through
virgins website after the first year is
up unlimited service is going to cost
$50 a month but after two years if a
customer wants to buy another iPhone
they could snag another half a year of
service for $1 it's a great time to be a
wireless customer because carriers are
making crazy offers to win your business
virgin is owned by Sprint and last week
Sprint launched a promotion for June
giving new customers a free year of
unlimited data service but the deal is
only offered online I'm Bridget Carey
