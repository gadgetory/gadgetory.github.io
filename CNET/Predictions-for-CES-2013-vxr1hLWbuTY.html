episode of top five we're giving you an
inside look at what our cnet editors are
expecting to encounter at the 2013
consumer electronics show CES these are
the trends in tech that will set the
tone for the whole industry for the rest
of the year and for each trend we're
going to hear from one of our expert
cnet editors so let's get started with
cnet's top 5 predictions for CES 2013
counter down by cnet's best and
brightest I'm David Connolly starting
things off at number 5 lightning
accessories now that Apple has
redesigned the connection on the iphone
and ipad it seems likely that we're
going to see a new wave of all the
accessories that go with them car
charger speakers adapters there are a
lot of accessories out there and the
companies that make them all want to
stay up to date i'm eric franklin coming
in with number for android tablets yeah
i know big surprise but with the
popularity of products like the kindle
fire nexus 7 everyone except for Apple
and Microsoft everyone wants to release
the next big Android tablet I think
we'll see a range of different sizes
from seven maybe even up to 13 inches
most targeting the 200 to 400 ella price
range i'm scott stein and coming in at
number three apps it seems that every
product now comes with its own app
whether it's a TV or home stereo or
maybe a toaster we're seeing an
increasing amount of products that have
their own companion app they're not
always good but a lot of them are
interesting so whether you want to use
your smartphone as a TV remote or just
the EQ on your stereo with your tablet
manufacturers are making sure that
there's an app for everything they make
and now that there are more tablets and
phones and ever expect that to be a big
trend at the CES i'm at miskovic with
number two streaming everything whether
it's Bluetooth or airplay speakers or
some new way to plug Netflix into your
TV we're seeing more and more wireless
technologies for the living room and
I'll be surprised if we don't hear
something new for me the Roku or maybe
Google TV or maybe even an update to
last year's award winning simple TV
product for cord cutters but before we
get to number 1 i'm jessica doll court
with a prediction for something we
probably won't actually see much of its
CES those really whiz-bang smart
with Mobile World Congress just a month
after CES I expect that most phone
makers will save their marquee
announcements until then I'm sure we'll
see more than a few phones at CES but I
wouldn't hold my breath for a parade of
astounding flagship products and finally
I'm David Katz mar with our number one
prediction for CES OLED and 4k
televisions deja vu you say well yeah TV
news from CES a year ago is dominated by
these technologies to but this time TV
makers are serial they promise OLED is
destined to replace LCD and Plasma
someday but for 2013 we expect these
amazing TVs to cost around 10 grand if
they come out and 4k is the next 1080p
but it only makes a difference on 80
inch plus screens and there's no 4k
content today yay the future so there
you have it cnet's top 5 predictions for
the 2013 Consumer Electronics Show
straight from our cnet editors head over
to CES cnet com for all of our preview
coverage and watch that page go
ballistic as our live CES coverage rolls
out on January eighth until then I'm
