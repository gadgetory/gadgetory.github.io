deciding between the two phones and the
camera is your main priority is the 10
worth the extra money
to find out we took them for a tour with
Chinatown alleyway tours in San
Francisco we left the cameras on default
settings and shot the video in 4k at 30
frames per second now bear in mind that
the screen you're viewing this on will
make a difference in how you perceive
the images
if you're looking at photos on the
phones they're going to look nicer on
the 10 because of that oled screen that
doesn't mean they're actually better
though off the phones it's hard to
distinguish photos between the two
that's because the phones share the same
wide-angle lens the main difference is
the telephoto lens on the 10 it's
slightly faster than the 8 plus and has
optical image stabilization
both phones used that telephoto lens for
portrait mode to give a blurred
background effect similar to what you'll
find on a DSLR portraits look great on
both phones but if you look closely the
10 captures more detail you'll notice it
here in his beard and here in her hair
while the front-facing cameras on both
phones have the same basic specs the 10
adds portrait mode for selfies by
creating a depth map of your face with
cameras and sensors the 10 can isolate
your face and blur out the background
the portrait mode effect is not as
accurate as the main camera but it's
still a good option to have if you take
a lot of selfies
apart from portrait mode the telephoto
lens is also used for zoom in daylight
at 2x it's hard to spot the difference
between the two but in video the
stabilization makes a noticeable
difference especially when you're moving
when the sun goes down both phones are
still similar for most shots at 2x and
viewing photos at a reduced
magnification it's hard to notice much
difference if you look closer though you
do see a difference in sharpness and
detail like this shot on the bar
aquarium for video it's hard to notice
any big differences between the two
they're good for phone cameras but still
do show a lot of noise in low light
we're the 10 really shines is for
low-light portrait mode even in the dark
Lexi's face looks sharp and well lit on
the 10 the 8 plus is darker and more
grainy for video if your hardly moving
the stabilization won't make that much
of a difference going into this we
expected there to be a bigger difference
between the 10 and the 8 plus but it
turns out it's not a huge jump in image
quality between the two if you're a fan
of portrait mode the 10 does a slightly
better job especially in low light and
it's the only iPhone that lets you do it
on the front camera but it's at least a
$200 difference in price between the two
which seems like a high price to pay if
your main interest is the camera but of
course that's not the only upgrade
you're getting if you choose a 10
time for some real talk you found out
exactly what we have to say about these
two cameras sir it's time for you to
