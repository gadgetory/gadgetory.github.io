and all the other drones that are out
there is the intel realsense module
using an intel realsense camera and an
intel cpu with the collision avoidance
technology we've developed with
ascending technologies this drone goes
everywhere it goes in the woods it grows
around trees it can navigate any
obstacle this is the world's most
advanced collision avoidance system in a
consumer drone it's designed for real
outdoor experiences it's light it's
portable it goes in the backpack and it
truly understands its environment but
it's one thing to see a drone up on a
pedestal that's easy it's another to see
it in action what we've done again is
built equivalent of an outdoor of GPS
inside then we mocked up a short
mountain bike trail I challenged our
demo team to prove that the unique drone
can follow a rider even when confronted
obstacles like fake trees so what you
see is the drone not being piloted by
anybody but simply optically following
the biker and now it's in the lead mode
you'll see the drones actually in front
of the biker avoiding the trees now as
the biker gets around to the end of his
course you'll see the drone
automatically just Waits and flips and
does into follow-me mode now a drone of
that real sense would have no way to
avoid these obstacles and to capture the
image real time but this drone is
different and it can react to obstacles
real time so let's see what happens if
we put out a real-time obstacle you see
that drone was able to stop and wait and
go around that obstacle as well
following the rider all the time
any other commercial drone out there
would have crashed into a tree</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
