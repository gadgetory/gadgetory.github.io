G watch are these are really nice smart
watches that share one common problem
they don't have GPS an essential feature
for many runners and cyclists sure
there's the GPS equipped Sony SmartWatch
3 but that suffers from poor battery
life that's where the garmin vivoactive
comes in this is part SmartWatch part
activity tracker and part GPS sport
watch it can display notifications for
things like incoming calls text messages
emails and app and calendar alerts from
your smart phone it can also track the
steps you take each day distance
traveled calories burned and your sleep
at night on top of all that it uses the
GPS and other sensors to measure your
pace distance speed and more while
running biking and even swimming there's
even an app store called connect IQ that
allows you to install third-party apps
and widgets the thing I really like
about the vivoactive is the slim design
the device is incredibly lightweight
coming at only 38 grams and you barely
notice it on your wrist even with that
slim design and an always-on color
display the battery life is really good
Garmin claims you will get up to three
weeks in watch mode or up to ten hours
with an active GPS signal but I saw
around seven to nine days of usage but
that included three 30-minute runs with
the GPS enabled well there's a lot to
like with the vivoactive there's still a
lot that needs to be fixed the Garmin
app is dated especially when it comes to
sleep tracking and the selection of
third-party apps in the connect IQ store
is lacking I also found that the watch
software to be rather sluggish and my
phone randomly disconnect and on
occasion the watch would completely
freeze forcing me to restart it the
music controls are also disappointing
while you can pause play and skip songs
it doesn't show you the title or the
artist of the song playing which most
smartwatches do these days all in all
the vivoactive has potential but it
still has a ways to go luckily a lot of
these problems can be fixed with feature
software updates the garmin vivoactive
is available now for $250 in the US for
more information be sure to check out my
full review over at cnet.com I'm Dan
Graz never seen it and that was a first
look at the garmin vivoactive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
