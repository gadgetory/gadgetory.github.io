years or so it really seems cheap and
small and petty to run down their duds
oh boy is it fun
I'm Brian Cooley with top 5 Apple flops
ranking these is real subjective so I
went the way you would let's rank them
by how much you can get for them on eBay
here we go
the number 5 Apple flop is the Newton OS
message pads this is gonna raise hackles
since descendants iPhone and iPad are
now Apple's biggest business but Apple
made like 6 models of the message pad
and Motorola made some and sharp took a
whack Adam and nobody could get it right
it was just this slow-motion disaster I
recall when these were new and they were
scorned everywhere and didn't they have
Newton's stores too what a mess
price-wise these don't fetch a lot 30 to
50 bucks for one on eBay number for the
Mac g4 cube we've never seen a computer
like this and it's short time in
production keeps it that way this silent
fanless monolith with a toaster slot on
top for CDs was real different but
thanks for that odd shape you couldn't
really put any expansion cards in it
back at a time when you actually cared
about such things and it was pricey
about 200 bucks more than a
conventionally shaped Mac that had
similar performance oh and the cases
often cracked which is really annoying
on a machine you pay top dollar for for
its looks they made about a hundred and
fifty thousand of these so they aren't
real hard to find on eBay
and they seem to fetch about a hundred
or two hundred bucks number two the
Pippin recall this one it was produced
with Bandai of Japan rolled out around
96 as a game console with a light
version of system 7 on it as its OS it
was gutless it was damn near nothing to
run on it in terms of titles and the
price was like 600 bucks about 850 in
today's dollars 42,000 or so were made
eBay prices top out around 400 bucks or
so for a really clean unit number two is
the 20th anniversary Mac it was one of
the first things Steve Jobs killed when
he came back to the company and I
suspect he did it
standing inside a pentagram because this
thing is so not him like all crap
labeled executive it's full of form over
function for $7,500 over ten thousand
bucks in today's money you'd get it all
in one design okay kind of cool with a
small 12 inch display and beyond that
not much interesting oh there was a Joey
pouch disc tray in front and buttons on
the front panel arranged for looks
instead of works the whole thing came
off like sharper image had a one-night
stand with Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen and the 20th
anniversary Mac was star-crossed from
the beginning it launched in 1997
Apple's 21st year that said you seem to
be able to get about 700 bucks for a
good complete one on eBay before I take
you the number one Apple flop ranked by
eBay price let's consider one so awful
and so unimportant it doesn't even
deserve a true spot on the list that
damn round USB puck mouse from the
original iMac totally round so you never
knew which way to point it size so only
a raccoon could articulate it and just
ugly with that bad late 90s semi
translucent plastic with Jolly Rancher
color accents this thing was a mess
I found a basket of 20 of them on eBay
for 35 bucks overpriced my number one
Apple flop Macintosh TV I'd actually
forgotten about this this was the first
black Mac it was basically a Mac
performer that had a Sony Trinitron
television bolted to it and a cable
tuner inside you could use it as a
computer or switch to watching TV but
you couldn't watch TV in a window or
anything cool like that
it made a mockery of the word
integration about 10,000 were made so
there's a handful of them sticking up
eBay D given day at around $800 now for
the brighter side of life don't miss my
other companion video to this top 5
