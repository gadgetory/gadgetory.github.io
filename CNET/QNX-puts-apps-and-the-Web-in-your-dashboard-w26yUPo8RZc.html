with cnet com I'm on the floor of CES
2012 behind the wheel of a Porsche 911
Carrera but I'm not here to talk about
the car i'm here to talk about the
technology and the dashboard this is Q a
nexus car to applications platform and
it's basically their vision for what car
technology of the future is going to
look like so what we're starting with
here is an all digital dashboard we've
got a touch screen here in the center
that's get applications built into it
communications it's very similar to what
you've seen in the QX is parent company
blackberry playbook so we've got our
applications here pretty much any app
that you could run on a blackberry
playbook you'd be able to run here as
long as the vehicles not moving moving
on we've got this sort of all digital
instrument cluster that's completely
configurable you can set it up to a
track mode and sort of show like a race
track they basically swapped this whole
thing out with a big LCD one of the next
interesting things that they've done is
they've taken all of the hassle out of
bluetooth pairing all you have to do is
take an NFC equip phone drop it into a
certain point on the car and it will
automatically handle all the pairing for
you now once you're paired and talking
they've taken all the sort of Machinists
out of voice communications what really
call their ultra HD audio technology now
that's actually CD quality phone
conversations that you can have in
stereo I've actually got a demo earlier
where a gentleman like walked back and
forth and we can hear the voice
traveling back and forth across the car
now what's interesting about that is you
can then you that same protocol for
audio streaming so it's not just for
voice it's also for audio and simplify
things for that technology in the future
finally if you look back behind me we've
got a couple of tablets here in the back
seats they're connected to the dashboard
and by extension connected to the
internet so you can do things like
stream audio stream video play games
from these things and even skype video
conference from the high speed internet
connection that's built into the car
this is just a proof of concept it's a
basically a bunch of really cool things
that we can hope to see from q1 next
they're working with oems to sort of
bring this thing to the car of the
future and we're looking forward to it
