terranea resort in Rancho Palos Verdes
California near Los Angeles for the all
things digital conference which kicks
off in just a little bit obviously
everyone's looking forward to hearing
what Steve Ballmer Steve Jobs and others
have to say but one of the things that
attendees also look forward to each year
is the schwag bag of goodies that all
conference attendees get so let's take a
look at what's inside this year so
overall I have to say there's not quite
as much that's going to make you oh and
AH this year the bag is pretty cool it's
a nice little d8 bag here but what's
inside is not as much tech gear as in
some years past probably the biggest
techie thing we've got as I open this up
here is the insignia which is best buy's
brand child locator so this is a little
gadget that you can use to find your
child I suppose so that could be hot for
some folks I suppose we've got a pen the
all things D pen and that's right here
natal we find out that Microsoft's
indeed going to show us project natal as
we expected that's going to be tomorrow
morning wednesday june second from 935
to 945 and also it says that attendees
will get some sort of special gift
compliments of microsoft so could be an
xbox we'll have to wait and see we got a
notebook the folks that know KN 0 are
debuting their product this year it
doesn't look like they're necessarily
giving it away it says that guarantees
you placement at the top of the list to
purchase a no product so a little
different than getting it but at least
if you want it you can be among the
first to have it we have a pamphlet from
AMD about their vision processor another
pen from NYS e-- euronext we've got a
flash drive from comcast and let's see
some sunscreen always good in the sunny
Southern California on the other side we
have a couple books we've got the mirror
lit test from Jeffrey hazelett we have
Lonely Planet's thousand ultimate
experiences we have a wine chiller bag
and a recyclable or reusable rather
shopping bag perhaps the most
interesting thing is from AOL they're
doing customized personalized chuck
taylor converse shoes so we don't have
those yet but we have the card to fill
it out so i'll have to get back to you
on what the actual converse look like
and then of course last but not least
the conference t-shirt so you know in
past years there's been a flip camera
like the one I'm using to film this with
promises of the plastic logic ereader
other goodies bluetooth headsets guitar
hero so perhaps not as high on the fun
you know but we are still coming out on
a recession for cnet amina freed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
