this is a new personalized and
intelligent user interface as I
mentioned before our list of channels
and on-demand programming continues to
grow dramatically in turn we know our
user experience must evolve that's why
we'll start rolling out our next
generation you I in a phased approach
beginning later this quarter we want to
make sure that we create a simple yet
intelligent user interface what this
means is we're now able to shape the
user interface using various data inputs
as part of our phase launches this year
our new interface will continue to get
more and more personal it will be able
to tailor in real time the types of
programming with which you're presented
it'll do this by using information like
previous viewing habits including time
of day day of week location popularity
to create a more personalized experience
and it all starts with my TV if you have
a favorite TV show or movie just tell us
and then you'll never have to hunt for
it again is it'll be front and center in
my TV if you had to stop in the middle
of one of your favorite shows you don't
need to worry because my TV will have it
ready for you to finish playback and as
my TV grows you'll see the addition of
recommended content based on your
viewing preferences over time we'll add
intelligence to show you content based
on the time of day and your viewing
device and my TV will become your go-to
spot to find all of your content in one
place popular content will also be
presented as an option to make sure you
never miss a must-see event</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
