making the case for president barack
obama to grant him a pardon arguing that
the information he shared about
government surveillance programs was the
moral and ethical ii right thing to do
Snowden explained his case in an
interview with The Guardian adding that
his actions encouraged others to speak
out against government outreach and that
he didn't hurt anyone the American Civil
Liberties Union and Amnesty
International also launched a campaign
to push the Obama administration to
pardon him and the petition comes the
same week as the release of the Oliver
Stone biopic on the NSA whistleblower
starring Joseph gordon-levitt as Snowden
shailene woodley as his girlfriend
Lindsay Mills and Zachary Quinto as
guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald at
the New York City movie premiere we
asked the stars with a thought of their
real life counterparts and their views
now on technology and privacy Gordon
Levitt said he would like to see Snowden
pardoned me personally I would like to
see that yeah I know that he would love
to come home I think a lot of folks and
I understand why I think that he was
sort of out to get America or wanted to
undermine America what I what I found
the more I got to know him was it was
out of a love for his country that the
truth is the NSA was breaking certain
laws and lying to the American people
that really go against everything that's
so beautiful about our country you know
and he risked his life to try to stand
up against it Stone said that he didn't
make the movie to help Snowden but he
also wants to see him pardoned I have no
political motive it'd be nice to see it
Quinto spoke about what impressed him on
plane journalists Greenwald I think he's
unimpeachably intelligent and I think
he's he's unafraid to step up to like in
this case the Guardian right
the corporate structure in order to
fight for what he believes in and and
and that was the thing that I really
wanted to because in this situation
where they were so vulnerable they
didn't know how at risk they were they
didn't know each other all that well you
know there's a an implicit trust that
has to be cultivated in those
relationships working on the movie also
got cast thinking about privacy issues
but Woodley says she's not paranoid
about it you actively want to see change
you have to be empowered through
awareness and so paranoia leads to
complaining and I feel like awareness
leads to empowerment which activates you
to create a change I'm Bridget Carey you
can stay on top of the biggest stories
