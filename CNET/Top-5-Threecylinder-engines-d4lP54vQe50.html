engines of the 80s and early 90s you
know they were one thing crap nobody
uses the words too bad when they see a
rusted-out Geo Metro Subaru justy or
Daihatsu charade but threes are back
i'm brian coolie here with the top five
three cylinder engines and current
production that are really Wow's on the
road we're gonna rank these by their
specific output in other words how much
power they crank out per liter here we
go number five is the 2014 Mitsubishi
Mirage yeah they're still around sixty
two horsepower per liter it's a 1.2
liter those 74 horsepower that 40 mpg
average with a stick is quite good but
beyond that nothing about it tries to be
anything other than stingy
so it's fittingly at the bottom of our
list number for the 2014 smart for 270
horsepower per liter now smart must love
this they're not at the bottom of a list
for once that's 70 horse out of its one
liter engine sadly gets worse mpg
however then the Mitsu gets out of a
larger engine the smart does 36 average
this by the way is perhaps the oldest 3
cylinder on the market for 2's have had
an inline 3 since launch back in 1998
now there is a BRABUS edition of the
smart that eats up another handful of
horsepower but not enough to move it to
number 3 which is the 2014 Mini Cooper
91 horse per liter here we have the
veritable Big Boi of our group a
relatively portly one and a half liter
engine but just three cylinders 136
horsepower thanks to a turbo and direct
injection with a stick your average mpg
is 34 incidentally this is the same
basic engine found in the very different
BMW i8 but in that car it's been hotted
up to 228 horsepower but it's part of a
hybrid system so that's another list
number two is the 2014 Opel Adam 115
horse per liter now our US viewers won't
know what I'm talking about but this is
in a nutshell a hot-looking on
to a Fiat 500 made by the Opel division
of General Motors it's one liter three
uses high-compression direct injection
and a turbo to break the three-digit
mark at 115 horse per liter on-demand
oil and water pump are some of its other
tricks to make sure that it sips fuel
and doesn't squander it's three cylinder
miser leanness before I get you to
number one the king of the three
cylinders is actually Nissan's di gt-r
so one and a half liter that does four
hundred horsepower that's a specific
output of two hundred and sixty six
horse per a little tiny leader you're
not going to find one of these in your
versa anytime soon
it's purpose-built for the DeltaWing
zeod RC hybrid race car the engine is
small enough to qualify as a carry-on at
the airport though at 88 pounds it would
do a number on your rotator cuff as you
wrestle it into the overhead though I've
seen some you put heavier things up
there our number one mighty three
cylinder engine is found in the 2014
Ford Fiesta SF II it does 123 horsepower
per liter this little turbo direct
injection powerhouse is only found in
this special lean edition of the Fiesta
and only with a manual transmission
which is fine by me
since Ford's powershift dual clutch
gearbox doesn't exactly inspire love
letters and in this combination
you'll get 36 miles per gallon average
high tech cars and modern driving that's
what you'll find at CNET on cars.com i'm
