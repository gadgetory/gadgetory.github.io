california it's the apple byte extra
crunchy podcast with your host mr.
Bryant ahh oh goodness thank you for
that introduction produced this show
produced by your producer Steven Beecham
how do you what's up everybody welcome
to the apple byte extra crunchy it is
episode 32 on this April Fool's Day as
we're recording it for the record I want
to let you know the stories that we
talked about today will not be april
fools let's hope these are not these are
all real factual events Steven I got
fooled for like a split second today by
which redbox what did they do they said
they wanted a redbox ambassador and like
I was like what can have people like
hanging out by the redbox and then there
was a picture there's like a guy inside
the red book oh so silly and I was like
oh not not that I want any of the kids
to check but um pornhub turned their
website into corn hub and it was like
different pictures of corn not that I
looked wow what is that URL it's gonna
leave it bad for the children listing
all the adults listening there they're
here in full force we just want to say
thank you again so much for being a part
of our show this is a show that includes
you we have live streams going on with
YouTube and live stream and periscope so
we like we like to interact with you all
and Steven again if people during
appropriate times if there's people that
want to interject and say stuff you know
just jump on in the show and just let
let us know what Lincoln as well we also
want to let you know again for you to
call in and be a part of this 1 800 61
62 63 eight is the number to call name
where you're from and your statement
your comment your question your bad
apple we had a couple calls that were
like way beyond 30 seconds that we're
like we just can't do this cuz yeah
we're getting a ton of calls and we
really want to pack in as many of you
that we can yes so you know we don't
want anybody filibustering thank you is
that that's what we do yes we feel
asleep we fill out we we fill a Busta we
just keep talking so let's get to the
show and jump right off the top this may
not necessarily be directly related to
Apple but I want to talk about the Tesla
Model 3 oh yeah I want to talk about the
Tesla Model 3 and the reason why I want
to talk about
it is this is what Apple is up against
this is they are bringing a tesla car at
a thirty-five thousand dollar price
point a consumer car that looks really
amazing it has this huge massive
skylight window glass top it's a roof
that just swoops from the front to the
back zero to 60 miles per hour in less
than 60 seconds to six less than sorry
sorry i meant la isla better be licensed
it might actually be faster to even say
depending on which model you get if you
get the supercharged model 215 miles on
a single charge at the very least they
said it has this autopilot feature which
is awesome I mean look at I'll tell you
right now i have not advertise it on
social media because it shouldn't matter
but i put a one thousand dollar deposit
down did you really i did your duty
ghosts and online yesterday no no you
could do it i'm doing i am right after
it happened cool so after the keynote
I'm like dude I this you it is fully
refundable okay so don't get all crazy
it's not like of course I'm gonna put it
on a card it's fully refundable but if
you wait these this year and a half or
two who knows it might it's gonna be a
lot harder to get right people were
waiting the lightest it's actually it's
actually pretty affordable it's 35
thousand dollars and then you get a
seven thousand dollars and a break with
that tax break so I mean what is that I
let's do the mask 28 27 27 in snow chain
wow yeah 28 and 27 that's pretty good
and we don't know what this cars we
loaded loaded with but again there's a
lot of excitement around this this is a
game-changer for sustainable you know
cars in general the other thing I want
to talk about though is Apple right like
Apple what are they gonna do there where
there's people waiting in lines for
Tesla like and I feel like it I know
that they are in competition there so
behind they are positioning themselves
as the quote/unquote Apple of yesteryear
of cars now yes the hype is there the
excitement is there the design I need
that looks like a test that card is not
on the exterior does not look like it's
skimping visually know it looks hot and
then the debt there's no dashboard
which is like I can't you know it's hard
to grasp that but all it is just a touch
screen that big screen cool yeah so
we'll time old time will go on time will
pass and we'll find out how this shakes
out but I think it's one of the most
exciting announcements that we have seen
in the past couple of years just from a
tech standpoint and consumer stamp a
tech consumer standpoint oh yeah and
it's Apple is looking at this and
there's been rumors that they have a
plot of land in the south bay that
they're going to use to potentially use
as a factory I mean Apple isn't even
producing anything right now and they
must be looking at themselves and like
maybe we should go back to the drawing
board or maybe we shouldn't try to make
a car yeah I don't know I feel like
they've like dip their toe in to
anything a lot this year in terms of the
car like just little hints and little
mentions they're gonna try our play so
they're gonna try I i will give them the
benefit of the doubt and see where they
stand but it took Tesla they started
around 2003 to get to this point Apple's
just not going to all of a sudden be
able to build an amazing car in a year
or two it's not their target is 2020
yeah so they still have time but just
imagine we're Tesla's gonna be in 2020
compared to where Apple is gonna be 20
20 that's what you have to look at race
way far ahead way far ahead so this is
as they say potential game changer they
had a around 130,000 pre-orders already
in place at the time of the keynote I've
got to imagine that probably doubled yes
so the cover night for competition is
fierce competition is fierce we're going
to also switch over to the reviews for
the iphone SE and the ipad pro 9.7 inch
they are in now basically it's what you
expect everyone's are saying the SE is a
solid phone it is using parts from the
5s it is using a few parts from the six
sorry the iphone 6s as well it uses like
the 5s screen and some of the other
components it's a solid phone if you
want a 4-inch phone in the US it's not
like it's selling gangbusters or getting
a massive amount of pre-orders in China
and India specifically that's where
you're seeing the most traction but this
is not moving the needle for sales for
Apple in any way shape or form where
it's something that would be considered
a major victory this is like we've
talked about
business decision over innovation
business yeah I saw someone sent me an
ad that I can trade in my iphone 6s for
like three hundred sixty five dollars
which is close to what i bought it for
and i was like actually tempted to do
that and get an SE just because of the
size just because of the Xenon's I'm
glad you admitted iphone 5 you know the
iphone 5 size was perfect the iphone at
six s it's just it's too big I I I think
hey you know what to eat their own even
even my even mice I don't know who has
bigger hands right here I put your head
I want to see this I got to see this
come on come on I pretty have pretty big
hands honestly I my head just just for
the record ladies and gentleman my hands
are slightly bigger than Steven
Beecham's now that doesn't mean I
Beecham wears like a size 20 shoe so I
mean interpret what you want from no but
uh I could see how with your smaller
hands Steven that the iphone success
would be harder to handle yeah I mean I
was literally tempted I'm like it's
close to the success it has you know
it's a little cheaper so I don't know
but it is a solid phone right rounds out
there phone line also the ipad pro 9.7
inch what some people are arguably
calling the best ipad pro just or the
best ipad clearly from a standpoint of
its the sweet spot for the size and the
features that it has but i will tell you
i'm still very happy with my ipad pro
after overtime right we let when when do
we do our last a show just i think just
last week right I can't remember see
because we we do these things all the
time you're in LA that's why that's why
it's fuzzy you remember right it's so
much better being in the same room yeah
it's so much easier but the ipad pro is
a solid I told people from the start
even right after the announcement that
it's a great update if you've been
looking upgrade your iPad pro I would
say and you've had one for two or three
years or even four years if it would be
a great update if you're someone that's
looking to do that so I like the product
but I want my true tone display on my
freakin 12 point that just kills my man
also just a quick update we talked about
Apple's iOS 9.3 update that had to be
updated and got pulled and waiting for
the update
the update of the update iOS 9.3 point
one is out Apple release it it fixes
this web link crashing bug so on our
video show we this this just happened I
think yesterday in our video show
published by the time it came out so we
will address it but it is out so I would
suggest that after the third update of
iOS 9.3 bed hopefully they've got some
of the kinks worked out but for those
you that waited and are smart about
things that did not jump into it
immediately then uh then you're good
yeah it feels like I've been updating a
lot this week I have been a lot of
updates of the updates an update yeah we
just don't want another update to the
update of the other update of that let's
not update any more updates yeah I don't
I don't I don't like that we're here to
keep you updated a just kind of
transitioning over to Apple pans out
there wasn't a lot of news initially set
up for the show but all of a sudden a
boatload a cornucopia of patents just
dropped on us these are pants at Apple
as applied for that have been revealed
or released and now brought to light and
we talked about it in a way this is kind
of sad to me but this first apple pan is
still cool but Apple has invented
improved efficiency of inductive power
transfers and is proposing in this one
of these patents we have like eight or
nine that we going to talk about
proposing inductive charging iphone case
that does not have a hump on it yeah it
looks flat it actually looks like a
 case yeah now who knows when they
design that thing if they're gonna put
some chunky ugly hunchback a Notre Dame
bump on it Oh it'll be chunky it's gonna
be chunky there's gonna be junk in the
trunk no I believe this but uh this is
Apple working on for believe it or not
wireless charging in this is my goodness
could we see it possibly in 2016
possibly oh my goodness I just a
technology that hasn't been around for
four or five years so they're they're
working on that that's kind of fun also
though I like this one a lot better
Apple is working on building this
inductive charging be
tween iOS devices and even something
like a macbook so this is cool this is
cool the surface of your macbook let's
say it's near the keyboard or even in
drawings that are further down in the
patent would show that you just lay your
devices on top of your macbook and then
there are specific hot points that would
allow it to charge while they're just
resting there yeah so there's conductive
coils inside which make connection with
conductive coils of the other device and
transfer the charge so it's pretty
interesting I think it I think that's
super cool this is actually something
that's super useful they even showed the
back surface of an iPad that's got to be
an ipad pro ever gonna put three devices
on it i'm saying and is it also talks
about it being magnetic so it would
magnetize did those those hot spots yeah
so you put your phone on you'd feel the
magnet connect its lillix charging yeah
that's I think it's useful you know the
we'll see how iphone battery life is
over all with this next-gen iphone
hopefully it's better most likely it's
about the same but using your other
devices to charge things that's kind of
cool because most of us even though we
have laptops they're typically charge
charging while we're using it right yeah
so typically it could just basically be
an inductive charging station very cool
I like that another patent reveals um
that the iphone is potentially will be
able to use touch ID to gain access to a
macbook without having to type in your
password now when we're talking on these
podcast sometimes because i don't have
it set up when when my laptop's just
opened and I start talking to Steven
beach and we're like just viben the
passcode locks and I'm like typing it
while trying to talk to you it's
annoying that's a pain it is a pain so
much like the Apple watch unlocks your
phone when they're within proximity of
each other this would be your phone
cheer macbook yeah and it's biometric
stuff so it doesn't necessarily just
need to be your fingerprint it could be
maybe you just look at it and get your
eyes you know your eye scans or
something or you put the phone up to
your ear and it unlocks because it knows
the shape of your ear or something I was
what ya did you i read the um I did not
read that part that's crazy well there's
a I put it in the
the rundown see everyone was everyone oh
I moved that I moved that I saw that
line I thought I accidentally pasted it
I actually do it was just a definition
of biometric biometric security and one
of those things was putting something to
your ear and it reads the contours of
your ear nose oh this is Steve 0k I'm
gonna unlock so it's kind of silly but I
think it's interesting I think it's cool
I also remember when touch ID first came
out all these call the crazy people are
like people can just try and steal your
fingers no oh yeah no they're not not
gonna try and steal your ears either
Apple had to come out and say actually
your finger has to be alive and have
blood flow going through an order for it
to work so they had to clarify which is
funny everyone's like I'm gonna chop up
someone's fingering in their phone yeah
totally worth it yes totally worth it um
yeah that I thought your thing is
interesting yeah I mean it's kind of
silly I don't think anyone ever do it
cuz you already have the fingerprint but
yeah it's funny you know Microsoft does
have their awesome facial recognition
hello we're and it works really fast i
don't know if you've tried it or not i
haven't done that you just you look in
the camera you say hello basically once
you open your laptop it takes like two
seconds it sees your face and it unlocks
it that's pretty cool it's pretty hot it
might even take less than two seconds
it's it's pretty slick so you don't have
to press or do anything like that I want
my phone to just smell me and be like I
walk up and it smells me and it's like
oh ok Steve's here did you because it's
April Fool's just really quickly until I
think it was Intel I can't remember but
they put out a bunch of different new
ways of like security and one of them
was a scent detector and then the other
one was a saliva a biometric detector so
they showed a guy licking his iphone I
don't know anyone here that's done that
before hmm just saying that's finding
them but he was like going at it going
at it like nah robbery real gnarly um
but you know what I'd like to do right
now yes I like to read a message from
today's sponsor that's right Apple might
extra crunchy bringing it and get some
music I'm gonna give us a little get us
in the mood yeah go ahead ladies and
gentlemen boys and girls today's sponsor
is casper mattresses obsessively
engineered american-made mattresses at a
shockingly fair price and now you you
you you can get fifty dollars towards
any mattress purchased by going to
Casper dot-com / apple byte and using
guess what
a code apple byte listen you spend about
a third of your life sleeping I probably
spend more than that no less than that
let's make sure you're doing it on a
good mattress just the right sink just
the right bounce two technologies a
hybrid of latex foam and memory foam
they've got a risk-free trial and return
policy they'll deliver it straight to
you you can try it for 100 days if
you're not happy they'll pick it back up
at the store maybe you'll get a minute
to try their mattresses I'm like the
worst reader right now with Casper
you'll actually get to sleep on it it's
five hundred dollars for twin size
mattress and nine hundred fifty dollars
for a king-size mattress comparing that
to industry averages that's an
outstanding price point so get fifty
dollars towards any mattress purchase by
going to casper calm apple byte and
using code apple by terms and conditions
apply all right juicy juicy moving right
along we have guess what we have more
patent stories for you yes because I i
if this is stuff that they're putting in
their devices in the next few years this
is cool sometimes there's like some out
there pads that we never see like a
virtual reality interface unlike apple
doesn't even have anything virtuality
reading right now that's coming out in
five years more not at all yeah but this
one's pretty sweet the Apple watch
they've shown off a new patent where it
shows up this kind of like the best way
to describe this is a modular this is
more watch links this is smart that link
together and these specific links can
actually do different things so what
it's leveraging is when the Apple watch
first came out there's like a port on
the side near one of the smart bands on
the body of the Apple watch uh-huh and
it was revealed that it it's it is their
diagnostic sport but it supplies data
and power so this patent would leverage
that power and data that it stores and
then use it to connect different types
of links or even talk to different
devices because of this diagnostic port
and leverage the Apple watch to be able
to do a lot more different things this
is great because they're running out of
real estate really quick on the Apple
watch you know this way to make the
apple watch smaller and more slim and
then basically you can have more
functionality all the way around your
missed so I think this is great idea
listen check this out this is what this
patent is talking about by doing by
adding some of these additional links or
you know let's call them smart links and
Apple is going to do something like that
yeah you could add things like more
batteries input and output devices
haptic devices displays health sensors
add why fight through like a link on
your watch it it's almost like if you've
heard of project ara which is the
modular smartphone that Google's been
working on it was originally for
motorola i believe if i'm wrong kurt you
can you guys can scold me on the
comments but this would be kind of their
equivalent with some with specific
modules again this is way down the line
but I could see it happening sooner
rather than later definitely definitely
a little extra battery juice just by
provided by a link on your watch that's
prayer and then uses that induction
charging we were talking about so you
can just rest your watch to get an extra
charge on your laptop that's cool it's
super cool I think it's great super cool
stuff so look out for that potential
modular setup from Apple then another
really cool one with the Apple we
related to the Apple watch and we know
we're expecting to see the Apple watch
this year the new one I'm guessing
they'll show off some more features of
watch OS at WWDC but I'm gonna also
guess that the Apple watch itself will
have its own event I don't think we'll
see it at WWDC that's just my gut I have
no information that says that it's going
to be that way I think WWDC is really
going to be all about the macbooks WWDC
dub dub so this cool this additional
patent about the Apple watch shows new
motion research that reveals gestures
may be supported in the future by the
Apple watch so you know speak to the
hand this is kind of cool to speak to
the hand speak to the hand yeah you can
do things like if you get a call you can
do a gesture to like swipe it on down
right swipe away answer or not it can
detect your movements of your wrist but
what I thought would made this thing
super special is when it gets in a more
specific movement so what if you're
talking about doing maybe individual
sign language yeah or things like that
this is what the patent talks about
based on either the tendon movement
or electrical signal or both the Apple
watch can determine the users motion and
gesture the motion and gestures can be
interpreted as commands but it can
detect like your tendons the tendons
flexing from your wrist will then help
indicate what you're actually doing with
your fingers there for leading to the
apple watch interpreting that which is
crazy I mean it's like that's right
we're getting closer and closer to just
being like you know Bionic Bionic robot
people that the singularity is on its
way even faster than we thought that ish
cray but it is cool so like thinking you
can have a Spock you can have a Spock's
yeah totally with that what would that
do maybe I have some app developers get
on that may maybe if you got a phone
call you could create sounds that are
like voice responses to the call like
you know I'm I can't I can't pick up the
Apple I can't pick up my Apple watch
right now you do a little Spock sign and
all it says is live long and prosper
that's pretty cool it's very cool I also
just kind of other news this time we're
transitioning over to the apple TV we've
talked about Apple really needing to
start creating some new content are you
watching anything on that flicks right
now I know your business ad and
everything no I don't know dares
actually don't know I just have a amazon
prime do you i would give you access to
my account but i've literally given it
to like I've its share them as Netflix
they they promote sharing their like
police sherry they do but I've already
shared it with too many people that's
the problem you know what I'm sorry I'm
gonna survive without netflix for now
you you will for now but I honestly
Netflix has changed like they have so
much good stuff on there now that's
exclusive I'm just like my mind is blown
and they're spending their throwing
millions of dollars towards new content
that we're gonna see in the next year
too and I that platform is amazing and
it still saddens me that you haven't
seen daredevil season one or daredevil
season two like I'm not a daredevil fan
I don't really I don't really care no no
no no no no but yeah but what's that
what's the guy's name Vince did you know
the guy who plays kingpin oh yes Vincent
D'Onofrio cannot be oh yeah you like
sauce I love him yeah
looks like you I feel I'll did you kind
of relate to him I don't relate to him
but you guys kind of get you some really
good movies the smell I'm not saying all
white people look alike but there's a
little resemblance here no hey Brian it
was like Bruce Lee yeah hey Brian you
look like Jackie Chan no I don't well I
mean I'll take that I'll take my friend
Ali's watching right now she's a big
private Pyle fan so I don't think she
would even say I look like him I'm not
saying you look okay let's not let's not
generalize this you don't look like him
but there are at least fo similarities
come on gchat what's the chatroom say
family got to be watching and they're
saying hell no no way to find a picture
of him real quick okay well you find a
picture of him I'm gonna talk about
apples for Reina content there was a
story reported earlier that they were
going to do kind of like a a bio a semi
TV series based on dr. Dre's life that
was going to be very graphic mature what
this neat do you want to hear what this
second project that has been talked
about according to new york times is
going to be um yeah i know i read about
it okay it's a non scripted series
ladies and gentlemen it sounds awful
about apps um it's going to be a
partnership with will.i.am who I
actually wish I also sounds awful okay
sorry so 2000 and late okay you're 2000
and late isn't that from the actual
miracle dinner song he's so 2,000 lei
he's like yo I'm 2008 great okay so will
I am it's gonna be will.i.am and then um
TV executives Ben Silverman and Howard T
Owens a new show that will spotlight the
app economy yeah I guess it could be
compelling is this like a marketing
ality show this seems more like
propaganda like from the surface sounds
like propaganda to me or if it's like a
silicon valley / reality show / how to
game the App Store like I mean you gotta
have really interesting people to make
that show yeah well I am you're already
you're already losing I'm sorry okay the
only reason why I've actually met him
and I've been able to talk to know yeah
you interviewed him but the reason why
do like him i will say for the record is
because although he makes products
i will never buy his whole mentality
behind that is look I'm a kid from the
streets and I have I have the ability to
have my own company and make an actual
tech product and that in itself is a
victory yeah it's like that message to
give down to people that are less
fortunate that are having heart that are
in a hardship like to be able to be like
yeah I was a kid from the streets and
now like I got to this level of course
his music is really what drove that but
so that's why I like because we're not
they don't dislike him I don't listen
music okay I just think it bad it's a
very bad choice by Apple to choose a
musician to be on a TV show who's never
been on television is the same thing
they did with dr. Dre is he gonna like
gonna get all like artists appeal
television stars now so 20 so yeah I'm
not saying I will watch the show I'm not
defending the show by any means Steve
and I are on exactly the same page i'm
not saying steven Beecham thinks he's
lame well maybe certain things he does
his lame concern things he does is lame
but uh you know he was really heartfelt
when he went to that to place he like
for some reason he started getting deep
with me and I was like let's go there
let's go there will I am let's get you
gotta go watch that by the way Vincent
chiappa top hero does kind of look like
me ok there's that's even that's not
even a good picture of him he's like
that's not even a good there are subtle
similarities ok at all subtle I'm not
angry did they do the chat room confirm
my beliefs um yeah actually I'm getting
50 50 here I'm someone saying no way yes

the chat room okay okay 55th what did

though racist that's racist you look
like Rufio from oh man I gotta pull it
up I took a pig I took a picture with
Rufio at a comic con cuz like he's not
really recognizable yeah his name's the
actor Dante Basco and it was like Rufio
meets Rufio and it was like if you gave
a care about Rufio you think it was
really cool people I used to care about
him Rufio was awesome man he was he was
like come on let's be honest when you're
an Asian guy he was like he was like the
yeah yeah yeahs
tough guy and I was like but probably
the last time we saw an asian guy in a
movie after him was like 20 years later
all right um let's go let's go to the
call shall we yeah we got some awesome
calls from you also will go hit those
then we got something a little parting
gift for you guys before we head on out
all right first call us from lens giving
BTW a heads up mr. Bryant song this is
when I love your podcast just want you
to know you look at the apple store as
of yesterday they do now offer an ipad
pro 12.9 inch in the 256 gig model that
should be out next week but you can go
ahead and order that now have a great
day ok ok Lynn I love the fact first of
all that we've got lady colors that are
into this show so thank you yes Lynn why
are you taunting me like she knew I was
having a mental breakdown when they were
announcing the 9.7 inch iPad pro and
she's like you can order away I'm like
Lynn I can't order it because i spent
like right a G on a from on a freaking
iPad pro that only had 128 it's just not
the same let go ahead and order bride
got some nice bank not the same hmm
anyways thank you lynn for calling we
love you ladies out there keep on
calling yes please all right next call
matt guys it's matt for framingham i was
calling asking actually i have a macbook
15-inch retina and instead of updating
the internal hardware harddrive excuse
me to hold more of my media library if
there was any better option I've looked
into plex but you have to have an actual
hard drive or use your computer to
storage usual media I watch a lot of
movies shows with it I didn't know if
you guys knew of a better option if you
could let me know that was a great
thanks photo okay first of all just Lynn
it was actually watching the periscope
alive right now I'm serious and I just
happen to look at it says it's me and
I'm like what I lind I like wave to you
Thanks she says lollipop just to confirm
lollipop nice no no okay to your
question sir I forgot
his name because I got the shots from
Brad him so I actually have a solution
that I use that I think might be able to
help you there's this product that I
think is the bomb it's called the
Seagate wireless plus it's a one
terabyte portable hard drive now why is
this special on this hard drive it not
only talks to iOS devices so for example
when I travel a lot because I don't have
a 256 iPad pro I can load all my movies
onto this Wireless hard drive there's an
app that I can go to and then I can just
watch those movies remotely from that
wireless hard drive it also works with
Macs and PCs I've never had a problem
with it personally is this it right here
yes it is the boss it's cheap too yes
that's a two terabyte one that you're
looking at only two hundy two honey's
for to terry's to honey for to terry's
that's pretty badass um I don't know
what else the one terabyte I'm just
looking I'm not they're not our sponsor
but maybe they should be after I say
this 011 st9 the one terabyte on best
buy is on sale right now for 137 99 and
they're also doing price matching so you
don't want to go see what that looks
like on Amazon you know it's pretty
often so that that would be a solution
that I would look into so that you don't
have to have like like you said with
Plex and also lived at this is a super
portable drive i love it i love it cool
all right let's go next call Nick from
my hometown alameda Alameda hi this is
nick from Alameda I love the show hey
just want to let you guys know I read a
book probably a few years ago in regards
to the marketing strategies of Apple and
when you jobs came back he compared
Apple to other companies decided that a
long product line wasn't the answer you
know not having five or six phones
different models different makes what he
did was as he says look we're going to
have a subversion and we're going to
have a baseline model I believe Apple as
a whole is getting away from that core
principle and I think it could be the
nail in the coffin if they don't correct
course there's no reason to have an eye
phone 7 pro model or whatever it's
called just give me an iphone 7s plus an
iphone 7s or an iphone 7 and an iphone 7
plus uh thanks a bunch enjoy the show
and have a good day that's a great call
I have felt that way for the longest
time just because if you look at apple's
iphone lineup right now they have the SE
the six the sixth plus the success and
the success plus so technically they're
line is five phones right now yeah okay
i get what they're trying to do but they
need to simplify that late ipad line is
now ipad mini ipad well they're just
trying to call it the ipad pro but it's
a mini a 9.7 and a 12.9 and look that's
okay if you want it if you want to do
that and get yourself in every nook and
cranny which is they have followed
basically the samsung model of making
things at different sizes these are
business decisions and it's quite
honestly though from a business
standpoint I've got to imagine just
purely because of apples muscle and
marketing size it has worked out for
them but when you look at some of the
product lines like what is going on here
this is again just to reinforce that
idea whether you like it or not this is
not the same Apple that you are used to
yeah it subsidies not setting their
customers and people don't want to hear
that I get it all the time oh my gosh i
love it when someone says like you're
such a blah blah blah go cover duck egg
and some was like oh you suck Apple's
blah blah blah that's like I must be
doing something right yeah we're like a
badge of honor yeah I'm just like I just
want to let you know people watching
periscope someone was really pushing for
our gentleman to use a zip drive like a
printer cable until I can I Omega zip
drive that's straight up like 90s man
it's cracking me up cracking me up
alright next call next call Charlotte
Tyler from Charlotte hey Brian beechams
Tyler from Charlotte I was wondering if
y'all heard any developments with Apple
pay and if they're going to be moving to
like a magnetic
pure transmission kind of like Samsung
pay I feel like that one of the big
holdups with apple pays not widely
accepted in all like retails places so
it really makes me want to switch to a
samsung phone so I have that ability I
was wondering if you've heard anything
about it all right thanks this is a
great question so what we're summarizing
basically Samsung has the ability to not
only use their kind of fingerprint
scanner to authenticate wireless
transactions that also is able to
communicate to the old-school magnetic
strip credit card readers this is an
acquisition they made with a company
called loop pay I think about mid last
year and everyone was like oh that's
really cool because it'll work with
every like now like ninety-five percent
of setups at retail Apple does not the
technology the way that touch ID and
Apple pay works it's purely an NFC
transaction it cannot talk to the old
school magnetic readers unless they do
something different or at a different
component Apple pay will not work with
that and there are no indications that
they're going to they're even one out of
five people are using Apple pay right
now that have it which is actually
pretty low I tried to use it the other
day and I failed and it didn't work and
you're like after forget that I didn't
finish my word guys some someone used my
credit card at like a Victoria's Secret
in oakville Oh someone so it got it got
turned off I didn't need to know someone
stole my they love you they really do
yeah they still shopping for your wife
or somebody I must have swiped my card
in a gas station and someone stole my
car rule they went spend a bunch of
money so I was all excited I was
somewhere and there was Apple pay their
I'm like oh my god I'm gonna use Apple
pay right now I went to get my car and
it was like shut off so what such a big
fail on my part dang so fun story fun
story right guys great great always
always great story man that sucks but I
don't see it happening any time soon I
don't know if it's necessarily worth
changing platforms for but if that's
really the differentiator for you then
go ahead and do it you know everyone
changes switches things up for whatever
reason so I ain't gon hate yeah just
keep on listening to our dope show
and some couple more calls will you talk
about Pokemon go yes we'll talk about
Pokemon what hey hey who's screaming

more Pokemon leave me some office
suckers like it okay that is actually on
a playlist from a youtube channel by the
way I play it for my kids all the time
sure you do sure you sure it's not for
yourself I secret oh that's right ok
this is abdul from Iowa hello my name is
Abdul from Iowa and I have two questions
for you guys about you know Apple and
what they're doing right now so do you
guys think will Apple ever update the
Thunderbolt Display and my second
question is you know looking at the art
industry you know a mac and apple is
what artists and creatives use you guys
still think that Apple even know isn't
you know is still known for that or do
you guys think that oh they don't even
care about that user base and just goes
to the consumer not
you know how they market their uh you
know the pro models of iPad macbooks and
whatnot all right yeah that's it um I
lifeless shell guys keep it up I thank
you for calling that's a great call the
last time Apple updated their
thunderbolt display or actually released
the first one was approximately four
years ago Wow so they you know they also
with the interface is changing we have
the app Apple MacBook 12-inch that's
just a USBC connection um it'll be
interesting to see what they're doing
there's so many like 4k 5k screens out
there now these days yes and it's like
come on Apple what are you doing maybe
to me if they haven't update if they do
not update the screen this year at WWDC
with the announcement of new max I don't
I think that they might just be out of
the monitor display business as just a
separate display I they've literally
done nothing they have their show
nothing that they are looking at that I
could be wrong but we'll see what
happens at WWDC yeah um the second
question though is apple still catering
towards the pros uh we both are gonna
how about let let you start off on this
steven a kind of what are you where's
your brain at i definitely think so I
mean you know if you go to a concert a
lot of the bands have like a macbook
sitting on there on the stage you know
like you see it at concerts all the time
I always see max for music also modeling
agencies like photographers I know that
they still use it a lot I you know
sometimes I'll catch a rerun of a above
what's that show what show I might have
the one with uh what is it uh the
modeling show uh America's Next Top
Model S awesome sometimes when you
happen to catch an episode I've been to
catch that yeah yeah what it randomly
happens to pop off on TV right Randall
it all their random watch it railways
they always have a mac you're always
using mac for their pictures you know
solely random it's very Pro very random
you never lose a big channels when I'm
searching for America's Next Top Marques
the word always
here at our studios we use pretty much
all macs to our video editing but yes I
will say this Apple has changed their
priorities from a standpoint of
internally if you look at what they did
with final cut I think they really shook
up things they might say it was for the
better but most people that use Final
Cut will say it was a step back and most
people because of that have started or
are or are transitioning either to
premiere or back to Abbott yes it's
changed the dynamic of pros in the video
business Apple's Final Cut Pro X still
does some cool things like it's
real-time rendering is probably it's the
best asset but just the way that you
organize your video clips it I mean I
don't want to keep on harping on it but
people kind of joke and call it I movie
pro yeah i mean we actually tested guys
that we work with tested it out when it
first came out and they're like which we
can use this we can't work with it it's
too difficult they changed just the
general flow of things so much that
sometimes guess what it might work with
hardware but when it comes to software
things that you have used for years you
don't want to like do a fundamental from
the ground up change on how you actually
use and interact with a program for pro
for pros totally and so to relearn you
let's eat learning her even avid system
is really just a different way of doing
things but if avid said we're gonna
completely do this different like and
scrap their interface and people that
have learned on it for years they're
gonna be shipped it's gonna be a shake
out there like what I'm gonna go jump
ship yeah so you know when I saw how
Apple did that even their support of
what's that that there is it's not light
room is it aperture their pro app I'm
not sure there was their pro photo app
that kind of stopped supporting that and
saying oh yeah your aperture libraries
can be put into iPhoto and people like
what yeah do you remember so um I think
from a software standpoint apples look
you can only do so many things and when
you're expanding to all these different
categories mobile devices iOS you're
going to take manpower from these
different areas and you've seen it
specifically in their Pro software
that's how I feel
but iPad pro for artists I ain't seen no
one created I'm still waiting to see
it's only been eight on an iPad pro my
four months feature stuff I I can
contribute some something for my adult
coloring book yes you know I just and
it's not again I have to all his roof
it's not what you guys think it is you
perverts it's like look up adult
coloring book it's actually just like
geometric patterns and like stuff it's
like therapy it's like look at women
it's not naked not know it's like waves
it's like psychedelic ass yes it is it
is and you just color it in so cool all
right everybody um I think we're gonna
wrap it up for today that was that was
great we had some fun times with you all
thank you so much for watching remember
you can always call us 1 806 1622 638
