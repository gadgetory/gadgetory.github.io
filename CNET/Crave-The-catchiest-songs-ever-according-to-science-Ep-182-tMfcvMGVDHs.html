here's what's happening this week on
cnet scrape off this week I made a trip
up to Santa Rosa California to meet with
inventor and musician Jeremy Bell he's
broke the scrubs the scrub board in its
current prototype state was a modified
tape cassette player but the tape had
ripped out and connected to a longer
cable allowing Jeremy to scratch like a
hip-hop DJ simply by scrubbing the tape
head over elevated pieces of audio tape
during his early experiments with analog
tape machines he found he could produce
record scratching sounds similar to a
hip-hop DJ scratching vinyl using analog
tape and in a much more effective way
eliminating the difficult finger
movements that hip-hop scratch DJ is do
when scratching a record on a turntable
the result is a similar sound was much
more control and precision he was able
to build a prototype drying up early
mock-ups and by literally hacking a
couple of grand walk man's he had lying
around the scrub board is stereo so you
can scratch with two audio sources at
the same time even incorporating guitar
loops and riffs into the mix
jeremy has gotten a lot of attention
online from the DJ scratching community
after he posted a video of himself
demoing the scrub board a few months
back as of now jeremy has his sights on
creating a do-it-yourself kit for the
scrub board for people who want to build
one of their own you can learn more
about the scrub board at the scrub board
