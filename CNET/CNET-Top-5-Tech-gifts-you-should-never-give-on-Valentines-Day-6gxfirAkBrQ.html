from your partner when Valentine's Day
rolls around that poorly delivered line
assuring you that it's just a cheesy
holiday and that she doesn't partake in
it consider yourself warned
she is lying and this is a trap if
February 14th rolls around and you don't
even have a daisy to show for it you may
find yourself sleeping in the doghouse
for the rest of the month hey guys it's
Vanessa and Ariana from CNET and today I
have the list of top 5 worst gift ideas
for your lady on Valentine's Day number
5 on the list big-screen TVs an Xbox one
or any other gadget that is clearly more
for you than it is for her if you end up
spending more time in front of that
flat-screen TV than with her trust me
she will know you gifted yourself
instead go for something more personal
like an iPad Mini with her initials or a
quote engraved on the back coming in at
number 4 iTunes or Google Play gift
cards on most holidays these convenient
little cards are a safe bet but bets are
all off on Valentine's Day on
Valentine's Day she needs to feel
special and doesn't want to get the same
gift you gave your bro as a belated
birthday gift instead make her a
playlist of her favorite songs or get
the entire season of her favorite TV
show and preload them on her device of
choice downside as part of the gift
you'll probably be required to listen to
or watch yes even if that means 20 hours
worth of The Bachelor number 3 on the
list a Roomba nest or any other smart
appliance just because she made you
watch the YouTube clip of a cat on a
Roomba doesn't mean she wants one for
her living room not only is it a highly
unromantic gift it may be sending her
the wrong message to my sweetheart
because you don't clean after yourself
if you're dead set on getting something
for the home consider a massage chair
for her and second on the list ecards
nothing says you're not worth the extra
5 minutes it takes to go buy you a real
card than an e-card a few things should
never become high-tech and love letters
are one of them instead sites like
Shutterfly and Snapfish let you print
out all sorts of virtual creations like
photo books and cards put some effort in
it and plan
hat and the worst gift you could ever
get your partner on Valentine's Day
fitness trackers there's a reason why
chocolates are such a popular
Valentine's Day gift you want to treat
your love not insinuate that she needs
to shape up and no no giving her
chocolates and a Fitbit will not
neutralize the message there's only one
type of physical activity that she
should be thinking about today and you
won't be a part of it if you give her
one of these instead and get her the
best kind of wearable jewellery you
don't have to hire an orchestra to
impress a woman on Valentine's Day it's
really all about the details and putting
thought into your gift tech or non tech
so take some cues from this list and go
have yourself a wonderful Valentine's
Day and check out more of our top 5s at
