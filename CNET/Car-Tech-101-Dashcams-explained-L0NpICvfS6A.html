having a recording of it can be handy to
show who's really at fault in a crash
provide evidence of a crime that you
weren't involved in that saw or kitc
that jackass and hit your car in the
parking lot it just drove off dash cams
have a host of unique features for
capturing all that easily and better
than just a standard digital camera or
clipping your smartphone up here they
are constant recording that means
they're always running and merely
overriding the oldest clip once they
fill up the card but you can put a huge
card in there dual lenses are common not
always but common they all have at least
one lens that looks out through the
windshield but some cameras also have
one that looks back in the cabinet you
think of like the cameras you see in
taxicabs commonly others have a remote
second camera that can be put in the
back to look at the person who's about
to rear-end you GPS data is typically
recorded by these cameras to both know
where the car was when an impact
happened let's say but also to monitor
its speed would be handy when you have
one of these mounted up for your kids
they typically have impact sensors
that's used to save a clip and lock it
so it doesn't get deleted if it was
recorded during an impact because it
assumes you want that one if you park in
a sketchy place where your car is
getting banged into all the time and
it's making you nuts
look for a camera that has motion
detection it'll basically sleep until it
sees something moving and then roll
video on the shenanigans and they didn't
be pretty affordable let's face it most
of us don't want to dedicate something
to just this one purpose that cost a ton
of money so these are definitely
available in the hundred to one hundred
fifty dollar range they can go higher
but not all
that is buying a dashcam isn't the
entire answer he needs to know how to
use it so here are some tips first of
all know where you can mount it wouldn't
it be ironic to try and be Johnny law
abiders I having one of these and then
break the law by putting it basically
where I have it most states require you
stick it over in one of the Farlow
corners of your windshield not here in
the middle where everyone tends to put
it be ready for a lousy frustrating
interface when I got our cameras in for
testing I finally found out where all
those people who used to engineer
television interfaces and the 90s went
to get a job power cords battery dashcam
out there requires a constant source of
power from a nearby 12-volt outlet which
isn't that nearby because it's in the
windshield so you have to deal with
dressing this putting it away somewhere
so it's not hanging here these do not
have long life batteries that's not in
their design and finally know about
eavesdropping laws recording video is
one thing recording people's audio is
actually a much touchier area 12 US
states are what are called two party
states you can't record a conversation
unless everybody involved has given
permission that's something to be aware
of most of these cameras have the
ability to turn off their microphone for
that reason and in many countries like
Spain Austria Switzerland even recording
video of the public road without people
permission is banned now you might ask
what kind of insurance discount do I get
for doing this well in the u.s. as far
as we can tell none there is one insurer
in the UK who's offering a supposed 10%
discount for having a dashcam but you're
kind of ahead of the curve with one of
these also note that these are not
primary fatality or injury reduction
devices there's secondary litigation
devices so these don't keep you from
getting hurt as a result the insurance
companies aren't that enthralled by them
yet now it's beyond our scope or
expertise to advise you on the law of
obtaining this video then the police
take it can the other guys attorneys
take it is it totally your property
that's something to check out in your
area before you start to use one of
these because once you get into a wreck
someone's gonna see you have one and
then it's gonna be a ball in play and
finally realize it you don't want to go
this route you can get some really good
dashcam apps for your smartphone
it requires tying up your phone for that
use of course and you have to follow all
those other rules on
mentioned but it's an easy or free way
to at least try out this behavior</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
