Android wear watches went first to view
Motorola is back with three brand new
moto 360 smartwatches
there's the 46 millimeter fashioned the
42 millimeters and a special woman's
collection 42 millimeter watch the 46
millimeter watch has a twenty two
millimeter band while the 42 millimeter
fashion has a 20 millimeter and the
woman's collection has a 16 millimeter
band the two big changes this year are
the crown positions at the two o'clock
position and there's these new lugs that
make the watch look more traditional
instead of the band being wrapped under
the casing it's now a bit more flexible
and definitely feels better on the wrist
like other Android wear watches this is
able to display customized Google now
cards right on your wrist and
notifications for things like calls
texts emails and calendar events it's
also an activity tracker that will track
your steps distance calories burned and
also your heart rate with an optical
heart rate sensor on the back battery
life is around 2 days for the 46 million
model and the 42 millimeter is set to
get about one and a half days so it's
still iffy I'm also a little
disappointed there's still this black
bar on the display so it's not a
complete circle but Motorola says that
gives them more screen real estate and
there's less of bezel all three models
of the Moto 360 fashion are available
for pre-order right now prices range
from $300 all the way up to 430 dollars
depending on what model you want you can
also customize it on Moto maker comm so
you can choose from a new bed a new
bezel kind of what color you want and
customize it to your liking the Moto 360
will be available in late September
Motorola also introduced the Moto 360
sport this is a sporty-er version of the
band it's 42 millimeters it has a
special any light display so it makes a
lot easier to read outside but the real
important thing is that has GPS so you
can track your pace and distance when
running which is something I really like
as a runner
pricing availability wasn't announced
when the military 60s sport that's
coming sometime the huge
I'm Dan Graz ever seen it and that was a
first look at the Moto 360 smartwatch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
