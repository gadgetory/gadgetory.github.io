scene that right now is the Google Nexus
7 it has the price of a Kindle Fire and
all the cool features like NFC Google
Wallet Android 4.1 the other tablets
just don't offer but if you have no
business buying a new gadget right now
I'm here to talk you down in this top
five I have the best reasons to skip the
Nexus 7 and wait for something better
starting off the list at number five no
rear camera personally I don't get why
people want to take pictures with their
tablet but people are doing it like a
disturbing amount of people now the
Apple comes out with an iPad Mini this
year you know it's gonna have rear
camera and you're gonna feel burned at
number four there's no video output now
pretty much rules this thing out for
giving presentations or hooking up Angry
Birds to your TV now you could spend
$300 on a Nexus Q for the privilege of
wirelessly beaming a sliver of your
tablet content to your TV but that's
$100 more than the tablet plus the Q
kind of looks like it's gonna eat your
children when you're not looking still
not convinced how about number three no
Adobe Flash support Adobe is getting up
on flash for mobile and as of Android
4.1 Android is giving up on flash and
yet there's still a ton of Flash content
out there on the web maybe what you
really want is a killer Windows 8 tablet
at number two there's no cellular data
option Wi-Fi is great around the house
but a lot of people want that same
pay-as-you-go data coverage offered by
the iPad but hey at least it's still a
refreshing change from all those 3G
honeycomb tablets that came on contract
now before we get to number one let's
take a look at CNN's list of top budget
tablets who would have guessed that the
iPad would be facing so much competition
from $200 tablets as for the non iPad
tablets priced at $500 and up
I hear they formed a support group it's
poor bastards all right now the number
one reason not to buy a nexus 7 there's
no memory expansion considering this was
everyone's biggest complaint on the
Kindle Fire you'd think that Google
would have thrown it in and the extra
$50 that you're going to spend for the
16 gigabyte model that's not going to
take away the sting when Samsung throws
down a version with a micro SD card slot
any day now
so there you go hopefully I have
tempered your nexus7 enthusiasm just
enough to help you make a sound decision
it's still a very cool tablet so be sure
to check out Eric Franklin's full review
on the Nexus 7 over on CNET and for more
top five like these head over top-5
