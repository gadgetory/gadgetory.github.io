the scene it staged for special edition
of dialed in i believe on episode 206
for i remember correctly i'm here with
all my tough jessica doll court our
senior associate editor are very new
associate editor Lynn law she's been on
the job how long a week I think four
days before see ya for day seven he or
she is at CES so it's kind of a crash
course and tech reporting we believe i
did a trial by fire around here yeah we
really do how's your 11 day work week
how's that going it's been great it's
like 12 hours a day no sleep and yeah
running around a lot ok good and then we
have Brian Bennett who was also somewhat
new to seen it but comes to us from a
lot of great tech reporting background
and we're here to talk about what
happened here at phones it's a big phone
show absolutely i mean compared a couple
last couple years don't you think like
huge last year was pretty good but this
year was definitely something that would
require us to sit and take notice
jessica spincake even care very careful
notes about how many phones we have yeah
our stats so what are some of the stats
okay so they announced 21 phones so far
and i think we're done with the
announcements here so 21 phones that i
don't think so yeah only one of them so
far was Android Ice Cream Sandwich there
were two windows phones and one of them
we knew about one of them we didn't and
five of the phones that were announced
have the word galaxy in their name
because they're part of the samsung
galaxy line can I just say like are we
in an air of long phone names last night
at t-mobile we had samsung galaxy s2
blaze 4g yeah yeah and then there's also
this i don't count CSU skyrocket HD okay
so i think i don't even know how to put
the marketing in these phones like it's
a little plaque on the store it's just
gonna be like yo so um we be a big phone
show lot to see what are we most excited
about Brian what do you what I think I
know but yeah I know I want to hear I've
been talking about this phone second I
found out about it on
yeah that was the hour of like Verizon
press releases every five minutes yeah
we were recovering the 18 c press
conference and all of a sudden boom
verizon comes out with with a whole
bunch of new phones one of them is the
one I'm really excited about it's the
motorola droid 4 so if any of you guys
out there actually our original droid
owners and really love that keyboard but
we're waiting for an Android slider with
dual core processing and LTE data access
I mean this phone has got your name all
over it so I have it actually right here
if you want to take a look as you can
see we've got a big HD screen right here
and the phone actually slides open here
and we've got a five row core to keep
keyboard here so keep I made it I made a
big deal about the keyboard you thought
it's really cool I mean is it is it one
of the best you've seen it's a kind of
bordering on like blackberry rim a
territory of as far as you know the cage
know when I picked it up I first picked
it up I was like wow first of all the
keys look great you know so you know and
also one thing I liked is you know it's
backlit and it feels really good when
you press is rubberized in very tactile
feeling another thing is that it has the
whole full qwerty full number roll on
top which is really cool plus
directional arrows in case you really
want that yeah but I mean this thing and
also another thing they call it a you
know a razor sorry a laser etched keep
keyboard which what does that even mean
yeah actually use a laser I suing I have
to find out but uh also it could be
cooler for shot razors out lasers out of
it that's right i don't want to be
blinded we can sort of we need to start
some sort of dictionary of all these
like laser at you know laser keyboard
and hyper skin back oh yeah and like all
of those things really got what does
that really mean well actually
brightness there's actually something
that's even cooler or even weirder is
that it's supposed to have a nano
around the entire device which repels
spills and so it's water-resistant a
little bit from where I understand it's
a little bit water-resistant I guess
again later Alex it's only slightly
water-resistant don't spill your drink
on it will take three drops but not for
right yes not a full glass maybe you sit
right for what do we know when that's
coming out we I believe a few too I'm
not sure though q3 another somewhere in
there I'm gonna be a little tension to
be a little pessimist or actually it may
actually actually know what I think it
maybe even coming soon that maybe in the
next few weeks so we'll take a look and
see when it comes out there's no pricing
and I don't believe so but I mean this
is a device that a lot of folks have
been waiting and on verizon and on
variety is Jessica what are you most
excited about hey there are free phones
i'm going to give a shout out to the
first is the nokia lumia 900 that was
leaked before the show it was just great
to actually see it in person I like the
previous version but this one it's it's
larger and that beautiful screen really
pops out and it so just it looks
fantastic it's it's great all right you
know what I like about it is like Nokia
sofa stunts such a long history of real
doing really good designs you know
remember those nokia phones in the
mid-90s we're like you could just bang
that thing around for a bit wasn't
recovered of rubber it wasn't like this
next tell you know you're supposed to
shoot it out of a cannon or whatever
like you could drop that thing it last
forever and they've always been really
good about that good about display and
it's nice to see me okay yeah continue
that tradition yeah it's a completely
original design and i love that the
other phone that i like I really liked
the LG spectrum from verizon yeah I
didn't seen actually haven't got my
hands on it you know it's kind of simple
in the same way that they Galaxy Nexus
is it no real like design you know um I
guess Claire yeah thank you I have fun
you ask me but it's very simple it's
very clean it's got a lot of high-end
specs it's just a nice package all
together and then I also want to give it
a shout out to the pantech first and
let's have a look at that as well but I
think that pants like really put a lot
of effort into that phone
there's some nice design Flair yes and
and it looks really good and it's going
to be really cheap on ATT like 50 bucks
and I just think it's great value and
that's one of those phones that I think
could possibly be a sleeper hit okay I
really like it because it's like a lot
of people really want smart phone set
but it can't necessarily afford the high
end stuff and the ones that are on that
price range aren't really they don't
look very good quality and it's like not
really premium yeah it feels really
plasticky but the Pantech Burst actually
feels like a quality phone and it's only
like 49 99 and the specs are good that's
a dual-core processor on it there's a
5-megapixel camera there's a front
facing camera and it just it looks
really cool doesn't have like metal in
it at all or any kind of well the
backing looks like like textured almost
like textured wood grain but it comes in
red and titanium and it looks really
nice it looks like there is renewed yeah
the back we really like those there's
sometimes bridges it's like some
contouring Marcus words on it there was
a ruffle your leg ridges six phones
announced at the AT&amp;amp;T press conference
on Monday yeah oh the ATT press
conference desk assembly hours did your
laptop battery lasts oh well I actually
our live blogging tool comes over the
mobile version so I was live blogging
from the mobile tool and then after
about 45 minutes in I turned on my
laptop because i only get two and a half
hours of battery on that what happening
this next to me he had like 10 minutes
left of juice at the end of the show our
news chief declared the press conference
longer than avatar oh I read that tweet
wasn't your your battery about to
explode like your picked up your laptop
yesterday night it was like it was like
melting yeah I was waiting for flames to
start spewing forth from it you're
giving it a workout we are so we have
some predictions before the show we
thought you know we're gonna see your
favorite fun oh I guess what's got over
me huh I'm sayin I'm gonna say Lumia
actually I really like that phone I oh
I'm sorry I thought you were the burst
you want to say any more about the let
me know just get both okay i really like
Elena it's got a great design and really
the I really love that the feel of it in
the hand I love that display and I just
I like sort of the angle of it how you
move you kind of approach from the side
and it bevels in a little bit yeah it's
really clever Cicely and I have you I
windows phone 7 is something i didn't
use for a long time I just you know
Banita you know who used to reduce my
front sport she was always the person
reviewing those and so I never she was
in New York so I never really saw a lot
of them and then I started using that
operating system and I do like if I
think it's a nice mesh between it has a
little bit of Android it has a little
bit of iOS message some of them together
and no fan of that phone and I was at
the press conference and Nokia was
making a big deal with CEO Stephen Elop
about you know we're back we're back in
the u.s. we're back in North America and
actually a tmobile said the same thing
last night everybody we're back we're
back okay the second blackberry rim said
that there yeah exactly I velez respect
so this is a show feedback but you're
going they're not even here okay for so
long nokia you know and a lot of people
think about no key in the US and they
think well they're just not doing well
they're not doing well as a company and
that's not really true because so much
no kiss business is overseas in emerging
markets those little phones that we use
ten years ago I mean huge part of the
business still that really lost some of
the smartphone train because they didn't
get with on with carriers here which is
so important in this market but it's
nice to see that support and see them
see somebody really pay attention to
Windows Phone 7 see a carrier pay
attention to it and I think it's just it
seems like a really solid device I
haven't used a tin tease used to 18 to
sell te right yes okay and you would
like to yeah I'm cautiously optimistic
in the 18 tues LTE I checked it out in
san francisco and this beats were pretty
good but i think the the real message
with that the true test between that and
also Sprint's new 4g LTE network is
going to be how it holds up under hood
when everybody starts getting the funds
when everyone starts using them are we
going to see the same problems that we
saw in san francisco and other cities
like New York was sort of congested
PG or never the worst like you know you
have to fight for every everything and
spectrum is just another thing oh so
five from space in this restaurant on
the train in the subway like on a
sidewalk and yes spectre-2 okay get out
of my spectrum yeah but but basically
you know I think that these questions
are going to be answered down the line
in six months and a year from now how
well the development is actually going
and actually you've touched on sprint
that's another big thing to happen here
is that sprint you know as a wimax
network that's been there for G for a
long time and yeah there's been a lot of
issues with clearwire Clara are getting
funded which of course they're why max
partner there were are having enough
spectrum and we knew at some point they
were going to go to LTE and its then the
show they've announced I mean they vote
they announced a little while ago but
they confirm plans they said I think San
Antonio Dallas Houston and Atlanta by
the first half of the year and they have
introduced two new phones the Galaxy
Nexus on sprint with LTE in the LG viper
the paper work yes oh and a lot spot
that actually switches between wimax and
4G LTE which i think is really smart
even though the thing is tall and looks
like an anvil it's very handle my bag so
the interesting thing about the Samsung
Galaxy Nexus is it is pretty much
identical to the verizon version that we
looked at however it actually has Google
Wallet enabled on it yes right that's a
big big thing too because sprint is a
google partner and things like google
voice so if you've got google voice you
can very easily get it on your phone and
we didn't really use it put on the
company card but basically if you either
have a prepaid google card or if you've
got the city mastercard with paypass
then you can start using that right away
on the Viper as well which is also NFC
enabled yeah we provide you saw a
Verizon Galaxy Nexus running Google
Wallet at some point or always what are
you didn't actually not see yes I
actually well I've you know a little
while ago I mean people were upset when
the verizon Nexus Galaxy Nexus on
verizon came out and did not have google
i'll support even though had NFC built
in
so people started to actually hack their
their phones to put that capability on
them and I hope people i know have
already actually started doing that now
they've got the app on their phone that
allows them to access Google Wallet so
it's just interesting I mean I i would
love to use use Google wallet's feature
especially there's a lot of you know
free little deals i can get no free
drinks free food free you know I don't
even know what toothpaste that we read
or something I would love to try that
you know so you got you guys here see if
you see yourself using it as well like
mobile payments on your phone no I don't
really like using robots for plenty
money to be really long time some use an
ATM thank you okay I have a great use
case though going to the gym you know
let's say leave everything in the office
go to the gym next door take stuff with
me on the way back I realized oh man i
really wish i had a gatorade you know I
want to gatorade I don't have anything
with me if I had this on my phone BAM
Gatorade in hand I think that we're
going to learn to use it and the people
who thought they never would will sooner
or later we could put our IDs on it and
then we'll just never have a lot and
never windows your phone you can
actually just also sew it onto yours so
one of the cash people I've got to say
yeah for a lot of thing is embrace of
all yeah yeah no paper trail how do i
doing there are things in gold I don't
know anymore I don't anyone know I
bought that you know people magazine
right nurse exactly so I'm any
disappointments so far anything you wish
you had seen that we have it I was
completely wrong with our prediction I
thought there was going to be you I
thought this was going to be the Android
Ice Cream Sandwich okay there's one Ice
Cream Sandwich device everything else is
gingerbread 2.3 point six right point by
point nine that will be upgradeable
later on yeah but you know one thing I
can't leave I was wrong okay that was
pretty cool is that huawei had to global
devices which we're running ice cream
sandwich that we took a look at but you
know of course they don't have a carrier
they don't have any sort of any
information about them really but basics
of p1 and the p1s and they're gorgeous
devices
then one of them has like a metallic
shiny red coating those the month so you
got that you can get the bright yellow
cover for the back oh that boy yellow
black sorry bright yellow back cover
really I didn't even know that oh yeah
that's that's pretty that's even better
so yeah Bonnie child was taking photos
of that yeah yeah I mean it's a pretty
you know and it's funny because they
look so close so similar to the samsung
galaxy s2 it was a little bit i mean the
the folks there displaying a little
uncomfortable when i said that because
it looks it looks so close to that to my
special effects I'd something slowly
away yeah you know so I don't think they
appreciate that comment so maybe a
little wrong an ice cream sandwich but
you know I think that we I think we we
always do that we say we think that is
going to eat last year i think for csv
probably slip lots more gingerbread cuz
you know i was right after the galaxies
are the nexus s right sorry remember all
these and then we didn't see a lot of
tension right it came out early you know
i was fri oh and then it was we were
also hoping for quad core phones but
this is not that show either yeah well
there is a quad core core quad core
phone sitting around the fujitsu pills
oh really yeah but it's behind glass and
so i don't think we don't actually know
if it's a quad core phone it's like
Schrodinger's phone no it is but I mean
it's just not we didn't it's not out
it's not out on the floor you know found
out you can't touch anything no you
can't open it up and look out but you
could just be saying it's what about
Intel's big news last night oh yeah
brought about that kind of ramen yeah
that was something that was dropped in
the middle of the Intel press conference
they are lenovo is introducing know they
make a lot of species they make a lot of
desktops and laptops so did drop a new
phone so we'll talk about that in a
second we'll take a short break and
we'll be back
and we're back we're just talking about
the lenovo phone this so this is a phone
is going to be powered by Intel an Intel
processor and it is the lenovo k800 and
it was kind of weird because we don't
were expecting at all and then they were
at the Intel press conference and
suddenly it was boom here's a new phone
from android phone so i actually i know
that brian Tom got to check it out last
night and a jmar leaving from download
com got to check it out but what do you
guys think I mean it was surprised by
this news yeah definitely surprised by
it and also I'm just kind of wondering
how well that's going to succeed don't
read it to work there are other
companies viewsonic has a phone here
that we haven't looked at yet and are
they selling those i mean i think that
the carriers and the major manufacturers
really on the market so it's interesting
to see something else especially if
there is some sort of innovation on it
but i don't know if it's wasted effort
or not yeah yeah i mean that's that's a
real hurdle you know for them to get a
carrier approval for that kind of device
but i'm going to throw out a crazy idea
what if should--we should we get out of
the way yeah shout just duck man okay so
I'm thinking you know Lenovo and I heard
this from other folks oh I can't take
full credit for this but what if Lenovo
actually bought black bear rim because
they have such like a kind of the
business same kind of you know client so
can you imagine if that manova phone
actually kind of takes some of the
business away you know business phone
usage away from blackberry yeah I do
want to check it out though is but it
looks entered you get a spec sir we
don't really know a lot there's
gingerbread on it I think there's a
5-megapixel camera i think or eight and
they were very short on specs very
shorter and released your timing or
anything like that but that is supposed
to be the first of a quite a few
intel-powered phones and made by Lenovo
avatar by Intel and all Android so
another player in the market and then be
sent via sonic like you said to write
exactly I know so Jessica we were
talking to the break Jessica wanted me
to mention of course the t-mobile press
conference last night lame got to meet
us link out to meet a TV star yeah we
all took pictures me in
Brian two pictures with Carly yeah AKA t
mobile tmobile girl with the pink dress
and she's super pretty and in real life
yeah another thing a trash bag see sure
they showed an ad where she was wearing
the same dress that she was wearing to
the party I know how how weird is it to
be like at a party and then see her add
like actually I really like because I
kind of glanced over at her to see her
response because I was sort of on one
side you know being sandwiched by Carly
t-mobile girl on one side and then add
with Carly t-mobile girl on the other
side she was looking at it she's gonna
like yeah someone asked her how it felt
she's like I don't like looking at
myself on camera I never seen like
didn't understand that really how does
she know what I just like ran out of the
room screaming every time is your TiVo
just screams about I like she's got some
program so but there was apprehension
event because like we mentioned earlier
t-mobile's very much about we're back
we're back in the US I mean they've
always been here but I mean we're back
you know from trying to merge with AT&amp;amp;T
we are going to get newer phones we're
going to get we have spectrum we got the
cash from the mouth of the CEO who came
up on stage and actually spoke for quite
a long time and what I thought was a
very forthright manner and I really
appreciated it I thought it was the most
honest executive statement summary that
I've heard at the show really I kind of
I thought it was a little bit of like
we're just trying to sell a line here
maybe but I think for the most part you
go up and you hear the carrier saying
things like our network is strong we're
the largest 4g network know we're the
largest and the fastest and the most
reliable and he know they're very good
about this bigger that's gaining going
up there and he's like the last nine
months have been hard right you know
well well but I don't think you could
talk to anyone in that really end it was
upset that that merger did not happen
well let me just say one thing i know
that i was at a press conference I was
on a t mobile device that HTC fort amaze
4g and i was trying to actually get
access to just you know tweet tweet deck
and all that stuff over 4g at their
press conference and I was having
connectivity problems because they were
using you know what's going on here I
mean
the same thing was there a sign there
they usually have signs at all of these
things like to make sure our demos work
please turn off your sprint etc 18t
whatever a hot spot but I wasn't even
hot I was amusing as a hotspot is your
name cell phone that's it that's all I
wanted to do but and then you guys and
then afterward you drop by the
blackberry thing that was not a lot
there oh yes when and I went to the
blackberry event it was a informal
cocktail party type thing but everyone
was dressed in black anyway I didn't get
the memo well you're the cosmopolitan I
think that's like that which I wear
dresses in black the uniform it's very
fancy but unfortunately there wasn't any
news there there had people showing off
the blackberry playbook to OS which is
really uneven if it's actually out yet I
think it's more like a in development or
for developers and I kept pushing how
it's supposed to be you know a segue
over to blackberry 10 in which isn't
coming in which which is coming out at
some point but to be fair we knew all of
this we knew that they weren't going to
announce a product we knew we knew
beforehand that blackberry 10 wasn't
going to come for a while but we don't
know we've the president it's been a
long time that we've known that it has
been one it's bed you know and ok not
just one for next month the next month
and but rim is still had a big showing
here not in terms of products but
actually their booth eats up about half
of the floor of the South Hall just
right over there yeah I mean they
definitely helped have deep pockets
still so so maybe we'll have to wait for
mobile world congress for that right of
course that's a big show next month in
barcelona we're sort of biggest mobile
show in the world and will be there to
bring you all that but that should be
blackberry 10 thanks for cross what are
the phone did you bring right oh yes so
motorola was nice enough to actually
bring another phone that was announced
this week this is the droid razr but
it's the purple virgin check this out
here you'll want to take a look so we've
got its got purple all around the sides
it's really thin the same thickness as
the original droid razr but it has a
purple along here along the edges and
just you know along back here so if you
like a very metallic purple device with
android thats you know really fast this
could be what you're looking for it's
pretty yes i have to admit it's pretty
i'm not sure if purple is my thing but
yeah I've been hearing a lot of
different things on the internet some
people say that's really pretty other
people say that looks really ghetto and
I'm like I guess I mean color is such a
you know probably no respiratory yeah
exactly there was a period I don't know
Gotye forget when it was few years ago
where we had a bunch of purple phones
like right in a row six purple phones
and like purple was like the new black
for a little bit and then it blew was
after that so always changes I think
black and gray are the most minute
colors or white you throw away yeah why
is it become the new black yes yeah
there is a like it's the new white is
the new purple one of the new sony
ericsson phones the is the Xperia S I
think minutes sorry sony phone not sony
ericsson his comes in white as well yes
i would not away ok so i just see those
phones yeah um this is the motorola this
is the motorola droid razr maxx when I
can run so me and Brian werlla campus
and we kind of really dig it only
because there's 33 Alison only because
there's a 3300 milliamp battery in the
back yeah like Max our man you barely
notice that it's still super it's still
super thin yeah we compared to many
let's see that one compared so there
must have been complaints because you
can't remove the batteries in these
phones right yeah yeah yeah that's a
major issue yet yeah and the people have
motorola we're just giving us different
specs of course it totally depends on
your individual usage but they said 20
1.5 hours straight talk time eight full
length movies back to back and yeah
that'll help that'll have to ride home
do a lot easier so basically Motorola's
lesson is that thin isn't always the
best right because they have to add to
add more battery they have to like pop
it out so instead of having this notched
back at almost not that way that's so
pretty been there it almost goes
straight yeah so pretty sweet thing was
that like this is really thin but didn't
want that they now had the thin
phone yeah but that's gonna last for
like a week I was gonna announce that
was Samsung man okay I mean soonest is
gonna it's just gonna disappear it's
gonna be like being in a turn on outside
and you're not going to see anything so
why cause when it's too thin people
don't like it just have like a really
fragile feel and well it's sharp in your
hand I got it during blanching doing it
hands-on with your my tripod and auto
focus on the phone like that I'll have
it you know facing front and as I turn
it over the autofocus will just like
lose track and all of a sudden
everything blowers out so it's like it
disappears you know sony ericsson sorry
we uh we did announce two phones i keep
saying that i'm gonna have to get out of
that it is just so Nina no need so it's
just Sony and they did announce two
phones to Sony Xperia ion and the Sony
Xperia S the Xperia S completely
confused me at first because I thought
didn't they already announced this the
Xperia Arc S but I completely different
so you took a look at experian I on at
first yes and yes so well the big news
is really it's a android it's a
gingerbread unfortunately it's not you
know ice cream sandwich but it has it is
I know what's going on you know we just
get the promise oh it's coming it's
coming they say it's coming just like
you know with the droids here from
enroll their supposed to get ice cream
sandwich soon but the ion basically has
you know things like a 2 megapixel HD
camera in the front and a in a 8 verse
actually a 12 megapixel a pic yeah
that's right that's what it is so 12
megapixel main camera which is pretty
impressive well I'll see your 12
megapixel camera and i'll raise you 16
megapixels with the HTC Titan too well
there's a there's you know Daniel
actress over the hilton so I didn't need
plow that's that's a lot of megapixels
you know we can took some pictures on
the Titan too yeah I'll a nice yeah
actually um you think megapixels again
but also with the sony damn i want to
say ericsson all I know but anyway with
the sony phones the megapixels is again
an issue we talk about a lot if they
didn't change the light sensor if the
rendering software isn't any good or
even optics and that the lens is not so
hot yeah it may not even matter
right exactly so we'll be putting all of
these through major camera tests as well
awesome yeah and I mean you know cameras
your point shoot camera seem to be
fading away as people are using their
phones as the cameras now so it's
definitely more important now to
actually have a good camera in your
phone you know and especially when you
want to send it over to Twitter or
Facebook or something like that it's so
much easier to do it from phone and some
kind of fancy internet-enabled camera or
something like that and I know you're
big fan of the Titan too I like the
Titan to their original Titan you know I
got into some arguments with some other
you know mobile bloggers about the best
Windows Phone out there and they said
the type when he's in person argument so
were they over Twitter or they all they
came to blows okay cystic us but I
basically said that i liked the
basically windows phone version of the
samsung galaxy s2 line and they
basically said that they liked the titan
and i found the titan to to be so much
better because yes they have increased
the battery life they've increased the
camera its 4g LTE and then they also
just kind of give it a little lick of
paint so it's a different color it's a
soft touch finish which is I just think
friendlier to hold and there's a little
texturing on the back cover as well so
all in all I think that's a much better
device and if AT&amp;amp;T didn't have the Lumia
800 then I would definitely say that the
Titan two would be the best device but I
think it's going to be neck and neck for
a while until we get our hands on tests
it's nice to see to Windows Phones you
know we like two of them they're they're
really cool see how they compete I want
to see Verizon pick up another windows
phone yeah they don't act and let's
prank that one too we have a sprint
picked one up in a long time they have
resin has one no that's a good thing
okay oh that's right I forget yeah once
a verizon hasn't picked one up either
but AT&amp;amp;T is definitely the windows phone
you know patron yeah man they were
getting there very much capable t-mobile
you know they did that actually the
Lumia 710 one on sale today Brian
reviewed that phone a little while
and some time is it pretty you know it's
not bad I mean it's like fishing for its
price right it's like 49 50 bucks
basically and you get all the basic
features and it runs you know windows
phone mango very well you know no no
performance hiccups or anything like
that and you know you can do everything
that you can do on an android phone with
a device like that the only I think sore
point is that it has a 5 megapixel
camera so not megapixels for me but but
for that price I think it's yeah this is
that guy that came in like that's right
yeah comes in white and black and maybe
some other colors you can add on to the
back yeah globally I think it comes in
like pink cyan yellow this so here's the
thing though I mean for windows phone
and nokia nokia is like yeah we're back
we're back in the US we're really going
to give this a push but so far AT&amp;amp;T has
the highest concentration in windows
phones t-mobile's next nokia and
microsoft are going to have to get
windows phones on all four carriers and
they have to be real offerings oh so
here's something interesting too we met
with the limb brian and i met with a
microsoft yesterday to talk about
Windows Phone and we asked the question
about the incentives because there was
no yes a rumor story that the
salespeople were going to be given
incentives so money basically if they
could sell a certain because there's
been a lot of reports that carrier staff
are actively discouraging people from
buying windows phones they go into the
store and they say no you and they asked
for in customer asked for windows phone
let's say no you want to get know you
want to get Android or you want to get
iOS something else right well actually
it's funny because the Microsoft
representative actually said that a lot
of it has to do with pushing services so
you know maybe the windows devices did
not have hot spot or other ways for to
paying into some of the carrier services
that
revenue for them so but now it's getting
more advanced of hotspot there's all
these ways to share content in-stream
video and all that stuff so tablets
things like that yeah so all those
devices and the I think the take-home of
the story is that he was saying since
there are these other ways it might just
be that sometimes the representatives
would push something if they were given
like you know extra payment for selling
a bundled service or more devices and so
they gravitated toward Android where
they could do that and then also i think
the report was that it was eighteen t
who's guilty of this and eighteen t has
come out and said that's not it that's
not how they operate they don't work on
commission that way yeah so it sounds
like that report was maybe a little bit
false but microsoft definitely knows
that they mean to get into the retail
stores if they're going to sell them
more carriers or more manufactures board
and a better app and more strength and
strength in the app community the app
developer community because those things
that really make operating systems from
they've actually the absent skyrocketed
they were in eighteen thousand then
thirty thousand and now they've reported
that across the five hundred fifty
thousand Mahroug the quality quality
there too yeah i mean i think i just
have to make Windows Phone cool which
it's kind of difficult because like a
brand perception yes because like I was
turning around you know one of the
windows phones on t-mobile and I started
using an among friends and family and
everyone was like what is that is that a
windows phone you know like well yeah I
think your windows and people i mean i
wrote a call a couple weeks ago about
why we need Windows Phone 7 a lot of
comments work I can't buy it because
it's microsoft and its windows and it's
I mean I think that's a not really the
best attitude about it we had a way to
approach it but yeah then they you throw
in windows and people get a little they
think of the community the computer
operating system and they get all
freaked out about it so no I do the cool
tech test on my 15 year old nephew who's
really into technology and all the cool
stuff and I brought him the samsung
focus flash and the samsung focus s
which is the one that's like the galaxy
s2 phone but on
his phone and he basically is playing
with it I'm sure he'll think you can do
this this and this you can change the
colors you can do all this stuff it's 50
bucks you know for the newsflash and he
hands it back to me and he's like I
don't want to look at this anymore
because I'm going to want it and my dad
won't let me have a smartphone huh so he
thinks it's cool maybe he could be a new
spokesperson for windows phone I smell a
contractor exactly I'm so lettuce your
first um can I be any soon but I will
and I want to say it's your first CES
what have you learned um that it's very
crowded and very dry and that a lot more
celebrities actually come than I think
who else have you seen Justin Timberlake
came to kind of promote my face and try
to make it look cool again but the fact
that he was just here and I was looked
and I would I was only under the
depression that LL Cool J and maybe
Justin Bieber was here but her fever
yeah but justin timberlake came and I
thought it was really surprising though
you missed the the concert you want to
see which at t-mobile right yeah Colbie
Caillat this was that what she did play
at the tmobile concert no but we had a
good battle yeah we get it out before my
best celebrity sighting was Carly the
t-mobile girl yeah Brian and uh you know
what I mean okay celebrities are great
and all but I actually had a really
awesome moment this morning in front the
hotel when I saw a fisker karma super
electric you know I'm not a car guy so i
don't i'm not sure i don't know i just i
dig i dig electric cars and this is a
electric supercar that is really rare
