ribbon I'm Alfred Aang it's good to be
back for the craziness of Las Vegas at
CES one of the big themes of the show
had to be the back and forth between
Amazon's Alexa and Google assistant Ben
you you covered this pretty closely who
do you think won it's pretty obvious it
was Google but it was guy too
I mean I'm not Amazon's guy come on
so Google won it out obviously because
they spent a ton of money
yes he's spending an insane amount of
money on marketing so they just really
wanted to flood the zone at the show and
it's partly because they're right now
number two in smart speakers they're
like Amazon basically dominates right
now they have two-thirds of the market
in the United States with smart speakers
Google only has about a third and then
everybody else is kind of fighting over
the scraps right otherwise so that gives
Google a very good reason to spend I
don't know how much money they did on
Google the ride and really trying to do
like oh go ahead I was gonna ask though
why do you think they want just because
their names were everywhere like did
they actually have better products and
features come out over Amazon I mean I
think the marquee feature was the Google
Google to promote being able to
translate different language 27
different languages but yeah I was it
was definitely for me it was more of a
presence thing they were everywhere you
couldn't avoid seeing them they have a
lot of announcements to they a ton
where's Amazon house but they were just
there were announced to partners right
they didn't actively announce anything
themselves yeah yeah that's right and I
thought it was interesting like for
instance Lenovo came out with a product
that looks a lot like the echo spot so
that's that's you know the kind of rival
the like one of those Amazon products
KitchenAid came out with a smart display
uses Google assistance and iOS on has to
fight off KitchenAid of all companies so
there was just a lot that Google was
trying to stack up and I think they
definitely did a good job they also
advertised like crazy all over Las Vegas
so it was just if they were really
trying to make a big splash and show
folks that hey where he
and we're really looking to compete then
they did that job alright so another
theme from CES was foldable displays LG
surround us with its big screen rollable
Ola television
but I was looking from the phone
perspective royal flex PI was there it
was just like trying to start up with
this kind of janky foldable phone I
tried it actually hardware wise it
wasn't bad software wise it's a complete
mess but we just saw report in The Wall
Street Journal today that what more
phones are coming particularly Motorola
or Lenovo is bringing back the Motorola
RAZR as a $1500 flip phone I am what the
foldable display oh dude I'm good unless
you know they drop that price like
severely from I mean clearly this is not
meant for the typical user right this is
this is gonna be a novelty item this is
gonna be an item for the one-percenters
I'm a one-percenter I'm stinking rich
but I'm good all right well that I mean
look that's the future foldable phones
lastly Nike and yesterday unveiled its
new self-lacing shoes yesterday alfrid
take us through this well one of the
shoes like were they called yeah that so
adapt bb's this is the sequel to the
2016 hyperadapt 1.0 is that they came
out with they're gonna be available
February 17th for three hundred and
fifty dollars and you they tie
themselves based on an app that you get
through Nike or you can just you know if
you don't want to use your phone or give
Nike your data right it has buttons on
the sides one that is closer to the back
like will loosen it and then the one
closer to your toes well what he's
lighting it I just saw you just do a
front flip is there is there like an a
button on the app that pushes see the
difference in athletic ability based on
the tightness of the shoe yep they had
all these basketball players they're
like dunking basketballs and stuff but I
can't dunk a basketball I tried several
times shocker so I was like okay what
can I do so I put it really loose and I
tried the flip and then I put it really
tight and I tried the flip and it
definitely does make a difference
you feel like you have more grip and
control when it's really tightened
versus when it's like loose you're more
relaxed I can see that for when you're
just
like sitting down and just want to jello
and don't want to really tie to alright
for a full coverage tricks on scene at
Roger Chang and Fox Ruben I'm Alfred
Hank thanks for sitting
oh it's good to be back thanks again
everybody for joining us and thanks for
putting up with us during the mini
hiatus slash change a format there sorry
we don't really take the chat when we're
at CES it's more difficult cuz it's such
a revolving door on that stage but it's
still good to you know continue the
coverage and for anybody who is
subscribed to the audio podcast sorry
we're kind of ate up your inbox there's
a change from a four-minute show to a
25-minute show or whatever it was but
yeah as always we're back into the
normal swing of things so send in your
comments and questions what did you like
at CES but more importantly guys what
did you like at CES but why what did I
like you guys covered the business stuff
here today let's talk about the things
that piqued your person I mean I said
this last week but the the mouthguard
though washes your mouth five seconds
you know the thing is so ridiculous
don't try it even if it's a chance to
work I would brush your teeth it'll take
you two minutes and this takes ten
seconds right yeah Wow
I could write a novel with the time that
I buy more time so we're done stories
exactly Rogers a busy man like well no I
could I could I could make sure the
thorough clean and go 20 seconds or you
can do that but for two minutes like
it's recommended and then that'll like
you'll be brushing your teeth all that
time so that you don't have to brush
your teeth I take showers for three
hours so that I don't shower the rest of
the week that's the other one I like I
like the the boxer but no it's not meant
for individuals I think it's meant for
gyms but ideas like it actually scans
your stance it'll it'll shout directions
at you it'll tell you change like
totally move duck dodge I'm just play
Wii boxing dude mm-hmm
yeah I know I also mentioned this on
stage but I thought it was ridiculous
enough that it's worth mentioning again
the Lamborghini massage oh yeah $30,000
in size chair it's like a full body
thing just does it being a Lamborghini
addition make a difference it's like
meant to look like
borghini it's made by a different
company I don't remember what I thought
a friend oh yeah nice it's the Korea's
number one massage chair maker yeah well
maybe like it's so expensive that they
actually number them and make them
collector's items but I have no idea I
can't resell them if you like put your
butter there for like a month
or I mean like who would want to buy
like a used $20,000 massage chair anyway
it seems like all the coolest tech from
CES is like out of reach for anybody
that has like an average salary pretty
much I was mostly impressed with the
impossible burger yes yeah I really I'm
hoping to see more of that in stores
like right now the only times I've seen
it is at restaurants I like oh we stock
this but I'd like to be well you haven't
tried 2.0 yet no yeah I would like to be
able to try to get it as like a grocery
item I haven't either I'm actually
pretty eager to try cuz they I tried it
it seemed like it was a lot better than
1.0 which I have tried it's not that
green to me it was better I wasn't
really wowed by a simply the talk of the
show for sure 2.8 well they did a good
job of kind of you know zigging when
everybody else is agged
right in that you you're talking about
like a veggie patty at a tech show yes
so there are tech elements in making it
but at the same time it kind of stood
out in that it's not a grocery show so
yeah it was a just say I think this is
the first time food was allowed as like
an entry into CES look we can't use food
tech yeah yeah your your move beyond me
burgers up to you that's that's the
other guy yeah yeah someone in the chat
named Bonnie Gannon I'm not sure who
that is she says that you were really
really enamored by the property brothers
now weren't you been
I thank you for watching Bonnie that's
really great she was she was how did she
know that otherwise uh yeah I got to go
to their house and check out their cool
digs is the property brothers
compound oh they didn't invite me I kind
of just jumped over the fence you back
over the fence wait wait did they call
the compound I think they did because
like you know one of the brothers
how about its behind it like a gain and
howdy big no okay
no they could it could have a small cult
look I would say all right so yeah they
have a game room and a pool which
includes a projector screen so you can
like watch movies at the pool but I have
a brother's property that makes way more
sense that does make me more Sun so I'll
tell them that next time I talk to them
so yeah but yeah it was cool hanging out
we're gonna get more coverage from you
on that right yes yes yes and I
continued my celebrity hangouts at CES
last year was Tony Romo this year you
know my way up next year it'll be bring
I don't know Obama well we'll try you
look like the like the I like it there
Obama that let's spread to all these
conspiracy if there is on Twitter yeah
well I shot for Obama you went for
Alfred yeah the same way sure you can
watch all of the property brothers
features on Cena calm and on YouTube at
CNET we had them at the stage too and
for what it's worth the the past couple
of months with all of the chatter about
the property brothers
I don't watch Home &amp;amp; Garden so I'm
sitting around and you guys are talking
about these this show and it's like
what's so special about this we've seen
house flippers before this isn't
anything all that spectacular and then
you meet him in person and as a
heterosexual male you fall in love and
they are the most charming sweet
wonderful people and like the fact that
they're writing those children's books
now to was really really super cool so I
get it now guys I get the property
brothers yeah there you go yes I'm am a
fan all right next question Hector wants
to know what was the one product you
could not believe was a thing uh you
know what Katie wrote about this it was
like the like the emotional support
robot
oh right right that was a good one yeah
that was I have a hard time with that
like buy a dog your large high
maintenance they are but like they need
homes also homes more than a robot
privileged enough to be social and
friendly
and you know I know people whereas some
of us you know just don't like people
and like definitely relate to robots
more so but you could get a pet I mean
the whole idea is to be like a pet
supplement or pet replacements no that
doesn't hey you know what you guys are
making some pretty good points I'm gonna
have to start backpedaling now you take
away your kids like teddy bears and
stuff is a you know one of my kids one
of my kids walked around with a pair of
pants like that's his love is a bear
Lance yeah father yeah I see that's kind
of the perfect segue into what I thought
was an oddball and stemming off of what
storm Kings asking about any thoughts on
the machine that folds clothes oh I
didn't actually see it I just read about
it I mean there's just too much to see
the whole deal with this though like you
you still had to feed the clothes one by
one yeah and you had to sort of pre fold
them so it was not what I was hoping it
would be all the laundry definitely fold
closer this machine you should do a
challenge I mean we were gonna do that
but then we realize that was stupid oh
we need a Coinstar yeah always dumping
go tire pile we are their millennial
thing but do people still fold clothes
yes yes what I just hang it all up I put
on clothes hanger oh I thought
everything up I don't hang my jeans like
I like fold my jeans what about your
socks do you fold you know I fold those
two boxers I just throw that in a drawer
why do those my girlfriend's taken over
three of the closets and the watch tiny
you should be folding everything
organized everything that's organized
it's all in one drawer I guess all right
one other weird thing was the bread
making machine hella cool robot right is
it basically a vending machine yeah yeah
but it was still it was interesting I I
kind of think it's fun when things show
up at the show that aren't really
supposed to be there and that one
definitely got a lot
weird but still like the idea that you
could have your little corner market
that wouldn't be able to house a full-on
bakery I could put this in the corner
and say hey fresh baked but it's way too
expensive but yeah it is too expensive
but I mean it was a hundred thousand
dollars for a five or six year lease
yeah oh just a lease just on the moment
just the lease also whoever came up with
the headline for this on SEANET second
to none
give them a raise a lot of funds there
yeah well I mean it is her Forte yeah
she is quite rye oh god get out get out
all right moving on let's get some more
questions in before we got to wrap up
the show we are running out of time
the giant apple billboard outside CES
was kind of funny I'd still don't trust
it though that's from mark dybul I
thought that was a nice little jab and
twist of the knife but also not true
yeah that's a big fat lie what stays or
what something goes on your iPhone stays
your iPhone it's not remotely true yeah
I mean like if you're using the people
on your iPhone you're still sending
Google that data it's not like oh this
is where iCloud hacks let you like the
release of personal information like
clearly this stuff on your iPhone
doesn't always stay in your iPhone yeah
Apple also took like nine billion
dollars from Google to keep Google as a
default search engine so that you know
anytime you search for something on your
iPhone Google what they wanted out of
that it was one billboard it probably
didn't cost them that much and also
spurred a lot of discussion it was right
there right by LBCC mm-hmm like
perfectly placed by the Google they did
not need to Google was spending a ton of
money doing so many advertisements this
was one and they got a lot of precedent
that's why I'm not sure I don't really
agree if your assessment that Google won
this out just because they were
everywhere I don't know what the return
on their investment was like that's okay
they look at the ROI it's probably
questionable because they spent so much
money but I mean I would say I
agree with Ben's assessment that they
basically 1cs yeah description and also
just to share about announces that came
death from Google itself yeah
it wasn't gonna be Amazon for a third
year in a row like Google just like once
Amazon builds a ride then yes they'll
give it back to them sir enjoy mentions
did you notice that this year's CES
showcase more laptops and mainstream
computers in previous years I liked it
I think Dan Ackerman shared that
sentiment we should get him on the show
to kind of expand on the thought but did
you guys notice that as well yeah yeah I
mean it was an arm of the show that I
didn't pay focus as much on like I was
very much like looking at like what was
going on with the Amazon world I'll be
the bread butter at CES is often TVs and
appliances and laptops to a lesser
extent but I think this year there are a
lot more I don't know I'm still I remain
bored with laptops I mean yeah there
were some interesting things like a
unique Mouse right there kind of compare
it to the TV so the two that really
stood out to me were like LG had a
rolled old television and Samsung showed
off their like the whole yeah he's a
giant modular TV so made of micro LEDs I
think they shrunk it this year just show
that they can do that it could just it
doesn't just have to be this giant but
yeah people were very interested also in
the rollable TV they just thought it was
like a really interesting piece of
technology were talking about with
foldable phones is that the more you can
do this with display is the more
interesting stuff that's possible
probably one of the most interesting
things to look at was the LG waterfall
right the entrance to the LG booth had
all these flexible displays rolling
clouds and like see my kid like starry
nights yeah it was pretty mesmerizing to
watch it wasn't really cool I actually
liked and it's hard to say if I liked
that one more than last year's Canyon
the canyon was also really cool because
you walked through it yes oh good
because it was like right the entrance
is such a hall and like you had to fight
the crowds every time just to get
through there yeah I was worth it it was
pretty it was pretty nice like moths to
a flame we all just really like rolling
oh yeah Michael Browns asking if we saw
any smart health items there I know last
year we saw like the hit
air bags but what do we see this year
I'd like to go ahead and cite Clare's
my Segel adventure yes yep
there was actually a ton of health stuff
I think Bridget talked about that remote
ultrasound device that could connect to
your phone that really could
revolutionize how ultrasounds are taken
like either remotely on the field
because it just connects your phone and
then yeah Claire's bike air bag
yeah which basically the second you hit
the ground it goes just inflates right
which is pretty clever and upgrade over
like last year's like it was a belt what
the hip thing good thing yeah I guess I
don't know if it's the same company
though so there's Claire yeah they did
you can't tell what a truce is very
slender she's very committed yeah she
also got a chance to try out the massage
chair so she probably had the funnest
job of the show
that's very true yeah as we are running
out of time let's squeeze in the last
couple here from Timothy do what's the
percentage of gadgets that will not make
it to market oh god like 90% I wouldn't
go that high but yes I'm pretty sad to
go higher I would say like 95 so they're
just showing stuff off just for whatever
that's what CES is all about cool stuff
the vision of the next five years yeah I
don't know I mean yeah I mean there's a
number of products that they showed that
were already on the market for one thing
but a lot like the feature stuff the
stuff that's really cool or like stuff
you find in those evening conferences
show up because you're right all the
future of transportation stuff that we
were talking about the chances of any of
that reaching the market is pretty low
like there was like a flying taxi that
looked super futuristic like where the
hell is that axis looks like it was
straight out of a Terminator movie yeah
that was pretty awesome but yeah like
they're supposed to be in the running
for lubbers air taxi project so proves
my point
Uber's air taxi project come on
yep those that jumble of words will
never actually become a reality but then
also the autonomous vehicles like all
the autonomous cars which one looked
really cool the autonomous motorcycle
right like what totally why would you
even though you don't that's the whole
point they like did they did basically
to prove they could do it was terrifying
that's right when when Batman like
controls his motorcycle from like far
away to like catch up with him yeah
that's the only use I could see that for
whoa well we could use more crime
fighters I mean especially during the
government shutdown why not sure we
could use all the help we can get to
fight crime in this big setting yeah
please please do that alright we are out
of time everybody but thanks for joining
us and welcome back welcome back to us
welcome back to you it's good to be back
before we go some of the things we
weren't able to get to Samsung 75 inch 5
inch micro LED 4k TV the syringe eye
sighting apples big plan to open things
up the third party oh it's true and TV
and airplay on that list
I think air plays on that list too right
yes yes yeah it's nuts man I never
thought we'd see that day but yeah we'll
certainly be recapping some more CES
stuff but we're back in the groove will
have more headlines for you tomorrow
