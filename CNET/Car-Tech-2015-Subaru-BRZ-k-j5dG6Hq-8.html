fantastic time this is 2015 Subaru BRZ a
little sports car that in this very
short life went from being one of the
most overhyped cars to one of the most
underrated it's hot behind the wheel a
series of lewisham he would all deflect
about I would never want to get out of
this seat now a lot of automakers talk
about a driver focused cabin when they
talk about their sporty cars but this is
one of the truly driver-focused
interiors everything just falls nicely
into the hand from the steering wheel
the shifter the pedals are at a nice
spot for heel toeing just a very good
place to pilot this vehicle and do
nothing else there aren't even buttons
on the steering wheel now the BRZ
separates itself from the Scion with a
touchscreen infotainment system that's
going to give you navigation and HD
radio a whole lot of different bells and
whistles right out of the box and
they're all in this box right here now
one nice feature that the top-tier BRZ
models get is this little red button
right here that's going to indicate that
we have push button start and keyless
entry it's a really cool convenient
feature now Subaru BRZ gets a lot of
grief from the enthusiast community for
being a little underpowered but at 200
horsepower and 151 pound-feet of torque
I think this lightweight little sports
car has enough current to have a really
good time powered by this 2-liter
horizontally imposed four-cylinder
engine that's gonna be made it up with a
6-speed automatic or a 6-speed manual as
in this case transmission and one of the
things you'll notice is that fintan is
now is very low down and very far back
into the engine bay that's gonna help
this card's balance and it's gonna
contribute to that really good handling
that we'll see in a second this is a
rewarding drive there's enough power for
the chassis everything feels
well-balanced everything falls nicely in
the hand branches
torts not that great you find yourself
in too tall of a gear or in the wrong
gear at a stoplight and you will get
straight walked on by guy even Toyota
Camrys but when the road gets twisty
they will not be having nearly as much
fun I mean this isn't a car that's about
power it's about balance and it's about
the tribe being second nature the car
sort of being almost telepathic and I'm
getting a lot of that from here now it's
been pointed out then there is a little
bit of artificial miss to this cars
driving joy I mean it's got a great
platform for handling but a lot of that
sort of like tail out happiness that you
get in a turn doesn't really come from
power it come from the fact that if cars
been basically saddled with tires that
are too narrow and don't offer enough
grip but while they're not outright the
fastest setup they are a lot of fun
especially when you've got the VSC sport
setting on this car and you get a little
tail happy coming out of a corner now
this series blue Edition has cool
basically a lot of visual upgrades you
got a black body kit you've got black
wheels red painted brake calipers there
aren't very many performance upgrades
unless you count the extra aerodynamics
of the body kit I don't know if it's
actually worth the extra money on this
particular vehicle this is the kind of
car that you want to keep the cost low
and keep things simple keep you sweet
now the 2015 Subaru BRZ starts at about
twenty five six nine five but this
series blue Edition with all of the
extra body kit and interior upgrades is
gonna start at about $29,000 a
destination feed and you're looking at
just a hair over $30,000 for a 200
horsepower sports car now for that sort
of money you can get a very
well-equipped v6 Ford Mustang but now
we're talking about a very different
kind of vehicle that's more power this
is more finesse actually think the
biggest competitor to this is going to
be at thigh on batched when the FRS
which gets you all the driving thrills
with less frills for less money</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
