sequel to something I've never seen
which is the Dark Crystal my favorite
piece tonight is the tron page each in
burton superman movie and I just
appreciated the optimism in that piece
so much it's true your favorite cult
classics are getting sequels at least
they are at i am a fit wait what is I'm
a pit we make rad stuff maybe I can take
a crack at this I am a pit is where the
geekiest fandoms become cool we produce
art shows experiences also coming to
that like physical things fans can
interact with but bringing game worlds
or pop culture worlds to life I am a pit
was founded over 10 years ago and with
that founding John and Amanda needed a
space that could handle pretty much
anything they could dream up space were
in right now was an old video store AKA
porn shop yeah it was a porn shop so
when you walk into I'm a pit you enter
the front gallery which is the space
where now sort of combined a gallery
wall with a retail wall and then if you
continue forth into the bath it's a
3,400 square-foot warehouse space and
that can be many things what are those
many things is sequel to which is an
exhibition that gives artists the
opportunity to dream up never been
produced sequels and prequels for movies
that we all know and love it's something
that looks super real that Warner
Brothers or universal might get into a
theater chain but it's only 20 of these
were ever made opening night is always a
party there is friendly conversation
drinks music video and of course the art
they managed to find a nice balance
having art that reflects
people now and really seeking out niches
there is nothing that Mike
and at the same time there are a lot of
things that really make me laugh this is
a really cool visualization the stuff we
sort of talked about in joke about for
many attendees this wasn't their first
time and i am a pin in fact they come
not just for the art for the community
we just wanted to be a very welcoming
place where you could kind of make it
what you wanted vers it being a club or
just an art gallery or just something
else it's just meant to be whatever you
needed to be our website is always
offering everything that is available in
the store with very few exceptions so if
we have art on the walls it's also on
our website so and we ship worldwide
there are a lot of people out there who
think geek pop culture and fine art
shouldn't mix but fortunately for us I
am a fit has a decidedly different
opinions r is for everybody so it's not
just about putting a poster on your wall
it's about caring about that thing and
have an experience with our telling a
story</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
