football team on David Katz Meyer here
Jets fan and senior CNET editor I'm
Jamie Odell CBS sports.com host all
right budget we're talking kids in
college coming out of college you know
people that just don't want to spend a
lot but they do want high quality so
what's your best recommendation for a
budget TV well the less expensive TVs
are the smaller ones and among those TVs
like up to 55 inches we really like Roku
TV they're available from a few
different brands they have a built in
Smart TV system from Roku that's great
the advantage there is that you get you
don't to add an extra Smart TV box to
watch Netflix and all those other things
so you also get access to umpteen apps
on that device it's really simple to use
system so Roku TVs for the for the
inexpensive pick if you want to get a
cheap TV at a very large screen size
videos eseries is our secondary pick for
the budget line they go up to 70 inches
all right so if you do want to open up
your wallet a little bit wider for the
mainstream football fan someone who
wants to take in as much as they can
throughout the weekend of either college
football or NFL what would you recommend
the Vizio m-series it's available in a
65 inch for 1500 a 70 inch model for 2
grand and an 80 inch size for 4000 bucks
those prices are really good it's a 4k
TV the picture quality is excellent so
it's our best overall pick especially if
you want that big screen without
breaking the bank
and that still falls within your
recommendation of starting at 60 and
working your way up when it comes to
screen size all right high-end TVs
someone wants to really show off what
they got when they have all their
friends over for Super Bowl 50 on CBS
what do you go for money to burn
oullette hands-down there's a technology
from LG called OLED it really does
produce spectacular picture quality to
65 inches about $5,000 still really
expensive for that size let's say you
want to go even bigger there's a 75 inch
Sony for about six thousand dollars not
quite a good pictures OLED but still 75
inches come on bigger the better more
money the better David Katz Meyer tells
you to go 70 inches and spend $10,000
absolutely
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
