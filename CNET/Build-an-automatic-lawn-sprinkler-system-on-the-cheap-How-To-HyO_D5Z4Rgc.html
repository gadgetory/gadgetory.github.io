care of Lana is well let's just say it's
a new concept now that I've moved to
Louisville Kentucky owned a house and a
lawn for the first time I really need to
learn proper lawn care I know that
regular watering is essential to having
a healthy lawn but I don't have a
traditional irrigation system and I'm
not going to spend thousand dollars to
get one but after a little research and
tinkering though I've MacGyver the
solution that does the same job for a
fraction of the price the core of my
lawn watering system is the $40 quick
snap sprinkler kit a compact rotating
sprinkler which attaches to ordinary
garden hoses the other half of my system
is the $35 orbits single dial hose
faucet timer this is a valve controlled
by an electronic timer which sits
between your outdoor faucet and a garden
hose you might also need to use a few
water hose adapters to extend the reach
of your home's outdoor faucet don't
worry they're pretty inexpensive about 4
to 5 dollars each at your local hardware
store to hook up everything I first
attach a hose extender to my faucet then
I connect that to the water timer next I
screwed my garden hose to the other end
of the timer then I connected the quick
snap adapter to the other end of the
hose after that I dug a small hole in a
plot facing my lawn then I place the
sprinkler in the hole and connected it
to the hose after testing the sprinkler
and making tweaks for amount of rotation
and aim I filled in the hole and set my
timer I now have a sprinkler that covers
my front lawn independently functions
when and for how long I want and without
paying through the nose or digging
trenches follow these steps and you too
could have an irrigation system on the
cheap
