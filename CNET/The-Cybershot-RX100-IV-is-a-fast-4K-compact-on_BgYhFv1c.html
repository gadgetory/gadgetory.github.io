the sony cybershot DSC rx100 for as an
advanced compact for video enthusiasts
rather than a straight-up advanced
compact like the m3 at least until the
price drops a bit though it's more
expensive and adds a plethora of video
capabilities it pretty much delivers
roughly the same photo quality and
design I'm Lori Gruner for cnet and this
is the sony cyber-shot rx100 for the m4
remains one of the most pocketable
cameras of its type with it's still
ingenious pop-up viewfinder the only
change from the previous model is on the
mode dial finally merges the three auto
modes into a single auto to make room
for the high frame rate option otherwise
it has the same great design which
includes the pop-up viewfinder a
tiltable flash a flip up LCD and a
control ring on the lens for adjusting
selected settings on the other hand some
of the negatives remain the grip less
body is still slippery I don't like the
small flat movie button and it lacks a
hot shoe new for the rx100 line is 4k
recording with tons of video friendly
settings like framing markers control
over zoom speed time coding user bit
options and the ability to
simultaneously record to card and send
clean HDMI out to a recorder like the m3
it supports picture profiles which allow
you to control tonal range rendering in
movies and unlike previous models the m4
also supports tethered shooting via
Sony's remote camera control software it
also has a high frame rate mode for
capturing two or four seconds to create
short slow motion videos it's both a fun
and frustrating feature and seems
ill-suited to spur the moment recording
camera has excellent single shot
autofocus performance and decent
continuous autofocus it's tested rate of
five point seven frames per second for
JPEGs and five frames per second for raw
both for at least 30 shots and with
autofocus very good for its class in the
limited number of situations where you
can forgo autofocus and auto exposure
usually when people are standing on one
place moving just parts of their bodies
Sony's speed priority continuous
do 10 frames per second with the
mechanical shutter and 16 frames per
second with electronic despite using a
completely new but the same size and
resolution sensor the images from the m4
look quite similar to those from the m3
it has slightly better noise performance
in low light with more detail preserved
in dark areas but there are no real
obvious enhancements so the photo
quality is quite good but still not
best-in-class the video though looks
excellent and the picture profiles give
you significant control over the tonal
range I still have trouble getting the
highlights to keep from blowing out in
bright light that's typical though if
you're looking for the best pocket
camera for video experimentation this is
currently the best option but there are
also cheaper choices which may suit
those purposes as well for the full
review hop on over to cnet com I'm Lori
Audrina for cnet and this is the sony
cybershot DSC rx100 for</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
