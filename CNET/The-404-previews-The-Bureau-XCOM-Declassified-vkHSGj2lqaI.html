game at e3 called XCOM now it's not the
excom that we all know from last year
the real x turn-based strategy game this
was a game that took that original XCOM
brand and turned it into a first-person
shooter so this specific game was
actually in the works to be a
first-person oh yeah and then they
switched it right and I got to see the
game and play a very significant amount
of it wait so you said it's not a first
person shooter anymore so it is it's a
third person tactical shooter where
you're in charge of a team of a team
alright so there you have it there doing
some really interesting stuff of this
game and the whole thing with XCOM is
that it's this very uh you know it's a
sort of secret agency that gets test
with dealing with the sailing invasion
during the 1960's and it's not like
major American cities they're these you
know sort of sub suburbian you know not
really that's not Manhattan there
they're out in the west around the
Midwest and you control a character who
basically has to man entire team and the
gameplay is sort of it's like it's like
real-time strategy meets third-person
shooting where you can pause time and
load up the sort of wheel kinda like
sort of like Mass Effect Dragon Age
games yes exactly okay but the thing is
is like it's all really happening in
real time so you can totally thought
when you open the wheel it's everything
still going on right but it's slow it's
slowing down almost to a crawl and in
that wheel part of that pie is
controlling all the case your other
characters so when you choose let's say
target you know you can have one
character shooting at a target and you
assign the targets and the other
character you can you know move away on
the mat when you enter that mode you
sort of hover over the playing map and
can sort of just drop him where you want
um so there's a really interesting
element with that I spoke to Nico bihari
who is the senior producer of this game
and he had some really insightful stuff
because you know this game there's a big
history of X com
and this game is is definitely honoring
that you know conservative sort of style
of gameplay but at the same time it's
bringing it into a level where I think
people will identify with it most
because of games like mass effect if you
played mass effect you're gonna like
this game just because it controls in a
similar fashion you're really going to
be able to be like wow I have total
control over this team almost more so
than mass effect because you can
literally place them where you want
messe fig you could so how does that
work there like in a helicopter and I
know so you have a team on the ground
uh-huh and you also they just run to
that location right but you can sort of
when you're paused in that in that um
you know you kind of do this like
quarterback move where your they call it
combat quarterback right yeah so you
sort of pause the action and then you
move out basically a cursor to anywhere
in the map and the view got us tonight
to the writer flank to the left you
assign these guys to go do that so it's
really kind of cool in that regard
because they it's it's also responsive
and it really makes sense when you're
playing it it's a little intimidating in
the beginning because you're sort of
given a lot of responsibility and a lot
of options at once and I just want
people to know that this is not a game
we could just go in guns blazing you're
gonna get wrecked yeah you're gonna get
messed up real nice you gotta be
tactical and got to be strategic and you
gotta really plan out your your your
attack um you know from from the
beginning uh so you know there's an
interesting sort of element I really
like the era it's taking place in that
sixties sort of environment where
everyone's wearing jeans or flannels
well that was like everyone's got like
the suspenders and they're just like
they just look like they're at a Mad Men
yeah you know what I mean it's sort of
like madmen meets american horror story
in the sense that it's got that set that
sixty sensibility juxtaposed against
this really bizarre paranormal alien
invasion so I think there's a lot that
people are going to dig with that and
what does this come out this comes out
