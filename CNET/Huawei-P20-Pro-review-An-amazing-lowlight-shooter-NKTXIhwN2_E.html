immediately catch your eye with Huawei's
latest flagship p20 Pro the bonkers
color and the fact that it's got three
cameras on the back three cameras might
seem overkill that they do play an
important role
image information is combined from the
20 megapixel black-and-white sensor and
the 14 megapixel color sensor to create
10 megapixel images which although
smaller in size have much better detail
and contrast and exposure than you do it
otherwise gap that's the idea anyway and
I have actually been very impressed with
what this camera can do outdoor shots
are vibrant crisp and sharp the auto
software tries to recognize scenes to
boost them to give them a bit more
vibrance and while I loved how easily it
recognized this stand of trees as
greenery I actually am NOT that keen on
how much it's boosted the saturation of
the greens does make it look a little
bit unnatural the third lens provides a
zoomed in view either three or five
times depending on how close you want to
get to the action but when the light
goes this phone really shines low light
is typically when most phone cameras
fail but the p20 pros larger sensor size
and stabilizing software let this phone
snap the best low-light images I've ever
seen from a phone even dark dingy bars
like this one are captured well with
plenty of detail visible in the shadows
while neon lights on the walls remain
properly exposed East London city
streets were exposed in all their gritty
detail with static items like walls or
street lamps remaining pin-sharp despite
me hand holding the phone better yeah
I'm extremely impressed with the rest of
the phone as well I just love this pink
and blue colour and the metal in glass
design makes it feel extremely premium
to hold it's waterproof
- so snapping photos and the rain
shouldn't be too much of an issue it's
powerful enough to handle any task
you're asked of it and the chunky four
thousand milliamp an hour battery will
comfortably keep you going through a day
of use the 6.1 inch display is bold and
crisp and yes there's the notch at the
top of the screen although you can turn
that off if you'd prefer all of which
makes this phone an excellent piece of
kit overall and definitely the one to
consider if you're not that first with
the galaxy s 9 or you simply just can't
wait for nightfall to go out shooting in
your favorite grimy
