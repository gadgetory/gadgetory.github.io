I'm cnet's Cara tsuboi joined by senior
writer Casey Newton in kc we're talking
about a new video that was released
today allegedly showing off a new hot
product from google tell us about the
product and why it's alleged so earlier
this afternoon a video showed up on the
internet that purported to show
something called the Chromebook pixel
which would be if the video is accurate
the first Google designed Chromebook and
the first touch screen Chromebook and
this is something that has been rumored
since roughly November and now a video
has leaked and we think that that's what
this is now first of all no comment yet
from google saying whether or not this
is true that's right they have not
confirmed that it exists and so we've
been trying to do a little bit of
digging to see where the video came from
but based on some more digging we think
that there's a good chance that it's a
real laptop right i mean the rumors are
you know go back to the fall and you
know google has kind of intimated that
they might be getting into both of these
spaces yeah in november there were
reports coming from some asian news
sources saying that google was working
on a touch powered chromebook that had a
12 point eight five inch screen if you
look at the video it seems like this
this one would be in the ballpark okay
and why do we think that this video
could be the real thing and not just a
hoax so the video was produced by a
company called slinky based in mountain
view just like Google is it was started
by an ex-googler and this guy's name is
victor coke posted on his Google+ page
that slinkies website had been hacked
and all of their videos had been
released to the public before their time
he actually apologized and tagged sergey
brin the co-founder of google in that
post also posted a notice on his website
saying that had been hacked so it seems
like there has been some kind of hacking
going on which does lend credence to the
idea that this is a real video and maybe
showing a real product sure I mean the
video is slick it's well produced it's
got a nice voiceover but perhaps leaked
what couple weeks or months before it's
really ready it's hard to say you know
google loves to show off stuff at Google
i/o their developer conference that's
going to be in May this
that's only a few months away hmm well
keep us posted if you hear anything more
I mean obviously it's going to be an
interesting hot product anything
touch-enabled these days is a big deal
absolutely we're starting to see touch
come to more and more laptops it makes
sense that Google would get into this
market and lots of the early comments
from that I've heard from people they
just can't wait to get their hands on it
interesting good backstory to thank you
so much senior writer Casey Newton I'm
