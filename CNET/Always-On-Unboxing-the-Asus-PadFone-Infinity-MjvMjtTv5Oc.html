the ax sous padfone infinity and I know
that padfone remains the most mockable
name on earth but they've actually made
some inroads with this thing and the
padfone infinity is the newest version
of their convertible phone plus tablet
let's get it up
mm all right
infinity there's pretty impressive specs
and it's pretty expensive but maybe
it'll you know prove worthy look two
separate boxes for one Transformer style
device oh how exciting it's like a
double unboxing here's the infinity
station which is the tablet part finiti
station oh my gosh where to begin how
about the phone the phone is their guts
of the whole thing and it is well look
at this it's kind of an interesting size
cuz it's a pretty big phone but it's not
very wide it's not quite as phablet e as
I expected it to be to be honest though
ah instead of a sous they've actually
gotten with padfone branding here but
look at that nice brushed aluminum back
that's kind of hot inside this box we
have this sort of expected charging
brick USB micro USB which I love for
charging and some headphones anything
else headphone changes and that is all
let's see what's inside our infinity
station box
you
the hook
I did it run it out of room here okay so
here's the docking station really a lot
of plastic in this packaging can I just
take another minute and say that so not
quite this day in brushed aluminum but
you can see there's the space here to
dock it and then other than that is a
very very iPad looking tablet that I
finger printed up pretty much
immediately not very oleophobic screen
there see here yeah slides right and put
you where you have a red dot
hello anyone oh there we go I have to
admit if you really want a tablet or you
want to take it on the plane that's kind
of cool all right but let's run down the
specs and see if those also impress the
asus padfone infinity is made up of a
5-inch LTE smartphone that becomes a
10.1 inch tablet when it's docked into
the infinity station the phone part of
the PadFone as a 1.7 gigahertz Qualcomm
Snapdragon 600 quad-core processor
pretty impressive power their graphics
are powered by an Adreno 320 GPU it also
has two gigs of RAM to help out that
snappy performance the phone runs
Android jellybean 4.2 the phone's
display is a 5-inch super IPS screen it
has an impressive 1920 x 1080 resolution
delivering 441 pixels-per-inch basically
the screen looks good it has a
rear-facing 13 megapixel camera with an
LED flash a sous is talking up this
camera it apparently has lagless shutter
speeds and a dedicated image sensor for
improving low-light photos plus it has
burst mode of up to a hundred photos in
a row while recording 1080p HD video
have to try that up the front facing
camera is no slouch either at a full 2
megapixels storage is also decent the
PadFone is available in either 32 gig or
64 gig models and it comes with 50 gigs
of free cloud storage for two years the
phone has a 2,400 milliamp hour battery
so expect decent if not awesome battery
life as for the tablet the 10.1 inch
display offers a pretty impressive 1920
x 1200 resolution the tablets front
facing camera is a disappointing one
megapixel though if you're into tablet
based video chat other than that there's
a micro USB 2.0 port and that's about it
luckily since this is two devices in one
the padfone infinity shell sports a five
thousand milliamp hours battery which is
sue says can deliver 40 hours of 3g talk
time when the PadFone is doc but if you
want to be a transformer you have to pay
for it being
d set costs at least nine hundred and
fifty dollars ouch check out our full
cnet hands on over at cnet com now the
one thing that's really bumming me out
about the Padfone infinity phone because
I kind of want to start using it today
is that it's the first non-apple phone
to use nano SIM so the regular micro sim
card that you're using in your AT&amp;amp;T or
tmobile phone it's not gonna fit you're
gonna have to cut it down or take it to
your carrier's store and have them cut
it down for you want wang so i've been
playing with the Padfone infinity long
enough to figure out how to change the
language to english and get it all
docked and i have to say i'm getting
kind of a crush on it i can kind of see
it I see the promise because I use my
phone for everything and then I could
just plug it in here and have a totally
synchronized experience with at least
according to a sous 64 hours of battery
left now it's possible that I'm just
developing a crush on how pretty it is
but no of course then I just remembered
how it cost a thousand dollars I'm
probably out but it's neat at half the
price
