me I hate maintaining separate estates
of things separate collections of music
separate collections of apps you know
you get little buckets and everything
everywhere these days on all your
devices
that's where mirrorlink technology may
offer some relief this used to be called
terminal mode at Nokia technology it's
now become part of a large consortium of
companies that want to basically do this
let you take what's on your smartphone
let that be the hub of what happens in
your car and use the display of your
head unit and the amplification maybe
the radio to just sort of serve the
phone let me show you what I mean by
that so here I am with a Nokia Lumia and
I take a USB cable that goes into this
Sony head unit which were using for
demonstration as you can see when I do
that it wakes up and says aha I'm
connected to a mirrorlink
technology-enabled head unit it's now
going to establish a connection over
this cable notice that we've gone into
drive mode on the phone and this is not
a drive mode you can escape like on
Android you can't just say I'll go to my
desktop of apps right now so I can screw
or not with Facebook no you are in drive
mode as long as you're connected here
then go to this mirror link selection on
the head unit because this is certified
to work this way
and notice what we've got a perfect
replication of what's on the phone to
the screen the difference is what's on
the screen is bigger mounted stable and
of course connected to amplification and
other technologies coming into the head
unit you put this in your glove box
basically and say I'm done with the
phone you can make your calls here it's
nice and big it's an easy read out you
can have a navigation app here like it
says for Drive music all of these are
services will be built in by the phone
maker onto their handset with their
software stack and then echoed on the
screen it's not a very complementary
term but basically this becomes a dumb
display and all the processing the app
load and all of that is on the phone
now notice though that none of this says
that the head unit maker has to sit on
the sidelines and just make the dumb
display they can also put in a tuner
navigation their own Pandora
or all of these can also live under
mirrorlink that's where you get the
flexibility to decide if you want to go
all mirrorlink
phone centric or if you want to spread
some of the functionality across to
different devices now the roadmap on
this is that the mirrorlink people in
2013 want to get app developers onboard
I'm not showing you a lot of apps right
here kind of just a few basics they want
to get the app developers on board
sometime around Mobile World Congress in
2013 and the other thing I'm waiting for
is when can they get an OEM supplier to
the automakers to build this technology
into a vehicle that comes off the
factory floor because the aftermarket is
not where the action is anymore this has
got to become something installed within
factory cars they're also talking about
that taking route in 2013 so the big
idea here is manage your phone your
media your apps your settings your
preferences all of that here and not
have to duplicate replicate or recreate
that on what's built into your dash you
still have the choice of doing that but
you have the choice of also simplified
now the folks behind mirror length the
car connectivity consortium they're
going to run a curated app presence once
those apps start to arrive you can't
just stick any app here access any app
you install they'll make sure that they
are automotive contextual useful for the
driver and done in a way that is low
distraction and very reliable and
function I like the idea we watching it
in 2013 see other potential develops</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
