looking for a winner between these two
it's not happening there's not a giant
difference between the performance and
quality of these two consoles they both
start at $300 but that said on paper the
Xbox 1s is a more feature packed machine
it supports 4k upscaling of Xbox one
games and can stream 4k content from
services like Netflix and play 4k
blu-rays natively the ps4 slim this is
just a replacement it isn't an upgrade
thanks to a firmware update it can now
handle HDR like the Xbox 1s but that's
not really a big deal because there
really isn't
HDR games and content for standard PS
fours if 4k and HDR is a selling point
for you it seems like the smart move is
to wait for the ps4 Pro and hook that up
to a 4k HDR capable TV the Xbox 1s can
get you 4k functionality right now but
it won't be nearly as powerful as the
ps4 Pro
at the end of the day it's really about
the games the library of exclusive games
and what console your friends have you
want to play with them online
that's what should dictate what you're
going to buy if you're only concerned
about having 4k compatibility and HDR
then yeah
Xbox 1s is the way to go keep in mind
Project Scorpio is due out later next
year and that's going to be Microsoft's
answer to the ps4 Pro you're simply
choosing between a ps4 slim and an Xbox
one s you need to ask yourself what's
more important to you if exclusive games
isn't a deciding factor and it's 4k
streaming and upscaling that you're
primarily concerned with the Xbox one S
is your console now it's worth noting
the ps4 slim the 500 gigabyte model that
can currently be had for $300 with
uncharted 4 packed in that's a great
deal one minor omission on the ps4 slim
though and that's the optical out port
Sonam removed it and if you're like me
and you use third party surround sound
headsets that's not going to work with
this but if you use a receiver for sound
or hook it right into your TV you're
good to go
are you still unsure you might be so you
can hit me up on Twitter and I can help
you out
