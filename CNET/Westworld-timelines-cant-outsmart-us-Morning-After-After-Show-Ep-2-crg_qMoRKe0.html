morning after after show I'm Patrick I'm
Lin I'm Caitlin and we're all seeing
that editors who are big fans of the
show Westworld today we're going to talk
about episode 2 titled reunion reunion
of who I don't know but if you have not
seen season one or season 2 you probably
shouldn't be watching us unless you're
like our mom or dad hi mom hi dad
but yeah who are you what are we reunion
being here a lot a lot a lot everything
from the past to the present I guess
probably not the future but we're not a
hundred percent sure where we exist on
all these timelines right yeah yeah
really I think a lot of the big themes
of the episode revolved around Delos and
the company and how you know we know so
little about it up until this episode we
really got our biggest look yet at Logan
dillos his father James dela Papa dillos
and how William came to Lake edge his
way into the company I think it was
really fascinating yeah that's also I
feel like sometimes when you have like
those sequels where like you see like
famously the sequels of The Matrix
really I don't want to see all like the
behind the scenes stuff of the company
here I thought it was done really well I
don't really like it and I was like
really excited I might you could just
lead the whole episode in this like
first timeline yeah and it was
fascinating to me if that's a need to
see let's start with Doris looking out
the window she was part of the Argos
initiatives pitch they were gonna bring
to show Logan Dell owes and proved to
him like look where we are in the world
of robotics look how far we've come look
what we can do we can pretty much trick
your brain and we learned that Logan got
kind of discombobulated when he realized
that everybody in the room with him was
a hoax I loved it when he said I thought
this is a private meeting and then she
was like angela was like yeah it is
dun dun dun and we're like am i in a
flash mob is this what's going on it and
he's like poking and prodding everyone
and he really was just enamored by all
these things and then he saw Angela and
he's like alright cool first thing I'm
gonna do is
get yeah hey we have this Internet first
thing we do is sex you have first thing
you do is you haven't seen that price
like you go straight for the face pretty
typical technology but I liked it in
that scene when it was like Angela and
another couple with another man and male
and female host so still sticking to the
Logan bisexual Canon I feel which I
appreciate I have like one of my
favorite little moments of that that
moment was seeing Clementine at the
piano not also because they rickrolled
us earlier and before the season aired
they released that video for but also
just the fact that we start seeing some
that people we already know and a lot of
hosts that we don't know and then on top
of that like just as we think of like
we're in the world tech we see tons of
like product amounts of stuff like how
badass of like a demos like that it's
like oh she's not where all of them they
don't even need one more thing that is
your thing yeah one of your mind blow
this is cool
well I think that is really fascinating
because the next one that we see of Dell
is shortly after is william bringing
papadelis to Westworld
we can kind of assume you were took you
and i were talking about it how this
takes place after William and Logan have
already been there right now he's
working through what's had their issues
yeah last you saw him was naked on a
horse right cause he said he remarks on
his son yeah he was like oh my screw-up
of a son and we we know that if you end
up naked on a horse something probably
bad happen to you or it was college so a
horse holy jalapenos OEC William is
bringing della Sera to be like look at
the potential that this place has look
at how it could you know not only help
people find themselves but also help us
learn about them that's super creepy oh
no I like that like papadelis Scottish
maybe the house represents old money but
also the fact that he just like
lands a helicopter in the middle of this
vulnerable world we saw in the first
season and this literally kicks his feet
up and I also it's kind of creepy that
we see now it's like I kind of like
Logan
better than what I've liked Logan
starting the last episode of first
season why is that in that he was it was
like revealed that Hewitt had more sense
and he was more grounded than William
because unlike William he never got lost
into it and he was a little mean he was
kind of stabbing a lot of the hosts but
but he like never lost sight of what
they actually were even though it was
short-sighted that he didn't know that
they could achieve consciousness but
even then William didn't care about the
consciousness either he was like
infatuated but then he just started
wanting to own the game as man in black
and Logan was the in the end was like
the one that had the good head on their
shoulders it's like don't fall in love
with these people like all right these
machines and stuff like that and William
on top of that it's like also gives the
papadelis the like great piece of
it-it's like look it's maybe not right
now there's not money in this but like
people are themselves from there they're
free of all the things and like heirs
they put on we could get a lot of
information about that I think it's what
happened to him yeah yeah yeah and
they'll look at the data center like oh
everyone wants to be a murderer and a
rapist so I guess I don't know the value
of that kind of data but yeah well I
think I think it's like that yeah the
family side of things is probably why
I'm guessing this is before all six
parks are running or however many parks
yeah we have no idea what the timeline
is on how they've created all six parks
we know that there's West Portland's
Shogun world but we haven't seen Shogun
world yet and we know there's a park
where that Bengal tiger came from still
it feels like we're old sting look at it
great I would never visit good luck even
if I can't get injured like I'm good I'm
out don't need to but I think it's
interesting to to see that like William
when he takes Delos around you see them
all all the hosts freeze but William
purposefully directs the action toward
Dolores he purposefully knows exactly
where she's gonna be he really like says
the
the can getting picked up and Dayla
Della's kind of just throws it on the
ground like he's still just zeroing in
on her and it's another moment where we
almost have that meeting and we just
pass straight by but that's like that
doesn't seem healthy like I don't think
I want this guy given me as a CEO all
this advice if I'd known that he what he
I mean yeah my son
messed up naked horse guy horrible
experience I'm embarrassed the father
but then if this guy's like obsessed
with a robot and like is making
decisions well he doesn't see that this
I'm saying like it just I we see that at
another level it is ridiculous and that
being said the thing it's interesting
the timing of that since again
real-world especially with news of
Facebook recently with selling our data
as well as pretty much I feel like I've
had my data stolen from everything from
credit cards at this point to emails to
social media so it feels like maybe
Delos and Westeros a little more of her
criticism about our modern culture and
social media so we have the second part
of our interview with Simon quarterman
who plays Lee Sizemore and he actually
talks a bit about social media and some
of the other relevant themes of
Westworld season 2 it's all well I think
as well I think with social media it's
all about creating a story of how you to
be perceived to the outside world we're
constantly we're all storytellers aren't
we're all you know covering up our own
story and how we'd like to be seen in
this world and so that doesn't differ so
much from Westworld so in a way we've
all got a little likely Sizemore over
there no self and we because it did the
complexity of that of the scripts that
we're reading and and you're getting
thrown into it you know pretty quickly
we're moving fast you tend to just
concentrate pretty heavily on what's
going on in your in your in your thrust
you know you're through line your your
story so I don't get so heavily bogged
down with what's going on I get very
brief you know I get a basic
understanding what
going on which which is great from when
I'm watching it because it's things I
didn't even know that I've popping up in
front of me and it's wonderful I think
it would be a story of redemption you
know and a story of someone discovering
really who they were you know and how
they got to that who knows and how they
had to have a what they had to go
through in order to get there there
would be would be the thing to think
about I came off it about two years ago
and it's honestly one of the best things
I've ever done it's amazing how much
space it takes up and you don't even
know it until you've kind of got you got
rid of it sucks you in and just the next
thing you know you just scrolling
through like everyone's life and then
it's like an hours passed ablack Drive
it myself around star wars I think Game
of Thrones
I think his points about social media
are really valid we are writers we enjoy
crafting tales and sharing those with
people but the key point the key
difference really in West world is that
you aren't really crafting anything
you're just trying to live you're trying
to immerse yourself in this world and
what's scary is now thinking that this
corporation this multimedia conglomerate
is watching you and judging all your
movements it's scary like Facebook yeah
I think the parallels are super easy to
all the questions Facebook has been
facing recently but I mean it gets to
the bigger question like what they
explore a little bit I think more in the
first season is like why you would go
there I mean the idea of like being in
the Wild West or living out these
fantasies is one thing but then within
those fantasies and that's that that
lovely scene and
with papadelis is the fact that like
that's what you're the most free is what
they're theorizing yes on the flip side
of that though that's also when you're
most free it's also is not how we
present ourselves online we don't
present ourselves right that's who we
are
yeah but when we talk about this kind of
judgement thing there is an interesting
note that man in black says to Lawrence
where he says that West world is a place
for people to sit in peace and then that
it's that kind of data he hinted at that
data being collected but he says but the
purpose is not judgment it's for
something else and that is a hint to
something what you said more nefarious
is happening and I think that's like an
interesting point that he brought up so
one of the things that season one was
those intricate timelines and I was
curious to see if they were gonna be
able to keep that up for season two but
they certainly have it's like more
intricate and even more disorienting
which i think is maybe even a signal of
like kind of letting go trying to make
sense of it even though lots of people
love that because the characters aren't
making sense of that and I imagine even
the actors aren't making sense of it but
then that also brings us back to like
are the things we happening kind of like
the cyclical thing or is it like a
predetermined thing I don't know what do
you think kind of relates to I think and
I keep thinking about this over and over
again is the philosophy of like eternal
return and it's this ancient Indian
philosophy that people are predetermined
and just destined to live out these
lives over and over and over again and
you're just kind of stuck on a time loop
I like the idea that West world is
presenting these kind of old
philosophies and theories that have been
thought about before I mean they're
packaging it in a really sexy news video
show with a lot of sexy robots but these
things like eternal return have been
explored centuries before it was written
in this show do you think the show would
work if the robots weren't sexy if they
were more like normal looking I actually
am kind of looking forward to a robot AI
movie where there is no moral like moral
friction about how beautiful this robot
is and how much they want it like love
it and have
yeah like ex machina was the same thing
I was like oh I fell in love with her is
she really hit I'm like okay can we take
out that element where you don't fall in
love with a robot and they're not really
good-looking and you just like then
think about if they're human or not but
instead of this me to fuck it is when
they start thinking like oh maybe I
shouldn't do this
yeah but giving back to judgment a
little bit I think it is interesting
when you think of who is doing the
judging - because we talked about some
of our favorite moments and one of yours
was when Dolores and may have met up
again so talk me about that I super love
that scene I liked when I was called
reunion we don't we see them meet before
but with now without any very like real
substantial dialogue this one was great
when they were just kind of meeting on
the fly ins of the field and they were
just such a badass women and they're
like what's up and it was really good
that they that Maeve kind of rejected
Dolores is agenda because she was like
I'm gathering this army we need to break
free she's like I don't want anything to
do with jealous you do whatever you want
and if you're saying that we have a
choice as you know as free as you say
you are then you are gonna let me do
what I want to do and I just like the
idea that this kind of robot uprising
not everyone's on board everyone has
their different agendas maybe is looking
for her daughter she doesn't want to
well for now for the time being kind of
show Delos you know a piece of their
piece of their mind or anything so I
like that Dolores and make me and then
kind of diverge and I think I mean that
that scene in particular and the one
other one with Dolores with how she
recruits the army and just basically if
they don't join her she yeah shoot them
all she has a tech to fix them brilliant
yeah that point is really interesting
because Dolores is all talking about how
everyone has consciousness everyone is
free now but she's kind of making their
decisions for them like they're not free
under her anymore she's just shooting
them and then bringing them back to life
and being like you're following me and
I'm sure you can speak to this - you're
like but does that mean it's because
Dolores knows what's gonna happen like
in three seconds this water is gonna
fall from this corner in the river
whatever like I got to put a glass there
like she's already knows the future or
is it more dictatorial because it's like
that empowering freedom of breaking away
from being a host I mean she definitely
knows more than other ho
she's kind of like just get on board and
let's do this rebellion you guys don't
know like what I know so stop doing your
little small robot life living things
and like robbing banks and eating at
tables and farming barn houses and get
on this revolution right now because we
don't know what she knows either it's
causing a lot of questions does she
think that her way is the only way or
does she think it's the only way because
she's done it before or does she think
that because she is the only one with
this special dello snot like intricate
meetings with William we we've only seen
one and a half let's say in this episode
does she actually possess that knowledge
that we're just kind of well you're kind
of acting like a dictator maybe you tone
it down a little
it'd be nice if she gave Teddy a choice
so she's like so knowing what you know
do you want to follow me or don't it'd
be really cool if he was like man I
really want to didn't I know he just
pushes him into the world so frightened
by her I think I think he is so like
dude let's just run off into the sunset
Oh yep those are the moments where I
felt most like a game to me too because
you have like Maeve following her agenda
it's like she's moving across the game
board you have Delores gathering her
army have man and black trying to gather
his army and it really is the first time
in the show where it really felt like a
game versus the saying it was a game
he's like oh wow and this is like again
I really had this idea that Ford is
putting all these on purpose to a for a
greater point to see what happens I also
feel like he's playing even if he's not
there he's playing through the robots
against William which is one of my
favorite scenes which is the men and
black meeting one of my favorite actors
Giancarlo Esposito playing Alonso but
that scene when he meets a la Sol and is
trying to not only convince him but also
his men to join him and that they have
to and then there's a he grabs Alonso
and basically is like hey if you don't
join me or your army your commander army
team and they all turned the gun point
at their head and killed himself and he
has this great lines like hey this game
is designed for
but you have to play it like and we have
to play it alone which i think is
interesting because it's like because
who else is playing the game alone all
of them really if you think I'm Mavis
Dolores has her like pieces together but
she's really playing it alone
it says Dolores William and main I also
really like that scene because it shows
that the man in black isn't as good at
this game at living in West world as he
was in season one it's very humbling
like you see him struggle he's getting
actually hurt and he loves it though
yeah he's super you see one having a lot
of fun but I want he knows where the he
knows are the first-aid kits are and I
want him to be a little bit more humbled
I just kind of liked seeing him
struggling because I feel like it kind
of sucks that the only dude that's
having a good time in this terrible
world of suffering is Amanda Mike so I
want him to kind of get a taste of his
own medicine
what was your favorite moment I actually
think my favorite moment was kind of
back to the del o Stein lines it's the
third one we see and discrepancy whether
it's like retirement party or a
coordination between papadelis and
William and we first look and see
Dolores playing on the piano just where
Clementine was previously this little
girl comes up to her and she's like
you're pretty oh thank you what's your
name and the girl runs off and the
little girl runs to Juliet who if you'll
remember was on the picture that set
Abernathy off and his Williams ex-wife
wife why why he's mentioned that she
died right okay so he's William's wife
and then William steps into the frame
young William do we go oh and he and
Dolores make eye contact and there's
this moment when I don't know if it's
just projection or wishful thinking but
it feels like you can see the flicker of
recognition in her face and you're both
like oh and
he kind of feels it he walks toward her
like oh I should talk to her and elif's
just cuts him off just stops he's like
stop stop playing girlie oh okay like
the moment that William and Delores they
keep missing their moment to meet it's
like it's a it's not a good moment
though or is it like a I know what
you're gonna become moment I don't think
it's I know you're going to come I think
it's a really sad moment because William
for all of his pleading to the opposite
I think he truly fell in love with
Delores I think he truly fell for this
AI and it's hard for him to admit he
still is really upset about the fact
that he showed the most vulnerable piece
of himself to a host did he admit it
though later when he has her alone in
the room and he's like I fell in love
with you later
that's later right so later he's sitting
with her and he's like you're a
reflection you're just exactly what I
want you to be that's all I didn't fall
in love with you I fell in love with the
best parts of me how are the worst parts
well it's very soap opera I mean that's
exactly exactly and then while all
that's happening we have and he has this
crazy little drug thing what is that
it's a little weird like it's a very
organized it might mean he's just like a
doing a tuberculosis test like that it's
an allergy test him out gluten right
nuts this is what you made
but he has this great line he says to
Dolores is looking out at the city and
the stars are on the ground should we go
back to that line and he's doing his
little Domino heroin TB testing and he
has this line that darling is a sound of
fools fiddling while the fucking species
starts to burn and I think that is that
that line is so relevant for the series
but also it's a lot of the things that
we deal with in life too when we get
something new and exciting we get so
excited about it not to go back to
Facebook or social media but I think of
like the internet and how there's all
this promise but we get so sidetracked
with the belittling things the bullying
things the sexual things of it that we
lose track of it's true potential and I
feel like in that case he's kind of
declared Westworld or de lows whatever
the six rules are going to make is
doomed from the start and it's such a
brilliant line and I wonder if that's
also what he's registering in that
moment of saying like we don't know what
the data they're collecting but we know
it's nefarious and her remembering that
this is what's gonna burn humans down is
this creation which later goes on to say
that she holds the key and she knows the
difference and she knows like where the
weapon is right and we think maybe it
was something that he was William was
showing her I mean that terraformed area
where maybe it was a you know something
he buried there it could also be Arnold
just showing the real world so right
last line that she was talking about we
don't know for sure what friend what old
friend who was foolish showed her
exactly what our thoughts for the next
episode are moving forward what do you
hopes for when I love this episode I
think it was much stronger than the
premiere even just because I like what
timelines it's filling in especially
whatever happened at Logan and the naked
horse riding but I really want to see
more of Dolores in this real world and I
really want to see more of her gathering
this army and basically kind of
convincing
she's kind of God she's like killing
that I'm bringing back to life and she's
like yeah you either follow me or you
don't and if I saw that in real life if
I saw someone like kill me and then
bring me back I would follow I would go
into that over there for sure what do
you think what are your hopes for the
next episodes you know I liked that one
and two of this season have felt like
two sides of the same coin
like we could have watched them
back-to-back and we would have you know
felt like a few more questions were
answered they kind of feel like they
sandwich together very well and so I
hope then the next ones we get kind of
more contained stories like more episode
by episode theories and questions kind
of less I need the next week to come
right now and more that was a great
episode I want to talk about that yeah
that's kind of I felt about this episode
I mean I like the first episode of the
season but man the second one in my it
dis expanded the world in such a smart
way and it's such like a theory way for
me but then I think about again we got
man in black sorry
we have Dolores his army got Maeve doing
her thing but then we know at least who
says if it's fact that Bernard killed
all the robots so yeah exactly right
did he admit so where all this is going
it's gonna be either really amazing and
then if they can keep that up I'm
excited for that
I just hope it doesn't turn to like a
letdown I mean I trust Nolan I trust
Lisa joy but I do and I witness shows
where they just write themselves in a
corner and I really hope that they
respect the audience makes know that
we're watching and that everything kind
of either is good and interesting and
does every character kind of justice and
I don't want it to be like it was all a
dream the corners they wrote themselves
in the first season I gotta say I'm
really happy the way they got out of it
and are launching it this bigger world
for every episode Caitlyn makes a
special cocktail and for this episode
the rigging and she made a mez cow mule
so let's go to Kaitlyn it's a cocktail
corner and see how she did it
for episode two reunion we are making a
mezcal mule with for a little bit of
added spice the ancho Reyes verde made
from poblano chili peppers just to give
it a little bit of a bite and we'll use
del maguey Vita mezcal so fill your
shaker with some ice and then we're
going to use equal parts mezcal and I'm
sure Reyes we're going to put squeeze of
lime in here we're gonna shake it up
then when that's too cold to handle
strain your in pour that guy out top
with ginger beer Thank You Caitlin for
the drinks first so that's our recap for
the second episode reunion join us next
week as we go over the third episode and
let's give a little toast to actors
