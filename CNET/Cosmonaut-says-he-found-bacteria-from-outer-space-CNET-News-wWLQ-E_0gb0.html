cosmonaut anton shkaplerov says his team
found living bacteria on the surface of
the Russian segment of the International
Space Station during a spacewalk samples
were collected from the external surface
of the ISS Scapa roth told russian news
agency ta SS and now it turns out that
somehow these swabs revealed bacteria
that were absent during the launch of
the ISS module that is they have come
from outer space and settled along the
external surface the cosmonaut also
added seemed to bacteria posed no danger
samples of the bacteria were sent back
to earth to be studied the bacteria also
made its way into the space station
accidentally on tablet PCs where it was
studied Scapa Roth will head back the
ISS next month NASA has yet to comment
on the matter but see net has reached
out this is not the first time Russian
astronauts have claimed to find oddities
on the outside of the ISS back in 2014 a

evidence of sea plankton on the external
surface of the space station so do you
