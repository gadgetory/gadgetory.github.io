favorite laptops of 2018 a really great
year for laptops and really one of the
very best is one of the newest it's
right here it's Apple's new 13-inch
MacBook Air we've been waiting literally
years and years for an update to the
MacBook Air a laptop almost everybody
loves and uses but realizes was getting
a little out of date this new version
looks and feels a lot like a MacBook Pro
and it's got the big Retina screen the
giant touchpad it's got the butterfly
style keyboard which some people love
some people hate and of course it is
smaller and thinner and lighter and much
more powerful than the previous MacBook
Air only downside is it's kind of more
expensive also now every laptop maker
except for Apple makes a hybrid or a
two-in-one design where you pull the the
lid off and it becomes a tablet and a
keyboard or it folds back one of my
favorites for this year is one of the
originals in that space lenovo and its
new yoga c 930 the yoga is really one of
the first 2 in 1 laptops anybody noticed
this new version they've taken the hinge
and they've added a little sound bar
right to the hinge they move the
speaker's there so the audio will follow
you whether you're in tablet mode or
tabletop mode or over here in
traditional laptop mode but really my
favorite secret here is right on the
back they have a stylus for it because
it is a part time tablet and it's hit
ins right in the body of the system so
you're not going to lose your stylus
every 5 minutes like I do when I have to
carry them separately 20:18 a great year
for gaming laptops one of my favorites
was the Razer Blade 15 very high-end
high-gloss laptop very powerful also on
the expensive side there's also a less
expensive version right here also called
Razer Blade 15 there's a little bit
chunkier a little bit thicker but really
much less expensive starts about $15.99
which is expensive for a laptop cheap
for a Razer laptop but if all of these
feel too pricy for you well I do have
one budget pick that I like a lot it's
the Samsung Chromebook plus and
Chromebook pro models these are fairly
high-end Chromebooks how they perform
really great for something that cost
around $500 they
the Chrome operating system but all new
models can also run pretty much any
Android app to find in the Android Play
Store and of course it also folds back
to form a tablet and like my favorite
hybrids do it Scott
your little stylus tucked inside so
you're not going to lose it and then you
can just pop it back here when you're
done even fold this into a tablet take
it with you and these are just a handful
of choices there been so many great
laptops this year you can read all our
