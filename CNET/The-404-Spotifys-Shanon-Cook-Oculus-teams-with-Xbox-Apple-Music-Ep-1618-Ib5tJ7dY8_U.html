welcome to the 404 show ladies and
gentlemen it is friday june twelfth
almost june thirteenth friday 13th oh
well better luck next time horror fans
welcome to the the 44 show I'm Jeff
Bakalar joined by iyaz Akhtar and across
the table from me for the first time
ever in our audio experiment thing
Shannon kook am i inside a guinea pig hi
Shannon kook gets a golf clap yes what's
up Shannon how are you I'm great how are
you guys uh we're good I as you're good
I'm magnificent today alright that seems
like an exaggeration your hand you said
you were magnificent then you shook your
head yeah see that's the magic of audio
only say they wouldn't have known well
I'm gonna tell everyone everything I see
this is gonna be a great watch out oh
you're just calling I as out I as you're
full of it I am full of it so Shannon
you're in town all the time that's right
I live here and we brought you back it's
been a very long time so so so what have
you been up to why haven't you been
around what what's like you hate us like
no well I'm abandoned us no this is the
video and then she just ran away this
feels very unfair actually I was giving
you guys time to find your legs find
your feet to figure it all I can find
another right here uh I got him I know
they were rubbing against my feet a few
seconds ago oh ah I've been around but
you guys have been you know I'm changing
up your format and so I was just giving
you some distance so you could sort your
stuff out and then I ok I like to arrive
when it's streamlined fair enough ready
to go giving us our space to get her and
crap together is the answer exactly
wonderful but I missed you terribly and
I'm thrilled to be back and he's
flipping me off everybody this is but
not true she actually just spit on your
computer actually step I'm actually
picking his nose I'm not flipping oh wow
that's a friendly kind of interaction
wait so it's funny you're gone for so
long it's been literally sick strong
going on about it
you could have invited me back sooner
and I would have come at the drop of a
hat right I would have come here at the
drop of a hat all even alone um but what
a fortuitous coincidence that you decide
to come back the week that there's this
massive gigantic announcement from yeah
I guess what's now your biggest
competition yes though i should point
out we had planted not the guy we did
but is still a 14-8 mistress uh so this
is huge apple had a conference earlier
this week at WWDC which we won't bother
to find out what that stands for but
they announced apple music was the way
they ended their press conference it's a
ten dollar a month service any song you
want to listen to on demand trying to
think of another program / service that
does something like that and we just got
to throw out the caveat Shannon does
work for Spotify so we're not gonna you
know pick and choose sides here right
we're just trying to have I might there
you may because you might be biased
slightly you're contractually obligated
but we're going to keep you in check
okay ah but this is a major deal in it
and it has to be discussed because Apple
music is something that we've known
about for a long time but it's finally
out there and I need to come out and say
first that my impression from the
announcement was as a Spotify user i
currently pay for spotify myself I don't
believe I will be switching their to me
to me I am presently holding a gun to
just head yeah but the Safety's on to me
it does not present a compelling reason
to switch now let's also for a second
forget about the fact that well there's
a free version of Spotify which Apple
music will not have that's not true
there is a free version you can get like
a queue I think with the beach radio
service and career on an iOS device that
you can't do that when they android
version show okay stay a couple of
freebies that are involved but it's not
like you can do on demand right okay so
let's talk about beats one
for a second do we have to write that's
my point so the whole press conference
the whole key know the whole
introduction of Apple music was like the
freedom that your choice your freedom
right it was like a lot of that verbiage
was uh was used and then they go on
there like all right and we have three
radio stations for you like all of the
world's very John wrote a stand music
taste and all that other stuff with
three radio stations for you just always
strange right is it it's why it's three
different locations it's the same stream
for everybody the same house that's what
it's supposed to be so you can listen to
it worldwide especially three different
djs New York LA and London is that so
you're telling me now because I guess
I'm confused you're telling me the the
London DJ it was playing the same thing
that la DJ's playing I think they're
just gonna hand off the hours that's
pretty much it that's ever yeah do you
know anything about this or no no I mean
I heard that I've heard as much as
you've heard so better but i think the
radio thing sounds really cool and don't
know and i'm i'm looking forward to
checking it out okay Sam I'm looking
forward to checking a three month free
trial that's that's insane Teela here's
three months go ahead no rate you know
what that is they're gonna get lock-in
you forgot to you right I know yeah yeah
oh right we still have your freaking
credit card information and by agreeing
to three months free you agreed for us
to automatically charge you at the end
of that anybody have your credit card
this is gonna happen I'm sure it's going
to be painfully easy to like
accidentally I can you know sign up uh
because I'm sure when you sign up for
that three month trial you agree that
you will automatically get paid unless
you you know unsubscribe at the last
minute or before the period ends Jan
you're actually excited about the radio
station yeah no I'm excited about um I'm
looking forward to checking out the
whole Apple music experience I mean I'm
a fan of apple I have nothing against
Apple insurance you know it's expected
that I'm going to say something negative
about it but the truth is um you know
and it's also expected that I'm going to
say something about how spotify worried
and is this going to be the beginning of
the end of spotify but we're not
worried and I think part of the reason
we're not worried is because we have
great users we have very loyal users we
just announced we have 75 million active
users now that's a lot and 20 million
paid subscribers our numbers have almost
doubled just in the past year so we're
we're very comfortable we're very happy
we're thinking ahead to the future and I
think that there are so many people in
the world and of all the people in the
world lot of them like music and a lot
of them have cell phones so I think
there's enough room mmm for other
services so bring it on I I can't wait
to check it out at the end of the month
rdio see what it's like that's what
happened what I'm curious about is like
I guess I'm curious about the geeky
stuff that no one really knows yet like
you guys do you have any idea what kind
of like streaming quality yet SAT to 56
kilobits per second so to lower quality
then you know Google Play and on Spotify
320 20th those other guys okay that's a
little strange well I mean loyalty most
people with an apple product use those
white earbuds so they don't know if you
have they don't know yep she had one
last year unless your ass an audio
engineer or me work in recording studios
all day it's probably not going to be a
huge yeah I mean I guess the difference
between 320 and 256 is not to discern if
it was 128 or something but yes and
you'd be like hey you wait a second but
that's what other geeky things you're
thinking about I don't know I guess
that's it um but there is a question
whether the entire catalog is streamable
too because they said you get all of
itunes music so include the the Beatles
right they're not on everything as far
as I know no there's like one album on
google play I think they're on Spotify
we do not have to because the Beatles
are like notorious with when it comes to
that that licensing yeah there's a
question whether that will even be on
the streaming service as well
interesting and there's still itunes
match which still exists as a separate
thing so that it's interesting so I
wonder like what what's going to happen
to iTunes like what I mean if I'm did I
would imagine people just will stop
buying music like if I not all at once
overnight but if I'm an active music
purchaser through itunes and
and you know in my inbox says hey you
know wanted to spend ten bucks and have
all you can eat and I can't just see
myself being like I don't know bioniche
album individually seems like the better
deal you know I just can't see that
happening there's gonna be a massive
drop-off how could there not be I mean
that has to happen but I could also see
people saying like okay I'm not gonna
subscribe forever I'm gonna buy these
tracks like I've done there for other
services are trying out other music
service i'll buy the track so I'll own
it don't have to keep paying for the
streaming service that didn't need it
streaming all the time right that's one
weird things I keep thinking about with
these streaming services it's as if
everyone has unlimited data and I don't
well I know T Mobile allows you to
stream music for free that's there's
another thing so like it's I still think
it's a little ahead yeah but it you know
what it is like uh I actually found this
out the hard way while I was away in
Texas I wound up streaming two gigabytes
of Spotify which was a problem and you
know I feel like most people hook up
their phones to Wi-Fi yeah then do the
other extended for extended streaming
yeah sessions that's recommended that is
recommended by Spotify which is across
the table alright so let's let's shelf
the apple stuff for for now we'll have
to see how that all shakes out I sit
when does it all come at you too didn't
I still think the whole my son's
birthday Oh excellent I still think the
whole my mother's birthday today my son
is your mom ways doorman today is your
mom's birthday today not you maybe your
son is my mom's son no oh no no what's
happening whoa happy birthday yeah happy
birthday to everybody involved is the
whole radio station thing sounds so
freakin screw you to me I think I get it
they're like when you start the app up
since it's the music app because it's
the same music have you been using when
you want to go what am I going to
discover you just turn that thing on
while you're just like looking for other
stuff but it's like one voice for all of
Earth that's apparently revolutionary
like is the opposite of choice that is
the opposite of the Phantom to explore
this but you don't
we have to have to partake you don't
know what listen to it at all like that
something i really love it see and i
think other streaming services would
never do something like this and if they
did they would offer the entire gamuts
worth of genre and choice like to me to
me the whole it's it's this whole sort
of like falling into line thing with
with like what you know this is what you
should be listening to and that's like
the exact opposite of what this is
trying you know that they've had like
like internet radio streaming on iTunes
forever right and nobody uses it right
maybe that's why they went with one well
I think they should probably wrong hush
up people use it all its I think they
should do this I think you should be
able to stream your own show with you
cutting in after the track using the
Apple music library that would be rad
that's a terrible idea why because it's
going to be a bunch of amateurs crap
fine all the good or float to the
top just like ready like right yeah yeah
like ready all the good floats to
the top you don't think so hmm well
there is that social networking like
that idea actually I think it'd be great
if you had a section of it's like it's
like music it's like one step ahead of
okay build your own playlist right build
your own show around your place man so
here is he's sending out an email to
Spotify it's like you should you should
do this and I'd be happy to host the
metal can you not air this podcast for a
while Posey is a joke without lawyers
for a bit post dated that's just be like
a bunch of static in the middle the
episode if you yech we must add a
technical difficulties I just need to be
so brilliant if I could let you know a
personality that I like right yeah that
just me and maybe it's sold maybe
there's ads on it you know like the way
podcasts are starting to get ads because
you just heard one on our show so I feel
like that to me makes sense it's sort of
it's almost a form of podcasting in a
weird way except maybe it's live then
they have some curated playlists on this
new music service maybe I don't know we
don't know enough about it because no
one's really had hands-on with the damn
thing I think we'll find out soon enough
also yesterday and we will get to
Shannon's playlist and we will talk more
about Shannon's always fantastic taste
in music yesterday oculus
big news from the oculus rift people
which is a Facebook company don't forget
Facebook owns aequitas even like a
couple billion 1 billion dollars i
believe or maybe 32 bill yeah what's a
billion dollars when your facebook to
instagram ah so they bought oculus and
then yesterday the company comes out and
says hey here's what the final retail
oculus rift is going to look like and
they showed it they didn't show a price
they didn't show say a date all we know
is 2016 but the big bombshell is that
there's going to be xbox one
compatibility specifically through
Windows 10 so if you have a Windows 10
machine ah and apparently an xbox one
you will be able to stream in xbox one
game right onto your head and play it
with the included that's right the
included xbox one controller that's
going to ship oh my god with now now
Shannon stop jumping off the walls oh
whoa I'm holding myself down here
signing out no it sounds great it sounds
really cool i want one I want three you
can have three but so what is this you
put this on your head on your head
strange visor like binoculars
motion-sensing have a camera that that
watches you and will react to your head
movements as well and so it takes you
out of reality no you stay in reality
but you you don't like leave the third
dimension you stay here you don't time
travel or anything like that I know
that's what you're hoping for but what
he's so you're like playing you can play
game you can watch a movie version
reality headsets like all the stuff that
you see like Lawnmower Man or wherever
well the movies have virtual reality I
don't I don't know but you get it right
Joe this isn't like over your head right
you're just playing but yeah so that's
about as fun so that's what this is no
pricing and apparently then you'd like
or you need a seriously beefy computer
to run this thing right like it's not
just gonna run like on a little happy
ultrabook or something no I would
imagine you need a somewhat of a decent
graphics growth I'm this thing I wish I
knew what it was called and you will
probably know people with listeners
don't they'll know my
Ben is Daniel C bug he used to be a tech
reporter at CBS and ready seeing now he
works Google yes he brought home this
thing it was made of cardboard and it
was the same concept that's you'd want
your cardboard that's good it's cold
yeah okay I just came home and was like
oh what's this thing that's how the name
came about and was a short board then
Shannon tried to recycle it he put it uh
he put his phone in it he handed it to
our four-year-old yeah and she
absolutely loved it and we all tried out
it was it was the same idea yeah and I
was very cool so that's google's even my
mom yeah daddy's happy birthday my god
happy birthday mom his cardboard have
some CAD board mom she's Australian so
those how Cheetos uh no but it was a
very cool idea and we all we all played
around with that we all really liked it
so so yeah I think this oculus I guess
yeah so that's the thing like that's
Google sort of answer to that the google
ones like what a couple bucks you can
get yourself you that's just cardboard
wrestle this thing is going to be like
what the price is like room to be
fifteen hundred dollars uh yeah I don't
know it's gonna be really seriously
intense about this like oh yeah I'm
gonna spend this and put this on my face
and wear it all day I still all day but
one of your gaming what's cooking is
that there's developers do you wouldn't
wear don't I would you know oh man well
if you really hate where you are yeah if
you just want to like be absorbed by
that other reality but I mean you've
realized reality when you are wearing
this thing you're right wearing it all
day suspicious I think you're instantly
like red-flagged if you're the guy
wearing this all day mmm you could save
an electric you know cuz you get lights
off yes on your face all baby may be
nicer apartment you will need to see the
toilet at some point that's true that's
you know any lag there that's
problematic especially if you're still
wearing the yeah well you're right well
it appears well I think maybe you just
don't leave the toilet you stay on there
god I think Ron to something I think
there's a future it's like the future
from what's ready player one I mawali
for a wallet yeah you just sit there is
like okay it's like everywhere you sit
you can poo amazing the future like
you're a bro now but I don't think it's
socially acceptable ok back to the game
thing real quick what are we talking
now we're talking about camping in
virtual reality Oh babies there are
there are realistic like sort of you
know think about it okay they have all
the support there's these game
developers like establish game
developers who are saying we're making
games for your oculus rift headset so
people are invested bets are being made
on this thing whether or not it takes
off is another story I for one think it
will be a slow and steady sort of thing
sticking in the novelty category for a
little bit a little while to come it's
gonna get like rolled in with Sony's
working on the moat Morpheus why I think
it is gonna be like we get a playstation
five or whatever they go their dread set
maybe because I think that's the way you
get mass adoption you can do as a
peripheral right by itself that seems
like a really which is why I culous is
is trying to do something with Microsoft
where it's like all right people we want
this association we want you know some
sort of tan demised introduction to the
to the world so let's do it like that
there's my new word of the day
randomized yeah there you go use that
one often is I don't think so it should
be a playlist think I just invented it
and mais demain no here's about a budget
I just learned it a word that's kind of
used in PR circles it's id8 id8 you
can't like come up with ideas yes oh
that makes me want to go you just say I
have you come up with some idea we're
having a brainstorming I did it sounds
like oh look I got the idea off of
vanity license plates that's where I got
the yeah I r.i.p brainstorming when we
come back we're gonna take a quick break
we will talk with Shannon all about some
brand new music get ready because
everything you're about to consider
trending you probably haven't heard yet
maybe that's just the case for me did I
say that's what not but I know I'm just
talking about expectations let's have a
break in I d8 all right I d8 we'll be
right back did you know that your cars
valued appreciates by ten percent the
second you drive it out of the
dealership lot and then twenty percent

it's kind of it's more like a trippy
trip-hop trip-hop electronic as a thing
Tupac they'll play that on beats one
I'll tell you that but I think this is
gonna be a big underground hit through
the summer some of the raps some of the
lyrics though yeah little x-rated you
might have to comb through them later
make sure you're not saying weird stuff
yeah there's a line about squish it
squish it that like what I'm not gonna
say the whole line but all right pull up
those lyrics and have a little read gets
a pretty entertaining there's also a
stroller metaphor which has a parent I
don't understand stroller like like an
upper baby reference no you just have to
read the lyrics and I'm sure some people
listening to this right now I've already
got there lyrics up and they're going oh
my god that's disgusting I'm into it
this is a great song this is our most
viral track around the world at the
moment should notify staffers sorry to
interrupt yeah talking about Spotify
employees now um we've been listening to
this song for a while so what so what
makes it the most viral song and in the
world like how does that work well we
calculate how many times the song has
been shed okay and divide it by how many
times it's been strange so it's just a
simple formula it's not like some weirdo
Spotify algorithm no oh man oh no you
could be like a special sauce I want to
be like the magic ingredient in
coca-cola but it is a magic formula in
that it it does point us towards these
songs that um even though they might not
be streaming in massive numbers they're
getting shared a lot which sort of gives
them give us gives us a heads up of what
would potentially be a hit remember when
I was coming in and always talking about
that young museum
linder Lord yeah remember her because
she was a viral / spiral always sounds
kind of sounds a little dirty yeah
little personal she's a petri dish
what's her deal now she making new music
I think so I would imagine so I'm sure
she's got an album in the works love her
yeah I music you she's great she has
been a little quiet lately the whole
South Park stuff was great it was
awesome she played real nice with that
she was a good sport about it she's
really um she's really impressive she
doesn't mold herself in any way won't be
any kind of idea what the hell you think
yeah an entry I'm from New Zealand
dammit deal with it another artist whose
trending at the moment is ASAP Rocky
okay I'm Harlem rapper he had a really
big first week with his latest album on
Spotify in fact it was the second
highest first-week debut we've had me
streamed more than 20 million times in
the first week oh sorry you yeah that's
me I'm such as God being at dj's hod you
got a call girl talk and play the song
let me hear you like into it on Spotify
one this is shannon cook and i'm here
with the new ASAP Rocky I want you to do
it cuz that was perfect what is this is
called LSD and can you hear it you
playing it's not my fault now yeah it's
playing there you go oh I wanted to do
it but anyway let's hear it
um a few of a SEP songs have been
scaling out viral charts and this is a
very trippy album yeah I'm already
tripping hmm i'm still really write
other side cyber whoa okay i think was i
right yeah so the stroller thing please
explain anyway we shall focus st
so it's gotta be about drugs ASAP
but I need making love songs baby I'm
just wrapping to this L
smize it there's good tracks on this
album there's another one like people
are rocking this like cynthy eighties
sort of thing lately right like that's
the thing now and another thing we're
doing is on this song every day is we're
getting in line with old white dudes
like Paul McCartney and in this case Rod
Stewart he samples Rod Stewart on this
song every day this is quite popular on
Spotify at the moment okay let says a
lot of these songs are just so relaxed
like well then I think that's why i said
it's it's sort of weezy don't get to the
end of the album you're like whoa so
this song I think sucks but the first to
give it a huge chance let's try some
more he bitches guys right with biscuit
really that's why's it always gotta be
bitch was that the rhyme that's right
they rhymed bitches with biscuits you
know what I actually think that's clever
you think biscuits and bitches rhyming
is clever no I did get to get it just
sounded good it sounded good especially
sounded good winches and it sounds good
when I SS sign me up for some bitches in
business not a mega that's a different
video not sound good coming from you and
the delicious so what it sounds like
this is a weird one so who's behind this
it's this is this is ASAP rocky and he
sampled Rod Stewart and then somebody
track some people are saying that the
two might get together to do some kind
of collaboration that's gonna be a weird
audience ameritech show is nothing to do
with music anyway that's ASAP rocky and
rap by the way it is having a real
moment on Spotify this year this album
Rocky's album was the seventh album
hip-hop album to have the the biggest
debut week on Spotify in terms of
streams I'm Kendrick Lamar he's he's
streamed like 35 million times in the
first week right and it's it's
interesting because outside of the
streaming space hip-hop does very well
but it's not necessarily always on top
where is this your desk job what I mean
come on there was a big news story last
month metal right I know you heard about
that yes never on one metal song I
didn't I'm sorry but it's true metal
like make up for that I brought a very
cheesy eighties sounding song alright
fair enough I like a tease I'm a sucker
for 80 stuff but here let me talk about
another person who's not cheesy and
she's definitely not from the 80s she's
only 18 years old oh my god her name is
alessia cara okay anything that sounds
like karo aur tera always sounds
ridiculous with my accent not only are
are are you wanna know era yes I know
ago kitaro Australian metal voice please
make sure she corrected you say Tara
like that right not terror well in
Australia say Tara Tara anyway this is a
less
Cara this has been a hot song on our
viral charts it's called here sultry
well it's to me it sounds a little
Portishead yeah it's like a gin Wigmore
thing to you know that is no like she's
like born out of the amy winehouse right
right she's got that sort of affected
voice but what I like about this girl is
obviously we're not gonna listen to the
whole song but if you do listen to the
song there are no stroller references in
this data phone but what is only 18 but
what has got out of one um but she the
song is all about going to parties and
actually not fitting in and wishing she
wasn't there like oh he's going to the
coolest party in the city and she's
hating hating it she hates the music
they're playing she hates the
pretentious people she hates that she's
getting hit on yeah welcome to real life
is the introverts on yeah but that's
what's nice and real about this job and
what's real about her because it's not
always like a pitbull potty song is it
it's not what's your name my name's
alessia cara lesya is just finding out
the same thing we all found out when we
were 18 and she's mad about it
everything sucks good for you but i like
i like it she describes herself in this
song as an anti-social pessimist and I
know I just that's pretty big likely
it's like an anti-party song and I think
at a time when there are just party
songs everywhere sure by the way potties
in other word my accent just sounds too
horrible you know who does a lot of that
kind of stuff to Lana Del Rey is like
Jeff or email like that yes I hmm she's
just a bummer she's like a debbie downer
hugely popular though and i think that
alessia is going to we think she's gonna
break out I like her he beg her debut
albums coming it's on she's with Def Jam
I believe huh alright can i play you my
favorite song at the moment better have
guitars and a drummer hmm unfortunately
you ever bring that it has
tars and it has a drummer sign me up the
total cheesy 80 sound it says it's been
around for a little bit and it's it's
done really well all around the world I
feel like 10 5 seconds of summer no mind
no this is a song called shut up and
dance by a group called walk the moon
who walk the moon walk the moon or
anything walk the moon thanks I you look
good this is me kicking you and sounds
like the guitar sound like you I know it
sounds like it's totally ripped for me
too but my husband actually played it
side by side I've heard this on this is
a good summary song as we're heading
towards summer this is much more fun but
you've got to watch the music video I
wish we were still I think I tell you
what the music video is what is that
it's like guys on a road trip no in the
hilarious it's very 80s and cheesy and
it's deliberately so we are ruling on
the microphone that's what the song does
do I really like the song it's cool i
like it too it feels like any money it
feels like a lot of my face genesis
rover
yeah I can see that if you've gotta
check out the videos you know this
sounds like late fall out boy yes sort
of like poppy raw it does it's a group
from there from Ohio walk the moon how
old are they they got it they've only
been around for a few years I believe
but their route this song has broken
them and they go back to I hope I Ohio
and they play shows and everyone's very
excited in it it's all very lovely this
parts good the breakdown
or did you dare
they remind me of like uh dunno cobra
starship yep like those guys are they
like those dudes were in punk rock bands
and they're like let's make it more
cheesy and accessible more fun yeah and
that's definitely what this is it's a
fun song please please watch the video
cuz you'll love it there's even some
break dancing it's pretty good I thought
but I thought we were gonna get to like
real eighties sort of stuff no this is
this is his 80s as I bring it today oh
we're watching the video yeah it's
basically like a lot of sledgehammer
Peter Gabriel stuff there's a redhead
it's good man I dig it a good song I I
can't deny it I heard it on I was in a
bachelor party over the weekend I heard
it I was like all right I don't hate did
you shut up and dance I did dance my
dance my ass off I still can't find it
um alright we only have a few more
minutes can I just believe can I just
play for you is so I want to give you an
opportunity to tease me and Phil play
you a song that I've been really into
there's this um DJ very popular on
Spotify around the world at the moment
his name is Kai go very young okay very
cute mmm gentlemen I gotta do with it I
believe he's Norwegian okay that's
nothing to do with that behind me I
don't even know what you're talking
about um he has a huge song around the
world it's like top five all around the
world called stole the show and I
recently discovered he's remix of sexual
healing oh wow okay so and I really
really like it so can we play some of
that sure is it going yes it is going
it's just slide or you you don't have
your hand on the right knob and that's
always the case maybe you need some
sexual healing job I think so
All Right see where we're going that was
Jenna by the way this is about it so
much
I don't want to be like the guy who says
like all these remixes suck this is bad
like if I don't know it's not like the
keyboard casio demo yeah drum loop like
