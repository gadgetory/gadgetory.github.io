conference in the rest West West is
running februari 27 through march first
in barcelona spain that's next week and
it is here that some of the hottest
phones around the globe our first
announced and we already expect to see
at least 21 smartphones and tablets
emerge with more surprises sure to come
this week we take a closer look at the
Android and Windows devices that we
think we'll see and we also share some
news stories of the day and answer your
burning questions so this is dialed in
cnet cell phone podcast I'm Jessica
dual-core joined by Lynn LA in San
Francisco hello and by Brian Bennett in
New York hey guys and Steven Beecham is
our technical producer so welcome
everybody okay so Mobile World Congress
as I mentioned is coming up where you
are going to be there on the ground and
I'll be there with kent german we've got
some news folks as well Lynn and Brian
are going to be covering it from New
York and San Francisco so we've got all
time zones covered and some of the
themes that will definitely be emerging
are going to be quad core and ice cream
sandwich for real this time I swore we
were going to hear a lot more ice cream
sandwich phones for CES and that just
didn't happen not as such the major
disappointment failed prediction but we
swear they're happening so guys you know
we don't have time to talk about all 21
leaked or rumored devices that we think
are coming but what are you most excited
to see well I mean I'm definitely
excited to see anything with quad-core
in it so I know we talked about some HTC
devices that may be coming out this
couple tablets that may come out with
quad-core definitely want to see that I
want to see I'm very curious and I'm
sure a lot of our listeners very curious
exactly how fast quad-core will be over
over traditional or I guess boring
ordinary dual core phones that are out
now so yeah that's true i mean a lot of
it does come down to the processor and
to how tasks are managed and it's not
exactly clear if quad-core automatically
means double that's what it means in
theory but is that what it's really
going to come out to be and to see
quad-core perform
arm versus some single core processors
for example with Windows Phones that's
true and also i mean there's the the LG
optimus vu or are you boo i know i want
to save ooh cuz it do it just sounds
like French or something but but I
believe that is supposed to be a quad
core right no no it's supposed to have I
big massive 5-inch screen and it's
supposed to be sort of LG's answer to
the Galaxy Note so that'd be interesting
to see how that plays out so that one
has a stylist as well right Layton
you've kind of been keeping your eye on
this one the LG optimus view yeah yeah
it's a it's really it's kind of it's
really big ok and I guess I'm just
really excited because it's just another
contender for the galaxy note so the
Galaxy Note won't be the only one that's
coming out there with the stylus with
the big screen and this will be good for
someone who doesn't want exactly what
the Samsung Galaxy offers and this is
something from LG that people could be
really excited about so this kind of
makes me wonder you know are the stylus
is really gonna are we going to have a
resurgence of this I mean LG and Samsung
pretty much had to know what each other
was doing in order for these 5-inch
stylus things to come out um pretty soon
after each other I I guess samsung had
like a nine month lead on LG since they
introduced their is at the ephah
conference in September but we also
heard about the samsung galaxy note 10.1
which would actually be a tablet so it
seems like the phone makers are trying
to kind of create this category maybe
not around a certain size but around a
stylus that lets you do more with it and
trying to get the developers on board to
come up with interesting ways to
interact with your phone yeah I'm not
sure soliant buying this sort of thing
Yeah right phone tablet phablet i don't
know i mean brother you also took a look
i I mean you and I have both used the
samsung galaxy note for the last week
what are you
thoughts on the stylus and just using it
in general well you know I'm right now
I'm working on a little story on how I'm
surviving after a week of just using the
note as my primary phone or tablet or
whatever it is and my feelings that the
stylus is actually you know what it's
actually not so bad as not as not as bad
as I thought it would be because i'm
using what they call the s-pen to you
know write notes into to do as long as
you stay within the little grid there
that you're supposed to enter text in
with the pen it actually does right and
and recognized your handwriting decently
well though it does get confused and
that's that's really annoying it's not
it's not as easy as writing on on a
piece of paper I agree with you there
and i actually did sort of an in-depth
writing test since I actually do write
things by hand yeah and I totally agree
what you said to because I read a read
your post as well I noticed that yeah
you can accidentally hit the capacitive
buttons or other buttons on the side
like if your finger brushes against them
on the bottom of the phone when you're
writing you know you have to be careful
it's it's almost like you know you have
to really kind of learn how to write all
over again in a way which is which kind
of defeats the purpose but it is it is
cool to say go into Evernote or one of
these sort of note-taking apps and be
able to jot down quick little reminders
for yourself in your you know using the
pen type of device and to me that that
actually really feels good you know it
feels like I'm actually writing down on
my notepad but it still has some way to
go especially since you have to use a
samsung keyboard to actually put in the
pen input you can't just go from the
android keyboard or swipe or something
right exactly yeah so so it's sort of
not quite as you know where I'd like it
to be but so like it or not we're
definitely going to see the same thing
in the LG optimus view and we're
definitely expecting to see that at
Mobile World Kong
LG has another phone that leaked as well
then why don't you take us through that
one real fast yeah it's called the LG x3
and basically screenshots of it got
leaked and it says that there it will be
running a Tegra 3 chip which is also a
quad-core processor yeah and it will be
the only what's up for what we know the
only other phone besides the HTC One X
that will have a quad-core processor
right and so this HTC phone that we're
talking about Brian I gave us a low down
on that could be called the 1x right but
used to be known called a million other
name edge yeah never exactly aliases
yeah you know the endeavor or the crane
the edge supreme I didn't even hear that
one before you makes me think of fun I
think that was about its name for like
five minutes well you know I don't know
as long as it has you know dual-core
that's that's pretty much the primary
kanpur quad-core sorry course are see I
was so conditioned already I know
dual-core was was it a year ago dual
core phones were the end-all and be-all
now it is quad-core I can't even you
know say that fast enough but uh but yet
so I'm supposed to have quad core power
arm and and actually you know the whole
thing is that this device they teased it
at a mobile world congress in teaser
invite that they sent out saying that
it's going to you know revolutionize the
way everybody computes and everything
like that and that press event i believe
is going to happen on the 26 at 9pm I
think that's local time correct I that
sounds about right I think so I think
someone's are all befuddled at my
calendar and like I enter it in the
Spanish time zone but it shows up on my
calendar and pacific time so i don't
know what anything is yeah i mean all it
says it kind of has this cryptic
postcard with a bunch of pictures and
you know sort of pleasing look at this
given a picture of a cat in one corner
and a raspberry and flowers flowers a
flower theme along the borders yeah
index finger pointing a beach I mean you
know hey that sounds baby
nari yeah insert revolutionary product
here you know um so down oh that phone
we expect a 4.7 inch screen nvidia tegra
3 quad-core processor what else do we
have there um let's see basically camera
it may not be the only one it's gonna
have a buddy or two oh you mean with a
12 megapixel camera oh well that was the
Titan to that we saw could definitely be
seeing more camera power we could be
seeing that had actually a 16 megapixel
camera Oh the Titan too so we could see
something like that here yeah I mean it
seems like 12 is going to be the normal
maybe I think I mean I think you can
still have a perfectly good 8 megapixel
camera I think they've got to be careful
with 12 and 16 not to lose inequality
regression would be the worst for all
these phone makers that's true so there
was also the HTC one s / ville / maybe
primo I know that was named going around
for a while so that one also has 1.5
gigahertz but that's a dual-core
Qualcomm processor right right that's
right that's right dual-core 1.5
gigahertz dual-core for like I said 4.3
inch display and you know actually I
don't think there's any word yet as to
if it's gonna get an ice cream sandwich
or not I would expect yeah most of the
phones coming out of the show to have a
better image on this point exactly yeah
I mean you better get I should sandwich
at this point everyone's been waiting
and waiting and waiting okay so what
else there's also the droid 3 incredible
that we heard something about which was
a to use Lin's favorite new phrase spied
on the Y in the wild it's in a lot of
other thing he's at terminal a lot of
other things it's out very wig in the
abyss in space running loose and uh yeah
in the in the fly me you can't really
say in the flesh yeah in somebody's
somebody's holding it so what about this
phone what do we know about it um
probably Ice Cream Sandwich hey
right ready a dual-core 1.2 gigahertz
processor 8 megapixel camera Verizon
Verizon Verizon Verizon isn't having a
press conference yeah that's kind of is
it's kind of interesting because you
figure verizon it seems so non you're
not a European carrier so it's
interesting that that would leak ahead
and yet where was verizon last year they
were at Mobile World Congress with a
huge showing that's crazy though I mean
that's so wild why would they you know
what's there what's their purpose there
just to get international are they
expanding or no I mean they're US
carrier I think they're just doing it
because mobile world congress is such a
huge yes yes they're gonna be around
1000 people there it's gonna be nany
everybody so sorry I said everyone's
trying to make an impact there to catch
you know make sure that everyone is
paying attention because everyone's
gonna be talking about I suppose exactly
and the press are all there with their
fancy new cameras that's true so we know
that Sony is going to have something
they have bought out sony ericsson and
their partner in a joint venture and now
we're going to have sony xperia phones
they're having a press conference
they've also registered for the name for
the trademark xperia sola so not sure
what that's going to bring but something
nokia is also going to be having a press
conference and they're going to have
something clients at least one maybe
more Samsung has already come out with
the galaxy ace 2 and galaxy mini to
information and we already know that ZTE
has a couple phones up its sleeve
including I love this one mimosa mimosa
it's very nice I don't actually know if
I love that or if I just love the Moxie
of using mimosa I think that's the next
trend maybe it's gonna everything you
know is going to be cocktails and
instead of name-brand yeah actually
that's true maybe that's not I see your
jelly bean and I raised you mimosa I
have a CT Tom Collins I have
whiskey yeah that's right HTC bourbon
you just can't call it sours whatever
you do can you think it leaves a sour
taste in the mouth sour is sweet so lame
so um actually I'm just gonna say what's
on this list but really quickly we also
caught wind of LG also coming out with
some new Optimus devices with ice cream
sandwich two of them with ice cream same
other than the view yeah like I mean
it's interesting it's rumor but it was
taken from LG site I would quick post on
it but it looks like the site link has
disappeared and it was basically the
optimist it's part of the LSL style
lineup it's gonna have like three
devices the the style it took at the El
the optimus s 7 I think it's gotta go
back and look but it's basically like
three devices with one is going to have
a four-point a four-point-oh inch screen
4.3 inch screen those two are going to
have ice cream sandwich and then a
smaller one that's going to have like a
3.2 inch screen sir they more high-end
or more mid-range there's two it's
basically like three devices one's going
to be high-end one's going to be I guess
mid-range like the amounts of phone yeah
and then the other one is definitely
low-end yes right more portable you know
and its own it's only gonna have
gingerbread so so yeah but of course
that's that's L nothing nothing new
should be coming out with gingerbread
unless it is cheap cheap cheap which ad
it sounds pretty cheap so let's see if
LG has those three up to my and the view
and the x3 LG could be a big winner
which makes sense because CES was a
really slow show for them but we're not
hearing anything about motorola yeah it
doesn't look like they're gonna have
anything outside of the stuff that came
out of yes which is not a surprise
because they said they were going to
slow things down a little bit and we
definitely are going to see something
Xperia come out of Sony as Sony gets
more aggressive in the mobile phone
category okay so a stick with us next
week
and stick with us now we're just going
to go on a short break and we'll come
back with news of the day
we are back you are listening to dialed
in and we've got some quick hits news
from the day and an earlier lot or later
last week for example the samsung galaxy
s2 love fest continues this time US
cellular gets their version of the
insanely popular phone that has so far
already sold over 30 million devices
worldwide am speaking of US cellular
they are pushing ahead with their 4g LTE
plans right now they only have a 3g
network and that will change sometime in
the near future in other news HTC will
grant more us phones with ice cream
sandwich because gingerbread is so old
and it will add for Verizon Wireless
models to its lineup and they're going
to be due out soon we don't know when
though and in law making news feds say
to automakers they should block drivers
from texting and tweeting and surfing
the US Department of Transportation has
proposed guidelines that would limit
driving activities to just driving as we
should be do you think and next we've
got DISH Network's actually looking to
shop their new or at least their
spectrum out to other folks who may be
interested in they're looking for a
waiver from the FCC to end hopefully
they can farm out that spectrum to other
folks maybe LightSquared perhaps since
they were denied by the FCC to expand
their network and then also we've got
some news from blackberry from rim
blackberry playbook OS to actually is
out today yes which does anyone care I
don't know yeah you care if you have a
playbook I guess if you got I didn't
like a $99 fire sale that's true that's
true apparently it only brings the OS up
to the level it should have been when it
first launched and that basically adds
email and contacts and calendar access
we already built in insane what a
concept rim
it's awesome and also maybe a few
android support for android apps though
all i care about personally is kindle or
some sort of google book reader or
something like that and i'll be said so
back in review world 1 review last week
that we didn't talk about in the
previous show and that was the Pantech
Burst 418 tea I took a look at this one
but Lin actually knows it very well
because she saw it at CES it comes in
two colors ruby red and titanium i think
this is a really great phone it's fifty
dollars for AT&amp;amp;T it's got LTE it's got a
4-inch really beautiful super amoled
display it's got Pantex interface on top
of that which I found pretty easy to use
very friendly you know it's it's similar
to the other ones with the unlock screen
and things like that so you can do there
aren't a lot of surprises with this
phone I just think its overall really
nice and it's got sort of a stylish
design that's a really nice bill to it
and i love the backing of the the wood
with the grain finish that's it yeah
it's plastic but it has this veneer yeah
and I mean for fifty bucks you'd be
probably pretty happy with a plain old
plastic phone and I feel like pantech
really actually tried to do something
with it so call quality wasn't that good
battery life also not as great as it
should be um we're going to continue
doing tests on that but i think that the
design is really solid the features are
really i mean it's got a dual-core 1.5
hurts processor and this is really hard
to get 450 bucks we're seeing a lot more
phones like that 18 t is starting to
make a name for itself as a destination
for this kind of budget phone there's a
lot of competition but for 50 bucks it's
pretty good it'd be really good for a
little bit more than 50 bucks to four
ninety-nine dollars but i think the fact
that it's fifty dollars is going to get
people interested in a brand that has so
far cruised under the radar a little bit
so let's see what are you guys reviewing
in the next week i have 2 ZT phones that
have moves music included it's the ZTE
chorus and the ZTE score that's coming
up Brian you got anything well I've
actually
a whole bunch of headsets which
something that people don't think about
a lot probably but yes as these you know
device has become more and more like
multifunctional you know bluetooth
headset is actually quite a interesting
device to use right now I'm checking out
the Jabra sport which is a ruggedized
bluetooth wireless headset just reviewed
the Jabra supreme which is just a plain
mono headset with fancy features and I
hope to get some more into so stay tuned
and let's see last week we were
lamenting that we didn't have any email
love but this week we actually have too
many so we will share with you like we
promised since we owe to you guys we
begged so hard for them it seems like
everybody was on vacation the week
before but this week everybody is back
and asking lots of questions so the
first question we have that we received
was from Tom I believe that's how you
pronounce name I will check at that ok
awesome and well you never know it could
be thumb maybe could be well anyway so
tom says people thommas thank you mamas
mamas um maybe after a few cocktails
after their drinking or ZTE with mimosa
yeah my HTC bourbon um so yeah so so Tom
actually is asking about whether or not
you know he heard our podcast last week
and he notice that we talked about
QWERTY sliders and he was really
interested in in court he actually
portraits slider which which to me is
very strange but I what he said was it
was ever so briefly raised by me and
then shot down by Brian right I'm like
you know Kourtney's uh you know portrait
sliders well he doesn't like the torch
which which makes sense um but then you
know actually it's interesting because
well I haven't seen any qwerty sliders
or even just 40 portrait QWERTYs that
don't slide yeah or just any bar style
yeah it's really been a you know it's a
dying breed but um he actually has a
follow-up question as well he wanted to
know
specifically about using going over to
t-mobile um and he's also eyeing some
windows devices specifically the Lumia
800 but it's a little too expensive with
five hundred dollars and he's looking
for something that has a bit more memory
than the Lumia 710 which he definitely
likes but it only has eight gigs of
memory and that's it that's a tough
question i have to say and I was looking
around and I their windows phone so they
don't have expandable memory yeah I
think you don't have online storage hmm
or or you know some of them come with
with expandable we're not really
expandable but they have internal memory
that is pretty high up to 16 gigs but I
mean so that that card is locked down I
was looking at some of the other devices
that you might want to check out I know
that there believe it or not there's the
HTC hd7 which was for tmobile a little
while ago it has 512 megabytes internal
but it does have a 16 gigabyte
non-removable ram non-rural storage
that's what I think t mobile isn't
actively selling anymore but you
wouldn't find that elsewhere ebay
craigslist exactly yeah hopefully you
can pick that up I mean I even thought
about well hey what if you take an old
hd2 which you know one of the devices
that I was into I remember that phone
came with a 16 gig card pre-loaded
because I came with transformers two or
something I hate to say it oh yeah no I
hate to say it but a 18 t really seems
to be the niche for windows phones yeah
it seems like they're becoming the
flagship for that but I would love to
see t-mobile get more yeah i mean he's
on I'll tell and he was trying to see if
even a non lock device would work on
alltel but as I think I think I'll tell
is on verizon's cdma network so yeah
doesn't seem like you'll have much luck
there but so anyway you know good luck
to you maybe check out the the hd7 if
you can get one for pretty cheap or even
an hd2 that maybe
you can talk to someone into parting
ways with and it hasn't been beat up
like the one I have good advice from
Brian and we have another email from a
t-mobile customer with 16 months left on
their contract and this here he asked if
um they want to change her his out they
want to change this person wants to
change to out the LG g2x to another
Android phone with a larger screen
without losing 4g speed and they're
asking us do we know if we could get an
unlocked Galaxy Nexus or galaxy no and
still be able to use 4g on a t-mobile
t-mobile network uh yeah you can get
them unlocked GSM they're more expensive
they should be they won't be optimized
for t-mobile sometimes you do get speed
degradation best-case scenarios you can
use it on the hspa+ network the other
part of the question was are there other
large screen android phones except the
samsung s2 that we can recommend and i
would say that the MAS 4G and the
sensation 4g have 4.3 inch qhd displays
so those are really the large screen
android phones in existence right now
there was a yeah it was the nokia lumia
800 that if you buy it unlocked you get
like 2.5 g speeds for tmobile that you
get 3g speeds for eighteen t so it's not
always created equally so you should
definitely do some digging on that but
t-mobile will know and and they'll be
able to tell you where other people will
be able to tell you exactly what you
should expect with an unlocked phone and
another reader asks um well actually oh
actually before we get to that let's
have an exciting um commenter who were
called and left us a voicemail we said
we would read them and and we're going
to play it here we go hey guys this is
mal from the Midwest love dialed in
listen to it every week I just thought
I'd throw
maybe historical perspective in here the
last podcast I listened to you from
februari 13 you're talking about the
Galaxy Note the five plus inch phone is
interesting I know if you all remember
but the first galaxy tab which I think
was Santa inches in Europe was also
phone that function was disabled in
America so just sort of interesting it's
just really the same stuff with multiple
different sizes so um you know the notes
and Austin device and it helped me a
group of people to love it a lot of
people won't bother with it thanks Mel
we've got another question that I
interrupted reading so take it away Lynn
oh no this one was coming from a reader
who wants our opinion on huawei mercury
on cricket wireless what do we think
about the network they've been thinking
that they want to make they want to join
the network they don't want to make a
transition to a big company so what is
and they don't care about 4G because
they're usually on Wi-Fi so what do we
what kind of phones do we recommend or
what do we think about the network I
definitely reviewed the huawei mercury
and I actually gave it three and a half
stars and it's one of Huawei is higher
end devices released in the u.s. it has
an 8-megapixel camera android 2.3
gingerbread front facing camera 1 point
4 gigahertz processor or call quality i
was pretty happy with testing in on
crickets roaming network battery life
wasn't so great and the data steep
speeds were pokey but if you're on Wi-Fi
then then that's good I think that
cricket has some pretty good deals
there's no move music on this but I
don't think that you know if you were
not expecting to do a lot of data
surfing and ah well with the data
network and you do expect to use a lot
of Wi-Fi then I think it's a pretty
solid device and it is off contract so
you pay a little bit more up front it's
a 250 full retail but a while ago when I
reviewed it it was 180 after fifty
dollar mail-in rebate and twenty dollar
web discount
so it's possible to get it for a little
bit less what what actually just said
accuracy what network does what kind of
technology does cricket use turn
remember down crickets got a 3g network
is it that you yeah you may oh yeah they
write on they have a national
partnership with sprint so whenever
they're outside of the you know their
home footprint actually they also have
deals with like QVC and Best Buy so you
can buy some of their phones like the
ones that Lynn is going to be reviewing
next week you can buy some of those
phones from best buy for example and so
there's no way to carry it out of area
yeah there's no way to get it unlocked
device I guess I mean why not using by
the Huawei honor which is the global
version of the mercury and you can get
that unlocked but is it gsm um that one
yeah probably yeah or maybe I saw some
posts people are talking about you can
maybe even and this is on earth is true
but you can maybe figure out how to
unlock a sprint device to roam on on
another carrier's network so maybe
that's an option too but I don't know if
I'm finally spurt would take that yeah
that's crazy I you can usually do that I
mean that there was another network um
sprint supports a lot of mva knows so
basically other companies that use
sprint's network in a secondary fashion
to sort of offer service and you can't
just take a sprint phone which is locked
specifically to Sprint's own branded
network you can't just take your sprint
phone to another one of these networks
or MVNOs you have to have an unlocked
phone yeah i mean i read i read some
stuff and it sounded pretty shady so I
don't want to wreck the brain totally
recommend you should do this right now I
think you should recommend i think i
should hack sprint's network I i'm
imagining legal listening with this
right now you know oh boy there we go
let's see we have actually a cousin of
draw in our chat room says that you can
take a sprint verizon phone to metro pcs
and have them hack it oh yeah into metro
pcs and cricket so there you go play
with your own life life in your hands so
we have a one more readers comment or
one
readers email that we're going to read
today sure it's uh it's basically
someone from all the way from Syria
which is pretty pretty amazing Omar
reach out to us and wanted to know
basically he's really interested in the
galaxy note um but it's really expensive
about seven hundred dollars u.s. I'm
assuming so he wanted to let us know
about that that he's really into that
device and also he's eyeing the sony
ericsson xperia pro as well so you know
has great he says it has a great qwerty
keyboard and it's it's closed or on par
with to the droid 3 or droid 4 so i
don't know if you guys have used
anything like that or if you love it let
us know and we'll put your feedback on
air the subtext i'm getting from omar is
quit your complaining about how much you
have to spend on phones because it's
their unsubsidized in many parts of the
world so seven hundred dollars is really
par in Syria and other countries a lot
of other countries where carriers don't
subsidize it we definitely have sort of
an interesting typical situation in the
u.s. here with our carriers who have a
stranglehold on us for the best phones
but hey i don't know if i'm complaining
about that exactly because I would
rather probably pay 200 or 300 for a
high-end phone and sign a contract
personally then pay seven hundred
dollars every time I want to switch yeah
that's a lot that is a lot of money
though I think the only phone i would
pay that much money for would be
something I would i know would always
get updated with the latest software oh
really do you have a phone in mine are
you getting something maybe the Galaxy
Nexus perhaps he says quietly so that is
