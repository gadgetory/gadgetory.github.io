first look at the monster DNA pro 2.0
headphones now you're probably wondering
why these look so different from other
monster headphones while monster took a
different approach to this flagship
headphones design you still get the same
classic monster semi-circle headband but
the ear cups take the form of triangles
this time which may look pretty cool
with a fake carbon fiber weave and some
reflective pieces on the side here but
the area inside where your ear goes is
actually pretty small so you'll want to
make sure and try these on before you
buy them because as with all headphones
fit is a huge factor in both comfort and
sound quality other details worth noting
are an additional headphone jack on the
side so you and your friend can both
listen to a source at the same time you
also get two different cables in the
package one with a coiled section at the
top for extra length and a separate
cable with an inline remote and volume
control for your smart phone in terms of
performance these sound great if you can
achieve a proper fit music sounds smooth
and well balanced and although you do
get a lot of bass out of these it's not
going to be overpowering like some of
monsters other headphones this model
doesn't have active noise canceling but
it does do a really great job at hiding
outside noise while you're listening you
can check out more comparisons photos
and details in my full review on CNET
but that's going to do it for this video
this is the monster DNA pro 2.0
headphones thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
