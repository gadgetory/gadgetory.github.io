fitness wristbands I'm Bridget Carey and
this is your CNET update there's another
SmartWatch fitness tracker on the way
adidas unveiled the miCoach smart run
watch it packs in an mp3 player GPS a
heartrate monitor and the digital my
coach trainer program which speaks to
you during a workout with tips and
updates on your progress the adidas
miCoach suite of products have been out
for some time now and the technology was
impressive when I tried it a few years
ago but this is the first time it's
incorporated into a wristwatch this will
come out in November and will cost $400
but it packs quite a number of features
into the high price it runs Android it
can count steps and measure your stride
track your speed and how far you've ran
and it also has Bluetooth so you can
play music through a wireless headset
basically it does more than any other
fitness tracking wristband out there and
it'll work with apps for iOS Android and
Windows Phone 8 this is going to be a
big competitor to the new Nike FuelBand
se which costs much less at $150 but of
course it doesn't have as many features
and only has an app for iOS it's been a
busy time for fitness tracking
wristbands the Fitbit force made its
debut the other week for 130 dollars and
there's another brand even cheaper
called the fit bug orb it's 50 dollars
and it's a small plastic pebble-like
device about as wide as a quarter and a
counter steps distance and sleep it
comes in pink black or white and you can
snap it into a wristband or belt hook
but for the lower price you don't get
any display that shows the time progress
or your stats to see your data you need
a smartphone app or you need to sync it
to your PC via bluetooth
it works for iPhones iPod Touches and
Android phones that have Bluetooth 4.0
the single cell battery is supposed to
last between 4 and 6 months depending on
how active you are Windows 8.1 is now
available to download if you're an
existing windows 8 user the upgrade is
free and you can find it in the
Windows Store it's not a major change
there are a few new tools and features
as well as a new type of Start button
you can find the full rundown of the
changes in our review if you're someone
who still has Windows 7 we suggest you
stick with Windows 7 that is until you
buy a new PC with a touchscreen and a
heads up for you parents out there your
teens can now post things on Facebook
that the world can see Facebook changed
its settings to give teachers the power
to make a public post which they
couldn't do before that your tech news
