it's not another ultra-thin ultra light
model it's actually a gaming system it's
one of the gaming system it's an
entirely new gaming a line it's called
the notebook Odyssey series and we saw
the notebook Odyssey 15 that's a 15 inch
model there's also going to be the
notebook honesty's 17 which is a 17 inch
version in the 15 you've got an Nvidia
1050 GPU it's not the highest end
graphics card out there but it is
perfectly fine for current games at high
detail levels and and 1920 by 1080
resolution not quite enough for virtual
reality but still pretty good 16 gigs of
ram it's also got an anti-glare display
which I always like seeing especially in
the gaming laptop and Samsung says
they've built in some hotkeys for
recording and broadcasting in-game
footage which of course is what
everybody likes to do these days in the
17 you can probably expect some better
specs I like the new design on these
there's a kind of angular pattern around
the touchpad and the bottom vents are
done in a very interesting crosshatch
pattern and of course you've got the pre
wack is that backlit keys the
multicolored keys you see that on a lot
of the new gaming laptops so keep an eye
out later this year for the Samsung
notebook Odyssey 15 and Odyssey 17</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
