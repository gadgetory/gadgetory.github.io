and if you're in the market for a sleek
and slim Windows 8 laptop for around
$1,000 here's the Asus vive book v55 1lb
DB 71 T
it's a 15.6 inch laptop so it's not
ultra portable and it's travel weight is
about 6 pounds however it is less than
an inch thick so it is thin but not so
light the lid and keyboard surround in
palm rests are metal changing over to
plastic on the bottom but the design
remains clean with a nice overall solid
feel opening it up you get a look at
perhaps its biggest downside its screen
now it's touch response is very good and
the best thing about it really but the
pedestrian 1366 by 768 resolution is
disappointing at this price plus it
doesn't get very bright and the face is
so high glare it can be difficult to see
in well-lit rooms or in daylight moving
on below the keyboard is nice and
comfortable and the multi-touch click
pad is responsive without being jumpy
the keyboards not backlit though which
again for $1000 we kind of expect at
this point now inside you'll find a 4th
gen Core i7 processor 8 gigs of memory
discreet mid-range nvidia graphics and a
1 terabyte hard drive not having a
solid-state drive or even a hybrid drive
brings down its performance um but the
processor and graphics combo are solid
for day-to-day tasks and gaming at
reduced settings and battery life on our
video playback test lasted 6 hours and
20 minutes all in all it's a very good
laptop but lacks a few things that would
make it excellent for the money
I'm Josh Goldman and that's a look at
the Asus Viva book v55 1lb</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
