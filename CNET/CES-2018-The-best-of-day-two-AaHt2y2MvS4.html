at the scene that stage at CES this is
the best of CES 2018 day tune you could
say we are smack in the middle of this
show at this point here we are at the
end of the full day that we've had and
press conferences are behind us which
Scott and I brought you as things kicked
off on Monday I'm here with Scott Stein
my personal physician thank you for
being here as usual we're doing well
we're hanging in there all right thank
you keep an eye on me I need you here
we're here for the next 20 minutes or so
we're gonna boil down for you the best
products that CNET editors and there's
90 of us here by the way have seen here
at this the largest Consumer Electronics
Show on earth kicking it off I nominate
the power outage so for crime over there
was a power outage it was rain yep there
was darkness yes
CES yes and the rain led to the darkness
that was that was looking at everyone's
out there walking around slack-jawed
never seen power out before it is
actually a cruel irony you come to a
show here that showcases the future of a
world that can't exist without power and
you yanked that cord it is a deep inner
meta discussion of what we're gonna do
yeah they're gonna in the end they're
gonna say see we're getting you to think
about power solution we told you you're
a stupid infrastructure smart cities the
power outage at the North Hall the South
Hall are sorry the central hall our
South Hall here where we're based kept
running
that's because somebody above shines a
happy face on the red ball wherever we
are now I love the utterly unattainable
is one of my first nominees it's the LG
rollup OLED TV it solves a real pain
point and that is TVs are ugly when
you're not watching content on them you
sure as hell don't want to look at black
plastic gak on your wall so this guy
rolls up out of a relatively small
cabinet almost looks like a short throw
projector
yeah and it's OLED it's impossibly
aspirational and you can put it just
partway up as well and have kind of this
eyebrow display as
a home information console if you're
that much of a nerd we don't want to
plot your phone you just wait
my heads-up little moment exactly all my
heads-up ribbon display in the living
room what's the weather right bring it
back down it's super slick it's
exceedingly drool-worthy
wobbly just got something that I just
saw today speaking of a why keep
following VR the HTC vive pro now where
does VR go from here we can I've been
asking all week yep yeah good
experiences in them what well
interestingly enough HTC and viber going
the other direction not affordability
but but higher-end enterprise it's not a
crazy idea higher resolution Wireless it
was the first Intel Y gig technology
that I've seen that is an adapter that
allows you to cut the cord and move
around freely and that's gonna be sold
even if you have the original vibe and
that's a trend you'll see eventually all
VR headsets will be Wireless it fit
better on my head they distributed the
weight okay on my weird head in all
heads and and it basically is a better
VR thing has a wider range now are you
gonna buy that
probably not but they're pushing the
envelope on stuff that will inevitably
be in VR and make it better and more
comfortable for wireless and cordless is
incredibly important incredibly I can't
tell you how much of a hurdle that is to
people who are already wigged out by the
idea they've got to put something on
their face cut themselves off from the
world stop multitasking stop having you
know some kind of contact with people
that are around them there has not been
a face worn technology that took off in
the consumer market since 1784 bifocals
it's been a long time coming so you got
to get past these human-machine hurdles
before any use case is gonna print I
applaud this very much I'm glad you
spotted it I did that surgery simulator
this was actually done with I think
Stanford yeah and it was trying to
explore not accuracy but to just get you
the feel it's a little it was cool wonky
controls but it made you realize oh now
I understand how to put a stent maybe I
know what it did I don't know it's my
personal physician dr. Scott Steiner
everyone thinks I'm kidding he's gonna
put a stent in my arm later I said I
know what that simulation tells me it's
supposed to be like here's another one
it's almost hard to believe so it's a
stay in the medical fetus fear for a
minute the olia systems
Corder now this is right out of original
Star Trek stuff but it's better than a
koala tricorder it's a quad quarter that
things about the size of a business card
and what about a quarter inch thick
it'll sense heart rate respiration heart
anomalies temperature and this is
interesting
heart signature they say that everyone's
EKG is a unique signature like a
fingerprint they can tell an individual
by looking at that chart that's new I
had never thought that had not I've had
neither and this thing is fully
contactless I'll be honest I got to see
it and grill them a little more it's got
the stink of a little bit of vapor on it
but I know this technology is actually
being done in the medical sphere and
Volvo had something similar
they had a heartbeat and respiration
detector in their cars a few years ago
wasn't popular they dropped the option
but it was a way for you to tell if
there was someone waiting in your car to
attack you and it would show up as a
heartbeat on the key fob as you
approached your car it's the same core
technology I think so this is legit but
the idea that you just wear this like a
pendant or keep it in your pocket Wow
and it's constantly doing these four
measurements yeah pretty pretty cool
stuff you found the sequel to face ID
heart signature that's right heart
signature that is the future is heart
signature meet us in three years let's
see it right here right here I have a
weird fantasy of filling my home's walls
with colored lights I'm not ashamed to
admit it
nano leaf which right Chris covered
makes these crazy multicolored glowing
alone I love this yeah everybody's fall
in love with this yep and and now
they're back and they're showing these
square pixel like it's like Minecraft
meets like crazy fantasy wall and they
have these here they're touch sensitive
there are gesture controls you know to
Siri Alexa Google assistant and there's
some crazy glowing dodecahedron
controller and I want that too just to
sit in my room surrounded by colored
glowing lights with my dhoti why do we
both love this I don't know it's oddly
useless but it is fascinating it brings
me back to like Atari games it's great
yeah yeah it's it's all it's all 8-bit
looking stuff it's low res it's blocky
it's oddly creative I will never be
allowed to install this in my house no
there's whatsoever whatsoever but it's
cool yeah it is very cool I spotted it
too and said oh I wonder if Scott's
gonna like this as much as I do
and isn't that weird I
we had a slew of car announcements the
most tangible of which was Samsung's
very credible entry into the automotive
cabin now they bought a company called
Harman last year you may know them for
Harman Kardon audio which you very
unlikely have in your car real real big
maker of in-car technology so now
Samsung overnight is a major supplier
arguably the number one supplier of
in-car electronic connected technology
we already know they have a huge
footprint in mobile and a huge footprint
in smart home gear so you see what I
think now is a company that has the most
credible argument to say that we are
gonna be the first to connect homes cars
and mobiles in an in a true ecosystem to
use that hackneyed old term that really
works smart things appliances Harman the
largest maker of in-car electronics this
is a powerful combination now there's
plenty of real work they have to do to
make it happen yeah but this was an
amazing alliance I think kind of got
under under touted here at the show this
this week I've been trying to catch up
on car tech and at every moment it's
everywhere fitness wise I didn't get to
see this either but peloton company that
makes bikes with training integrated
yeah is making a treadmill peloton tread
now if you want look the future of gyms
your next fancy gym we're gonna work out
it's meant to offer an immersive
experience like the bikes and training
is gonna become something even more
important you're looking at fitness tech
more than the equipment perhaps and
you're seeing a lot of companies try to
break through into training that's been
a big success story for them smarter
Fitness tools like this could be the new
luxury thing if you can afford $4,000
yeah these are multi thousand-dollar
rigs right my brother-in-law's thing
he's gonna put that in his basement next
in his nice sports bar these are live
sessions with people on the cloud in who
are peloton members who come a yak and
led by a leader who is a trainer is from
what I understand yeah it's basically
like I live cuz it's like I do not do
those things I basically basically what
I do on this was fall off oh yeah if I
get to an elliptical and I just play
some John Williams music for a little
while oh and that's my very good
excellent strike oh very nice okay let's
go outside now for a quick moment to
Brian Tong who is at a company that many
people never expect to see here Google
for the first time perhaps
ever they have a vast presence at CES
showing off their hardware in particular
let's find out exactly what's going on
there BT is gonna tell us what's up
what's up at Google BT back here at CES
2018 the greatest technology showcase on
planet earth here we are at Google's
booth
I've been here for 10 years this is the
first time Google has brought an actual
booth to the show in the great outdoors
of CES were actually outside of the
halls and you can see we haven't it's
kind of like a two level building that
you can all come and visit
they'll feature a lot of different
things some of the new technologies that
Google is working on also obviously
feature the Google assistant which is a
huge theme here at the show so what we
want to do is kind of take you inside a
few of the rooms some you'll be able to
get to some will tell you if they're too
so but most the stuff that you see here
you're gonna be able to come and check
out for yourself and just experience it
so let's cut over out here to what they
call the gallery and kind of mows your
way through excuse me sir
no you're good to go thanks man all
right so here we go this is the gallery
what it has is Google's technology and
all the different devices that they're
partnering with there's over 350 devices
here that have some sort of integration
with the Google assistant we have
obviously the smart displays these are
like our personal assistant screens from
Lenovo
JBL LG we have those all here big hot
theme here we all know about speakers
integrated with the Google assistant as
well really everything here at the show
it's all about AI and everyone wants to
put Google's brains in their devices and
as the platform has grown so has their
partners we have some great sound
headsets here JBL across the board with
our speakers and their headphones got
this big boom in JBL Lync 500 you got to
love that
and then even things like appliances LG
signatures washer/dryer combo and even
some other cool stuff phones LG's tone
platinum headsets the LGB 30 and things
like the cord 0r9 right your little
robotic vacuum now when you come in here
you'll also see a lot of different
things a lot of different appliances
things like over here this is kind of a
fun one because it's littered with so
much stuff we have different thermos
that's obviously netatmo we have the
nest Honeywell's eco bees up top you'll
see a row of all the different smart
light bulbs and it just is here to
showcase and feature everything that
again has the brains now what I also
love about this is Google decided to
kind of have some fun here there's
nothing necessarily smart about this but
what this is is really kind of a fun
interactive demo a little diorama really
cute and stylized and think of it as
like a living City that Google has put
on here just to showcase some of the fun
stuff you'll have moving cars you have
the bank in the center with that
rotating dollar sign it's really fun and
just to kind of add that little charm of
how Google is really moving towards a
smart type city set up and just a great
way to like the display it's just really
cool stuff so come inside here
check it out and be sure to you know see
all the great stuff that they have here
look at John Kim my photo talk just
getting low with that get in those low
angles baby get that alright so we're
gonna come and head out here again this
gallery is available for you everyone
that's here at the show to go and check
out yourself we're gonna take this
outside and we're gonna head to another
area
there's also above us a Google assistant
experience and what they really want to
showcases sure we have all these devices
here but also how do they work one of
the things you can say to the Google
assistant and how we're gonna get people
a lot more comfortable with using these
AI assistants throughout the day and
throughout really in their normal life
now we're gonna swing over this way
around here and this is one place that
I've got to be honest with you you kind
of got to have the cool kids card to get
upstairs this we're gonna take you up
these stairs very carefully and then
take you kind of the top floor they get
a really cool view of everything so you
go VIP would be tazie let's go alright
thank you guys
all right so this is check this out this
is kind of their rooftop upstairs
exclusive area they've got a lot of
Google Max's featured like playing music
they even have yeah you feel that beat
it's already out sound available right
now
$3.99 it sounds amazing now this is kind
of a fun thing that we have here over on
this spot it's like dark and everything
but they're gonna treat you out
lookyou we've got Google do i do nuts
for donuts baby right here I'm gonna I'm
gonna save one of these for you
JK this one's for you this I'm gonna
just feed you right here yeah eat that
eat that eat that yeah eat that eat that
yeah alright so you have this kind of
bar area just a cool hangout but let's
go to show you the view from this
perspective there's not many booths that
really give you this cool view of the
entire show so we're out here on the
front edge and this is look a really
cool look over there that's the South
Hall right now you can see the entire
this is the show floor from kind of a
different perspective at CES you could
just see how massive and scale this
entire thing is that great big CES
balloon it's kind of like a signal to
let you know you're upstairs enjoying
the big show and if you look carefully
you might even be able to see a little
scene that ball out there you know some
company that covers technology quite
well from what I've heard from what I've
heard all right let's just get out here
check this out one more time now I don't
know I don't know if we're gonna try
this should you know I'm gonna ask my
photo John are you ready do you want to
do this do you want to do this he's
getting he's getting his rig on assemble
we're gonna hold you for a second this
is gonna be the first ever slide camera
slide this is this is this is boss this
is legitimately boss so upstairs here
you got a great view but look not all of
you again can go down the Google slide
we want to give you like that feeling of
what it feels like so we're gonna send
John Kim my amazing photographer to
experience this so that you can
experience it
so John be careful look at this use of
slide is at your own risk curl up in a
ball turn the camera around on you John
show yourself show yourself he did it
alright we're good we're gonna come down
now I can see you we're coming down baby
we're coming down all right we did it
that's a quick look awesome booth here
Google's you know hey Google Google
assistant that was awesome you went down
the slide I went down the slide we'll
have plenty more coverage CES 2018 stick
with us t let's talk about this last
technology we want to bring to you with
Jessica dual court here that she's very
excited about this is one of the Holy
Grails of phone engineering it finally
happened fingerprint sensor without a
visible sensor yeah it seems like such a
small thing but in the phone world it's
a really big deal so I went and I saw a
phone made by a Chinese phone maker vivo
and it's got an in display fingerprint
reader it's actually underneath the
display on the outside exactly so you
have the entire expanse of the six inch
screen and you have a fingerprint area
it's where the home button would be you
kind of press it a little bit you really
got to put a little bit of force there
and it unlocks so far it's it's pretty
fast it's fairly accurate but this was a
pre-production model the beauty of all
of this is that there's no physical
button taking up the screen it's there
when you need it and then it totally
disappears and then you use gestures
sort of like what you would find on the
iPhone 10 to get around instead of
pressing a home button another pet peeve
that I have personally there were
fingerprint readers on the backs of
phones and that's another popular place
to put it if your phone is linked down
next to you and you want to use it you
have to
pick it up and unlock it that way every
single time if you don't want to swipe
and do a pin or pattern or something
like that so it's very it's very
specific important technology that was
rumored to be in the Samsung Galaxy
phones and then in the iPhone 10 and
that never happened and we're seeing it
for the first time not as you know just
this fanciful thing but as a real-life
working model not a prototype from a
Chinese phone maker I think that this is
something that we're going to start
seeing in premium phones in 2018 and
beyond it's gonna be a little bit more
expensive to make and use so that's this
is not something we're gonna see in
every single phone in the next year it's
going to be very selective and to be
clear the company the vivo has the first
prototype here synaptics did the part so
other brands could have this a company
that makes the component so I actually
was able to see the sensor and the
circuitry that they use to put under
there right now it's holding localized
so you can't put your finger anywhere on
the screen you really have to put it in
that one area but they kind of light it
up digitally so you know exactly where
to go you're just home ask you that yeah
interesting we think Scott big deal or
yeah Micro first world problem no I
think it's great and I still feel like
something like face ID it needs to be
improved a little more and for
accessibility I think you should have a
fingerprint sensor anyhow maybe you
could combine them yeah the other thing
phones are one thing but things like
this oh yeah I feel like you know you
have to add a passcode on this not just
for smartwatches but for any little
thing that you want to authenticate you
could start putting this now instead
this even though sometimes the smaller
realistic is you're pointing out the
benefit more real estate do you get more
screen real estate but in addition to
that I mean if you've got something like
face ID which we're also going to see on
phones in 2018 yeah I I wake up in the
morning I look at my phone if my face is
smashed in a pillow it's not gonna
recognize me your fingerprint if it's
dark if your face is obscured for
whatever reason you always have that
biometric backup I would love to see the
two of them together okay
all right I'm convinced I gotta say I
came into this thinking it was okay you
know gilding the lily but you've pointed
out some use cases here both of you
where in that seems like a path to some
really really sophisticated technology
it's very simple and it's one of those
things that maybe doesn't sound like a
big deal but I think we'll see
established use kay
is that it actually dude this is this is
sort of a wave of the future I'm
starting to see it a one that I was
excited to see more of I think and that
was more phones along the lines of the
axon am folding phone we didn't get a
Foley didn't get any foldable phones
here at the show this is something that
we've been talking about we know that
there are various phone makers that have
patents on this that are planning it
Samsung said we were gonna get one this
year so we're still waiting for that and
we don't exactly know what it's going to
look like so that the ZTE axon M has a
thick seam in the middle it's basically
two 5.2 inch screens next to each other
it folds open like a book it has some
really legitimately cool use cases and
potential however it's one of those
things where they're just like a lot of
really weird kind of I don't know like
hurdles to usability so you know it
makes you left-handed artificially
whether you are or not it feels really
unbalanced these are something that the
phone makers are going to have to work
on in order to make this compelling for
everyday use not just like oh great idea
that I will never buy and also the specs
have to be you know they have to match
the price has to match this back so you
will pay more for screen yeah but if
you've got last year's technology do you
really want it I could say a lot of a
lot of advertisers are spoken to here at
the show many of whom attend here
they're intrigued by the idea of dual
screens because it helps to solve the
battle between content interrupting or
stomping on advertising and vice versa
and all the viewability that everyone's
ki about just give each camp its own
screen simultaneously here's the content
on the Left here's the ad they bought on
the right no one's worried about
viewability they're both viewable but
then somehow the ads will end up on both
screens exactly you'll never find a way
around yep yeah you're on it I'm not so
I sold on the dual thing although I feel
it's this is more gimmicky but I think
about the Nintendo DS and how I felt
about that when it came out and I
thought that was the most gimmicky thing
and then it became a really amazing game
system so you never know I just I feel
like it needs to be really good I think
you find ways to use it in your everyday
life where you don't so with a folding
phone I'm leaning down but yeah one of
the use cases is is multitasking right
so you can have your video on one screen
and do something else on the
other you can open it up and have a
larger display if you don't have an ugly
seam down the middle or I kind of like
this I don't know if I would use it but
you can sort of fold it like a tent and
imagine you're sitting across from
somebody ad on a table you can watch the
same video or like a mini laptop or like
a mini noble concept with the keyboard
like maybe you're typing something yeah
to wrap here the one that everyone was
just wondering if it might arrive and
didn't Galaxy S nine what's your
forecast on it now I never thought it
was going to come here that is not part
of Samsung's historical release cycle it
just doesn't happen this early so that
is a phone that is widely expected to
come at Mobile World Congress which is
the end of February and leaning into
March or quite possibly if Samsung
doesn't hit that target date it could
come as a standalone event afterwards
we've seen that happen with two of the
Samsung phones where that event will
take place in New York but it's short so
you're either gonna get Anna February or
you know to mid March and then we'll see
the phone hit store shelves probably
late March April I'm guessing all this
but just based on years and years and
years of noxious cycle yeah I mean we're
like about 10 years in fairly confident
that this will happen and you know it
will be interesting to see if some of
that technology finally does make it
into the Galaxy S 9 at the most
realistic use case I think will not be
that that s9 is foldable but that it
could have a fingerprint sensor in
screen or under screen just like the
vivo phone that we saw say that's
interesting cuz of you if you look at
the production time obviously I would
they would had to have been engineering
this new part in to the inspect for the
s9 so I wonder how they would feel about
the fact that someone else stole their
thunder and yet they'd be the first big
phone perhaps dead you know I actually
think it's the other way around I think
you know this the interest around vivo
could be sort of a validation if Samsung
is planning this because this is
something people are getting excited
about its hyped up the vivo phone is not
announced we don't have a name we don't
have a price we don't know what it's
probably appropriate it's it's
pre-production but ready for production
okay so we don't know when this is
coming out it's very possible you know
oftentimes when a company announces it
first they're not always first to market
Samsung is a global brand vivo is really
mostly known in China so and this is
came here could be Samsung's gain as
well what happens with synaptics in the
past you know sometimes we'll see a
concept and then you will see it emerge
in another product you know the course
of fingerprint says yeah the trial
balloon brand is here the main go to
market brand is over here it's a good
harbinger of it yeah I mean we've also
seen things come to other phones first
like wireless charging and waterproofing
and then Apple comes along and it's like
it's been invented for the dates that
whole pixie dust is a whole other story
all right Thank You Jessica
appreciate thanks for the update very
interesting technology there that's it
for day 2 of CES everybody for myself in
Scott I'll Scotch 9 thanks for watching
we'll get that stent done afterwards if
you wanna go yeah I'm all ready okay
