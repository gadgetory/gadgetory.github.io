and we are at GES headquarters taking a
look at a brand new product it's
basically a spin on existing products
that GE has we're looking at the event
to mod this is a little combo oven that
you will slide into your wall in your
kitchen comes in two widths you've got
27 inches on the top or 30 inches your
choice of the two and what's really
interesting is that this oven has a
microwave on the top and a standard oven
on the bottom but the microwave on top
uses the advantium speed cooking
technology you basically get double or
even quadruple the cooking times that
you would normally get from a ordinary
microwave oven that is made possible by
convection oven technology that's
swirling the hot air around as well as
halogen lighting that crisps everything
like it would in a normal oven as
opposed to a microwave so there you have
it you have two doors here and the whole
setup comes in a stainless steel finish
but hopefully the slate finish will be
in the works soon so if you want to get
your hands on the new GE event Ahmad
combo cooking device you will be able to
fight it for 39.99 it begins to ship on
August 1st and it will be available in
the profile as well as the cafe series
