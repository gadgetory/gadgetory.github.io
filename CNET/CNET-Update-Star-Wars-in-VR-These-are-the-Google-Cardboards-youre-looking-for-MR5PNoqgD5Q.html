collectible but this one you don't have
to pay for I'm Bridget Carey this is
your scene that update you can visit a
galaxy far far away in virtual reality
with the star wars app and Verizon is
giving away free google cardboard
headsets in four different Star Wars
character designs there's r2d2 bb-8 kylo
Ren and a stormtrooper the Galactic
Empire of verizon gave us a private
secured experience to check the mountain
person there are 200,000 of these being
given out to Verizon customers in stores
verizon is one of the sponsors of the
upcoming movie The Force awakens but you
don't need this collectible version to
enjoy the Star Wars universe in virtual
reality nebr headset will do and you can
find a plain google cardboard set for
just three bucks on ebay the main star
wars app has been updated with a new
feature called jakku spy inside you'll
find short 360 degree video clips in
stereoscopic 3d which tease the movie
the first one has you on the desert
planet jakku getting a message from bb-8
a new one comes out every few days with
nine in total and they're all going to
tie together into a story and don't
forget google cardboard works with
iphones or androids these are not the
droids you're looking for move along and
there's more news in the world of
virtual reality if you happen to have a
Samsung gear VR headset which costs a
hundred dollars and now comes with a web
browser so yes you can browse the web
and watch videos in a panoramic view
with something strapped to your head as
if your internet searches weren't
strange enough already gear VR went on
sale a few weeks ago in the US and it
just arrived in the UK on Wednesday it
only works with the galaxy note 5 and
the new galaxy s6 models but if you
really want to feel like you're living
the movie forget VR you may have to
travel to Omaha Nebraska to watch the
force awakens in the Alamo Drafthouse
because the theater built a lobby that
looks like it's straight out of the
Death Star and there's even a Death Star
in the Death Star there's a ten foot
model hanging from the ceiling that
lights
up you can sit on the Emperor's throne
and order from a concession stand that's
topped with snacks worthy of a Sith Lord
that's it for this tech news update and
there's more at cnet com from our
studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey
see now this is the droid you're looking
for</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
