and this is another big-time battle
everyone wants to know how does
BlackBerry's first all touchscreen phone
stack up to the competition well many of
you guys left blackberry to jump to the
iPhone so we're bringing you a prize
five punch out between blackberry z10
and Apple's iPhone 5 to see if they've
done enough to bring you back home our
judges for this fight are senior editor
Jessica Duke it out dole cork associate
editor Lynn
ba la lalala and myself for all the
ladies all night long Tom now we'll take
all three judges scores and average them
out to the nearest tenth each round the
final prizefight score will be an
average of all rounds using the same
system let's get it started
round 1 is designed blackberry brings
its classiest looking phone to date with
the tight design of the z10 even if it
has some resemblance to the iPhone 5 its
soft leather S textured backing and
softer curved edges are comfortable to
hold and it's 4.2 inch screen is larger
and has a higher 356 pixels per inch now
we know Apple's iPhone 5 design is one
of their best ever bringing their
quality design and level of
craftsmanship its 4-inch Retina display
is smaller but it's still a beauty with
326 pixels per inch super-bright display
and it's two-tone design that's still
thinner and lighter than the z10 these
phones both look great with the iPhone 5
takes the round with the 4.7 and the z10
gets a 4.3 next round is user interface
and controls the z10 is BlackBerry's
first all touchscreen phone and it
relies on a set of gesture controls to
navigate the OS without any specific
home button now it has a higher learning
curve it's not pick-up-and-play but it's
not hard once you get used to them you
can pull down from the top to access
services swiping from the bottom takes
you to the multitasking screen to close
apps and accessing the BlackBerry peak
feature to check out your notifications
is this team move now there's nothing
you don't already know about iOS it's
still the easiest UI
planet Earth but it hasn't evolved to
add more features like customization or
better notifications pull down my nieces
and nephews can use it with these but
Apple can still bring more to the table
while keeping it simplified the iPhone
still takes this round with four point
seven and the z10 gets a three point
seven after averaging two rounds the
iPhone five leads round three is
features the z10 brings new features to
the table that we haven't seen from
other phones with its 1.5 gigahertz
dual-core processor I'm a fan of its
keyboard that allows you to flick
suggested words as you're typing your
messages and then deleting letters or
entire words depending on how you swipe
backwards and that's pretty nifty
blackberry messenger is part of their
heritage and is their best version yet
with video chatting you'll also have NFC
to immediately add contacts and a
universal search and let's not forget
HDMI out and an expandable memory card
slot the preloaded Documents To Go is
nice for business users and the
BlackBerry balanced feature keeps your
work and personal lives separate on the
same phone
but as drawbacks are a week Maps app
that lack local businesses when you zoom
in and no walking or transit directions
their voice assistant is pretty mediocre
and the blackberry world store has
content but can't compare to the library
of apps at Apple breaks now Apple's
iPhone 5 dual port a6 processor is
blazing fast and Siri becomes more
useful with sports movies and food
recommendations now Siri is arguably the
best assistant right now but it still
hasn't lived up to the hype and it takes
way too long to get information back
from its servers Maps brings
turn-by-turn directions but it's still a
step back from what it was before and
passbook still remains rarely used and
it needs some help or else it's another
wasted Apple feature but Apple really
shines with its App Store that still
tops in the industry and no one can
match the content available on its
platform both phones have features that
make them unique but it also places
where they fall short so we're calling
this round a tie at four points apiece
next round is web browsing and more time
the z10 brings its webkit-based browser
with tab browsing and has the ability to
turn on flash support it's a solid
performer but we did have a few hiccups
rendering some pages correctly now it's
eight megapixel rear camera takes over
all good-looking pictures and 1080p
video as well it also has this cool time
shift mode for picking the best picture
from a bunch and a robust built-in
editing mode with tons of effects and
filters its media player widget that
will appear on screen when you press on
the volume rocker is a cool addition and
multimedia looked great on its screen
even if it can't get as bright as the
iPhones but it falls short with its
multimedia ecosystem that still trails
apples now Safari on the iPhone 5 brings
a full-screen mode and a smooth working
browser overall you can't ignore Apple's
iTunes which brings the most robust
library of multimedia that looks great
on its screen it's 8 megapixel rear
camera brings a built-in panorama mode
and 1080p video support with the ability
to take stills while recording video and
it's still really the best camera on a
mobile phone with pictures that were
more vibrant than the z10 now the
BlackBerry is no slouch in this round
but the iPhone 5 still takes it with the
4.7 and the z10 gets a 4 so after
averaging in 4 rounds the z10 still
trails the final round that decides it
all is performance
both phones are sold performing ones but
side-by-side it's the iPhone 5 that's
faster to navigate across the board
battery life received mixed results with
the z10 between our staff but our labs
tested out to ten point six hours of
talktime compared to around eight hours
for the iPhone five
now 4G LTE performance will vary in your
area but it was excellent for both
phones at San Francisco and call quality
was solid but will obviously be
different depending on your location and
carrier now fast don't lie and the
iPhone takes it yep another round with a
4.7 and the z10 gets a four so let's
average out all five rounds and in a
prizefight where Apple jumped ahead
early they really pin the BlackBerry
down and stayed on top with the iPhone 5
taking this battle four point six took
four and is your price buy it winner now
guys the point of this price buy it
wasn't to give Apple another win which
we did but it was to show you that
blackberry is back in the game and
although it might not be able to lure
hard for iPhone and Android users yet
the new BlackBerry has given their
diehards a phone they will want and it's
a solid foundation to build on i'm brian
song thanks for watching we'll catch you
guys next time for another prize bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
