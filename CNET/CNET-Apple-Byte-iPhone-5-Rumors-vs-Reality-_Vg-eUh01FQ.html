welcome to the apple pie for all the
good and bad stuff inside the world of
Apple now there's so many iphone 5
rumors floating around there and we
ignore a lot of them but many of you
have been writing in to ask what's been
happening with the iphone 5 so we have a
little rumor roundup for you from the
past week and a half so first off get
your save the date on your calendar
ready until the actual date is announced
but according to the iphone blog and
9to5 mac apple is targeting pre-orders
for the next iphone on the last days of
September into the 29th of the 30th and
shooting for a launch date in early
October and even as early as october the
seventh or the 14th so more and more
guesses you can bet are pointing to
october now now everyone is question if
the iphone will come with 4G or not no
one has confirmed it yet but the boy
genius report has obtained information
and documentation that shows apple
carrier partners are at the very least
testing iphone models with LTE
capabilities again this doesn't mean the
next iPhone will have LTE but Apple is
actively testing them with their
networks then 4G rumors got even hotter
after engadget tipsters reported a major
apple store was getting LTE 4G equipment
installed by AT&amp;amp;T but battery life
issues and the 4g chip size in the
thinner iPhone form factor aren't really
ready for primetime chest yet and what
about the looks of the phone we've seen
plenty of concepts some say it will
resemble the current iphone 4 and others
say it will be drastically different
well macrumors took things another step
further by commissioning a company to
create high-quality renderings based on
the allegedly leaked iphone 5 case
design that have been pretty accurate in
the past now the renderings look pretty
nice with the elongated home button and
tapered design but just consider this an
imagination of the next iPhone it's kind
of like how I imagined flying like an
eagle soaring high and caring for my
babies now the other story everyone asks
about is if there's really an ipad 3
coming out this year because it makes
complete sense for Apple to release you
know a new product six months later
that's still in high demand hopefully we
put this one to rest for a while after
digit times
the publication who months ago said an
ipad 3 was coming out this year recently
claimed that difficulties in building
high res retina displays that meet Apple
standards will push the release out to
2012 but it won't hurt them after a
surprise announcement one that really
came out of nowhere when HP announced it
will be discontinuing its line of web OS
devices specifically the touchpad and
web OS phones now webOS was expected to
be a strong computing platform but the
touchpad flopped with a lesson lukewarm
response in no other tablet has been
able to give the iPad or run for its
money all right let's switch gears for a
moment if your iTunes media has taken
over your hard drive space we have a
how-to to move your iTunes library onto
an external drive to get started open
iTunes and make sure the drive you want
to move your library to is connected to
your computer and ready to go next go
into your iTunes preferences on a PC
you'll find this under the Edit menu and
for macos under the iTunes menu click
under the Advanced tab and where it says
itunes music folder location change the
location to a folder on your external
hard drive next make sure the copy files
to music folder option is checked this
ensures that any new content you
download or rip into itunes gets
transferred to the new location after
that hit the ok button now you're not
done yet there's one more big step to
take before iTunes really starts moving
your library to the new location when
you're ready to make the transfer click
the itunes file menu then go to library
and select organize library you'll see a
window with options here for
consolidating and organizing your
library check them both if you can but
the critical one here is the first
option for consolidating files this is
going to take all the files referenced
by itunes on your computer your movies
your music your audio books podcast TV
shows and it's going to copy it over to
the new location on your external drive
it will take some time and remember it's
not deleting the old files it's just
copying them to the new location if
you're feeling confident later on you
can move your old itunes media files on
your local drive to the trash can after
the transfer is complete then check
again to make sure everything is still
working and then permanently delete the
old files watch out for deleting your
local itunes itl
or XML files low as these might still be
used for your playlists and ratings for
cnet com I'm Donald L helping to give
your iTunes library some extra breathing
room all right thank you mr. Donald now
apple recently released the floor plans
that are proposed mega headquarters in
my hometown of Cupertino California that
Steve Jobs and friends hope to have
finished by the year 2015 it looks so
magical now the Mac Observer took the
plans crunch the numbers and found that
the UFO will be just slightly larger
than the Pentagon it's longer than the
Navy's nuclear-powered USS enterprise
and the Empire State Building and did
you know that Apple even has more cash
than the United States government so
it's official welcome to the United
States of Apple now in other large glass
object Apple revealed its plans as it
remodels the Fifth Avenue glass cube in
New York changing its exterior to 15
panes of glass instead of its 90 that
just had way too many visual scenes and
really looks so horrible all right guys
on to the quick bites we told you how a
german court ruled in annapolis favor to
ban the sale of samsung's galaxy 10.1
tab in europe because apple argued it
resembled the ipad too closely well the
court is now lifted that banned except
in germany and a discovery in the
filings show ha apples submitted
pictures of the galaxy that weren't the
actual galaxy tab but an edited and
resized version of the tab that looks
exactly like the ipad we know you guys
are good with photoshop and graphics but
come on not that good also apples
joining the social party and adding
links to products on their online store
so now you can share what you like on
facebook and twitter and show friends
gift suggestions that they will never
buy for you and if you haven't updated

this idea from kooky zoo Mac os10 Maru
the internet famous cat yeah you know

to them but this one I could really
rally around
