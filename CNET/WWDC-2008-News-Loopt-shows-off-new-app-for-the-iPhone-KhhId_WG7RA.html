the iPhone loped is about connecting
with people on the go which is after all
the main reason you have a phone we show
you where people are what they're doing
and what cool places are around you
the orange pin up there is where I am
right now and the blue pins represent my
friends we make serendipity happen it's
amazing how often you wrote a restaurant
a couple of blocks away from a friend or
stuck in an airport with an old
classmate and don't know about it will
show you that this is the best version
of Luke that we have ever made and by
far the best device we've ever had the
opportunity to work with we've developed
for nearly every mobile platform out
there this one is the best and the most
powerful so James is navigating the map
just like you'd expect by pinching and
dragging and tapping and we can see that
there are some friends down south a
friend of mine is driving across the
Golden Gate Bridge
and here are some friends that are
varying their bias right now we can tap
the map a few times to zoom in and as we
zoom in we see that there's one friend
very very close so we can tap on that
dot and it's Erin Easter and she's only
a few blocks away and so we can see what
she's been doing today this is called
her journal photo she's taken text she's
entered all of this tied to places and
shareable with any other service she'd
like and the thing in blue is a comment
that her friend has left earlier today
so we can tap on that top entry that
says back at the cutest little cafe and
we can tap on it again and that photo
will enlarge so that does actually look
pretty cool and I don't have lunch plans
today so we'll see if she's free so we
can go back I could call her or I could
text her we integrate with the native
iPhone api's but I'll leave a comment
and I'll say free for lunch if she is
free then I can get directions to her in
one click and one line of code another
example of the power of the SDK and this
is really all an example of the power of
location location plus a contact list
and information about cool places means
you never have to eat lunch alone again
or at a bad place and we think that's
really cool we really do you can use
loop with your friends on most other
carriers or devices in the US we are the
largest social mapping service in the
world and very happy to announce that
loop will be free on the iPhone and in
the App Store at launch anyway we think
this is a new era of mobile we're
thrilled to be part of it thanks very
much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
