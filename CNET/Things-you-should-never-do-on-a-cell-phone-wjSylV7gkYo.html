Hollywood who filed for her IPO this
week and now has to observe an SEC
mandated quiet period that's the best
damn scam to get time off I've ever
heard of welcome to the buzz report
first the gadget of the week the gadget
of the week is electric death aka the US
Navy railgun look at this thing it
shoots a 5-inch shell up to 220 miles
without using any gunpowder it does it
with 33 megajoules of electromagnetics
kind of like one of those maglev trains
except it kills people Raytheon got the
nod to work on this guy this week and it
could be deployed on US ships by 2025 as
for me I can't wait for a surplus one to
come on ebay so we can mount it on one
of our review cars now the news with all
the buzz you'd have thought facebook
went public this week when in fact all
they did was just file papers saying
they would like to but in the meantime
this week's filing has all kinds of
fascinating numerical nuggets facebook
expects to be worth 75 to 100 billion
dollars they're going to raise between
five and ten billion dollars for their
war chest the day they go out and 21 to
28 billion dollars of all those shares
will be Zuckerberg and that still won't
convince him to buy a shirt with a
collar but for most of us Facebook users
who will never own the stock the best
part of them going public is that they
have to go public that means formally
and regularly reporting to the world
what they do and how they do it that may
lead to greater transparency when it
comes to our privacy or at least greater
pressure to do so anti-corporate group
some of us started a petition this week
for Apple to make iphone 5 the first
ethical iPhone by demanding its
manufacturing partners like Foxconn in
China improve working conditions right
off the bat they got 35,000 people to
sign it about the same number of Chinese
who lined up for jobs at a foxconn plant
this week if you
saw the leaked photos a few weeks ago of
the supposed new BlackBerry designed by
Porsche and realized the Panamera isn't
the only ugly thing with the Porsche
name on it take heart a new leak
suggests that this is in fact the new
blackberry blessedly devoid of any paul
revere pewter ware design cues but as
you can also see it appears to be a pure
touch device no more famed blackberry
keyboard and the rumor is it's the
single new phone they'll be rolling out
later this year with blackberry OS 10 so
what sticks out further than Pinocchio's
nose rims neck but that sure beats being
long on yesterday speaking of phones new
research out this week if you carry an
android phone you're a whore this survey
was done by match com beating MIT to the
punch and found in a nutshell iphone
users are most likely to fish off the
company pier but also to call you the
next day after a first date Android
users are most likely to have a
one-night stand do it on the first date
or both and they ain't never calling you
and BlackBerry users are most likely to
get drunk on a date I mean they're
carrying a blackberry after all oh it
gets better another survey this week
tells us BlackBerry users are most
likely to continue their call when
they're on the can don't do that and
don't leave the damn stall door unlocked
and don't make noises like you're having
geriatric sex just stop all of that
that's it for this week everybody I'm
Brian Cooley molly's back next week all
wealthy and smug
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
