second generation Kindle paperwhite I
don't know if the analogy is completely
appropriate but I look at this as kind
of the iPhone 5s of readers it looks
nearly identical to the original
paperwhite but it's better and zippier
for starters this is the first shipping
product to feature a inks pearl to
display which offers slightly better
contrast instead of the 800 megahertz
processors that are found in the
original paperwhite you get a one
gigahertz processor and there's a next
generation built-in light and a more
responsive touchscreen display that is a
19% tighter touch grid it's also a hair
lighter weighing in at seven point three
ounces instead of seven point five
ounces
the most immediate difference you notice
between the new paperwhite and the
original is that the display looks
whiter as opposed to having a little bit
of a blue twinge and the lighting is
more uniform also the light is brighter
at its highest setting on the original
paperwhite there was a bit of murkiness
a sort of clouding effect at the bottom
of the display when using the light
particularly at night the light now
displays much more evenly across the
screen it's a definite improvement
amazon says the contrast has been
increased but it's hard to tell that the
blacks are that much blacker even if
they are still the screen is more
pleasant to look at particularly when
the light is on and looks more like a
page from printed book it's also worth
mentioning that the new display requires
less refreshing to eliminate the
artifacts or ghosting that's inherent to
eing screens the previous bottle
refreshed about every six page terms and
my test the smile seems to refresh about
every 13 to 14 page turns as for battery
life it remains the same it up to two
months with Wi-Fi off despite the bump
in processor speed it comes with the
same two gigabytes of integrated storage
1.25 gigabytes of which is available for
the user the rest of the changes
involved feature upgrades that Amazon
has or will add through software updates
these include a smart lookup feature
that streamlines the dictionary x-ray
and Wikipedia lookup interface with a
single easy to access set of tabs and
vocabulary
builder which keeps track of all the
words you look up in the dictionary and
allows you to create flashcards to help
you learn those words Goodreads
integration and Kindle page flip a sort
of picture and picture page scanning
feature are coming soon as is Amazon's
kid centric kindle freetime feature
which adds parental controls
I also compare this model to Cobos aura
which is a nicely designed ereader but
the screen and lighting are better on
the Kindle it's not a huge difference
but it's definitely noticeable and the
paperwhite cost less starting at 119 for
the Wi-Fi only model that serves up ads
Amazon calls some special offers on your
home screen this may seem like an
unspectacular upgrade on the surface but
it clearly improves on the previous
Kindle paperwhite basically Amazon has
taken a very good product and made it
about 20 to 25 percent better and while
it would have liked to have seen
Amazon's engineers cut the size and
weight down by about 25 percent kind of
like the Kobo aura it's still the best
eReader currently available I'm David
