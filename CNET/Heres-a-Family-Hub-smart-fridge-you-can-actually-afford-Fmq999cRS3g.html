high-profile smart fridge on the market
and this year Samsung released new
models that don't cost quite as much
I've got the least expensive of these
new family hubs here with me in the C
net smart homes kitchen unlike the
luxurious four-door family hubs of last
year which cost five thousand dollars
enough this one is just a basic French
door build in plain stainless steel the
retail cost here $2,900 pretty much par
for the course when it comes to fancy
French door fridges the odds are also
good that you can get it for even less
than that I've seen refurbished models
selling from outlets like Sears for as
low as fifteen hundred dollars this
cheaper family hub has all the same
smarts as the original you get the same
twenty one and a half inch touchscreen
with the same slate of fridge apps and
yes you can still see what's inside the
fridge using a trio of fridge cameras
that snap a photo whenever you close the
doors that touch screens operating
system got a nice update from year one
to year two the overall design is a
little more refined and you also get
some new apps like this nama coo cooking
app that'll connect with your smart sous
vide cooking gadget one other feature
that I like is here in the recipes app
you can pull up something that you want
to cook say this shrimp scampi
cheesecake appetizer and then customize
exactly how many servings you want to
make it'll automatically adjust the
ingredients and tell you how much you
need and if you don't have any of those
ingredients you can just select them and
then send them straight to your shopping
list the big sacrifice is designed it
doesn't look nearly as nice as those
top-of-the-line family hubs from last
year and you don't get the very nice
flex zone feature that lets you split
off one half of the freezer and use it
as extra fresh food storage space the
inside feels cheaper than before - like
these rattling crisper bins still you
get a reasonable 24 cubic feet of
storage space plus adjustable shelves
and a temperature adjustable cool select
pantry drawer performance was steady -
with accurate temperatures in the body
of the fridge and only minor hot spots
in the door shelves the new more
affordable family hub fits right in
among fancy yet generic French door
models and it has that massive touch
screen to help set it apart from the
crowd
at less than $3,000 or even less than
$2,000 if you catch a nice sale it's a
perfectly justifiable pick for a kitchen
