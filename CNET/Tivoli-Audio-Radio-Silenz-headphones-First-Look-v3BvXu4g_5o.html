for cnet.com and I'm here with the
Tivoli audio radio silence headphones
let me start by saying that I'm a fan of
Tivoli and I've always liked the
company's tabletop radios and portable
power radios which offer an excellent
blend of design and performance that
makes it easier overlook their
relatively high price tags alas the
company's first foray into the
headphones market is a different
situation altogether instead of coming
up with a unique high-quality product
tib lees put something together that's
both unoriginal and decidedly
entry-level while slapping $150 price
tag on it the reason I say unoriginal is
that the radio silence headphones look
very similar to the meat electronics HT
21 headphones which cost twenty-five
dollars at amazon that's right
twenty-five dollars yes the radio
silence has typically signature wood
trim on the ear cups and also include
some noise cancelling circuitry but
otherwise the headphones have the same
design right down to the cheap plastic
storage bag that ships with the
headphones on the plus side the
headphones actually look pretty nice our
lightweight fold up for transport and
are fairly comfortable for on ear
headphones but they just aren't all that
luxurious true two headphones can look
the same on the outside but sound
altogether different and in fact the
radio silence and HD 21 do sound
different the radio silence offers more
bass but in the process sacrifices some
detail the HT 21 on the other hand seems
a bit thin by comparison but offers a
touch more clarity both however lack any
sort of refinement associated with
higher end headphones I expected tighter
bass and more detail from these guys
particularly because I have a lot of
respect the sound that Tivoli radios
deliver instead there's something a
little mushy and bloated sounding about
these headphones that put some squarely
in the sub $50 camp well they don't
sound bad they don't sound all that good
the noise cancelling was also a
disappointment when activated it really
isn't effective and when you're
listening to quieter music or gaps in
playback you could hear a discernible
hiss
this is par for the course for noise
canceling headphones but it seemed much
more noticeable on this model look if
typically put these out for $79 or even
$99 I would have been more willing to
give it the benefit of the doubt and be
less critical the wood trim does add a
nice touch to design of the headphones
but the 150 999 price tag strikes me as
cynical sure plenty of other companies
of tweaked and polished off the shelf
designs of various consumer electronics
products with the radio silence and HD
21 headphones are just too closely
separated at birth as it stands you'll
be better off with the compact and super
comfortable Bose OE two orrow e2i
headphones or sena is more affordable HD
to 38 which is being replaced by the hd2
39 those on your models don't offer the
active noise cancellation of these
headphones but they do passively seal
out a good amount of sound and you won't
have to deal with hearing that audible
history quater tracks or gaps in
playback i'm david carr nguoi and those
are the tivoli audio radio silence
headphone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
