contract I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your cnet update next week t-mobile is
expected to announce that it's getting
rid of smartphone subsidies altogether
that means no more discounted phones
when you sign a new two year contract
the idea is that customers would pay
full price for a phone which could be as
much as 600 or 700 dollars and then just
pay a lower monthly bill or there could
also be a way to pay for your phone on a
monthly installment plan this big
announcement comes on march twenty six
so we'll find out for certain then the
shutdown of Google Reader still has many
people fired up especially people in
countries where internet access is
restricted by the government the
change.org petition has racked up more
than 130,000 signatures of people urging
Google to keep the reader tool alive
while some in the u.s. just might feel
inconvenience about finding a new RSS
aggregator petition signers in other
countries have left comments about how
Google Reader is vital to staying
connected with the world comments from
users in Kazakhstan and China say reader
is the best way to access band websites
and uncensored news about 75% of
signatures on the petition came from
outside the US twelve percent came from
people living in countries that have
internet censorship google reader is
scheduled to be shut down on july first
as you know google has several tools for
communication there's Google Talk
hangout voice and messenger but they
could be all rolled into one unified
program called google babble at least
that's the rumor geek.com is hearing
from sources if that's true we could
hear more about Google babble in May at
the Google Developers Conference that's
usually when google unveils new products
and software this could be the year of
the SmartWatch a Samsung executive told
Bloomberg that the company is working on
a SmartWatch of course no word on when
it could be ready looking ahead this
week the blackberry z10 smartphone will
finally hit stores on Thursday but right
now only eighteen t is carrying the z10
to celebrate the launch of the phone
that Blackberry took forever to release
the company executives made a music
video to the song at last but with campy
lyrics and bad lip syncing and it's just
all kinds of corny you'll games and apps
or in the store listen dudes I know
you're just having a little fun and
showing that you're excited for your
team but when people say it's
embarrassing to have a blackberry phone
you're not helping the cause you're
giving nerdy white people a bad name
just keep the music videos to yourself
and put more effort in getting better
apps on your phone because that would be
great that's your tech news update you
can find more details at cnet com /
