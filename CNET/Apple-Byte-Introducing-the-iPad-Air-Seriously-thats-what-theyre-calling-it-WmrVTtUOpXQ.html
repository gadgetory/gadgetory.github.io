to the Apple by for everything good and
bad inside the world of Apple right
after their latest keynote in San
Francisco and there is plenty to talk
about so let's just recap the highlights
and we were pretty much on the money
with what we expected to see but there
were still a few surprises first up OS
10 Mavericks is available as a free
download right now free probably the
best news of the keynote and support
some max as far back as 2007 running
snow leopard or later you really can't
beat free unless it's that taco from the
fair that's still giving you them
indigestion that's too much information
right and all right now I think the big
surprise was the name of the new
fifth-generation iPad at the keynote
Apple's calling it the ipad air I know
it almost sounds like a bad joke but
this thing weighs only one pound packs
an a7 processor improved Wi-Fi shares
design cues from the ipad mini there's
no touch ID and no major revamp to the
camera because people really shouldn't
be taking pictures with their ipads
anyways and don't be this person now the
ipad air goes on sale november the first
starts at 499 for a 16 gig Wi-Fi version
and i'm looking to get one after selling
my third gen ipad new that's now the
ipad old old to jen's later you guys got
to figure that out now look at this
video clip spin two classrooms
boardrooms expeditions even to space and
we can't wait to see where you
take it next
introducing
lighter more powerful ipad air I think
it would have really made more sense to
call it the iPad pencil and I like that
name better now the other no-brainer
that had to happen was the announcement
of the ipad mini with retina display
that also sports an a7 processor
improved Wi-Fi and the same design it
sounds great right but the retina
display mini starts at 399 for a 16 gig
Wi-Fi version and will be available
later in November but what sticks out
like a sore thumb is when you compare
the mini retina to something like the
new Nexus 7 that starts at 229 now Apple
is positioned as a premium product I get
that but they're smoking something with
that pricing and there's a reason
they're losing tablet market share 399
seriously that's a bad apple and the
iPad that has stood the test of time so
far the ipad 2 apples still selling it
for 399 two plus years later no one
should buy this and you're actually
better off getting a refurbished ipad 4
from the apple online store for 379
instead of a new ipad 2 now we also saw
new macs the macbook pro retina line
gets a revamp with new Haswell
processors integrated intel iris
graphics and improved battery life the
13-inch will get 9 hours of battery life
in the 15-inch will get 8 hours but
Apple typically is very modest with
those numbers now they're available now
and the 13-inch starts at 12 99 while
the 15-inch starts at 1999 apple also
showed off the new mac pro with its
beefy next-gen Xeon processors dual GPUs
and more this is a powerhouse supporting
4k video on up to three monitors I know
it's not for everyone but high-end
graphics professionals will be drooling
over this one even if it's at two
thousand nine hundred ninety nine dollar
entry-level price point now software's
also focus at the keynote with new
versions of ilife and I works they'll be
free when you purchase either a new mac
or iOS device the iwork suite gets to
redesign across all apps iCloud
compatibility and gives multiple users
the ability to access and edit document
iphoto and imovie get revamped with new
tools and effects and sharing options
and GarageBand gets what Apple calls its
biggest update ever with up to 32 audio
tracks in real time
aberration and there have been some
updated redesigns for Apple's iOS apps
including podcasts thank you find my
iphone and the itunes trailers app now
you guys there are always highlights of
a keynote from Craig federighi perfect
hair to Eddie Q's dojo master attire and
I'm still not sure who allowed that to
happen but Phil Schiller really won
hands down with this one so if you're a
fan of the Black Knight as I am you can
watch the entire trilogy on one charge
whoa whoa wait wait are they making a
fourth movie in the Batman sirs that I
don't know about he didn't say the black
night did he so if you're a fan of the
Black Knight as I am you can watch the
entire trilogy on one charge yes he did
and why are you clapping for that are
you all dum-dums too if you're a closet
Batman fan you don't have to hide it and
if you called the Black Knight you
really do now that's not even a bad
apple Phil I'm giving you a black apple
and the only black knights I know about
are the one in monty python or Martin
Lawrence and that was not a good movie
so I've heard all right let's get to our
winners of our colored mophie juice pack
cases from last week we asked you what
you would do to win one of these sweet
cases now a lot of you freaks said you
would do things naked or give me
massages but I decided against picking
you so congrats to our Twitter winners
Melvin Shannon senior and sumeet cut car
who wants one because I bit on it our
email winners are maria palermo and
steve from rosemead california who wrote
in with a girl I'm dating also has the
same last name as yours and she's a
die-hard Apple fan and just bought an
iphone 5 recently i think i could
definitely impress her with this case
and hopefully we can go a step further
in our relationship you know what I mean
I don't know what you mean but i hope
this case helps out and i hope she
doesn't watch this show and she better
not be my sister all right congrats
again and we'll be in touch with all of
you that's going to do for this week's
show send me your questions and comments
to the Apple by to cnet com or tweet me
at Bryant on because I love to hear what
you thought about apple's event
thanks so much for watching and we'll
catch you guys next time for another
bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
