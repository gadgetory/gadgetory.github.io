waking up it might need some coffee
no apple's homekit platform has been
lagging behind in the smart home for
some time now
it doesn't have as many product partners
as Amazon's Alexa or Google alphabets
nest and it's not really easy to set up
it doesn't even have its own dedicated
app that was until Apple announced its
latest mobile software and a new beta
app for home kit called home the
official version of iOS 10 and home
won't be available until the fall but we
decided to take a look at the beta to
see what we liked and didn't like here's
what we like it's pretty easy to use but
still customizable quick press an
accessory to turn it on or off or long
press it for more options setting up
scenes is also really simple and
intuitive so with a single command you
can control multiple devices and if you
setup an Apple TV or an iPad as a hub
you have access to some advanced
automation options like geofencing and
triggers but there are some issues too
for one thing it's still really hard to
set up there's no actual infrastructure
built into the app right now at least in
beta form that lets you set up new
devices I would really love to see a
drop-down menu or something simple that
lists specific products so you know how
to pair them it's also a little tricky
in terms of usability as of today
there's no back button on the pages so
you really just have to press somewhere
within the current screen to get back to
the previous page and there's no way to
see all of your devices in one space
that's something that we'd love to see
in the final version it's still in beta
so it's definitely early to make a
judgment on this software we see
potential here so hopefully the final
version of this app will give homekit a
stronger position in the smart home hey
Siri goodnight nighty night
bye your house sleep tight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
