cnet.com and I'm here with the Geneva
sound system excess that excess stands
for extra small this company is a Swiss
company it usually makes actually really
big speakers but this is a small
bluetooth speaker and it looks a lot
like those old school travel alarm
clocks it folds up into its own case and
it's really kind of a nifty design you
can take this with you put it in your
bag it's protected it also has a
built-in FM radio and a telescoping
antenna it's a little weird that it
sticks out the side but it is cool that
it does have an antenna and you can get
better reception with that antenna a
couple of other features there is an
audio input so you can use devices that
don't have a Bluetooth with it that
cable isn't included however like other
portable Bluetooth speakers this one has
a built-in rechargeable battery it is a
lithium-ion rechargeable battery give
you about five hours worth of battery
life that's not great but it's not bad
either and you can always leave the
speaker plugged in as well
one of things it doesn't have is speaker
phone capabilities there's no built-in
mic here like the Jawbone Jambox has
this is slightly bigger than the Jawbone
Jambox it weighs 1.1 pounds but it's
very portable and it does sound better
than the jam box this one has a little
bit more detail too it's a little warmer
sounding and it handles bass better it
also plays very loud for its size take
all that with a grain of salt of course
these smaller speakers don't have a lot
in the way of stereo separation and they
don't sound fantastic but the idea here
is that they do sound big for their size
you can stream audio from your iPad your
iPhone your Android smartphone and it
sounds a lot lot better than those
internal speakers on those devices one
of the small drawbacks worth pointing
out is that it doesn't charge via USB
comes with its own AC adapter be nice if
it had a USB charger so you could carry
only one cable with your cell phone
charger but it does come with that AC
adapter the other bigger downside is its
it is a $250 device this is from a Swiss
company it is a high quality well-made
product but that $250 price will scare
off some people but if you don't mind
paying that much for a cool small
bluetooth speaker of this one is
definitely worth checking out and David
Conroy and that's the Geneva sound
system XS</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
