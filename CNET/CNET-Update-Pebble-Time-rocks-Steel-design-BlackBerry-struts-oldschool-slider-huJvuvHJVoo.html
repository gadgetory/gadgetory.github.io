smartphones beefed up security I'm
Bridget Carey and this is your scene at
update it was only a week ago that
pebble announced the new color screen
SmartWatch called pebble time and it
broke sales records on Kickstarter the
company has pulled in more than 13
million dollars in pre-orders the pebble
just announced there's another model
coming out with a more upscale design
called the pebble time steel everyone
that pre-ordered from the first batch
can put in more money to upgrade to the
steel if they'd rather have the gold
silver or black metal design the steel
costs two hundred and fifty dollars for
those that pre-order and it's going to
go up to three hundred dollars when it
hits stores in July the color screen is
the same as the cheaper pebble time but
the battery life is better it lasts ten
days compared to seven and both will
work with smart straps which are these
interchangeable watch straps with extra
tech built inside like a GPS tracker or
heart rate sensor we'll have to wait and
see what developers will create and with
Mobile World Congress going on now in
Spain companies around the globe have
gathered to showcase new gadgets that
includes blackberry the company has a
new all touchscreen phone called the
blackberry leap it costs two hundred and
eighty dollars but blackberry knows fans
love the keyboard so it's also coming
out with a slider phone yes ladies and
gentlemen is 2015 and we're talking
about a brand new slider phone
blackberry only flashed it on stage as a
tease showing a keyboard that slides out
from under the touchscreen blackberry
fights to hold on to its legacy is the
secure smartphone for corporations but
there's another phone that's after that
designation black phone silent circle
debuted a new version of its security
focused phone the black phone too and
there's also a tablet called the black
phone plus they're loaded with apps for
making encrypted phone calls and
messages but what's unique is the
operating system it's a modified version
of Android that gives users more control
of privacy and permissions and this age
of hacking security is a selling point
take for example new fingerprint
scanning technology from Qualcomm that
uses sound waves to capture a 3d
edge of your fingerprint the high
frequency waves penetrate the inner
layer of skin to capture every Ridge and
poor biometrics are slowly replacing our
passwords fujitsu made a smart phone
that uses infrared lasers and cameras to
scan your iris to unlock the phone but
if you're really concerned about
security and privacy try on these sexy
specs the security firm avg created
privacy glasses that confuse cameras and
facial recognition software it shines
invisible infrared light that distorts
your photo so big brother can't track
you unless they program it to track
someone wearing geeky glasses then
you're out of luck that your tech news
update there's always more at cnet com
from our studios in New York I'm Bridget
