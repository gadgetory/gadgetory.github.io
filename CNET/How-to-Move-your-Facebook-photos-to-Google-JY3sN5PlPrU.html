Picasa or Flickr to store your photos I
bet that most of your pictures are on
Facebook it makes sense since you want
to put photos where your friends can see
them but if you're switching to Google+
or using both networks you should share
your pictures on there too I'm Sharon
Vaknin for cnet.com here to show you how
to move your photos from Facebook to
Google+ basically what we need to do is
download your Facebook album so that you
can easily re-upload them to Google Plus
lots of free online tools let you do
this but I have a couple favorites as
always your best bet is to use
Facebook's built-in data downloader
because it's a guaranteed safe and
proprietary tool the only annoying part
about getting your photos this way is
that it takes a few hours to a day for
Facebook to email you the download link
go to your account settings then hit
download your information once the
download is ready you'll get a zip
folder of your facebook info like
messages and wall posts and all your
photos organized into folders by album
but if you're more of a one at now kind
of person checkout pickins if it's a
free web app that lets you download
albums plus any photos that you've been
tagged in just go to pick and zip com
log in with Facebook head to download
and select download all photos if you
have a ton of pictures this might take a
while I had about 3,500 and it took five
minutes the download will come as a
zipped folder which you should
decompress usually by double clicking it
on a Mac or selecting extract all files
in Windows you'll see in albums folder
with all your albums and a tagged folder
with all the photos you've been tagged
in once you have your Facebook photos on
your computer it's time to head to
Google Plus go to view profile then
photos and upload new photos here you
can create one album at a time you can't
upload all your album folders at once
click select photos from computer find
an album you want to upload select the
photos in that folder and hit open once
the photos are uploaded give the album a
name and hit create album here
you can add a comment about the album
which will show up in your stream and
decide which circles you want to share
it with if you want it to be private
just enter your own name or email
address share it and the album will show
up in the streams of the people you
shared it with and in the Photos tab on
your profile you can always change the
album privacy options by going to photos
then view all your albums
click the album you want to edit and
change the visible to option and here's
an extra tip unlike Facebook Google+ has
a built-in photo editor click on a photo
and select actions you can rotate the
photo or click Edit photo for coloring
effects like cross processing or
black-and-white in this view you can
also tag people in your photos by
selecting add tag and entering the
person's name or email address if
they're not on Google+ yet so go ahead
and move your photo memories to Google+
especially if you think you'll be
spending more time there than Facebook
and feel free to leave behind any
baggage you're ready to retire for more

Vaknin and I'll see you on the interwebs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
