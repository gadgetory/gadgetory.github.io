notifications from a soap bubble you can
step into a booth and find out the
weather somewhere else in the world and
astronauts are getting hollow lens
before even we get them so good for them
jerks it's tmrw daily
greetings citizen to the citizens and
what's wrong with me greetings citizens
of the internet welcome to tomorrow
daily I'm Ashley sceva this is kellen
onymous you're watching this peak talk
show in the known universe except for
grammar because obviously I can't speak
they didn't say it was the best grammar
show in the universe that's very true I
do not make I will never claim that Dad
ain't no truth at all none so anyway
without without that stupid intro here
are your headlines alright so hollow
lens isn't accessible to anyone really
yet no except for astronauts because
NASA is working with Microsoft to create
a like an app and experience for
astronauts now this is to help them kind
of work out some problems if there's
problems up in this space station okay
so they'll be able to assist them both
of them wearing hollow lenses this is
called sidekick and it's going to
provide virtual aid to astronauts
working off of Earth know what you're
going to be watching right now is them
testing out this hollow lens in a
weightless environment this is the wait
list wonder c9 jet we're testing out the
equipment to see if it works on this
wait list in this weightless place with
no idea exactly what they're looking at
they look like maniac what are they
looking at but you know they've again
they said it's it's to help them you
know it's an alien fighting simulation
program which you can play on the ground
they're just playing halo anyway so this
is actually going up very very soon in a
June twenty-eighth spacex is going to
take it as part of a resupply up to the
two up to the space station now their
goal is to reduce crew training
requirements oh boy and increase the
efficiency at which astronauts can work
in space so you can go up there and and
maybe if you don't have all the
experience you they'll help you out so
there's two modes is so this is all we
know as far as how it works and what's
going on inside the headset for the
astronauts two modes remote experiment
mode which is a skype so they can share
the experience they can see what the
astronauts are seeing and be able to
help them out that way and there's also
procedure mode which we've seen the kind
of a look at inside of the demo the
first hollow lens demo
in which what they're looking at it
projects like a visual so that if the
astronauts looking at like a piece of
the ship it'll point an arrow to the
ship and like highlight it and show them
how to unscrew us up like that so it's
basically holding their hand for these
astronauts who should probably learn how
to do it but you've got a lot more
people on ground ok but i'm not i'm not
saying astronauts aren't qualified it's
it's a good safety precaution if we've
if you think about if apollo 13 had that
you know maybe there might have been
something worked out resolutions but ya
allah many more minds on the ground
helping the few people that get sent up
to space is is really good now there's
tons more planned with this hollow lens
nasa sidekick sort of thing they plan on
sending it on other missions you can
check out their post about it there's a
tweet about it but spacex is involved so
that's pretty neat hololens microsoft
roslyn spacex I'm yeah I have I have to
say like in the last month hololens has
partnered up with some very unsuspecting
companies like I did not expect them to
partner with oculus that was like a big
thing I think that we were all kind of
surprised about and then now it's like
oh hey I'm by the way we're sending them
up to the astronauts of the space
station no big deal whatever like
insanity I love it but it's crazy yeah
it's gonna be interesting to see the
practicality because Logan and I tried
it on and we weren't blown away but
maybe you know there's just enough there
to like get the job done for the
astronauts uh it's crazy also they were
using wireless headsets too so that's
that's also good but tethered yeah it's
very good um well you mentioned like the
field of view being really small what's
that small oh wow that is very doesn't
look we're done that great yeah it's
otay it up Logan's k let's get up kales
camera Logan it's about that small
that's very small to kind of like look
through it but yeah so there you go
hopefully that'll work yeah awesome yeah
they're gonna send they're gonna send to
up very soon on jun 28th and SpaceX this
weekend a couple more sweet yeah so they
go I'm gonna snow away when I go up to
space just for all of them listen take
it how if I had hollow lens on they
could help me be an astronaut right away
that'll be great ok I want to tell you
about this climate booth this is really
weird but also one of those things that
I would imagine in like the Jetsons like
a thing that you would see in the
Jetsons so
uh if you've ever been we're from
Southern California and there were times
where I'm going somewhere and people go
it's really cold and you're like oh it's
really cold okay it must be like 60
degrees because that's really cold in
Southern California and then it's like
freezing and you don't really have an
idea of what that feels like until
you're in it and then you're like oh boy
I packed really wrong or I did not wear
the right jacket off the plane this is
called climate portal this is awesome
it's at the Arlanda Airport in Stockholm
Sweden they have installed these weather
pods for people to step into and they
can feel the actual climate of the place
they're about to go to so they'll know
exactly what it feels like when they
walk outside I'm gonna get off the plane
at their destination so it's not a
little late well it it works in this way
which is if you're not sure if maybe you
should have a jacket or maybe if you
need sunglasses or ever like for when
you get off the plane like you can take
all that out and just do that and you
won't have to worry about you know
figuring it all out once gets the
airport um they don't just heat up and
cool down there like here's the
interesting thing they actually use heat
AC missed fans and audio-visual
installations inside to like really give
you a sense of what the weather is like
so I would imagine that it would be kind
of not an intense experience but I mean
if it's like raining or to feel a little
mist like so you'll know like oh it's
gonna be a little bit damp like I mean
it's cold oh no this is like really cold
in here I'm going to need I gonna need a
bigger jacket or whatever I just think
this is awesome like I think it would
what a weird cool little bit of
technology that's sort of not doing
anything to change the world but it
certainly is like changing the way that
we travel like it's that's a thing that
like I think everybody would want to try
if it was at their local airport they'd
be like oh I just want to go in there
just see even if you're just going on
like San Francisco your psyche loads I
just seems like music walk in there I
really like the technology I still think
it's too late but you're already at
their port you've already packed and you
already have your jacket they do however
have like places you can test out your
jacket at like sports stores so you like
you're like god is this gonna be is this
gonna keep you warm enough to go into
this little basically refrigerator and
try on your jacket you're like yeah I
feel warm I'll take one jacket please
sir and then you leave that's pretty
cool but yeah I'm this is
it's maybe yeah just sponsored by
somebody or is it just the airport think
so it'll be up until like the end of
august i think they were saying they
were just doing it for like for now but
I have a feeling like maybe if a lot of
people people respond to it and people
really like it they'll probably keep it
I would I totally see somebody dying in
there how would me somebody yeah
somebody's gonna somebody's gonna be
like Oh Sarah Bing Bing Bing Bing Bing
make an R goes in there it doesn't
realize is it bad or he has died from
heatstroke he's trying to find some more
movie waiting to happen it really is
yeah so they'll be available to the end
of august but you have to put a
sweetener dried out RTD it is that's our
hashtag the day it is TD climate it is
what will feature would you add to the
booth to make it more interactive like
what's the thing that this booth is
missing you're watching tomorrow daily
so my answer would be it would change it
to different planets so the atmosphere
on different planets unfortunately you
die if you tried it once was I decision
out of there I'd be like Mars but that
would be mine so don't try that out okay
what's yours I would say I like I would
add a man in reality glasses this I
would drop in a hollow lens and then
that way you can sort of see what's
going what what its gonna look like and
you can feel what's the only thing the
same time can really immerse yourself
that's just out of hololens just at
hollow lens that's a trademark just that
hollow looking better just at home when
super disappointed the bird is a point
um okay and then lastly I just said this
is really fun and it's super dumb but I
but it brought me joy and that's
actually the point of it to bring joy uh
this is called know to fly and it they
don't have like a full video because
it's pretty simple it's pretty simple
idea regular notifications so 2014 so
there's this calendar app called pop up
and it syncs with this thing called no
to fly pop ups the point of this app
this scheduling app is to give you
opportunities to appreciate the joy in
your schedule so for example if you're
like seeing an old friend or if you're
sick you're saying goodbye then wherever
oh you're gonna see this person like wow
joyful detour like your dinner is you
know here's your friends you can go in
just a few footsteps you're going to
dinner at this place there's this other
place this great view
whatever so that's what it gives you
ideas like things to do like within your
schedule then the constraints to bring
joy into your life so uh kind of awesome
but no to fly pairs with this and look
and we have that gift it's an animated
gif they put it up on their site yeah
here it is so when you get a
notification for your calendar if like a
meeting or whatever it blows a soap
bubble on your you put it on your desk
and then you just like pop it and then
you go to your meeting when you have a
meeting at buzz bubble yeah when you get
a little notification like those little
bubbles here it's like it's like a
pleasant notification like I know that
sometimes I get really stressed out when
I have notification on my phone or my
iPad and I'm just like Oh what now we're
in a great text I fit well then you'd
want to shut that off that maybe you
shut that feature off otherwise your
whole room will be filled this is really
awesome it's so cool like there's an
edible bubbles by the way so they should
totally make it the edible bubbles
really little bubblegum flavored bubbles
and they just pop up my using hacks are
you that's really cool how much is it uh
okay so they're not selling them yet but
this is part of a project called
redesigns and this project this series
has a goal of turning this isn't these
are not my words Monday's into Monday's
they're trying to like revolutionize
kind of if you're out your daily office
experience I know you just got really
mad but they're trying to make people's
days a little more joyful and that was
one of the things they came up changing
the word to meunier does it make monday
any more fun no but that mean that's
just the concept of sad they're not
changing the word but they're like
that's the serve the idea behind it
anyway no to fly I thought really cool
and I kind of want one from being honest
I got a long one but on that note we're
going to take a quick break before we go
though we have to show you this video of
all the fancy Cena and games by editors
telling you what they're playing right
now I'm sure a lot of them are playing
batman arkham knight no they're not if
they have a pc yeah that that might be
true so so check out play this and we'll
be right back
I have been playing a life is strange i
just finished the third episode and it
is well worth the play because it's got
an epic narrative that is just getting
more complicated and exciting i've been
playing a crapload of split spoon and
splatoon is one of the greatest games
i've ever played it what's up i'm
playing project cars on the pc on this
sweet thrustmaster steering wheel but
what I'm really playing at home is a
Tokyo jungle on the PlayStation 4 via
PlayStation now they're weird
playstation 3 streaming service which
costs 1999 a month I'm playing a game
called I am bread and it's actually a
pretty amazing game it's a lot of fun
it's the most fun I've ever had playing
a bread video game it's based off the
butterfly effect principle where the
littlest actions can change a huge
number of things and it's got
fascinating game mechanics and it is a
really cool play so it's a shooter
except everything's colorful and tilly
uplifting to play and the best thing
about it like magically last three
minutes so it's got that Morris factor
so yes squids and kids there's quite a
lot of money to basically be a
Pomeranian in Tokyo but personally I
think it's worth it i'm reading it out
the question that all of us have to
answer for ourselves in the object is
you have to move this slice of bread
through a level and get it to the
toaster so the bread become toast that
sounds crazy when I say it out loud but
it's actually a lot of fun go check it
out
welcome back welcome back to the show I
mean you're playing batman arkham knight
right now I'm playing splatoon as well
so that's that's we're playing um you
know it's Thursday which means we have
to talk about what we like stuff we like
which means it's time for into it
alright so i'll let you please you go
first i was like hearing what you what
you're into because we have such
different lives i'm in gold mining this
week and there's gold inhales I've been
out panting forgot no I'm into batman
arkham knight well i guess it should be
over it cuz i just finished it oh you
finished it i finished it before i came
in while I finish out like an hour or so
before he came in except for it I
haven't done there's like a like it like
a second ending and I haven't done that
which which I'm gonna do it's it's
called like oh we have to initiate
projects something okay I got a hundred
percent ending is that it no no no it's
not even that it's just like a second
ending it's like once you beat the
mission they're still kind of like a
like finish everything off type thing
without being a hundred percent but ya
know by the way if you can't play it on
PC just wait cuz it is worth the wait
it's really it's one of the best games
the years solid storytelling again fun
gameplay from beginning to end the tank
battles suck stop that I wish they'd
stop shoving the Batmobile down your
throat there's a it's like really fun to
drive but they make you fight these
tanks are showing it right now too many
times the voice acting is great the
characters are fun again it's it's a new
and old story from Batman like they put
them through the ringer it's fantastic i
love it it's definitely worth all the
praise that's been getting online aside
from the pc complaints i was able to go
in and mod something so i got 60 frames
per second so it's allz good there but
it's great I know that I know that
anybody that's on the fence
whether or not to get it just get it
it's it's just a fun just as fun if not
more fun than the previous Batman
iteration all know I fly like that I
love that it's so good I'm gonna go I'm
not going two hundred percent it because
I'm not that guy and I could collect all
the Riddler trophies screw that how can
I have too many things to do but I am
gonna get to the whatever the second
part is the second the second ending man
it was so good I'm so good I'm excited
because I'm gonna pick it up at some
point in the next like couple weeks and
I'm like I'm now after hearing you like
your this ridiculous enthusiasm for it
I'm like really excited I couldn't
figure out when do I wanted to stop
playing it was always like oh there's
always something left to dukale I'm like
yeah okay Batman's wit okay back alright
so that's what I'm into / / i'll
probably finish it tonight okay so there
you go I like it um so I'm into a show
that is not for children I'm in a veep I
got I got really into veep Oh last week
okay so I have to explain because i love
good comedy like I love good comedy and
I i had heard really good things about
this show and finally a friend of mine
like pushed me over the edge it was like
literally put this at the top of your
cue do not wait like watch beep and I
was like okay they say just watch like
two episodes and sure enough I watched
the first two episodes and I just hooked
there is never an episode in which I
have not laughed out loud at at least
one of the jokes like there I think I
read something somewhere where it was uh
it's either thee like the top number one
series with the most jokes per minute
something like that like what the
writing is insanely good and there are
so many like just asides and it's so
fast and funny and like it's just
hilarious and the guy oh god Tony Hale
who plays her servant Gary uh her like
bagman Gary he played Buster Bluth
interested development and he is just as
funny if not way funnier as this
character than he was as Buster Bluth
like it is so so funny the guy who plays
Jonah's great this is sue her
receptionist it is a hilarious show I
highly recommend it if you are an adult
because it is an adult series with adult
jokes but it's a it's fantastic I
absolutely love it it's so so funny
so so petty like all the small like it's
they make kind of like this really big
government job seem like they're it's
full of all these little weird petty
like arguments and stuff between people
and I'm sure a lot of it is like that
but it's really entertaining so so funny
and Julia Louie Dreyfus is just she's
brilliant she's absolutely brilliant
love her and Seinfeld love her and
everything she does and she just
continues that streak here she's
fantastic that's on HBO right yeah
that's on HBO and so now she told you
get HBO now for 15 bucks a month if you
don't have cable you can just get it and
stream it but it's so it's so so so
funny um we're in the middle of season
two and Gary coals in it now and like he
is intense and hilarious time like the
story lines are insane and they're so
great it's really good anyway I very
similar enthusiasm for veep um except we
don't get to punch super villains in the
face that is true and that's why I'll be
buying Batman um because i would like to
also punch super villains in the face
okay guys we got to talk about you it's
time for user feedback okay ask you guys
use the hashtag TD hover tell us what
alternate modes of futuristic
transportation you'd prefer over you
know everything that we talked about
yesterday so land slug wrote in and said
I'm too old for a hoverboard anyway
hover Segway would be nice though Oh
hover say wait over segue for paul blart
mall cop 3 in space on the moon whoa no
no no we gotta just go for it just a
Radisson he's Radisson and just act like
just pretend like there's nothing
special about it innovation required
wrote in and said jet packs for small
distance and wormholes for long distance
because no killing and rebuilding were
involved it's a good workaround mart man
yeah that's it that's a hack I think
that's it as a wormhole hat wormhole
scare me about I would be so scared
Thiago wrote and said hyperspace
transportation of course i know i don't
disagree with that I'm gonna be honest
Lewis wrote in and said time travel for
definite dude where's my TARDIS I like
that time travel yeah travel time travel
and then James wrote an email and said
how about a personal hover system using
four bands to orient the field one on
each wrist and each ankle using the
energy produced by your body to power
the four bands would hyperx
seller ate the air molecules around you
thus lifting you off the ground using
various sensors such as gyroscopes and
accelerometers you'd be able to navigate
your direction or travel it would only
have to elevate your body a few inches
off the ground depending on the terrain
for paved or relatively smooth surfaces
one to two inches for more uneven
surfaces dirt gravel or fairly rocky 326
using nanotechnology these bands be
relatively small they would fit
comfortably under your clothes being no
larger than most wearable tech news
today that was a lot of thought and I
have to say like I'm impressed because I
would love a system like that if I could
just like boot up some wristbands and
ankle bands and like just float around
that would be awesome are you ready for
this kind of system that's what I needed
I want to be destroyed every single time
I want to go someplace I got a Chipotle
dezod kilt dissolves and then gets built
leg up into polio like wha barbacoa
please and back at home oh sweet Oh
amazing um but yeah so that's what you
guys wrote in 14 e hover um and now it
is time for a very last piece of user
feedback which is always our phone tog
refer the day
our photographer the day today is Mike
simple sense i hate TD not part of your
typical demographic but i love you guys
in your show watch it daily this is from
on my way home from downtown DC caught
this image just for kick-ass storm hit
the area i thought it was amazing
considering i took this with an iphone
5s hope you like it as much as my
facebook friends keep up the great work
Mike PS I'm 56 geekdom knows no age is
that why he said not part of our normal
Democrat yeah cuz I would imagine most
people most adults would guess that are
at 66 year old children it's usually in
the 60s yeah on the 60s are the only
people to watch this show that's because
they can't get away from their screens
fast enough my grandma's like in her 70s
so she can't watch this show no it's
much too it's too young we have a very
narrow demographic 60 to 69 years old
that's I'm not even old enough to watch
this show me neither that I like that it
looks kind of like dystopia it's like
all that height like super hyper color
but also like the yellows are kind of
sickly so it looks like they it was
trying to be like a futuristic thing but
mad max L train and then in the back
like the sky is all red so it looks like
it's been soiled like the planets been
soiled it's cool I like it no I dig it
so nice nice work Mike um if you guys
want to send in your phone tog raphy you
can email us tomorrow cnet com and you
can find us on social media tomorrow
daily I just wanted to let that hang or
you can follow us on our personal
Twitter accounts at kill anonymous and
ashley's together yes and that's it for
the show today we'll be back on Monday
with our 200th episode but until then
big of humans will see you guys next
