network of computers that police's
itself so people or businesses can
cooperate without fear that somebody is
tampering with the data today most data
is sealed up at a central organization
like a bank or the Department of Motor
Vehicles blockchain moves that
information to a decentralized shared
network of computers maybe even
thousands of them to create an open
transparent and mutable database that
data could include everything from sales
transactions to medical records it's
called a blockchain because computers
periodically collect transactions into
groups called blocks each block gets a
digital fingerprint called a hash and
each new blocks hash is
cryptographically linked to the previous
blocks hash basically forming an
unbreakable chain any tampering with the
transaction is easily detected and
rejected because it messes up the hash
not only of the block that's in but also
every other block added afterward if a
tampered block is on your computer the
rest of the blockchain network just
ignores it in the future for instance
there may be a blockchain network for
concert ticket sales you want to buy a
ticket from a stranger somebody you
might not trust in the real world the
blockchain takes care of confirming that
the original owner is legitimate hasn't
sold the ticket already and that you're
the new owner then the network locks the
data many companies are investing in
blockchain and many more are
investigating it
Walmart is testing blockchain so it can
quickly pull contaminated food from
store shelves in De Beers is tracking
diamonds so you can be sure those
anniversary earrings didn't fund
somebody's war you might not notice
blockchain as it makes businesses run
more smoothly but more directly it
should bring you peace of mind</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
