with its bright color choices hi I'm
Sarah mitrik with CNET taking a first
look at the Nokia Asha 501 let's get one
thing straight this is a budget phone
for emerging markets like Latin America
and India the phone is only $99 so you
shouldn't expect it to have any high-end
specs the first thing you notice about
the ash of 501 is its bright color the
phone comes in six colors this neon red
orange you see here or yellow green blue
black and white as you can see the 501
is tiny it's small enough to rest even
in my petite hands and it's easy to grip
the polycarbonate back cover is soft to
the touch and wraps around the edges of
the phone giving it a sturdy feel one of
my biggest gripes about the Ashi of 501
is that the back cover is a hassle to
remove you have to push down on the
small cutout and gently pry the cover
away from the rest of the phone not an
easy feat for anyone with large hands
behind that cover you'll find a micro SD
card slot removable battery and SIM card
slot along the right side of the phone
there's a slim volume rocker and power
slash lock button at the top there's a
headphone jack micro USB port and
proprietary charging port on the front
of the Asha 501 there is only one button
if you press it once it goes back one
step in an app or website if you hold it
down it takes you back to the phone's
home screen the Nokia Asha 501s 4 it's a
3 inch 320 by 240 resolution touchscreen
display which looks dated even compared
to today's low-end smartphones colors
look muted and the screen looks dim even
at full brightness moving around the
phone is easy but some touch controls
like swiping to unlock the phone aren't
as responsive the Asha 501 is running
Nokia's Asha operating system it comes
pre-loaded with Facebook and Twitter
plus a custom Nokia browser and several
games there's also an app store with
other well-known titles including
LinkedIn and Foursquare but it's not as
robust to Google Play or the Apple App
Store there are two home screens on the
Asch of 501 one with the list of every
app on the phone and one called Fastlane
Vaseline shows reminders notifications
plus a list of recently opened apps if
you swipe down from the top of the
screen a notification bar appears with
controls to toggle Wi-Fi data sound and
Bluetooth the Asch of 501 has an
unimpressive three megapixel camera on
the back photos and video come out
looking grainy and overexposed
performance wise the ash of 501 is
actually faster than I thought it would
be even with only 64 megabytes of RAM
the phone can only handle 2g data
connections but in our test that loaded
mobile optimized webpages quickly you
can read my full review of the phone on
cnn.com
I'm Sarah Mishra and this has been a
first take of the Nokia Asha
