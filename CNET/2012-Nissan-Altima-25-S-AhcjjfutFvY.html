in the car business and with the sonata
now getting a lot of headlines alongside
them
Nissan must be more than a little
twisted but their Altima gets quite a
bit less luck
well let's visit the last year of the
current Altima and check the tech this
2012 Altima is the last of the fourth
generation cars due for a heavy redesign
in early 2012 the coupe has always had
the far better lines but sedans are what
sell in this sector tech is also
something which sells but apparently the
Ultimate Team didn't get that memo as
Altimas with the S trim level like this
one have almost none now inside the
ultimate is nothing special and looking
awful but nothing special I'm not real
big a lot of the plastic they use it
seems to be kind of a hard plastic
throwback from like 10-15 years ago but
the rest of its ok it's all standard
Nissan switchgear here's the basic head
unit am/fm a single optical slot and an
aux jack that's it there's no USB no
other iPod connector no bluetooth
streaming even bluetooth is not standard
on a 2.5 s you have to option that in a
la carte or as part of a convenience
package now there is a tech package that
will give you a full screen LCD
navigation system hard drive based by
the way and that also will include a DVD
playback I believe and audio/video input
Jack's replacing this audio only or in
between this and the full nav is a
smaller 4-inch screen
premium audio package that's going to
get you ipod connectivity XM satellite
radio bose digital audio and for some
reason that's how you get into a
rear-view camera in this guy as well if
you like push-button start you're going
to love this car it's got it in there
even if this kind of lowly price level
if you like continuously variable
transmissions you're going to love this
car because all the four-cylinder
Altimas like this one have a CVT which
doesn't have actual gears but variable
pulleys with a big steel belt normally
that's in low power cars with very small
engines for the most part but this car
has got a pretty good size for and the
CVT
does work rather well you've got a gate
over here to influence its synthetic
shift points as well
now the motor in front of that CVT is
this guy in these 2.5 cars - two and a
half litre inline-four kind of big for a
four which you normally associate with
you know smaller engines as you can see
it's front-wheel drive only transversely
mounted pretty garden-variety stuff no
direct injection or other tricks like
turbos or such delivers a standard 175
horsepower 170 foot-pounds of torque
gets this 3,200 pound car to 60 in about
eight and a half seconds while
delivering 23 in the city and 32 on the
highway according to the EPA thing about
the ultimate is well it doesn't stand
out on paper it's a very pleasant car on
the road nothing about it is exciting
but it's definitely one of those cars
it's satisfying to drive the power comes
on nicely without a lot of that sort of
hemming and hawing that a lot of CV T's
do that lubricated with Crisco slippery
crap a lot of them go through this one
doesn't it bites right in and takes on a
gear it's quiet it's buttoned down it's
what you want for this kind of vehicle
if you buy an inline four in a car of
the camry accord class you're not
looking for something that stands out as
much as really good reliable vanilla but
one thing to look for is a complete redo
in early 2012 as a 2013 Altima so buying
one of these now is a little dicey i
think they're going to take it
significantly upscale and borrow from
maxima and really get this car to have
more of a distinctive flavor that might
be worth waiting for
okay pricing our 2012 Altima 2.5 s that
is one trim level from the bottom of
their range gets you in at 23 3 as you
saw inside not a lot of tech niceties
but what i'm not going to do is add the
tech package because i'm not that
impressed by their hard drive navigation
system instead i'll go for the less
expensive premium audio package that'll
take that eighteen hundred dollar tech
package off the plate premium audio gets
you all the inputs you want the USB in
the iPod and things like that and Bose
audio system plus the rear view camera
that's a good package and then I will
all a cart the Bluetooth hands-free for
325 and in terms of navigation I'll just
roll my own with a phone or a pnd
