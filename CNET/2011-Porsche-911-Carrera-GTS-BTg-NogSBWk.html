this car would probably get your
attention it's the most competent
Porsche 911 that doesn't scream look at
me well except for that color let's
drive the 2011 Porsche 911 Carrera GTS
and check the tech 911s occupy a special
place but depending on how you come to
them that place is either the ultimate
drivers tool or the ultimate tool for
tools but the GTS places you in the
former category pretty squarely because
it means you are savvy enough to pick it
out from a litter of almost two dozen
siblings that includes calves Targa's
asses fours turbos special GTS and the
speedster
classic lines inside a GTS this is
Porsche stuff from both the past with
the five circles of gauges and the
current which is this new centre stack
you'll get this seven-inch I think it is
LCD on all GTS Carreras but you won't
have navigation unless you add that
Alucard sources are fairly
straightforward this car is not
cutting-edge in that way you've got AM
and FM but you don't have HD radio on
this car base is going to be a single
slot for CD and DVD but there is a six
disc that's optional you see in here in
the console I've got my hookup for when
we got aux USB and a special connector
that gives you iPod and another USB
pigtail I believe that's optional though
don't get too excited about that SIM
card slot that's not for internet access
for about Google services or anything
that's just at ease in the European
market I believe that powers built-in
telephony in the US market it just says
screw you oh I see you're looking at
this aren't you this is kind of cool
little tiltable
vintage chronograph that's part of the
Sport Chrono Package now you can use
that to time your runs but it's also
part of a package that can hot up the
drivetrain and make this car even faster
than it is in the straight condition now
because our car has a nav I can show you
what the map quality looks like it's
gotten better this one's got a good
angle of view it's still lower than a
lot of car systems but that's just how a
911 cabin is laid out notice it is a
touchscreen system it reacts pretty
quickly I seem to recall these were
pretty pokey a generation or two ago and
you could also use this knob right here
to turn and click to select these seats
make me nervous now a GTS comes standard
with this mix of leather on the bolsters
and Alcantara Mouse fur down the middle
these always bother me every time I get
in I feel like I'm making it another
step toward being bald on the corners or
the edges you know and this drives me
nuts it's also a standard GTS thing they
paint this center console body color it
just feels cheap or like some kind of a
dune buggy to me
you can option that into leather carbon
metallized finish but you know what that
means
now's a good time to change gears and
make a run to rob king's escargot racing
in San Rafael California where Pat
Sexton can put the GTS in perspective
he's a Porsche certified master mechanic
but more importantly he's been tuning
Porsches since he was 17 and at the shop
fast rare and racing Porsches pretty
much litter the ground just the kind of
jaundiced eye I want to look over the
GTS I patent I'm a little bewildered I
was looking at the Porsche sight when we
came over to visit you guys and I count
23 911s in the stable these days you got
to help me figure out where this one
fits in the lineup this would come in
just above the 911s but below the gt3
it's more of a street car in my opinion
whereas the gt3 is going to be more
useful on a track a lot of folks want to
know how do I spot one 911 from another
the 911s body the wheels with the center
locks
those are real center locks right
correct that's a little fake cap no no
no little features like the blacked-out
bottom lip area whole bottom edge yeah
now in the rear as with every 911 we
have now one of the most covered up
engines yeah there's two see stuff in
here yeah it's kind of hard to
distinguish what we're looking at here
is bull to me yeah there's not much
ruined there's not much room to do
anything I don't envy your job I mean
yeah it's it's not easy that all those
knuckles looking they're not bad this is
a 3.8 liter 408 horsepower yeah and
they're all 3.8 liter for the most part
of this book yeah but they gave this one
23 more horsepower to give it a little
bit more oomph over at s over an S and
an S has significant over a standard
correct 911 so you've got a couple bumps
built in here yes and that's why I'd put
it up right right below the gt3 this car
has got a button for has the exhaust
logo on it the sport exhaust what is
that doing its bypassing part of the
system to make it more notable
that it's Laur just no it's just no good
oh yes that's what it's all about is
that
know that engine sound that makes it
distinguished from any other
escaping hell you can you can always
tell when a 911s driving by it does take
some time to get used to a 911 because
all the weights in the back you've got
the engine and transmission in front of
it all located in the back of the
vehicle so that's the old knock on these
cars is there not a car for the amateur
who is full of themself you can get in
trouble on it is that still the case
with all the stability controls and
stuff you find them tricky to drive now
no not at all this car will make anybody
a fast driver but you can still get
yourself in trouble
well enough talking about it lets go for
a ride okay sounds good this is where I
normally take you for a drive but Pat
hammers Porsches every day to make sure
his handiwork isn't going to come
unscrewed make all that him
it's a car that can really be made to
when you know what you're doing it's
just so
yeah I'd like I said it'll make a good
driver out of anybody
but what it does and how
good way to get to 100
now we didn't do that
this car wasn't now let me in theory
anyway yeah oh yeah exactly this car
didn't really break a sweat
Oh around at all not at all that was I
stretched its legs a little bit than
that not quite as much as it can go it's
a phenomenal car okay pricing any 911 in
less than an hour is futile
no company offers more options and
bespoke touches all of them expensive a
GTS bases at a hundred and four grand
deliver almost everything tech is all a
cart but this is one of those few cars
that really wants to be ordered without
any of it or that yellow pay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
