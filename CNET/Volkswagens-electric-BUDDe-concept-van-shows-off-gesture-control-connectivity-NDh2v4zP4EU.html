and check it out I'm with the Volkswagen
buddy that's right don't you just want
to give it a hug it's just so cute now
Volkswagen wanted to kind of bring back
the nostalgia of the old microbuses at
the time of course we can't have a flat
front nose because you know there's
something called crash standards these
days so we do have a little bit of a a
protrusion here in the nose area gives
it a little bit more of a Scion xB look
than it does a microbus but still it's
always great to see Volkswagen kind of
harkening back to his heritage now one
of the great things about this car is
that it is all-wheel drive that's right
there's two electric motors that are
power in both the front and the rear
axles it's gonna get 233 miles on a
single charge and it has a top speed of
up to 93 miles an hour all wheel drive
93 miles an hour
sign me up all right now there's a lot
of really cool gesture controls here so
let me see if I can open up this side
door so I'm just gonna put my hand right
here and then oh my god look at it open
them that's so cool you can even open up
this door oh come on so in front of me
I've got three it screens alright I've
got a screen over here that's telling me
everything like the status of my car so
I know I've got these doors are open
apparently I've gone point four miles
and I'm traveling at 30 miles an hour
but check out this really cool
three-dimensional navigation here I've
also got all of my climate controls here
and you can see I didn't even touch it
and things are coming up things are
posting up so let's see here
no battery charge of three charging
devices
hmm let's see let's see and you and I've
got all of my all of my audio all of my
cool things here now if you take a look
at this steering wheel what's great
about it is that it is a multifunctional
steering wheel but it's kind of like
multifunctional 3.0 because there's no
actual buttons everything here is done
with haptic feedback so I can just slide
my finger over the button and I get a
little buzz to let me know that I'm in
the right spot so that of course is
pretty cool okay let's go around the
back come on guys I do like that we've
got these taillights here that integrate
right up into the D pillar that's a
really nice look and one of the other
things that they've got that's in it
that kind of helps bring back the
microbus is that we've got really short
front and rear overhangs so again we
can't make it look exactly like my
beloved air-cooled bus but it's still
looking pretty good now there's a lot of
great gesture controls in this and one
of them is I can open up this back with
my with my foot so let me see I get the
little just the little spotlight there
put my foot on it bring it back so cool
so I've got plenty of room for all of my
friends in here I've got a nice easy
step up and then one of the things
that's really great is if I'm gonna be
on a road trip with my friends we've all
got our own separate like points of
interest music things like that that we
all want on our phones we can all come
in here and the buddy recognizes those
things and displays them up here on this
large screen in the backseat so that is
going to help everyone have their own
great personal roadtrip I'm pretty
excited about the concept here I mean
it's been teased for a really long time
I know there's a lot more to learn about
it so we really hope you guys have
enjoyed this quick look at the
Volkswagen but here at CES in 2016 stay
tuned because we've got a lot more great
coverage coming up right here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
