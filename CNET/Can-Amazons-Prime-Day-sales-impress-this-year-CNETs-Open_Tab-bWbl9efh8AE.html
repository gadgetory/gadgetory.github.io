one day of the year that amazon sort of
came up with a self-declared holiday you
will offering thousands and thousands of
sales on their site exclusive to Prime
members prime day take two is happening
July twelfth we know a little bit about
it we know that they are focusing on TVs
and toys toys is super vague I don't
know what the hell that means some deals
are rolling out ahead of the sale itself
they're calling them like countdown
prime deals what do you guys think about
prime day are you psyched are you
tempted what's the deal hacia was kind
of disappointed it was really bad they
had this big build-up it's gonna be
bigger than Black Friday yeah and it
kind of fell over in a heat no that was
I don't know I didn't take advantage of
any of the sale I cannot define bottom i
bought a dust buster and then i found
out i saved like 78 cents right and i
was like what the hell i didn't really
need to do that i guess because with
black friday you have people like us who
can count down the deals and the clay
ting at all sure and all the news
outlets are primed a is kind of its own
thing and it's harder to catalog and
point to where good stuff is yeah it's
it's uh for me it's just like I get it I
know y prime day exists and like you
know for what it's worth it did real
well last year they amazon killed it I'm
prime day even though there was like
this inexplicable sort of understanding
of what was on sale and what was it
right um it makes sense that they would
do this again I don't know did you buy
anything less your job either yeah if I
don't I know it has to be really good to
force we deferred to something like when
I'm not planning on purchasing it right
but I'm I didn't see anything there was
nothing that really impressed me I mean
the last thing I think I bought like
pre-ordered was the echo okay so what do
you think about like on fire TV stick
when I was 21 for time you can imagine
like all their first party stuff is
going to be on sale I wouldn't like in
those go on sale everything goes on sale
for me it's just like the navigation was
kind of twisted up I felt like I had a
really
tough time understanding what was the
what was the deal they were having these
flash sales I'm just like this I need to
like research I have to like draw the
right I don't want you to do yeah
because they got the monopoly on dead or
inside so they can control what is you
know highlighted for sure it seems a
little counterintuitive but hey I'm
obviously going to Amazon would you like
to all right to check that but there are
gonna be good you know hopefully I mean
all right the nice thing for like people
now is that they have to pay for the
full year they can do the monthly
subscription if they kind of want to
slip in and just check out the sale and
be out you're not you're not committed
for you really so yeah I mean well
that's that's cool because if you come
in on in that month of disappointing in
that stuck paying that all hungry for
the whole year don't forget it's only
good for Prime members ah that's July
twelfth and well I guess we'll have like
other prime members is the monthly in
the annual yeah we'll have a post-mortem
on prime day next week okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
