cnet.com today we're gonna take a look
at the HP Pavilion Elite Phoenix h9z
this is HP's brand new mainstream gaming
PC it comes in AMD and Intel based
configurations the h9z model though is
the AMD based one so this system has an
AMD FX 1800 chip in it that's a native 8
core cpu comes in at 2.8 gigahertz it
also has an nvidia geforce GT 550
graphics card it's sort of a mid-range
card you can also see from the design in
the system that HP is trying to
communicate that this is in fact a
gaming PC it's not really that
innovative but it's not terrible either
the problem though is that for 1049 this
system is not as fast as other pcs we've
seen for $9.99 and if you spend a couple
hundred bucks more you can get
significantly better performance even
among other HP desktops the system is
not as fast really making it kind of a
disappointment behind this door here
there's a typical SD card reader as well
as some USB slots behind here you'll see
the blu-ray player now it's kind of hard
to tell but up here behind this little
rise you've got two USB 3.0 Jack's as
well as standard analog audio output now
it might look a little spare back here
in terms of connectivity but HP is
actually covered in space is pretty well
here's a graphics card it's got two DVI
Jack's as well as a mini HDMI output
here you've got 7.1 analog audio couple
more USB ports as well as the
all-important digital audio output and
you'll of course notice the red LED here
on this fan just like the one in the
front all that says gaming so as you can
see the inside of the Fenix is kind of a
mess that's typical mainstream PCs but
boutique vendors actually have systems
in this price range that look very tidy
inside so you can see that air cooled
CPU down here now HP does actually sell
a liquid cooling rig for this system and
because this is an unlocked CPU if you
bought that it's a $60 option you'd set
it up and you'd be able to overclock
this system now that's a pretty good
feature we're used to seeing that in
higher-end systems now overclocking
would get you some more performance out
of the CPU but you'd probably still be
better off with an intel core i7 chip
and you can actually get that in a
phoenix from HP for a little more money
and I'm here on the motherboard there's
8 gigs of ram in the room for two more
sticks if you want to upgrade later
behind this bar right here is the
graphics
and up here it's actually a nice beefy
600 watt power supply now we will say
this for this system it actually has a
pretty good range of expandability 600
Watts will let you add pretty much any
high-end card at least within reason but
for the foreseeable future
so well we wouldn't really buy the
system as an upgrade platform at least
if you do you know there is some hope
now up here there's actually two 1x PCI
Express slots giving you some nice card
expandability and here is HP's kind of
perennial e terrible hard drive cage
design problem is that makes it really
hard to get the hard drives out you have
to take out this whole assembly there's
one drive installed already it's a
terabyte drive and there's room to add a
couple more if you want to so with the
lightly stylized exterior and the red
lights the system certainly does suggest
that it is a gaming PC but overall its
performance is pretty terrible for its
price so we can't recommend it so I'm
rich burnin this is the HP Pavilion
Elite Phoenix h9z</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
