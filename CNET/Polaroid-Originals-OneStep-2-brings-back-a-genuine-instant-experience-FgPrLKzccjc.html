shooting pictures with your phone but
sometimes it's just nice to shoot and
have an actual print that experience is
something Polaroid originals is
reproducing with its new one step to a
simple analog instant film camera load
the film in front through the drop down
door turn it on and you're ready to
shoot there's a flash a self timer and a
switch for slightly adjusting exposure
but really that's it lights on top let
you know how many shots remain and a
built in battery lasts for up to 60 days
and charges by micro USB though does
take old Polaroid film you can also use
Impossibles color in black and white I
type and 600 type film which has 8 shots
to a pack and sells for $15.99 each or a
little less if you buy three at a time
that's pricey but at least the camera
itself isn't at $99 or 110 pounds in the
UK compared to the prints from Fujifilm
Instax Mini and square cameras the one
step two Sprint's are larger with the
same sort of dreamy results the original
Polaroids were known for they can take
up to 15 minutes to fully develop - so
the whole experience is very different
from the rapid-fire shoot and share life
you're probably used to but again
there's nothing quite like being able to
shoot and share a print immediately with
the people you're with and that purity
of the format is captured with the 1
step 2
