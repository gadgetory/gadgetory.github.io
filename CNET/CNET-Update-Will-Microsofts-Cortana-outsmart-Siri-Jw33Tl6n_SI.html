smarter than Cirie I'm Bridget Carey and
this is your cnet update microsoft is
planning to have smart assistant
technology in all windows devices and
it's codenamed cortana after the
intelligent computer named cortana in
the halo video game series Cortana is
getting buzz in the news lately as
Windows Phone gears up for a software
upgrade but a Microsoft executive told
CNET that an Apple Siri or Google now
competitor would only be launched when
the technology is revolutionary rather
than simply an evolutionary step forward
that might take another two years
microsoft CEO steve ballmer did hint at
something like this in previous
statements he said there would be a
system that could do more than just
answer voice commands it would learn and
adapt over time to people in the world
and even anticipate what is needed
before the user asks for it Roku the
streaming video set-top box is adding a
new feature that works like Google's
chromecast owners can stream content to
the televisions straight from apps on a
smartphone now Roku already has an app
for Apple and Android that turns a
smartphone into a basic remote control
but this would take it a step further
with users able to pull up a video from
another company zap likes a netflix or
even the cnet app and then click on a
shortcut button to start playing that
video on a TV it sounds cool but there
was no word on when this technology
would be available next year Samsung
televisions may run on samsung's
operating system called Tizen Samsung
has been working on making its own
open-source operating system instead of
only depending on Android Samsung's
co-ceo says Tizen based TVs could hit
the market next year in 2014 and the
goal is to connect all of Samsung's
devices with a common operating system
but I think it'll be a while before
people want to buy a Tyson phone over an
android phone so between cortana roku
and Tizen these are all things that are
in store for the future but if you want
something that you can try today head on
over to Google Plus on a Google Chrome
web browser and you'll find new photo
editing tools google has been
continuously improving phone
O'Toole's on google+ you may be familiar
with the auto awesome feature it
automatically color enhances photos and
makes animations from photos that are
taking in a quick sequence but these
changes give users on chrome more
fine-tuned control for example you might
only want to enhance the color of one
part of the photo google also added new
filters and cropping and rotating tools
the major web giants are fighting to be
your home for uploading photos Google is
hoping to lure you in with free editing
tools like this that's your tech news
update but you can get more details on
these stories at cnet com / update or
