del Conte and it's time to get loaded
ebay launched something called group
gifts it's designed to let you buy
expensive things for someone by having
several friends pitch in this is much
better than collecting contributions for
someone's going away gift at the office
instead you hook up with your friends
facebook or otherwise and contribute to
the amount of the gift you won't be
charged until you've collected enough
money in the pool once the gift is fully
funded you choose to send it along with
all the normal gifting options you can
find out more at group gifts ebay.com
and we could see Google's Chrome
operating system as early as this month
digit times reports that smart books may
come out in November with Google's
windows and OS 10 competitor but Google
might also announced their own
google-branded smart book with chrome OS
hmm we didn't think we'd see this in
time for the holiday season but I'm
anxious to give it a spin well let you
know when we know more Apple is
increasing the time it lets you sample a
song from 30 to 90 seconds Apple
notified the music industry of its
intentions to do this for songs that are
at least two and a half minutes long
there was some licensing hurdles for
them to go through but they did it so
now you can sample your music a bit more
thoroughly and you can now buy your
Facebook friends an amazon gift card
amazon announced that customers can
connect to their facebook account on
amazon.com and create a personalized
gift card that will be delivered to
someone's facebook wall you can specify
up to five thousand dollars and even set
a delivery date of up to a year in
advance to learn more go to amazon.com /
gift cards dash Facebook Microsoft is
removing the 3d layer to bing maps in
favor of the 45-degree angle viewing of
maps called birds I the 3d and birds eye
angle used to necessitate a silverlight
plugin but no more birds eye is the new
default view maps that used to be in 3d
will be updated quickly so that any
links to those locations will not be
broken Google is crowdsourcing its
security efforts they're offering cash
rewards for anyone who finds
vulnerabilities in any Google web
property including YouTube bloggers and
orkut they're looking for serious bugs
that could attack Google's corporate
servers if you identify one that the
Google team had previously not known
about you could be compensated over
$3,000 and google has also settled the
suit that accused the company of privacy
violation with Google Buzz the
class-action suit was by Gmail users who
sued over privacy violation when Google
Buzz auto accessed a lot of sensitive
information the settlement calls for
Google to pay 8.5 million dollars
towards a fund for organizations
focusing on internet privacy and
education those are your headlines for
today I'll see you tomorrow I'm Natali
