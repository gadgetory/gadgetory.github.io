idea what to expect this is a town in
the middle of the Australian desert it's
eight hours drive to the nearest city I
had to take two flights to get there and
when I was flying in it's kind of like
flying into Mars everywhere you look
there's just red dust as far as the eye
can see and the whole landscape is
dotted with these piles of dirt kind of
like ant hills Cooper Petey's a mining
town so all of those piles of dirt I
just left over dirt from mine shafts but
it's not just about mining here in
summer it gets insanely hot and in
winter when I visited it was absolutely
freezing so most of the town is actually
built underground to escape these
extremes and all I could think was how
do people actually live here how do
people survive and I guess most
importantly how do you get tech to work
when you're in the middle of the
Australian outback and you're living
underground so more than half the town
lives in dugouts which is the name for
these homes built inside the sandstone
into the rock and they blow them out
with explosives they dig them out with
excavators and they're kind of like
rabbit warrens the rooms are kind of
circular they have round ceilings they
wind every which way into the rock
there's really no consideration for
architecture but the cool thing is that
they don't need air-conditioning or
climate control because when you build
into the rock the rooms stay cool all
year round the only thing they need is
really basic ventilation so that's just
as simple as a tube that runs up to the
ground above and keeps air flowing into
the house it's amazing so Cooper Petey
looks kind of like something out of the
Flintstones but I was really surprised
that the townspeople actually use a lot
of tech they use things like Wi-Fi
hotspots to stay connected underground
and Australia's National Broadband
Network has started installing
satellites so people can get internet in
their underground homes there's plumbing
and electricity like any normal house
and often the people who build these
houses why are they electricity in
themselves stringing the wires over the
rock
the whole town is completely off the
electricity grid so while they used to
have to rely on diesel generators and
diesel trucked in from out of town now
they have this big renewable project
that has brought wind turbines and solar
meaning they can power the town with
renewables the whole town was built on
opal mining and people actually still
mined there so they have these converted
trucks called blowers that sucked it out
of the ground they blast out mine shafts
with explosives and they still go over
Rock seams digging out opals by hand
they finish the opals by hand too they
cut and polish them into these beautiful
iridescent gemstones that look kind of
like shards of rainbow coober pedy is
like something from a completely
different world
people living hundreds of miles from
anywhere in the middle of the outback in
the most extreme conditions and yet
somehow this communities survived by
jury-rigging
tech to work for them it's kind of like
something from Mad Max this one last
outpost of humanity in the middle of the
harsh Australian desert</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
