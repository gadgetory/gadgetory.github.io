Morris and it's time to get loaded
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton did
speak about Internet freedom on Tuesday
but we didn't get many concrete plans as
to what the government plans to do to
ensure this internationally the State
Department does have to walk a fine line
ensuring security from cyber criminals
and terrorists but also they want to
ensure equal unfettered access so no
word on how they're going to do that yet
in related news we do know that the
Obama administration plans to increase
the budget for cybersecurity at home
Monday's budget proposal included more
money for security research and
development to reduce the risk of
insider threats and make sure the
programs that run our national utilities
are not threatened this is just a
proposal but it would kick into effect
in 2012 leapfrogged announced a tablet
for children it's the leappad explorer
it looks like a kid-friendly version of
a tablet it has games and activities to
help children learn to read count
practice vocabulary and more it also has
a camera a video recorder a microphone
and a 5 inch color touchscreen it will
cost $99 when it comes out this summer
Apple has enabled subscriptions in the
app store for things like magazines
newspapers and videos this means that
publishers of content will be able to
set the price and time frame of your
subscriptions these are subscriptions
for the mac app store and the itunes app
store apple will process the payments
through your iTunes account and take
thirty percent of the revenue this is
the same subscription service that News
Corp's the daily uses and if it feels
like your cell phone bill is always
higher than you anticipated it's
probably because of taxes a new report
from que se partners shows that
customers in Nebraska Washington and New
York are paying the highest percentage
of tax on wireless bills the rate is
over twenty percent of the total amount
in these states the national average is
not much better at sixteen percent
unfortunately this is not very well
regulated and municipalities can make
changes to these taxes as they see fit
so the customer gets shafted logitech
will upgrade its video streaming service
to stream to iphone ipad and ipod touch
Logitech's life-size video center is a
product for business
it's a stream video to employees for the
purpose of training or meeting it's not
a two-way communication tool it only
sends video out to approve people who
can now watch it on iOS devices and
finally a German man received honorable
mention in this year's World Press Photo
Contest for taking photos of Google
Street view images he put his camera in
front of his computer and photographed
images of unfortunate events that were
on google street view like this one and
this one and this one he called his
photo essay a series of unfortunate
events you'll want to page through these
