concentration of black holes ever NASA's
Chandra x-ray Observatory released an
image that looks like a bunch of
out-of-focus Christmas lights with a
very black background however the image
is actually of space and it contains the
highest concentration of black holes
ever seen nASA says it is the equivalent
of 5,000 objects that will fit into the
area on the sky covered by the full moon
this image is the product of over 7
million seconds of observing time and
come from another image known as the
Chandra Deep Field south that roughly
translates to about 81 days of observing
time by the way NASA says this is the
deepest x-ray image ever obtained the
colors in the image represent levels of
x-ray energy detected by Chandra
high-energy x-rays are blue medium or
green and the lowest energy x-rays are
red about 70 percent of the objects in
the image are supermassive black holes
this part of space is 9 to 11 billion
light-years away from Earth and is
located in the constellation Formax all
right so it's a pretty picture but what
does it mean according to Neil Brent the
person leading a team of astronomers
studying the image the picture will
allow researchers to explore the
earliest days of black holes in the
universe and see how they change over
billions of years to figure all this out
researchers are combining the Chandra
x-ray data with Hubble Space Telescope
