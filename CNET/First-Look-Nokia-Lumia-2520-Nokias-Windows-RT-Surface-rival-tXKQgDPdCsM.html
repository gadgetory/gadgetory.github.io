with nokia in abu dhabi taking a look at
the Lumia 2520 it's their much-rumored
first tablet from Nokia packing windows
8 a full HD screen and a quad-core
processor the first thing you might
notice about the tablet is its design it
has a one-piece polycarbonate body that
is incredibly similar to all of Nokia's
Lumia phones if you already owe Lumia
owner this might be the tablet to match
for rest of your collection it has a
10.1 inch display which is full HD which
does make things look particularly pris
it's very bright and seems pretty bold
too so should be fine for all your
videos and photos under the hood it's
packing a Qualcomm Snapdragon 800
processor that's quad cores should
provide plenty of power sadly though
it's packing windows 8/rt now that's the
lite version of Windows 8 rather than
the full version but lets you install
all your own apps so far sales of RT
devices from other companies haven't
been brilliant so it is a bit of a
surprise to see Nokia going with this
operating system nokia has loaded up
some of his own stuff though including
here maps and it's nakia music but lets
you stream playlist of music and free
around the back you'll see a 6.7
megapixel camera with a Carl Zeiss lens
snarky reckons can give very good
quality photos as long as you're
comfortable using a 10 inch tablet to
take your photos and you'll see usb3
connection and hdmi out popping it up to
a big TV to help with typing you'll also
be able to pick up the power keyboard
now that acts as a case to tour the
tablet as well as giving keyboard and a
trackpad and an extra battery which
gives up to 16 hours battery life in
total if you fancy some lucky 8 and
Windows RT action then you can pick
through 2520 up for 499 dollars towards
the end of the year make sure to keep
the cnet for all the latest and I'm
Andrew
and this is the Lumia 2520</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
