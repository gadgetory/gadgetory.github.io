one I ever did a video on it was a real
badass in 2005 but has the state of the
art passed it by let's drive the 2011
Acura RL and check the tech
you're real unlikely to pull up
alongside an RL today or any day the RL
is a slow seller only about 2,000 copies
a year most car companies pull the plug
on a car that sells that few if it's
less than a hundred grand in fact
everything in its class out sells the RL
buy a lot but that doesn't make it a bad
car maybe just an exclusive one okay
here you can see the biggest problem
with the RL I think in the marketplace
if you spotted it it prints too small it
kind of prints fancy accord which in a
way it is but it's a very nice car with
some very elegant understated lines but
it doesn't sufficiently shout I make
more money than you do its competitors
tend to do that here's your LCD well set
back in a little well in the dash
although it's not set back far enough to
battle glare all that well which it does
succumb to quite a bit but that isn't my
biggest gripe my biggest gripe is it
hasn't changed in an eon this is the
same crappy looking map they've had on
Acuras and Honda's good grief since what
Carter was in office the typeface is a
disaster it's kind of Jaggi sometimes it
overlaps black type on a black street so
you get this mishmash in some places
making things hard to read and no matter
where you go in this interface it's just
going to play school and Jaggi I mean
look at these lines I do better with a
blue pencil so I'm very disappointed by
this this speaks to an inexpensive car
and it's sitting in their flagship
vehicle and they've had this thing in
this car for ever the screen is fairly
far away so of course you wouldn't
expect to touch it and it's not a touch
mean they don't do that on these Honda
Acura rigs you've got this controller
which is it's quite good you roll around
this kind of proprietary sort of
hemispherical interface click on what
you want go through the usual rigmarole
of city state and all that piece by
piece by piece you can also use voice
command which can be good or not so good
depending on what operation you're
trying to play out address address I beg
of you address you do have traffic and
weather information
this guy coming in through XM satellite
radio great out on our car because it
says these subscriptions expired not
sure what that's all about because we do
have XM radio working but it is a
separate sub for the data feeds that's a
good lesson to take away from this
here's disc a tox is the most
interesting one you've got a cd/dvd
player it's a six slot right in here
iPod USB you can put a USB stick or an
iPod in there obviously that's down here
on this little pigtail that goes into
this jack in the console you've also got
your standard mini jack aux in there
bluetooth streaming audio as well as
Bluetooth hands-free calling of course
phonebook import as well AM and FM does
not include HD radio by the way and as I
mentioned XM is our satellite radio now
your sound settings show you've got a
pretty sophisticated Bose rig here the
usual bass treble fader balance but
you've also got a sub control audio
pilot is automatic active noise
cancellation it picks up certain harsh
sounds in the car cancels those out with
competing sine waves that are the
opposite if you will and Center Point is
a staging technology to put the center
of the sound especially with
multi-channel stuff in the right place
and the oddest thing tied to GPS is this
car was the first and may still be the
only with GPS linked climate control so
it'll know where the Sun is they tell us
and adjust the air-conditioning so it's
colder on the side of the car that's
getting the Sun on it but I don't know
that it knows what the cloud conditions
are since GPS won't tell you that so I
don't know how that works
scrolling your iPod is pokey rotate that
knob beyond a crawl down your song list
and you can easily outrun the interface
missing our technologies like
lane-departure night-vision front bumper
cams
all available in this car is sold
overseas as the Honda legend but not on
the u.s. spec RL now this hmm is not
just annoying it's actually what's
called a Helmholtz resonator when you do
that dumb thing with a bottle a skier I
took that technology and built it into
their wheels now here's the reason
alleles a complicated little noisemaker
you've got all these veins and facets
spinning through the air at constantly
variable rpm it's very hard to predict
then that entire assembly is moving
through the air in a line as you drive
so a whole bunch of busyness comes here
that creates noise in the cabin so they
built in they say some kind of a
resonator like when you blow over a
bottle inside there I can't see it but
on trust them that cancels out a lot of
that noise up front this guy has got a
now 3.7 liter v6 and Honda does great v6
s happy willing smooth will get on the
road in a minute
300 horsepower coming out of this boy
271 foot-pounds of torque gets his car
up to 60 in six seconds flat while
delivering pretty good 17:24 MPG the
power goes out now through a six-speed
automatic up until this year they had a
5-speed automatic that was more suited
to a tractor I mean everyone else is on
seven and eight cogs now but at least
they've now got six and what comes out
of that gearbox goes in every RL to
super handling all-wheel drive it's
standard not an option not a package the
first thing I notice when I get into an
RL is it's very quiet smooth I mean I'm
kind of pushing it hard up a hill here
and there's no intrusion of motor noise
and harshness all those anti noise
technologies I've told you about Plus
lots of good old deadening and isolation
make for a very serene spot so the RL
does in its powertrain in particular is
have a readiness that a lot of cars
don't have some cars and great piki they
do certain things really well in terms
of delivering power but they're not
always ready to go in any situation this
car tends to bias in that direction
which makes for a more livable everyday
car to me
take this turn and put some power to it
you can really feel it push the rear end
out
I think that's AK torque vectoring stuff
doing its thing in the back there's some
little display I could look at here but
look at the road instead little drummy
over the really harsh pavement in a way
that a car in this price class probably
shouldn't be especially one that doesn't
have enormous sporting pretensions but
it's a very confidence-inspiring car
that has ample power and know nothing
about it is out of class this patch of
gravel in an acute corner at speed is a
really good example of super handling
all-wheel drive just head in under power
steering or Mele don't freak the
drivetrain makes it all work out where a
lot of other cars would get real
dramatic and in elegance
okay let's price a 2011 RL bass is
48,000 or so but you're not gonna pay
that no I'm not a car dealer because you
need some technology in here and that
doesn't include navigation for example
and as rough as it is you want to get it
factory you don't want to go aftermarket
on this guy that dashboards not friendly
for that so 4154 the tech package that's
the nav rig as much as I'm here about it
adaptive front steerable headlights you
also get heated and cooled front seats
and the rear parking sensors the rear
view camera kind of pricey for what you
get but that's how you get it
then there's the advance package which
gets you really two things adaptive
cruise control and collision mitigation
braking system which are basically the
same thing in two different modes and
for some reason they roll in the power
folding side mirrors in that package too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
