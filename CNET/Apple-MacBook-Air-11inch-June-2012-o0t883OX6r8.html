is the 2012 11 inch MacBook Air
now the MacBook Air has been around
since the fall of 2010 and hasn't
changed it design one bit now on the
other hand it is still really attractive
to look at in fact it's seen its offices
a lot of people were looking over my
shoulder to see what exactly this was
because it is smaller it is slimmer it's
kind of like your Mini Cooper cool
convertible laptop that just seems a
little smaller than possible for a
macbook and the performance to its
credit is really about the same level as
a 13-inch MacBook Air it's point 1
gigahertz slower in the base core i5
configuration which you're not going to
notice and there's been a bump up in
speed thanks to 3rd generation Intel
processors that are now in all macbook
products you can also get the same RAM
configuration the same storage as you
could in the 13-inch model what you're
losing here is an SD card slot which
might matter to a few people and more
importantly battery life this lasts 2
hours less on a battery charge than the
13-inch model that being said I've
almost 5 and a half hours of battery
life is really good and will do just
fine for a lot of people but it's not
that 7 hours plus that you're gonna see
on the 13 inch on the other hand you're
going to be saving $100 on this for the
equivalent configuration so some people
looking to get the cheapest MacBook
possible well this happens to be it the
lowest end model of the 11 inch MacBook
Air is $9.99 now that sounds like a
great value if you're looking to buy a
general use laptop unfortunately this
one is still saddled with a 64 gigabyte
SSD that's really too small for most
people I mean come on once you have your
II mean your based operating system
installed and apps you're not going to
have more than maybe two thirds of that
space available and it's gonna go like
that but if you are you know hooking up
an external drive maybe you can get by
with it I would pick the 128 gigabyte
model at minimum the good news is that
that version is 1099 this year $100 less
than last year's 1199 but you still want
to probably consider upgrading also
consider that the RAM and SSD in here
are either impossible to upgrade or very
very difficult to upgrade so
choose your configuration carefully if
you take this thing all the way up to
its maximum configuration you're gonna
be laying down 2,000 $149 that is a lot
of change you could get a Retina Display
MacBook Pro for that amount of money but
know that if you're spending in that
lower end of the scale for the 11 inch
chair you're getting a machine that is
performing at the scale of a regular
Ultrabook a larger screen laptop it is
every bit as fast it feels great and
this keyboard has made no compromises it
is an edge-to-edge full-size keyboard
that you can find on any other macbook
like the MacBook Air the trackpad is a
little bit smaller but that's what
they've really made a great effort to
fit in here that you're getting ace a
large bezel around this 11.6 inch screen
but don't worry about that keyboard it's
gonna feel great now what's changed
since last year well that slight bump up
and processor speed a little better
battery life USB 3.0 ports one on each
side and that's about it there's also a
different charge ports so you're gonna
have to use different cables the one
that came with this MacBook and you may
have to buy an adapter if you're hooking
up to other MagSafe accessories that you
have in your home which is annoying what
hasn't changed well a lot the size and
shape at two point three eight pounds is
about a pound heavier than the Retina
Display iPad so really not that heavy at
all and you guys still got the same
Thunderbolt connector here overall it's
exciting it's still very sexy but four
people are going to be using this as
their all-around laptop that low storage
and we're gonna have to pay up to
upgrade to and the fact that it's got a
smaller screen and a smaller battery
life may tilt you over to wanting to get
a macbook air in the 13-inch variety
instead I'm Scott Stein and that's a
look at the 11 inch 2012 MacBook Air</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
