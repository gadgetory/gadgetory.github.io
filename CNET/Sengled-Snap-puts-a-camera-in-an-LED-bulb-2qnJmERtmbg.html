bulbs I'm the Westway 4c Nets here at
CES 2015 taking a look at to saying LED
LED bulbs that do other things as well
one of them's a camera and one of them
works with any smart home system so
first up is this one shown here in
orange it's the same LED snap it is a
25,000 hour LED bulb it's got a wireless
camera inside it you can see right here
that's also a night camera it has a
speaker and a microphone so the idea
here is that if you're thinking about
getting one of those automated lights
that comes on when someone approaches
your house you could have this one which
has the built-in camera and all those
other features so you get loads more
information about who's walking up to
your house like all the best internet
connected devices it works with an app
and that app lets you do things like get
notifications on facial recognition so
you can know when a certain person has
been identified by the camera you can
also see a live feed of what the camera
seeing using that software also knew
from saying LED seen here in this green
fitting is the element bulb this again
it's a 25,000 hour LED bulb what's fun
about this one is it has a chip in it
which should make it compatible with all
the major smart home platforms now
that's handy because at the moment there
are loads of different companies
competing to be the smart home company
so if there's a bulb that works with any
of them that sounds like a good idea so
two smart bulbs there's loads more smart
home tech here at CES 2015 check out
