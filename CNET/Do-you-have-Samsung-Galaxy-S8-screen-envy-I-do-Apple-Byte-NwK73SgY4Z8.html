welcome to the Apple bite for everything
good and bad inside the world of Apple
and we can't start this show without
talking about the Galaxy s8 Samsung's
direct rival to Apple's iPhone that s8
is the best-looking phone right now
especially that infinity screen it's
gorgeous
good lord with the booty side with that
fingerprint sensor right next to the
camera lens for smudge ville city and
that might be one of the dumbest design
decisions we've seen in a long long time
now the Bigsby assistant is still
half-baked it wasn't even fully
functional when we tried it and it won't
be able to grab the same kind of answers
that you're used to asking Google shoot
Syria is even better than Bixby at this
point now you can dive even deeper with
us on our Apple byte extra crunchy audio
podcast but as for the s8 it looks
amazing
but sometimes looks aren't everything
that's what my mama told me - now the
iPad 9.7 this is available to pick up at
stores and an iFixit teardown reveals
it's basically exactly what we expected
an original iPad air with an a 9 chip
it's still the best value nine point
seven inch tablet on the market I've
said that from the start but this is Tim
Cook's philosophy in action use the
leftovers from the supply chain to offer
a product at a lower price for more
profits see it's not about having the
best product possible remember those
days but the best product at multiple
price points you know what it just made
me sad Apple to read that out loud but
look at yourself in the mirror Apple
will have an iPad Mini a nine point
seven inch iPad and iPad pro nine point
seven inch a rumored ten point five inch
iPad pro and an iPad pro twelve point
nine inch for a product category that
continues to the client year after year
after year you know what that's a bad
apple all right iOS 9.3 was officially
released this week and I like to wait a
few days after Apple's track record of
bugs the past few updates but it looks
like the coast is clear now 10.30 pods
and the new Apple file system that's
optimized for devices with flash
solid-state storage and it's a more
secure system and if you haven't noticed
iOS 10.3 should be snappier
many animations have been tweaked or
shortened or you just turn them off like
I did in the settings a long time ago TV
OS gets an update the 10.2 with better
scrolling with the remote and when you
rent a movie on any of your Apple
devices it will finally show up on all
of them and watch OS 3.2 theater mode is
here for the movies the sound turns off
and the screen stays off until you tap
it twice to turn it on plus an update to
Siri allows it to work with apps for
starting workouts sending messages
booking rides and more and I works yes I
work it gets a few key updates as well
you can now use touch ID to unlock
password-protected pages number and key
no documents you know what keynote is
the only app I use of those three so yes
my name is Brian and I use I works
alright keynote also gets a cool new
feature where you can actually embed
keynote presentations into blogs and
websites with the new update so that's
very nice and by the time you see this
Apple WWDC 2017 Lottery has ended and
that means if you didn't register for
the lottery there is no way you'll be
getting in your odds are pretty much
like one in a million
so you're telling me there's a chance
yeah no there's really not now five
thousand people were selected for the
conference that runs from June the 5th
to the ninth for the lovely price of
$15.99 that's one thousand five hundred
and ninety nine dollars but we know
updates across the board for software
and new hardware always shows up at WWDC
alright according to MV LM Apple has
been declared the most intimate brand in
a survey of six thousand customers the
firm measure the overall positive
feelings consumers had for each brand
based on six factors first one
fulfillment exceeding expectations and
superior service okay say that's fair
identity reflecting an aspirational
image not so much enhancement becoming
better smarter and more capable that's
true ritual ingraining a brand into
daily actions yeah I do that nostalgia
focusing on memories of the past that
bring good feelings I definitely do that
and indulgence trading a close
relationship centered around moments of
pampering
okay Apple you got me Apple took the top
spot Disney was second Amazon third
harley-davidson was fourth and Netflix
was fifth but no word if Apple will be
next starting a new clothing line
because you know they're the most
intimate brand with this this or this
slide to unlock alright let's talk about
that music video from last week because
nothing tops the feedback after we Adam
no we're just drop a music video on you
all so let's be honest most of you we're
feeling it but not all of you were
rodrigo Montini says i will not lose my
time with seeing it anymore
see you bro glowing eagle rights this is
so stupid
but it's stuck in my head what have you
done to me Brian Tom and Melvin Joseph
comments I think Brian is a senior
editor or something like that so sorry
for seen it employees and staff battle
Oh terrible ha ha
alright that's gonna do it for this
week's show you can email us at the
Apple bite at cnet.com or tweet me at
Brian tone thanks so much for watching
and we'll catch y'all next time for
another bite of the Apple perks of the
job</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
