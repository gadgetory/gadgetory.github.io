somewhat enigmatic mirrorless
interchangeable-lens camera it has a
distinctive aesthetic that I think most
people will either love or hate and as a
camera it inspires some ambivalence as
well however you feel about its looks
the design works overall and has a few
what's called quarks it's big there's no
getting around that since it needs to
have a long flange focus distance in
order to work what standard came out
lenses and it's surprisingly heavy given
all the empty space between the lens and
the sensor also given the size the grip
could stand to be a little deeper but
it's covered with a ridge - rubberized
material that helps and the rest of the
controls are big and mostly easy to
identify an access
despite its modernist design the Kerr
one actually has a pretty typical
control layout the real problem is this
floppy rubber cover it's very difficult
clothes it requires two hands to do it
to compensate
Pentax added a separate plastic cover
through the sdcard slot that said at
least the card slot is on the side of
the camera instead of inside the battery
compartment a few of the ko ins features
stand out in addition to an
intervalometer mode the camera also has
an interval movie mode which does the
same thing but can shoot for up to 99
hours and automatically saves the final
file is an avi movie the handful of
shooting special effects are nothing
special but you can adjust a variety of
parameters for each and it also offers a
three shot automatic HDR mode with a
range of up to three stops but the KO
one has possibly the best mid-range
noise profile I've seen in a camera
under $1000 the Sony sensor produces
extremely fine grained noise and Pentax
is uncommonly intelligent JPEG
processing results in generally clean
images as high as ISO 800 and extremely
usable ones through ISO 3200 by other
measures the photo quality rates is
excellent for its class as well though
the default color setting pushes the
saturation and contrast until blues and
purples shifts are really with the
natural
custom image preset the colors look
neutral and accurate with no loss of
saturation we're even flat looking
contrast video quality's mixed bad
though on one hand it's bright saturated
and sharp and good light but there's
also quite a bit of rolling shutter and
some haloing on edges low-light video is
also soft and noisy the 40 millimeter
kit lens is quite sharp and the photos
come out sharp without looking over
processed and without Distortion
but it's unsuited to autofocus during
video it operates noisily and I found
the AF completely inconsistent and
unreliable
however the manual focus ring works very
well for video it's servo electronics so
it operates quietly and smoothly but the
autofocus system was generally
disappointing along with the shooting
performance it's the slowest camera in
its class the kit lens is especially
infuriating it's a prime yet it hunts
for focus as if it's a zoom after every
shot it resets so when you're taking
multiple shots of a stationary subject
it iteratively refocuses every time the
more I use cameras like this the more I
wish that at least the expensive ones
had an articulated LCD this model which
is relatively large should also at least
have the option of an EVF the LCD is big
and bright but really difficult to use
in bright sunlight the only saving grace
is the cameras peaking feature it's a
camcorder carryover that highlights
edges during focusing which we're seeing
a lot more frequently these days on
cameras and that's the only thing that
makes it possible to ascertain if the
scene is framed correctly and in focus
when shooting outdoors and off angle if
you've got a stable of Pentax lenses
especially good ones that can properly
resolve to the sensor and you feel like
doing some creative shooting especially
with manual focus then the Kon is a
great choice but if you're looking for
an all-purpose ILC under $1000 you may
get frustrated with the KO and slow
performance in large quirky design and
it's probably worth trading off a little
on the photo quality for a better
all-around camera and likely a less
expensive one I'm Laurie Brennan and
this is the Pentax ko one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
