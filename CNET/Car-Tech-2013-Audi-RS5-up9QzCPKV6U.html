and M and if you need to ask me if you
need one
the answer is no for the rest of you
let's go for a ride in the 2013 Audi rs5
finally here and check the tank spotting
an RS is not difficult go to the grill
when you see that chainmail ripped off
the bosom of King Arthur you know you
found one need more convincing go around
the stern look for that little power lip
on the trunk and optionally those big
old kind of black finished exhaust tips
they're optional but they sound as big
as they look now first of all because
this car is really a road story it's not
gonna kill you with the usual tour of
the cabin tech look at any of our other
2013 Audi videos and you'll get a deep
dive on this but I'll give you the top
line we have the optional nav system not
standard even in this rather pricey rs5
but once you get that you've got some of
the best navigation and media tech in
the business two key reasons Google
Earth is your mapping interface that's
outstanding and Google search live
through a built-in SIM card and 3G
connection right there in the dash now
let's get to some electromechanical tech
this shifter here indicates the only
transmission available in the rs5 and
that is a 7-speed dual-clutch automated
manual a DCT as you see you've got a
pullback to drive mode another kick to
automated sport mode right drops you
into manual mode where it'll hold
whatever gear you're choosing and that
can be selected either by the shift
lever or with the singular paddles on
the wheel by that I mean one is for
downshift one is for up shift and as an
overarching principle this is where
outies basic design language today
really shines in a car like this every
Audi kind of seems to be designed in a
techno performance manner so this car
really leverages that everywhere you
look is kind of a technical comfortable
race cabin sort of language also
optional here is this little button
which unlocks a world of stuff that's
the drive select button when you press
that you can go through several modes
either a comfortable ride
item steering mode as well as different
throttle response and shift points you
can go to what they call dynamic that's
sporty you can go to auto or it kind of
finds its own way or you can go to
individual where you set the parameters
yourself of how the car behaves but note
RS 5 s in this country do not come with
an adaptive suspension the European ones
do up front in the RS 5 is a v8 but kind
of a pocket v8 not by today's standards
but back in the old days we used to call
this thing a a wrap motor a little
small-block it's a 4.2 liter naturally
aspirated no turbos or superchargers
here although out he does use those in
some cases not on this guy and that
makes it kind of an honest motor at 450
horsepower but note the torque 317
foot-pounds I don't think I can recall a
bigger Delta between those two and any
car we've reviewed lately so I'm going
to be intrigued to see if it's gutless
in any part of the rev range 0 to 60 on
this 4,000 pound car takes only four and
a half seconds so clearly something's
working down here now as I mentioned
this power only goes out through one
transmission a 7-speed dual-clutch and
only through Quattro all-wheel drive
which in this case is kind of sport
tuned to put 60% of the power down to
the rear wheels by default a sporting
choice and it's also got some cornering
logics and torque vectoring as you're
going around a corner hard it's going to
put more power to the outside rear to
kind of wheel you around and counteract
this car's tendency toward understeer
the three phases the me with this car
first of all in standard Drive mug and
maybe you've got to drive select an
optional personality selector in Auto
for example this is a really nice
everyday driving car obviously with a
lot of skills but then if you drop this
guy in the sport with one more kick back
on the wheel lots of things change
everything sharpens up gears get held
longer it's very noticeable but it's not
nuts you also get your throttle blipping
logic now so as you come down in speed
the car will Rev and blip and grab the
next gear that way it's all very cool
stuff and it sounds great and all that
put it over here in manual now and get
on these paddles that I so wish were on
the column and this is where this car
obviously really shines the grip and the
neutrality of it are so nice they've
really dialed in this Quattro system I
think my favorite of any of the Audi's
and there's no drama that's interesting
about this car you know a lot of cars
that have this kind of pretension
they're very high-strung this car is not
and that I think is part of the
interesting balance between horsepower
and torque this is not a car that is so
twitchy that when you get on the
throttle you've suddenly gone to
someplace you didn't want to get you can
mash it and go there but you can also
feather it in it's a real driver's car
nuance is spoken here and that's what I
like about this versus some of its more
testosterone Laden competitors a couple
of thoughts this DCT gearbox
and you hear that that's a great
sounding exhaust the sport exhaust has a
real throat to it when you step on it
it's got some valving technology built
in it really opens it up and starts to
bark when you get in it and then backs
it off a little when you're not and it's
got a bass note to it that you don't
normally associate with German cars it's
more of an American Muscle thing god
this car is fun the toss
okay let's price this 2013 Audi rs5
starts almost exactly at 70 grand
delivered we don't even have never seen
that toys in there yet so add 3500 or so
for the nav package that's navigation
with the Google stuff be a no audio rear
camera HD radio and that Wi-Fi hotspot
you don't care about now 30 to 50 more
gets you a driver assistance package
that is actually kind of cool to get you
adaptive cruise control you also get
dynamic steering so the ratio changes as
the driving conditions do and you're
also going to get the Audi Drive select
that button they get you four
personalities
now as the sport exhaust for a thousand
more no-brainer to me and you're in
about seventy six six done seen that
style and also basically loaded with the
exception of a couple of wheel options
this is an interesting car it's kind of
a summer car for all seasons because
they've softened the ride enough to make
it a good daily driver and they've ended
up doing pretty good on the mpg given
its performance profile
