photographer who've used the world in
wide-angle and doesn't care about a
viewfinder then you'll love the Fujifilm
X 70 and there's certainly a lot to love
about it for instance with its aps-c
sized x-trans CMOS - sensor it produces
some of the best photo quality I've seen
for under $1000 and certainly for its
$700 price tag and the design with a
manual aperture ring shutter speed dials
and physical exposure compensation
control provides a real manual shooting
experience the grip is one of the better
I've seen on an enthusiast compact - and
it's the only aps-c model that offers a
tilting and flip up display but there
are a few aspects that Mar the
experience the record button and
navigation buttons are difficult to
press it's also frequently hard to see
the display in bright sunlight that can
be a big problem since its 28 millimeter
f28 fixed focal length lens is so wide
that you need to check the edges of your
frame a lot unless you want stray limbs
and other objects poking into your scene
I prefer a narrower lens for street
photography more like the 35 millimeter
model on Fuji films higher-end x-series
cameras that's personal taste though but
the biggest drag on the camera is the
slow autofocus the video is nothing to
write home about either the sensors
sixteen point three megapixel resolution
is lower than I'd like and it doesn't
support Raw in the expanded ISO
sensitivity range so you're limited to
ISO 200 to 6400 there there's more on
both sides of the story though you'll
have to read my review on CNET for those</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
