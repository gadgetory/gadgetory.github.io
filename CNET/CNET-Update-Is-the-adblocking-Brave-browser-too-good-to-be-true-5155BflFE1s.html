to protect your privacy but is it too
good to be true I'm Bridget Carey this
is your CNET update no one likes the
feeling of being tracked by
advertisements especially when some
stupid thing you looked at on Amazon
follows you around the web for a week
and ads are also coming with other
issues all that tracking can make pages
load slower and now we have to worry
about as that are loaded with malware
that could infect your computer even if
you don't click on it all of this just
contributes to the growing popularity of
ad blocking software but now there's a
new web browser that wants to get in on
this trend and do the ad blocking for
you by default but there's a twist the
browser is called brave and it's a
project of Brendan Eich he created the
JavaScript programming language and he
co-founded Mozilla brave blocks all ads
by default so ad companies will not be
tracking you and pages do load faster
but it wants to make money by inserting
its own ads in place of the blocked ones
so in theory these ads are supposed to
be better because instead of using
tracking cookies to follow you to ads
show up based on your browsing history
and that's how it would make money it's
still in beta now and the company would
need millions of users to even make that
model work and the creator's say that
maybe you and I could get a cut of the
ad revenue and we can send that money as
micro payments to support our favorite
websites since they would not be making
money off ads brave isn't the only
browser with guts to do such a thing
Firefox has an option called private
browsing with tracking protection that
also stops websites from spying on you
by blocking ads the only ads that do
show up are the ones that do not track
visitors also on the topic of security
if you have an iPhone it's a good idea
to download the new operating system
update of iOS 9 point two point one it's
also for iPads the update itself is
minor but it patches a nasty flaw that
lets hackers spy on your phone watching
what you type or even make purchases
without your knowledge it's a little
hard to make the hack happen you would
have to first connect it to a fake Wi-Fi
network that a hacker created but
nonetheless it's good to be safe and
just download the patch in case there's
some evil hockey mask
you're mine looking to trip people at
your local coffee shop that's different
this tech news update but you can catch
up on more at cnet.com and be sure to
