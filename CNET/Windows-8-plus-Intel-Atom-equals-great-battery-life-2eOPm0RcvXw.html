look at the acer iconia w510 this is one
of those new breed of products that part
laptop part tablet some people call it a
hybrid we tend to call these detachable
because of course the screen detaches
just like this and when you hold it up
like this it's a Windows 8 tablet now
unlike some of the other windows 8
tablets that we've checked out this
actually runs the intel atom processor
that is a sequel to the process as you
used to find in those little inexpensive
netbook style computers it's more
powerful the battery life is better now
but they also charge a lot more netbooks
for maybe three hundred dollars this
combination right here of the tablet
screen and the keyboard which includes
an additional battery in it is about
seven hundred and fifty dollars which is
frankly a lot though when you consider
that you can get some very nice
ultrabooks with full intel core i series
CPUs for about the same price that said
for casual web surfing and everyday use
the atom is fine and the touchscreen is
pretty responsive for a low power system
when you rotate it the screen
orientation changes nice and quick the
keyboard is a little bit small this is a
10 inch screen so you're not going to be
able to pack a very big keyboard into it
the keys are kind of shallow is still
fairly decent for accurate typing
touchpad also very small you're really
going to find yourself relying a lot
more untighten the touchscreen that
maybe you would on a full-size machine
the one thing that kept this from being
a particular productive system for me is
that all the ports and connections which
are mostly right up here on the screen
are micro versions you have micro HDMI
micro USB micro SD card slot so you're
going to have to carry some adapters
around with you if you want to plug some
stuff in on a regular basis that said
battery life is excellent when you
combine both the battery in the keyboard
and the better in here this thing
actually ran for about 13 hours which is
pretty amazing i'm dan akron and that is
the acer iconia w510</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
