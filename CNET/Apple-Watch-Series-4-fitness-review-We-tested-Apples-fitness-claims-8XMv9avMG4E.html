up its fitness game it's got more
activity options better training tools a
longer battery life and in a sleeker
more comfortable designed but $400 or
more is a lot to pay for for a fitness
tracker that shares a lot of the same
features as its predecessors having that
bigger screen during workouts really
made a difference I wasn't expecting it
to but it's not just the screen that's
bigger it's actually the numbers so
finding your data on a run when you're
on the go and you really have to keep
your eyes on the road is a lot faster
and those extra seconds could mean you
don't trip on that run I for one track
my heartrate and I like to do it on the
go and this pretty much applies to any
other activity where you do have to keep
your focus the other big advantage of
the series 4 in terms of fitness is the
battery life apple says it can last up
to six hours of continuous outdoor
activity tracking compared to the
roughly 4 hours you'd get on the series
3 it's still a lot less than other
designated fitness trackers in the
market but it's a big bump for distance
athletes considering an Apple watch
where it's really gonna make a
difference is if it holds up to that six
hours of continuous activity tracking
that Apple says and that's why we're
here I'm gonna go on a six-hour hike or
pretty much until both of these watches
die to see if there really is that much
of an advantage
pretty much at the one hour mark over
here and I kind of want to check the
battery so now this is the Apple watch
series for and we're at 88% an hour into
the hike and this is the Apple watch
series 3 and we are at 73% we are at the
halfway point which means 3 hours into
this hike I am definitely going to want
to check to make sure that the series 4
is at least at 50 percent battery life
I'm gonna start with this one
oh wow it is doing better than expected
at 56% at the three hour mark which
means this is probably gonna hold up to
the claim and then some now let's check
the series three three hour mark to the
28 percent battery life obviously you're
not going to hold up the six hours but
I'm curious to see how long it goes
three hours a pretty decent amount of
time
okay series three just died at 4 hours
and 13 minutes and I'm really hoping
that it recorded this hike it was at 1%
and I thought I had time to stop the
workout but it just died but this one is
still going with 39% of battery life
that's a significant increase over last
year's series 3 so here we are at the 6
hour mark I honestly did not think we'd
make it this far
myself or the Apple watch for that
matter and the series 4 is still going
strong I'm at 11% battery life which
means I might still have another 15 20
minutes of hiking to go that's compared
to the 4 hours of the series 3 now
obviously your mileage may vary because
well I for one didn't have the music
playing you might like to work out with
music but at the same time I could have
conserved battery by reducing the
brightness I probably didn't need about
a hundred percent either way the series
4 definitely holds true to the six-hour
claim that Apple stated in the keynote
and that itself might be the reason why
you would splurge on the series for if
it's important to you
for all the new fitness features you
don't really need a series for older
models of the Apple watch up to the
series one also got some important
fitness updates from watch OS 5 starting
with automatic workout detection within
a few minutes of your workout you'll get
an alert and vibration on your wrist
prompting you to begin tracking and if
you decide to accept you'll even get
retroactive credit for anything you did
up until the alert but it doesn't work
for any kind of workout the watch can
only detect indoor and outdoor running
walking swimming open water or pool
elliptical and rowing machines but no
cycling Apple has also added hiking and
yoga tracking to the roster of
activities you can now select on the
watch and if you're a runner like me
then you're getting a whole new set of
tools to train with my favorite has been
the pace alert essentially the watch is
giving you a gentle nudge when you're
below or above your target pace and it's
really kept me from slacking off during
my usual running route and I can see it
being beneficial when you're training
for a race or just race against your
friends watch OS 5 adds a competitive
streak to the activity sharing by
allowing you to challenge your friends
to a 7-day ring closing competition I'm
gonna be honest I was already competing
against my friends who shared their
activity they just didn't know about it
now it's official and it adds a whole
new level of competitiveness to the game
which is good because it has made me
step up my workouts but on the other
hand it's made me borderline compulsive
about closing those move rings even if
it's just for a medal at the end of the
week I need it the series 4 has more to
offer for athletes but the Apple watch
was already a great workout buddy and if
that's what you're looking for in a
SmartWatch then you'll still get most of
the same great features on the older
models for less but then of course you
still have to factor in all the other
non fitness features in the watch so
