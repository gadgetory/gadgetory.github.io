think about search and Android that's
not how people will talk about Google
ten years from now behind the scenes
Google is tackling some of the most
ambitious projects in tech like Willy
Wonka level out their stuff I'm Donna
Bell and in today's top five I'm
counting on the five special projects
that will shape Google's future and
yours starting off at number five
Google Fiber now I know that speeding up
your home internet connection doesn't
sound like the craziest out-there tech
dream but if Google doesn't do it no one
will the broadband monopolies have no
incentives to improve things or lay out
the money to install fiber without the
fear of Google beating them to the next
generation of high-speed Internet the US
will be left in the dark ages of
overpriced bundled cable deals that will
just get more bloated and sadistic once
the connected home becomes a reality if
Google Fiber is the cure for Comcast
heartburn I'm all for it at number four
project ara this is Google's concept for
a modular phone that you can upgrade and
customize bit by bit because let's face
it the pace of smart phone hardware
innovation is slowing down basically
buying the same phone over and over
again just for little incremental
improvements it's a waste of money and
it's an unsustainable waste of resources
there's something sort of beautiful
about a truly personalized phone that
adapts with you over the course of your
life I want to live in that world
coming in at number three project tango
you know how the Microsoft Kinect can
map out your living room in 3d but what
if your phone or tablet could do the
same thing everywhere you go Google is
selling hardware to developers right now
that will do just that and it's opening
up all kinds of potential for developers
it means you can sell an app that tells
you exactly where to locate the quinoa
your grocery store but for Google has
the potential to help them fill in that
last mile of Google Maps going inside
the buildings a logical and somewhat
frightening step but if it means Google
now can help you figure out where you
left your car keys maybe it's a fair
trade
at number two Project loon appropriately
titled since it is the craziest idea on
this list
Google is obsessed with connecting the
next billion people to the Internet
people who live in areas of the world
with practically no way to get online
now Google always sounds so altruistic
when they talk about it but they're
basically trying to figure out how to
get banner ads to the third world how do
you get high-speed Internet to the
Himalayas well how about floating
balloons by floating giant weather
balloons in the Earth's stratosphere at
the edge of space Google can create a
mesh network of radio signals that can
bounce the internet down to even the
most remote corners of the globe it's
the kind of crazy ambitious project that
only Google could pull off which brings
us to the number one Google project that
will make the future a more interesting
place the Google self-driving car not
everybody needs an Android phone but
everyone needs a car if Google gets it
right they could save lives ease traffic
congestion and free us up to watch Game
of Thrones in the comfort of our cars
but the payoff for Google is huge
they'll have the best 3d road data
updated constantly by us putting them at
the unreachable top of the navigation
game because they'll know everything you
do and every move you make they can
target their ads with uncanny accuracy
you get a hankering for some Pad Thai
and your car's already warmed up and
ready to go of course when you realize
that you got that craving after seeing
an ad in Gmail and you have to admit to
yourself that you no longer have any
kind of privacy your autonomy that
Google doesn't have some influence over
you might get a little depressed so
there you go the five fold path for
Google's ultimate plan for benevolent
world domination telling you the Google
of 2024 is going to be far removed from
the debates over Android versus iOS
they'll be too busy driving you to work
and scanning your home and providing
your internet for more top 5 videos like
