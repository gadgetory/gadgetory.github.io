plus is the best they've ever made on an
iPhone but Google may have just raised
the bar saying their new pixel phones
have the best camera ever made on any
smartphone so we're gonna put these
specs to the test in the real world with
a tour of wine country starting here at
the Jarvis winery both phones were great
at capturing the hint of fall in the
vineyards and the storm clouds on the
horizon but the one shot on the pixel
looks more dramatic with more visible
detail richer color and better texture
and though the shots were taken from the
exact same spot the pixel has a slightly
wider lens making it appear further away
in all the shots so we're gonna get a
little bit closer and test the macro
shot the white balance is slightly
different on both phones cooler on the
iPhone with deeper hues and warmer on
the pixel with brighter colors making
the grapes appear lighter and since both
have their charm I'm gonna have to call
this one a draw both cameras have a
blurred background effect on the pixel
it's called lens blur and on the iPhone
it's actually called portrait mode the
pixel takes a bit longer to get it right
and you can see it had a tough time
distinguishing between the subject and
the background the iPhone is much better
at distinguishing between the two thanks
to that dual lens setup and though the
edges still aren't perfect the overall
quality of the portrait is way better
than you pixel and if you feel like
flipping the shot on yourself the iPhone
has a seven megapixel front facing
shooter compared to the eight megapixel
sensor on the pixel and you can tell the
difference not only is a pixel selfie
sharper than the iPhone it also has a
wider angle lens which means you get
more in your shot without having to over
stretch your arm
next we went to the stables for some
action shots of these fast-moving
creatures
capturing the exact same shot while in
motion was nearly impossible but these
two were the closest thing both were
impressive at capturing the horse midair
considering how fast it was going and
how much I was fumbling with the phones
but again we see the pixel has brighter
colors and greater details in the clouds
both above the horizon and below the
horses hooks so now let's see how they
handle low-light inside these caves once
inside we mounted the phones on a tripod
to get the exact same angle and reduce
blur and while they can both handle
low-light like pros the pixel was able
to let in more light with greater
contrast creating that sense of depth in
the shot which closely resembles the
real thing both cameras are a huge leap
forward for a smartphone the portrait on
the iPhone 7 plus is incredible and that
may be a strong enough reason to choose
it over the pixel but it's the only
reason the pixel was able to capture
more detail in each image it had a
consistently brighter colors and
superior low-light shots making it our
overall winner in this round</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
