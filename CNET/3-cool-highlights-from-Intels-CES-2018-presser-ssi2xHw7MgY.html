true view technology firsthand so can
you tell us a little bit about your
experience with it well I think the
first time you ever see it when I saw it
and we used it on air it's it kind of
allows you the first time you're kind of
blown away because your whole life
you're kind of watching this 2d version
of television and then all of a sudden
you look at this screen you're like whoa
this is different you don't even know
you're looking at this 3d thing
yeah that's 360 degrees and you know I
told Brian earlier I was like who's the
guy that's got that camera that's just
you know controlling this thing that's
moving around so much and then you kind
of get into the detail of it and it's
just it's really revolutionary what
they've done and pretty special so okay
that's that's great that's how it kind
of feels so so maybe if we could play a
clip we captured from one of the games
this season and I'd like you to walk us
through it and and just kind of tell me
your thoughts about what it's like to
both be on the field and and and see
what they see out there well in this
play you're gonna see Joe Flacco from
the Ravens and he's got as you could
tell the Pacquiao is looking he's got a
cornerback right there in his vision and
he's got the safety he's got to fit this
ball right in there don't throw this Joe
John threw up touchdown good job Joe but
you know what there's not any other
technology that would show you how tight
the straw was and how difficult it was
for Joe this allows you as a viewer to
really go right there and beat Joe
Flacco and you could be like I can't
believe he's making this throw there's
no window there you get to appreciate
the ability of that guy at that moment
at the same time you'll be able to go
back and nitpick and be like not a good
job Joe don't the other guy it's likely
that that was a good example there so I
think this audience would be interested
a little bit and understanding how
exactly the mobile eye technology can
lead us to a safer future with fewer
accents and and how you really see it
playing out well it starts with sensors
we have cameras about 12 cameras around
the car we have a cocoon of radars and
and laser scanners lod ours all fed into
high-performance computing system on
chips from mobile I and an atom
architecture by a by Intel so when we
talk about cameras we have three cameras
in front
three different fields of you which
gives you about 180 degrees and in total
and an very high resolution so you can
see about 250 300 meters range we have
cameras wing cameras and side cameras
that give you half a sphere on the side
a rear camera and then for parking
cameras altogether 12 cameras and then
radars and and ladders for redundancy
and I think we'll say bye-bye to to
Yemen thank you
you know what we thought CES is the
perfect opportunity to bring volocopter
to north america for the very first time
so check it out the volocopter
is an entirely novel type of vertical
takeoff and landing aircraft it offers
unprecedented levels of safety is
extremely simple to fly quiet and when
running on its batteries emission-free
