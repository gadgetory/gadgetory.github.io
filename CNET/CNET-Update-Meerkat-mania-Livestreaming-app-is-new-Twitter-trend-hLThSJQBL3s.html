Carey and this is your CNN updated folks
on this show it's my mission to make
sure you're on top of everything
trending and hot and technology I don't
want you to be left behind because in
social media things move pretty fast and
right now you should know everyone is
mere catting a meerkat is a cute fuzzy
creature but it's also an app that lets
you broadcast video live to your Twitter
followers you have to have a Twitter
account to watch a meerkat but this
isn't owned by Twitter it's a separate
species of social if you have the
meerkat app you'll get push alerts when
someone is live streaming video so you
can jump on in and watch but you better
act quick because once the stream ends
the video broadcast is gone meerkats
move fast if you're the one mere catting
you can see who is watching your stream
and people can shot with you but
whatever you say on meerkat shows up on
your Twitter feed to this is great for
sharing something in real time as it's
happening but it helps to be on Wi-Fi
because you'll want a good connection
for video and moving on to a different
kind of streaming there are some more
reports coming in about hbo's upcoming

it will cost $15 a month and launch in
April just in time for the start of a
new season of Game of Thrones
International Business Times says it'll
be called HBO now and it'll be available
on the Apple TV streaming box it's
possible this app could also be on other
boxes like the Roku but details are just
unclear now this so-called HBO now would
be a way to watch HBO without paying for
cable or satellite service a month ago
sling TV launched as a way to watch a
dozen live TV channels over the internet
for twenty dollars a month and the
service just added IFC and AMC to the
lineup for an extra five dollars a month
you can get epics movie channels and
Sundance TV if you're looking for other
forms of digital entertainment rock band

plastic guitar because the karaoke jam
sessions will return in rock band 4

creator's say old songs purchased will
transfer over to the new system and your
old instruments

you're throwing an old school rock band
