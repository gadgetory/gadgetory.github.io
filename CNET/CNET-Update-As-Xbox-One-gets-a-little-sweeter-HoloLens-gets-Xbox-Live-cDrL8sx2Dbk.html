live games can be played on hololens I'm
Bridget Carey this is your CNET update
more details are being revealed about
microsoft's hololens augmented reality
headset the company says the headset
will work with xbox live games and that
it's going to be set free into the wild
sometime in the next year if you're
unfamiliar with hololens this is a
headset with a transparent screen in
front of your eyes so you can see what's
in front of you but it makes it appear
that other computer-generated objects
are floating around the room maybe
you'll put buttons in your hallway a
to-do list on the fridge a video player
on your wall even the game Minecraft can
look like it's just sitting on a table
in front of you and you control all of
this with your voice and hand gestures
you can anchor these computer objects to
physical locations in the real world and
they remain there regardless if you walk
away or you move your head that means
you can attach Windows to your home
windows if you so desire Microsoft said
the online multiplayer games of Xbox
Live can work on the hololens and
independent game developers can also
make games for the headset these games
will also be playable on Windows 10
computers because Microsoft's gold these
days is to make all of its systems work
together as one you can expect there to
be one Universal store for apps and
games that can be accessed from
different devices in an interview with
the BBC Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said
the hololens would be first released to
software developers within the next year
and from there it may be tested in
commercial use cases before would be
something that you can buy for yourself
there's a big video gaming conference
going on now in Germany called games
come and Microsoft you use the event to
make some more announcements about
updates coming to the Xbox one next year
the game system will be able to record
television shows like a DVR the Xbox one
has something called a one guide it acts
as a digital TV channel guide and you'll
be able to set which shows you want to
record automatically the shows can then
be streamed to watch on a Windows 10
device and in November you'll be able to
play old Xbox 360 games on the new Xbox
one but
starters it's only a hundred titles that
you can download so it's not gonna be
all of your games also in November the
Xbox one is getting a new interface to
work with Windows 10 that means you can
use Cortana to make voice commands and
ask questions but you need a Kinect
camera to be able to do that from the
Xbox and if you don't have a Kinect
maybe you'll want this new Xbox one chat
pad accessory it's a keyboard that just
snaps on the bottom of the game
controller that's it for this tech news
