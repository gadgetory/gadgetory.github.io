report the show about the tech news that
everybody's talking about this week it's
the Palm Pre iPhone rumors the Palm Pre
again some stuff about GPS and I don't
know the Palm Pre let's begin with the
gadget of the week the gadget of the
week is actually Wolfram Alpha that
thing that's driving geeks crazy like a
big pile of knowledge porn it's not a
search engine
it's a computational knowledge engine
but I call it a gadget because no one
can really define it and it's just kind
of a thingy to play with that's too
smart for me it came out of beta on
Monday to the delight of people who like
to learn random things about other
random things or make math I don't
really know because frankly I haven't
gotten it to do anything cool other than
tell me that I was born on a Friday
during a waxing gibbous moon but I do
understand that it will make my child
smarter and for that I'm grateful and
now for the news the big buzz of the
week the Palm Pre is coming out on June
6th for 199 dollars with 8 gigabytes of
storage boom
you did it palm you hope so anyway we
haven't seen the thing yet but the fact
that there's a launch date means it's at
least real and it's got a chance to wow
us palms excited they are warning that
there may be shortages of the hot little
phone and of course earlier reports
suggest those shortages might be on
purpose to keep interest high they
better not be palm play it straight of
course
the pre comes out two days before
Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference
and the rumor mill is already churning
out reports of a new iPhone announcement
at WWDC word is that a new iPhone could
have a 3.2 megapixel camera one and a
half times the battery life video
recording o LED display and whatnot and
cost $199 for 16 gigs $2.99 for 32 but
here's the thing now that almost
everybody who wants one actually has an
iPhone we've all come to the same
realization it kind of sucks the new
iPhone could cure cancer and I still
wouldn't buy it because of AT&amp;amp;T plus it
won't cure cancer it probably could but
Apple won't let it so instead it will
cause cancer and about a million
stress-related diseases due to high
it doesn't work and this is actual news
not just a rant reports have been
everywhere lately some combination of
the iPhone Radio and AT&amp;amp;T service is
giving almost every customer everywhere
fits of rage about this thing's flaky
service it's almost total lack of 3G
reception it's slow to respond radio and
generally pathetic coverage range and
don't get me started on how you'll pay
almost $100 a month for a phone that
doesn't work anywhere I don't care how
many apps it has people want to call me
and text me and they can't the Palm Pre
could be about as good as x-men origins
Wolverine and I am still paying my early
termination fee the AT&amp;amp;T with a smile on
my face anyway so that's the news about
the pre pretty excited about that in
other news this week Craigslist has just
about had it with being called a pimp
it's suing South Carolina's Attorney
General to stop that office from
constantly threatening to prosecute
Craigslist officials even after
Craigslist agreed to make changes to its
erotic services listings yeah it is hard
out there for a pimp
okay sorry also this week Apple is
warning that it's earbuds can give you
an electrical shock in dry windy
conditions they say you should try to
keep the phone in your pocket not take
it out too often maybe use hand lotion
try wearing natural fibers stuff like
that not that their product is high
maintenance or anything it just requires
a new wardrobe and cocoa butter and
finally this week a warning from the US
government officials say that the global
positioning system might be about to
melt down the General Accounting Office
told Congress this week that the Air
Force hasn't properly maintained the GPS
network and the quality of GPS could
start to deteriorate significantly by as
early as 2010 they're talking blackouts
failures even in accurate directions now
that's one thing if it's me in my car
trying to find a restaurant annoying but
you know who else uses GPS the military
for like dropping bombs you kind of want
those coordinates to be correct
fix it Air Force
okay we need a happy break
let's see what's clogging the tube shall
we it's a good one this week Awkward
Family Photos dot-com
oh wow other people you are so weird
and that's the buzz report for this week
everyone I'm Molly wood thank you for
