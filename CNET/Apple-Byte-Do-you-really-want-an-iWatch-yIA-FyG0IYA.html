but i'm actually not here it's called
the magic of video recording it and then
seen it at a later time all right now
i'm gone making sure i am tan all over
my body but this is the show where I
answer your deep burning questions that
you the app dividers have so let's get
to some real questions first a lot of
you asked this one from Joseph all he
asks since we will probably not see
broadwell chips inside of Max this fall
will Apple still release an update for
the max well they will absolutely
release some form of a speed update but
nothing major from what we can tell and
depending on how badly you need a new
computer it might be worth waiting but
not if you're looking for a new computer
for school now the major benefits abroad
we are going to be its power efficiency
and getting a whole lot more battery
life it also incorporates a graphics
processor alongside the CPU so early
reports expect a 40-percent boost in
graphics performance and is truly going
to be a next gen processor alright cool
F asks what's your full opinion on the
rumored iWatch now I've said it over and
over that the idea of a SmartWatch
doesn't impress me at all an apple is
going to have to really wow me to even
buy one for myself now will I get one to
review and test it yes but I still don't
see the major benefits if it's hell stat
tracking most people stop carrying after
a month with those fitness bands I did I
workout in once you know how many steps
you roughly taking calories burned you
just don't care anymore now I also don't
want a big screen on my wrist that's
constantly buzzing and alerting me about
emails and text messages and the most
important thing people aren't really
talking about they have to make it look
like a real stylish watch I like a watch
that doesn't look like everyone else's
and they could possibly partner with
major watch brands to build some sort of
a shell or a casing that's compatible
that might get me interested but a watch
is a fashion plate before function and
apples going to have to get both of
those right for me to really care all
right Megan swype kowski tweets in with
is Apple going to do anything to improve
Final Cut X and do you like dogs well if
you're hoping Final Cut really goes back
to its original interface we aren't
going to see that it has its benefits
like real-time rendering
it can actually be faster once you learn
how to use it but even within our own
production team we're debating the next
move to either go for X or jump over to
adobe premiere in right now more of us
are leaning towards the premiere camp
but we haven't made a final decision yet
and yes I'm a dog guy and micro is one
of my best friends ever all right
Terrence Mackel be says how did you get
started in your career at CNN what was
your second choice well this is a long
long story but I went to school for
broadcast journalism at the esteemed san
jose state university i did some
internships and hosted TV shows directly
then sent my demo reel to the head of
scene at TV and you know what the rest
is history but those are just the
highlights from a journey that really
spanned over 10 plus years before i can
walk through these doors and call seen
at my home now my second choice male
dancer in I'm pretty good huh oh here we
go all right from Twitter Billy prova
nose asks can I be your intern uh sure
Billy but it didn't work out so well for
my last one I feel like I can contribute
so much 6253 mr. Tom's up wha thank you
kindly there were also a lot of hair
questions like a lot of them and it
sounds like you want me to do a how-to
video for my hair we'll see about that
but the most direct question from
Jimmerson Bob ass are you a skunk well
only when I eat a lot of broccoli and
Susie chaos I remember you did something

iphone 5 on it music video you have
something planned for the iphone 6
