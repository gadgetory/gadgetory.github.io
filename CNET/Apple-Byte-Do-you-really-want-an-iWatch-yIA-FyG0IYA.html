but I'm actually not here it's called
the magic of video recording it and then
seen it at a later time all right now
I'm gone making sure I am tan all over
my body but this is the show where I
answer
your deep burning questions that you the
a providers have so let's get to some
real questions first a lot of you ask
this one from Joseph all he asks since
we will probably not see Broadwell chips
inside of Mac's this fall will Apple
still release an update for the Macs
well they will absolutely release some
form of a speed update but nothing major
from what we can tell and depending on
how badly you need a new computer it
might be worth waiting but not if you're
looking for a new computer for school
now the major benefits of Broadwell are
going to be its power efficiency and
getting a whole lot more battery life it
also incorporates a graphics processor
alongside the CPU so early reports
expect a 40% boost in graphics
performance and it's truly going to be a
next-gen processor alright cool F asks
what's your full opinion on the rumored
iWatch now I've said it over and over
that the idea of a SmartWatch doesn't
impress me at all and Apple's gonna have
to really wow me to even buy one for
myself now will I get one to review and
test it yes but I still don't see the
major benefits if its hell stat tracking
most people stop caring after a month
with those fitness bands I did I workout
in once you know how many steps you
roughly taking calories burned you just
don't care anymore
now I also don't want a big screen on my
wrist that's constantly buzzing and
alerting me about emails and text
messages and the most important thing
people aren't really talking about they
have to make it look like a real stylish
watch I like a watch that doesn't look
like everyone else's and they could
possibly partner with major watch brands
to build some sort of a shell or a
casing that's compatible that might get
me interested but a watch is a fashion
plate before function and apples going
to have to get both of those right for
me to really care all right Megan swipe
Kowski tweets in with is Apple going to
do anything to improve Final Cut X and
you like dogs well if you're hoping
Final Cut really goes back to its
original interface we aren't going to
see that it has its benefits like
real-time rendering
and it can actually be faster once you
learn how to use it but even within our
own production team we're debating the
next move to either go for X or jump
over to Adobe Premiere in right now more
of us are leaning towards the premier
camp but we haven't made a final
decision yet and yes I'm a dog guy and
micro is one of my best friends ever
all right Terrence McElveen says how did
you get started in your career at CNN
what was your second choice well this is
a long long story but I went to school
for broadcast journalism at the esteemed
San Jose State University I did some
internships and hosted TV shows directly
then sent my demo reel to the head of
scene at TV and you know what the rest
is history but those are just the
highlights from a journey that really
spanned over ten plus years before I can
walk through these doors and call scene
at my home now my second choice male
dancer in I'm pretty good all right from
Twitter Billy prova nose asks can I be
your intern sure Billy but it didn't
work out so well for my last one I feel
like I can contribute so much there were
also a lot of hair questions like a lot
of them and it sounds like you want me
to do a how-to video for my hair we'll
see about that but the most direct
question from Jimerson bob asks are you
a skunk well only when I eat a lot of
broccoli and Susie chaos I remember you
did something to way back for the iPhone
5 with your iPhone 5 on it music video
you have something planned for the
iPhone 6
on it just bring that for TLT yeah maybe
I don't know we'll see if I'm busy all
right guys we'll be back for reals next
time but myself and the team just wanted
to continue to thank you all so much for
watching the show in you know what we
will continue to keep on bringing it for
you you can still send me your emails to
the apivita cnet.com or tweet me at
Bryant on because I answer them when I
feel the warm fuzzies so thanks so much
for watching and we'll see you guys next
time on another bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
