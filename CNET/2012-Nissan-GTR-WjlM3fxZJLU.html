up and pop an extra viagra when one of
these hits the garage the 2012 Nissan
GTR it needs a special place instead of
terrorizing folks on city streets we
brought it here to Infineon Raceway in
Sonoma Valley put it through its paces
and check the deck
last time I drove a GTR its abilities
were almost unbelievable its ride almost
unlivable and its price almost doable
the new version has had work done on all
three spotting the 2012 is best done by
looking for the LED running lights in
the revised front bumper purists may
find these sissified and look for the
extra five or six grand on the window
sticker but as we'll see the GTR has
actually become more of a bargain which
is a pretty good trick for a supercar
now the 2012 GTR hasn't changed in the
cabin much at all tiny little tweaks
here and there the main player here is
of course this 11 screen
multi-information display but Lifan e
digital there in the game space and
Clarion they make the actual head unit
have knocked it out of the park here you
have four custom views here one two
three four that you can set up any way
you want the lettered ones are
pre-configured by the factory a is
acceleration B is braking C just think
cornering it's really about steering D
is drivetrain gear position in this case
efficiency a fuel economy and fuel usage
and then F is your stopwatch G is a
place where you can mark coordinates
where you've been to map out a route now
down here the one on the left is the
attesa all-wheel drive control our mode
of course is the most aggressive this
new position here is called save that's
a fuel saving mode or one that really D
Tunes the delivery of power it can also
be used if you're stuck in some mud or
snow to kind of gradually rock the car
out without spinning them by the way
secret trick hold this down for four
seconds they tell me until it blinks and
now the car should drive in rear-wheel
mode only interesting your middle one
controls the Bilstein damped Roenick
fully adjustable suspension
automatically reading the road and
making changes millisecond by
millisecond up for our mode really stiff
and aggressively holding the car in
position middle is the down normal mode
this is new comfort mode I think they
heard my last review and they built this
in they actually heard this gripe from
lots of folks without a comfort mode
before this 2012 this car was unused
in everyday driving and the far rights
your stability and traction control in
the middle is normal if you hold it up
you get our mode it still does stability
control but it's going to wait until
you're in trouble to kick it in and then
if you go down and hold you can turn
that off okay now if all this stuff
doesn't keep you busy enough there is an
entertainment system am/fm your
satellite choices XM bluetooth streaming
audio and Bluetooth hands-free is
standard all this comes out of a Bose
audio system including a nine speaker
rig that has dual subs right between the
rear seats ok the shifter right here for
the one choice only automated manual
transmission it's a 6-speed DCT you've
got automatic or manual it's a toggle
switch basically now most of your
shifting will actually be done up here
on the thank you properly placed pedals
look I'm moving the wheel and I'm not
moving the paddles and they're nice wide
ears so no matter where you are if you
know how to handle a wheel right there's
some paddle to get to a downshift on the
left or an upshift on the right the
biggest single area of change on the
2012 gt-r is under the hood the engine
is really dramatically more powerful
it's still a 3.8 liter v6 with twin
turbos but they've massaged and
emphasized lots of things to get it up
to 530 horsepower up from 485 and by the
way that 530 is considered to be kind of
a low whisper number for what the
insurance companies I guess
torque on this guy is 448 foot-pounds
ample for a car of about 3,800 pounds
curve weight zero to sixty under three
seconds with the launch control which
will sample later yet it's an ultra low
emissions vehicle that gets 16 23 mpg
for major changes made this engine so
much better than the outgoing one first
of all they've got better breathing
intake apparatus bigger bores going into
the cylinders secondly they've changed
engine timing they've increased the
boost on the turbos up to about 13 psi
and finally they record the exhaust
system to get it breathing better it's
more free flow a GTR has an exotic
layout engine in the front but the DCT
gearbox transfer case to manage all
wheel drive distribution and of course
the rear differential all sit in the
back
wait balance is an unusually lopsided
5347 but it still gets around a corner
okay
our doesn't end on this cards
unbelievable I mean no matter how hard
you get into it it's never out of breath
the exhaust note is one of
nothing but fun all the way around I've
cut this guy in the arm mode settings
never hang it on the rear end really
elegantly
with 530 horsepower in the hands of a
rank amateur but we all noticed here at
seen that car tech was no matter what
kind of road we hammered this thing on
it felt like all four paws were out
there grabbing
and to be out there grabbing with the
kind of power it's got to deliver it's
pretty impressive rarely does it get out
of shape I pretzel did a couple times
but it was my own stupidity getting to
know the car if you have to get to know
530 horsepower not just go on one date
in the end what do you say about a car
like this that makes any sense its
superlative in a lot of ways but I'll
tell you one of the things that
impressed me the most is the fact that I
can do this on the track I can hammer
this car pretty hard and then I can get
on that freeway right outside and fini
on here and have a nice ride home in a
spirited daily driver that's the real
interesting thing that Nissan has pulled
off with this 2012 launch mode works
like this put the drivetrain and
stability control into our mode stand on
the brakes mash the throttle when you
get to four grand
let off the brakes and you get this bang
engagement and then you're off for a sub
three second one to sixty you can do
this four times in a row before the car
locks you out to cool off the gear box
and save Nissan a twenty thousand dollar
warranty repair on your GTR those
Dunlop's Sport Max tires were turning
into powder are on 20-inch wheels nine
and a half wide in the front ten and a
half in the rear these tires are the
only approved boots for this car and
they cost about five hundred and thirty
bucks apiece Nissan tucks the wheel with
inboard all around so unless you look
under the rear end you don't realize
you're basically driving a steamroller
okay let's place the car of your dreams
91,000 is base for a 2012 GTR premium
and that includes almost everything
three options on the list caught my eye
one tech - weird the tech one is 600
bucks for that backup camera I think I
would do that but the weird ones include
300 bucks for a chrome jack and 46
dollars for a seatbelt extender in case
you're a big fat guy
no fake coming to you from Infineon
Raceway in Sonoma Valley I'm Brian
