Electronics Show and ooh you're gonna
hate your TV I'm Brian Cooley with the
top five new TV technologies you're
going to want when you buy your next
television based on what we saw at the
CES in Las Vegas here we go number five
passive 3d LG LED a whole slew of TV
makers coming to their senses this year
with a move toward passive 3d
televisions as opposed to those that use
expensive proprietary active electronic
glasses now we'll review the latest of
both kinds head-to-head soon and let you
know but regardless this is a move in
the right direction though it still
fails to conquer the odd factor of
wearing glasses to watch TV at all which
brings me to number four number four is
glasses-free 3d TV toshiba was all over
this technology with aspects free set
that doesn't require you sit like a
statue in one place to get the 3d effect
like some past televisions you can sit
in any of nine positions around the
screen which is still a ways off from
how we behave in our living room kind of
slouching all over but it's not bad and
Toshiba says these sets will ship in q1
2012 so we're not gonna have to wait too
long to see if they're vaporware number
three is 4k TV this is the next big bump
in resolution that will roughly
quadruple the number of dots on the
screen compared to your current 1080p
television that you thought look so good
until now it's like jamming 4 1080 sets
onto one screen for ultra high-def now
we just need something to watch in 4k
but the arrival of this one seems
definite if not imminent number two
connected TV this revolution was one
with not a shot fired because everyone's
fighting on the same side look around
for TVs that don't have streaming
services at CES I'll wait for you you
won't find any luckily that Roku box you
have is also the perfect size to become
a drink coaster before I take you to the
number one bit of sexy vision you're
going to want in 2012 what about Apple's
television now it's widely rumored to be
arriving in late 2012 we have Siri
gesture control some say iCloud for
video streaming to and from Apple
devices pick your rumor but if there's
one thing I think it needs to be a
pricey hit it would be a fundamentally
new model for unlocking things to watch
online too much of the good stuff still
comes in a red envelope the number one
TV tech you're going to want next time
whether you can afford it or not is an
oled TV organic light-emitting diode
technology stole the show at CES real
big with LG and Samsung in particular
offering dueling 55 inch jaw droppers
that have a picture that will just make
you stay in all weekend every weekend
and a case so slim you're going to be
afraid you'll break it a third to a
sixth of an inch thick I don't know how
they're going to box these things for
shipping but we'll find out in q3 when
LG says they'll be the first to market
price is TBD but I suggest you be
sitting down for more on TV technology
as it comes out head over to cnet com
and click on televisions and for more
top 5s like this go to top 5 cnet com
I'm Brian Cooley thanks for watching
