digital experience with cnet com now in
my hand we have the lovely just recently
announced Motorola Xoom tablet you can
tell her the design is really clean and
minimalist there are no physical
hardware buttons on design this is a
10.1 inch screen it has one gigs of RAM
and 32 gig 32 gigs of storage now you'll
notice a front-facing camera on the
front side and a back facing camera as
well so you'll be able to do video
conferencing with this device some cool
features about this is that currently
when it releases in q1 it'll be 3g
compatible but with a hardware and
software update you'll be able to update
it over the 4g network so that's going
to be kind of exciting you will have to
take in the store but the fact that you
have that option is really sweet with
this device you also see three ports on
the bottom there's an ACM I out port for
720p video a USB port to transfer your
data and then also a charging port and
on the top side here you'll see a port
for audio and then a micro SD card slot
as well also this is the first dual core
processing tablet Motorola is not
telling us what specific processor will
be using it will be also running
honeycomb so you get all the latest
Google add-ons and features like
Google's maps and kind of news new bells
and whistles that we're really looking
forward to seeing now currently the
interface that are showing off videos of
how to use it we won't be able to really
play with it at the moment but we'll be
able to see a lot more at Motorola's
booth but there you go it's the first
look very exciting q1 it's coming out
the motorola xoom tablet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
