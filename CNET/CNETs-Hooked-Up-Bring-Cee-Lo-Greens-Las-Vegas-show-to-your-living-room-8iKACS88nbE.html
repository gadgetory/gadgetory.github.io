that measures 60 feet by 30 feet and
it's a centerpiece for cielos concert so
we wanted to show you what is the
biggest and baddest television that you
can purchase today well price is really
no object check out this 90 inch
behemoths from sharp it's the largest
LED television available today it won't
give you the best picture quality out
there but it's still good bigger than me
and prices start at nine thousand
dollars yep that's a whole lot of
dollars but if you really want a big
screen for thousands less go for a
projector like the epson powerlite home
cinema that can cover up to a 100 to 300
inch area that's 25 feet or a great
white shark now you'll still need a bias
screen the projector starts around two
thousand five hundred dollars and it's a
cnet editors choice but guess what don't
believe the hype sighs just doesn't
matter but if you're looking for the
best combination of price point
outstanding picture quality and features
you have to check out the Panasonic st60
series which is our top recommendation
for the best TV of 2013 it also comes
with a pair of 3d glasses it ranges in
size from 65 inches to 55 inches and
it's also a cnet editors choice and we
don't give that out to just anything so
take a look at these three products to
really create an amazing home theater
experience
