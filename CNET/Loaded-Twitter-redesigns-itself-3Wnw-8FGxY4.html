Jeff Bakalar and it's time to get loaded
twitter is getting ready to roll out a
totally redesigned version of its site
in a video detailing the improvements
the new twitter com will combine most of
the site's functionality into one page
among the updates is a streamlined
version of your Twitter verse with at
mentions retweet searches and lists just
above your timeline for more on the
changes head over to twitter.com slash
new twitter the first reviews of the
social network movie are out and seen
its own Caroline McCarthy got a chance
to screen the Facebook origin film last
night she calls it thought-provoking but
possibly too brainy for mass-market
success this coupled with the
questionable accuracy of the film's
content certainly make for some
controversy but you're going to have to
decide for yourself when the films
released nationwide on October first
though the HP Slate was announced at
this year's CES in January it is yet to
go on sale but the company did confirm
yesterday that they are indeed working
on a tablet that will run palms Web OS
operating system the company says that
the rumored pom ped will make its debut
in early 2011 but don't worry if you're
still hoping for a Windows 7 slate HP
says it'll ship that by the end of this
year according to Gawker and now
confirmed by Google the company fired an
employee over privacy breaches at its
Seattle offices David Barksdale is
accused of breaking into the gmail and
google voice accounts of several
children now he's not accused of sexual
misconduct just incredibly poor judgment
as the service engineer Barksdale had
privileges to peer into accounts to
check for data integrity all this comes
at a very bad time for Google which is
still under increased scrutiny over
privacy concerns those are headlines for
today I'm Jeff Bakalar for cnet.com and
you've just been loaded
