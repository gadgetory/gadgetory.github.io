to Google ishes for everything google
that we can pack inside to show each
week Mobile World Congress is just a
week away and that means plenty of faux
news and really we should just call this
episode phone delicious now the biggest
hype right now is surrounding the
samsung galaxy s5 especially with its
anticipated reveal on februari the 24th
but we're starting to get more concrete
details including a report from Sam
mobile that the s5 will not only have a
fingerprint sensor that will unlock the
phone but it will also allow for
automated website logins it's reporting
that Samsung's fingerprint scanner will
differ from Apple's touch ID because
with Samsung's you will swipe your
finger and it will detect it as you pull
it across the HOME key now Sam mobile
also says you can register a total of
eight fingerprints and assign each one
to a different task one fingerprint must
be used to unlock the phone and you can
even use a fingerprint as an app
shortcut now I'd use my middle finger
for flappy bird another detail they
mention is that the galaxy s5 will show
a real-time image of your finger on the
display as you're swiping it over the
home button sensor now if the report is
accurate Samsung is really pushing a
take fingerprint scanning to another
level that's a great thing and we'll
find out if they do anything more with
the tech another leak from efflux after
they released a really crappy looking
full res photo from a galaxy s5s camera
now ignore the quality of this picture
this is one of those stealthy quick test
shots but the picture itself has a
resolution of 53 12 by 2988 which
suggests the s5s camera will come with a
16 megapixel camera and improvement over
the current 13 megapixel camera on the
s4 also a bloomberg reports says Samsung
might also try to not only compete on
features but with price this time around
their sources saying the Korean tech
giant may sell the new s5 for less than
previous s phones that's about as broad
as you can get and in an expected move
retailers are currently cutting the
price of the s4 in anticipation of the
new phone also the next generation
galaxy gear watch is anticipated to be
part of Samsung's unpacked
mints which we expect will cover
multiple product lines best buy / the
current galaxy gear in half for $149 in
recent promos an ATT has started one
hundred dollars off a galaxy gear watch
with the purchase of several galaxies
products the reality is this thing isn't
selling at all and they achieve their
goal of being one of the first to market
but it was a huge flop and we're going
to need a whole lot more from the next
version the next gen acc one note on the
rumor mills right now with the codename
m8 will be unveiled on march twenty
fifth after HTC sent out invitations to
members of the press including cnet it
will be held in New York and London like
it was last year but there's a lot
riding on this one for HTC with profits
and sales continuing to fall now the HTC
One was a critical success it's my
personal android phone right now but it
was just beaten down by the Samsung
marketing machine now they've opted to
announce it after Mobile World Congress
instead of during the convention this
year which is a good idea with Samsung
doing their thing at the show now
there's also been plenty of leaked
images of the HTC One successor but a
new one from a Bleek's shows what it's
believed to look like with a case on it
ACCC has started manufacturing their own
double dip cases for the ACC one so this
wouldn't be a surprise for the next one
it also looks to retain the same overall
design on the front with the big HTC
logo and touch screen buttons on the
bottom and in an effort to potentially
win more customers over acc announced
they will offer the replace your crack
screen for no charge if it happens in
the first six months as part of their
HTC Advantage plan it also includes
their promise to keep users updated with
the latest Android a clear poke at
Samsung since they are taking their
sweet time to get to KitKat and the
ability to upgrade google drive storage
from 25 gigs 250 gigs for two years now
nokia or nakia i said it both ways to
make everyone happy well they've teased
their ex phone ahead of Mobile World
Congress which is expected to be their
first Android handset it's been
codenamed Normandy and it looks like an
Android variant with a Windows Phone
like user interface is being branded as
nokia X and here's another look at it
according to another leak promo image
revealed by Eveleigh now like I told you
lots of phone news and we can only
expect more next week and in our last
story if you guys thought the whole
flappy bird tale was over it's not
google is now rejecting apps that are
using the word flappy in their title in
an attempt to ride flappy birds tail
feathers now the store has been hammered
by clones and the Play Store zap section
has over 240 plus results based on the
popular game so if you're still trying
to get your game through google has now
blocked that from happening alright guys
that's going to do it for this week's
show you can email me at Google issues
at cnet com or tweet me at brian Tong if
you need a friend to talk to that's
going to do for this week's show thanks
so much for watching i'm brian Tong and
we'll see you guys next week for some
more of that google ish asst cuteness</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
