would be a revolutionary electromagnetic
suspension system it would offer an
incredibly smooth ride for cars the
secret project was called project sound
you should be able to build a car that
basically flies along the ground stays
level all the time
so when you get to a bumpy road it
should stay level and when you turn and
break it to stay level when you start
the project we actually started with a
luxury sedan so we bought two we put one
to the side and we modified the other
this is the unmodified vehicle that's
what we're starting with and it's going
to come down and a good rate of speed
and then it's going to make hard turn
lane change and then we're going to do a
very hard braking maneuver then it'll
come over these bumps and then they'll
slalom back so now the white car same
make same model same everything except
completely modified suspension system
we'll bring the cars down one after the
other at a fairly slow clip I just want
you to watch the body motion food to
finish the demo Bose gives us a look at
a springy feature it had no intention of
putting into a passenger vehicle but is
a fun way to show up how high-tech and
powerful the suspension system is our
visual sensor then of the consents the
deficit you know it's funny right after
we did it the very first time I remember
a person asking dr. Bose that same
question and his answer was we said when
I was six years old I started studying
magic the first two things they tell you
about magic is never repeat the trick
and never tell them how you did it in
the end the project was a technical
success but a commercial failure the
suspension system was deemed too heavy
and too expensive to integrate into
mainstream vehicles bose was able to use
what it learned from the project to
create a special car seat for truckers
called bose ride both says it sold lots
of seats but is still a niche product
for them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
