the way you shop I'm Bridget Carey and
this is your scene at Update
amazon is testing out a device to help
you with grocery shopping it's called
the amazon - it's a wand that scans
grocery items so you can add them to
your online shopping cart but right now
it's only available to a few folks that
use Amazon fresh which is Amazon's
grocery delivery service Amazon fresh
launched as a small test in 2007 in the
Seattle area and it expanded to parts of
California last year now aside from
scanning the - also has a microphone
button so you can verbally add items to
your list
Amazon's example video has people
speaking generic food items into the
microphone like strawberry yogurt and
apples but you'll probably still need to
visit the website to specify what kind
of yogurt and apples the - has a bit of
a strange look one half is a slick white
Wi-Fi remote and the other half is a
kitchen utensil handle making it easy to
hang for storage the Amazon fresh
program provides same-day or early
morning delivery of your groceries so it
can be a time saver but it doesn't serve
the coupon cutting BOGO deal hunters of
the world after your free one-month
trial its $300 for a year to use the
service and Amazon throws in all the
perks of normal prime for that price the
Amazon employee better be picking the
best looking Apple on the Shelf scanning
barcodes to build a shopping list is not
a new concept you can use an app to run
around the house scanning items with a
smartphone camera a popular app is
grocery IQ which is part of coupons calm
and there are apps to help you share a
shopping list with your other family
members like our groceries I personally
use couple if you want to eat healthier
the app shop well scans barcodes to give
you advice on which foods are better for
you
in other news let's turn to what's new
with Google glass the headgear makes it
easy to capture hands-free videos and
photos but now you can live broadcast
videos and stream them online with a new
live stream app the early Explorer
edition of glass doesn't have great
battery life it only lasts a few hours
with typical use and recording and
streaming constant video will drain the
battery like that but if
you connected to a battery pack for more
juice you could broadcast all sorts of
things from a point of view perspective
like maybe a concert and those watching
the video stream can type comments that
will show up on the glassware or screen
now you just have to figure out how to
get the drummer of the band to wear it
the whole time without losing cool
points
that's your tech news update head to
cnet.com for more details on these
stories from our studios in New York I'm
