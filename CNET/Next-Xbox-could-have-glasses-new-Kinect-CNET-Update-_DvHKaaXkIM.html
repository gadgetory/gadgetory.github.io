room and bringing game shows to our
tablets I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your cnet update the next version of the
xbox might be able to play blu-ray discs
3d videos and use special glasses that
would allow for augmented reality gaming
these details all come from a 56-page
document that seems to be the plan
microsoft drafted for the xbox 720 to be
out next year it also shows the next
version of the Kinect which could track
four people at once have better voice
recognition and be split into two
separate units on both sides of the
television this PDF indicates it was
authored in 2010 so some of these
concepts surely have evolved by now or
or outdated but other things in this
document like smart glass have become a
reality the mobile app Draw Something
couldn't be turned into a television
show CBS has bought the pilot of a TV
show based on the pictionary like game
this is according to the hollywood trade
paper variety apparently it'll have
teams of celebrities and everyday folks
test their quick drawing skills in front
of a studio audience and you could play
along on the app at home so it's a more
interactive take on pass game shows like
pictionary and win lose or draw Mozilla
the organization behind Firefox is
working on a web browser for the iPad
it's called junior and it will be
different than the typical browser for
example the toolbar is gone and there'll
be large buttons on the left and right
of the screen to navigate through pages
no word on when it will be available
Verizon's offer your new top tier high
speed internet for fios service at 300
megabits per second for 210 dollars a
month most people don't need that level
of speed but verizon also is offering
new prices for other speed bundles
Microsoft's new product announcement
Monday evening has everyone talking
tablets so allow me to help you sort out
all the speculation it's likely to be a
tablet that will be tied in with the new
windows 8 operating system coming up
this fall but it's got to be different
than the current windows tablets being
produced so expect there also to be a
tie-in with Xbox something that would
bring us a step closer to the SmartGlass
we saw at e3 and you'll likely see new
features for streaming music to fill any
gaps
by the discontinued zune the 7-inch
tablet market is a hot area ripe for
competition so many thought this could
be a product tied in with the barnes &amp;amp;
noble nook but person towable said they
have nothing to do with this so I
wouldn't be surprised if there was a tie
in with a phone since the next version
of the windows phone operating system
will be unveiled Wednesday what makes
products alluring these days is having
it tie with multiple devices using cloud
services like Microsoft SkyDrive so yeah
it could be something like that that's
your tech news update for today for more
on the stories in today's show visit
