profile and everybody gets one and it
allows Alexa to learn your voice and
distinguish it from other people that
may use your Alexa speakers this means
that you can add events to your calendar

hear what she said or you just like to
hear it again for reference you can say

answer will be repeated to you verbatim
out of the box Alexa speakers can play
music from several different sources
