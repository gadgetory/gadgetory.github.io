cnet.com this is your first look at the
Officejet Pro 80 600 series printers
from HP there's three separate models in
the line two of which I have here now
that can be really confusing if you see
all three of them on the shelf but I'll
do my best to explain the differences so
we'll start with the cheapest model in
the line that's this guy the $200 Pro
8600 a all-in-one so this one anchors
the flagship series with a two point six
five inch color touchscreen cloud
printing and a sleeker chassis from the
previous model there's a 250 sheet input
tray on the front and the price point
also Nets you a 50 page Auto document
feeder on top here that makes it really
easy to drop in a stack of documents for
scanning or copying now the e in that
moniker a all-in-one refers to all three
printers ability to connect to the web
through an ethernet cord or by Wi-Fi all
three models are also compatible with
Google Cloud Print as well as Apple air
print which also makes it really easy to
set up a wireless connection with your
wireless network or iOS devices
now the 8600 printers also give you
remote printing by way of what HP calls
ePrint each device comes shipped with
its own unique ePrint email address that
lets you save to your contacts list and
then you can use that address to send
print jobs from any web-connected device
that works really well for articles and
photos that you see on your phone while
you're traveling that you'd really like
to have waiting for you when you get
home so here's where the three devices
start diverging though for an extra
hundred bucks more you can step up from
the officejet pro 8600 to the officejet
pro 8600 plus that gives you a slightly
larger 4.3 inch touch screen that you'll
definitely need once you start swiping
through the HP eprintcenter app store
the home screen on the control panel has
an additional icon that this one doesn't
have its labeled apps and that lets you
add new icons to display just like you
would on an iPhone there's plenty of
apps available for quick snack bites of
news weather arts and crafts as well as
printable games for the kids
you can also automate those apps to
download content and print them out at
the same time every day if you're a fan
of their
action ality now the big guy in the
lineup not pictured here is the HP
Officejet Pro 8600 premium a all-in-one
I'm starting to feel like a host on the
Home Shopping Network but that fully
featured model Nets you an additional
250 sheet paper tray an additional set
of ink cartridges and a 50 sheet pack of
premium glossy brochure paper along with
a 4.3 inch touch display the apps and
ePrint like I've already mentioned but
no matter which one of these printers
you pick you will definitely be
satisfied with its print quality the
print speed and reliable performance
that I actually recommend for personal
use as well as for businesses its
breadth of connectivity options and
cloud printing insurance longevity in
the marketplace and its compact
footprint relative to the features won't
really take up that much room on your
desktop now you can check out all the
details for all three printers on
cnet.com but that's going to do it for
me I'm Justin you you just took a first
look at the HP Officejet Pro 8600 lineup
