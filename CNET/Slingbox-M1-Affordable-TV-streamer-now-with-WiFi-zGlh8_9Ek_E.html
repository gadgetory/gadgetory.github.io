its family of play shifting streaming
media boxes and this is it
the sling box m1 despite its ho-hum
design it's a pretty cool little box and
the noteworthy hardware feature here is
the inclusion of Wi-Fi previously that
wireless connectivity was only available
in the step-up Slingbox 500 now simply
called sling TV which retails for 300
dollars the m1 cost half that or $150 hi
I'm David Connolly and is with past
sling box models the m1 digitizes video
streams from your cable or satellite box
or DVR and streams them in real time to
a wide variety of devices Windows PCs
and Macs iPads iPhones Android phones
Android tablets including the Kindle
Fire and Kindle Fire HD windows phones
and even some home devices such as an
Apple TV or Roku there's no monthly fee
but the mobile apps cost $14.99 the
streaming software on the PC and Mac is
via a free browser plug-in and the home
streaming device apps are free as well
to set up the m1 all you have to do is
connect the box to the component video
outputs of your cable or satellite box
then setup a sling box account and link
the box to your Wi-Fi network from your
computer the box has built-in IR
emitters that interface with the IR on
your cable or satellite box allowing you
to turn your mobile device into a
virtual remote control if you have a
router or an Ethernet connection
available near where your sling box is
set up yes the m1 has an Ethernet
connection like the step-up sling TV the
m1 offers 1080p video streaming but
video performance will vary according to
your internet connection it's more
important to have a speedy upload
connection at the source that would be
at your home or where the sling box is
installed that said sling engineers have
done some impressive work with video
compression schemes and I've managed to
get a sharp image on my phone with even
a slower 3G data connection and with
higher bandwidth connections including
ones on your own Wi-Fi network at home
the image is rock-solid it's as if
you're watching regular tea
viii if you're looking for differences
between the m1 and sling TV the sling TV
has a pass-through HDMI port that allows
you to navigate your home TVs program
via slings well-designed electronic
programming guide and some other added
features however from the standpoint of
accessing your content remotely you
really don't lose anything by going with
this more affordable model it faces more
competition from TV anywhere apps from
cable and satellite providers but a lot
of those apps still offer limited
channel selection into those apps truly
open up the sling box remains the best
way to remotely access all your home TV
programming and this m1 with its
built-in Wi-Fi is an attractive place
shifting option it's more affordable
price point of $150 I'm David Carr noise
