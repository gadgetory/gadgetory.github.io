and gentlemen boys and girls welcome to
the live show we're here see that live
for your coverage of the note eight
Samsung's unpacked event with a variety
of other things we might may or may not
see in the house we got do the
introductions ladies and gentlemen
across me miss Alexia Vijay's good
morning and also in the show our I live
show for the first time mr. Patrick Hall
and say hi to the good people outside
all right and also are running the show
with his eight-armed tentacle ease mr.
Steven BJ and our producer
extraordinaire in the back corner that
never likes to be revealed bodies in the
house you put your hand up can she
doesn't want she doesn't want the love
alright everybody so just to give you a
little update on what is going down
today if you don't already know Samsung
is holding their event out in New York
it will start approximately at 8 a.m.
Pacific time 11 a.m. Eastern Time we
will jump into the keynote but before
that we always do kind of our pre-show
we want to talk about the things that we
expect to see some of the rumors we've
heard but we also want to talk to you
guys we make this show all about you so
we're gonna put a little number down on
the bottom our call systems gonna be a
little different today but we are gonna
take your live calls and your live
questions all together now
Patrick gonna have to chant this number
with SK the number is 1/8
it took some time to put that together
let's just say that so if you guys the
gals want to call us um dial into that
number again it's one eight four four
three one one seven one one eight it's a
toll-free call both in the US and
internationally that's how we look out
for you someone paid for that all right
so as the call lines are already filling
up let's just touch base really quickly
the note eight obviously the successor
to last year's note seven we
a very explosive phone honestly a great
phone that had its own issues but let's
just go around here and start off with
you Patrick
what are some of the things that Samsung
needs to at least do today in your mind
I mean the first thing I do is you gotta
acknowledge what happened last year it
was a great phone but it was a kind of
one little small flaw that you know made
it be taken off the market then also
that you have to take a look at what
they've did with the s8 and how they can
bring that into the note aids and maybe
add an exciting feature maybe like two
on the back like I don't know cameras oh
yeah oh yeah something like that
Lexie obviously we have to have some
sort of acknowledgment of the note 7
issue samsung said time and time again
that the note customers are they're kind
of their most treasured in the fact that
they're so devoted to the brand so I
hope there's some sort of olive branch
for those guys and girls who are time
and time again going out to get that
note phone and stuck through Samsung but
through the whole times of the note 7 I
would love to see obviously the dual
camera Reema that's floating around and
something a little bit whiz-bang extra
because I know that obviously there's
gonna be a lot of emphasis on the
battery issue and safety of the phone
which is very very important but I think
that might take away from the discussion
of anything else that's super exciting
so hopefully there'll be a little
surprise in the bag crossing our fingers
anyway yeah right when you say whiz-bang
you don't mean like TouchWiz right I
mean obviously I think if everyone that
is watching this wit if their wish came
true we'd love to see a Samsung phone
with pure Android but we're we're we're
not gonna see that I mean that would be
the dream realized because that hardware
with pure Android which would just be
money I'm gonna just go down here before
we take the calls literally all 10 phone
lines are filled right now wow the
people the people are here so we're
gonna get your call in a second but
before we do that we did want to just
kind of briefly touch upon at least some
of the rumors that we've heard and seen
related to the Galaxy Note 8 rumored
these are actually specs from Evan blast
if you guys have been following him on
Twitter he is kind of
liek extraordinaire of images pictures
everything you can think of but a 6.3
inch AMOLED display with a 2k resolution
on that but the big thing that you guys
are talking about here that we touched
upon the dual camera for the first time
on a note product did you want to expand
on any of that why are you're kind of
juiced about based on what the rumors
there's lots of dual camera phones out
there and they kind of all have their
little nifty things they do but I think
what's exciting for me about this is
it's kind of in the vein of the Apple
phone or 1+5 where you have both the
wide-angle and is possibly a telephoto
lens yeah here's a big thing on those
phones especially the Apple one there's
only one of those cameras it has optical
image stabilization and if the rumour is
correct that both the telephoto and the
wide-angle have optical image
stabilization I think that could be
amazing I agree I think that one is
gonna be the game changer optical image
stabilization is essentially it's it's
so much better than digital image
stabilization it's actually in the
hardware in the lens of the camera
rather than actually through software so
the result is vastly superior and as you
were saying if it's in the both of those
lenses both of those cameras it's gonna
be really interesting to see how Samsung
does that I mean it opens up so many
possibilities as well it's not only just
gonna be food photography think about
the augmented reality think about all
those other applications you can use
with two cameras I hope there's gonna be
some sort of demo or something to go
look it's also if it's for a photography
it gives you that beautiful blurred
background look but there's also
something else coming later it's gonna
be really worth your while and worth
investing in a cat in a phone with two
cameras yeah we we've really seen the
fact that as it's in a weird way our our
phones and they we've already known they
become our go-to camera but now they're
becoming camera cameras like doing more
than just you know now we're getting the
bouquet if I were getting that depth of
field you know like Orfila depth in our
cameras and they're taking it to the
next level so I think that no matter
what I think bragging rights typically
tend to people get excited more now
these days because phones have matured
and they've kind of plateaued of what
they can really do it's all about what
the cameras can do now and then how that
adds to applications and you know like
we
talk about augmented reality and things
of that nature as a and I think also
interesting is that you're able to now
have just like Apple like the zoom lens
on there without physically making the
phone larger by adding another camera
and if the possibility is especially of
a are will they call it something like
Bixby a are barks be barks barks be
that's really like resonated we know any
other piece or box
Mark Smith and we're gonna call right
now be capital a capital R xby I'll jump
through a little quick specs before we
get to the calls some of the other
rumors or things that you guys and gals
have probably seen this design will be
more squared off compared to like the
Galaxy s8 and si plus we talked about
the resolution of 2k chipset globally
will go with an Exynos 88-90 five for
the US a snapdragon 835 and then one of
the things that people love to get crazy
about Ram rumors have pointed to and
leaks that this Note 8 will come with
six gigs of RAM which is actually two
more gigs than what the standard
versions of the s8 NSA plus have uh
there are a couple actually Asian
versions of the s8 that have six gigs
but it's not a widespread feature so we
have that um and then just speaking
really quickly to the dual cameras I
mean when we talk about detail leaks we
talk about detail leaks rear dual
cameras twelve met one of them will be
the 12 megapixel with an F 1.7 aperture
again with optical image stabilization
and then the other one will be the
telephoto lens with an F 2.4 aperture
again optical image stabilization with
optical zoom so these are just some
crazy things we'll see how it all pans
out but Before we jump in more and get
your calls we do have a call from our
own miss Bridget Carey from inside
Samsung's event and she is blue like
deep sea Smurf exploded on yeah I I'm so
glad to talk to you because I have such
a headache right now they are like
hypnotizing us with the same dirty
second song and we're in a sea of blue
and it's just let me show you exactly by
flipping my camera
here oh my god it's just blue you know
there's a doctrine aiding you right now
Bridgette I mean they're trying to get
you in a brainwash mood to absorb
everything they tell you information
already that they're showing you can
memorize that by now it's ingrained in
the head so tell us what's going on just
um I Brown just kind of maybe the
general feeling with people that you're
talking about about this notes 8 event
specifically if you'd kind of paint that
picture for us all right well it was a
little choppy to hear you because the
connection years wobbly but to paint you
the picture at least I'm getting here I
mean it was it was very high security I
think it's interesting to point out
there were different sniffing dogs on
with the bag so you know I never knew a
check event where I had a dogs take me
but hey you know we're secure here also
what everyone here is just kind of
waiting for obviously it's either tone
we can through ok we can hear you the
the the microphone on your phone is
quite impressive it's sad it's one of
those that you know enemies yeah I feel
like everyone is always hyped to talk
about like oh my gosh the big okay
there's Roger Chang everyone's type to
talk about the issue with the flyer in
the note 7 and how they're gonna you
know recover I think CNET fans keep
track of this stuff but I think most
people are really just wondering like
there's just too many Samsung phones
what can they do to stand out what can
they do to really make a big impact and
this is the big year they're fighting
apples so you know what are they gonna
do like the tension between them and
Apple's bigger than ever I think most
consumers are a little bit worn out
between how many different Samsung
Galaxy phones there are and what this
one's gonna do to make it worth paying
so much more for this extra jumbo phone
so true
Brigitte are there any freebies that I
know that Samsung's often given away
like gear 360 cam
to the audience of VR headsets is there
any hint of anything there at all we are
in stadium seating and know nothing in
our seats just the blue lights so if
there is any freebie I mean there was
some avocado toast hydration
all right Bridget hey Bridget so we're
gonna let you guys get back to work
there before we start there's the Big
Red Machine they're all in Tron right
now all right thanks so much appreciate
it we'll be looking for their coverage
we obviously will have all these
follow-up articles and coverage from
inside the event and hands-on with
whatever devices they announce I thought
she made an interesting point because I
think actually when we talk about the
note 8 I don't think that I don't think
the fact is that the note 8 line is or
the note line in general has always been
the most feature packed phone no one
will ever dispute that and beyond that I
just think they just need to show off
and it's gonna take time it's just gonna
be a solid phone that isn't gonna have
any issues it's going to improve on the
camera side everyone kind of knows what
to expect in every other aspect of it
with Bixby you know you might get a few
cool like features with the pen or
whatnot but beyond that if they just
hold down the fort and say okay fine
last year was a debacle we really
handled it incorrectly and we're gonna
do it right this time and if it pans out
to be a solid nice note eight phone then
they can go for the stars with the note
9 but I think that this need to prove
hey this is it I don't think people are
gonna be overwhelmingly blown away but I
think it's gonna be a solid phone yeah I
think that's exactly right the word is
solid it's gonna be solid it's gonna
have to be reliable it's gonna be your
phone Samsung has to put out and show
you that it's safe and it's not gonna I
think blow us away in any way don't mean
it's gonna be a reliable phone that it's
gonna set the tone for future Samsung
phones I think they again they're going
to reiterate that eight point battery
safety check that they roll that as a
result
of the night 7 and was first implemented
on the s8 I'm sure they'll reiterate
that again take us through a tour of the
battery testing facilities just to show
yes it's safe but then they're gonna
move on I mean once they've got that out
of the way and as they do with the s8
it's just gonna be business as usual
here is our phone here's what it's can
do and here's why you want to buy it
yeah let's um let's go to the phone
calls because everyone has been waiting
patiently so I just wanted to start
showing some love we're gonna start off
with Robert Kailash are you there Robert
welcome to the show
you listen listen to us through your
phone and then just ignore like the
actual stream because then you'll be
you'll be talking us like real time
you hear me now Robert no problem
alright what Samsung's gonna do anything
to those people that are turning their
no 7 if they go to give a discount or
you know Shannon well we saw what they
did at least right for people to have
the note 7 they offered people like kind
of a little discount off and by forcing
you to return it they take a little
chunk off the s8 what rumors are things
have you guys heard potentially about
what they might do here today something
in terms of maybe a give er deal a
package something to entice users I mean
is that really gonna be enough if it's
just simply an object rather than like a
financial discount I don't know so we're
gonna have to wait and see is there
something in particular you and I you
and note 7 owner yourself like would you
like a discount as a result of this yeah
I can do my notes I get an s7 edge and
most no plate people are loyal that's
why they still around so I was hoping
Samsung's gonna say okay fine we'll pay
what's remaining on the samsung s 807
edge and you know let you get your
notate yeah I think that as someone who
is a customer who I'm not gonna use the
word burn but I did but if someone who
felt that they were burned by that
situation I think you if you really want
to make people happy you got to give
someone more than just a gear VR headset
with the no date it literally would have
to be some sort of financial thing I
don't
think they'll do that I think they might
say okay here's a bundle of none of the
gear VR there's some extra software but
they already do that like they did that
during this time you got the the watch
or the VR set they do that yeah we'll
see I mean this is a good thing right
you're here to watch and find out what
they do and that's what we're gonna find
out as well so we'll cross your fingers
for you bro all right all right all
right thanks for coming thank you Chris
we're gonna go out to Chris right now he
wants to talk about the pen with the
note aid we don't get any question about
the pen so Chris what's up welcome to
the show okay I'm gonna put them back in
the queue and we're gonna go to someone
else because guess what we've got lots
of calls all right let's go out to if if
the calling software did its job is this
coward from calling us about the no date
okay I'm gonna keep all your doing that
as I say like I think another they could
just get people off Akata toast right
$10 a slice all right let's see here
let's go out - sorry guys yeah we're
trying to get this thing rolling it
didn't work the first couple times
though is Harvey out there can you hear
us okay Harvey or not okay well I'm
gonna figure this out well you talk
about other things someone on the scene
at live hashtag by the way if you want
to jump on that and tell us your
thoughts uh Chris has asked what
happened with the rumors about a release
of note 7 rebranded what did Samsung do
with all this stock that's a great
question I mean I know there was a note
7 what was the name of that edition that
they they kind of rereleased in Asia
wasn't it was it something I thought
there was some rumors about that I I'm
intrigued to know it yeah I mean there's
a lot of notes 7th stock left out there
like is it hopefully I'm sure it was all
gone to recycle
and raising this those pots for um you
know breaking them down and use them as
components for other fluorines and and
recycling them in a sustainable way
um I had I don't know what or what else
well there's a lot of look uh I mean I
don't know what I don't know what
happened with those things but I think
another thing that we could talk about
is other stuff that we expect to see at
this event because an impact it's not
just about the phones
Evon blasts again was back at it again
showing us basically a new I know this
is not gonna be like a game changer but
basically their new gear fit to pro the
next generation of their gear fit to
where they added the word Pro and so
come on now these days you've got to add
the word Pro to make the next generation
instead of going to numbers because
that's just people don't want numbers
anymore they want Pro it's so much more
professional so we have screenshots of
what Evan blasts revealed here this is
gonna be a Tizen based there Fitness
band sensor a nice big screen some of
the things that make it interesting and
different from before it will have GPS
it'll also support offline Spotify for
music playing which is real which is
really nice it'll be ip68 our water and
dust resistant it does say though that
it can be put in water but not
submersible so it does have a swimming
tracking software that'll be compatible
with speedo ons fitness app if in case
if in case you have a hammock it talks
to this device as well
but it rumors point to that being priced
at $1.99 and that we should expect to
see that's it's a little pricier for a
fitness band I think you know I think
these days you want something around
like the 150 maybe 170 but we'll see how
it integrates again it's Tizen base but
it will be compatible with both Android
and iOS
so we'll see more about that I also want
to throw this out before we try to make
an attempt at the call line again um
maybe something that do you guys think
we'll see anything gear VR related we
know that they released an earlier kind
of stuff more like a cosmetic update to
the gear VR when the s8 came out and
it's
paddle with essaying than si+ what do
you guys what are your guts tell you
about the gear VR do you think we'll see
one maybe maybe not
will they do anything different I'm
hoping that it's gonna be a standalone
headset so I'm I don't want to see an
update to the gear where it's just
you're put phone in and that powers
everything I want to see Samsung go hey
here are our plans for standalone video
you know we've got Intel already made
you know they've got plans out there
we've got oculus rumored to have that
standalone VR headset that is basically
Wireless it's you know all contained and
into one I want to see Samsung come out
and go so you know about the gear VR but
let's let's tell you about this new
product that's actually going to be
totally untethered and doesn't require a
phone to run I'm intrigued about that I
think that's really gonna be the the
next step that VR needs to take on
that's exciting too because if you go
back to the new date a little bit or
there's rumors about the resolution of
the screen and that would be an
excellent sliding device for the
old-style VR headset but if it was a
standalone I think that would yeah
there's um what did what they've shown
at least that the recent Mobile World
Congress in Shanghai was a prototype
version of a Samsung VR headset a
standalone one that does have the
position list tracking cameras in it as
well which is kind of like the next kind
of spatial advancement in these VR
headsets when they're stand-alones we I
don't know if we'll see it here but it
would be really cool if they dropped it
on us because it was a working prototype
it didn't look too shabby at the time
but again it's only been a few months
we'll see if they do more right they
added a motion controller with the
latest gear VR as well so that could be
something interesting if they threw that
out on us I don't know I'd like to see
it though just to see where they're
going okay should we get we should try
all right okay we're about eight minutes
out seven minutes out before the actual
keynote I'm gonna cross my fingers okay
okay I'm going to reach out to Larry
Larry can you hear us okay we tried but
the hash tag though a lot of questions
coming in on the hash tag go for it I
know what's going on here actually I
know what's going on yeah I'm gonna work
at the subs
okay dan says on cinet like what we were
talking about earlier about those older
notes seven devices that were turned in
they apparently turned into the note
seven fan edition that was only released
in South Korea okay that's I think
that's what I was remembering we're
calling someone's asking Brian where are
the air pods where are my ear pods oh my
gosh they're there somewhere around here
absolutely I'm not gonna wear them here
that's blasphemous to wear in a Samsung
event price point okay so a couple
questions on CNET live asking do we see
it launching at $1,000 or around about
that mark in the US is that just about I
mean Patrick is that too steep for you a
bat right no you know I feel like that
in a weird way that's a new trend I know
if it's a great trend but we're seeing
like these phones and rumors have liked
in the example phone popping up that hi
we're looking at this red camera phone
coming out later this could be $1,200 so
I think establishing as a premium phone
and at that price point could be
acceptable and they could play into the
narrative also of hey if you had a note
7 we're gonna give you a financial
discount to make it drop back in line to
me what last year's price was good point
I mean that's a huge incentive if they
can actually bring the price down
through a discount you know as we've
said time and time again loyal like
owners samsung knows that these people
are super loyal to the brand and super
loyal tonight so anything to entice them
and bring the price down but yeah a
thousand dollars it's still it's that
it's that barrier it's a little it's a
little psychological psychological
barrier for me it's a it's a steep price
point I think if it's $9.99 it's that's
like you know that thing or it's like
you see it it's $0.99 you're like I can
afford that oh it's a full round number
it's $9.99 I could afford that it's hard
though because you know we know the
largest capacity storage for an iPhone
you know 7 plus is actually already over
$1000 so I think people just although we
talked about all there's a lot of
articles about it I think we've always
talked about Center and some of the
other stuff we've done it's like once
you break that down and like to monthly
payments and plans people don't care if
they see like $45 a month they're still
gonna do it I know they're yeah exactly
like how long okay do you want me to
tell you why I think I got the phone
lines
I've been dying to know so the actual
Skype that we use to call into it had
been closed this entire time Oh clothes
on itself so if this is a total fail on
all accounts okay but I'm gonna give it
one more time I'm hoping and crossing my
fingers that Joshua is in the house
Joshua can you hear me from seeing that
live yeah you got in the show this is
good a good omen for no date users the
battery will not explode because we got
this to work alright Josh what do you
want to talk about oh yeah yeah oh no
man I mean like I'm on my note seven
right now actually thought you guys and
people walks away from the maybe that's
why they have all the security anyone
who has a note seven phone needs to get
off the plane he's like Joshua can you
tweet me whatever you're on a plane
because I'm gonna make sure I'm not on
that plane so no yeah I'm just I'm happy
for this no date event coming out
finally and uh coming you know I don't
know what else to talk about except like
we're just hoping to see that we don't
have that same recall issue that
happened to note seven because as you
can see a lot had to turn that back in
that was a big issue for us basically
you just called in a brag that you're
still rocking the no seven what they're
still out there yeah he's got it he's
got alright let's keep on going here I
don't have the name for this person uh
but I
believe it might be omar based on what
it says Omar can you hear us on scene
alive yeah can hear you not my man it
feels good when you get this thing to
work hey what do you want to talk about
today welcome to show thanks thanks for
inviting me I'm actually calling because
I was wondering what do you guys in the
leaks the placement of the fingerprint
scanner I I mean in Samsung learned from
the s8 that's the terrible location as a
fingerprint scanner and I mean my camera
lens is still clogged up them every time
I tried it with my finger out there yeah
you know what I think it but it bugs me
personally because I think they did it
purely from an aesthetic reason in their
mind they just didn't want to see like
two circles on the back of it I think
you know when they wanted to put it next
the sensor they had every opportunity to
change that with the note 8 and it gets
in the way some people say oh it's not
that big of a deal it's right next to
the camera it's gonna smudge over time I
mean how often do you feel like you're
cleaning your camera lens there's a
message that pops up to there reminds
you to clean your exactly yeah so all
the renders and everything that has been
leaked out that are allegedly actual
official images the of the notate show
that it's still gonna be in the same
exact place right next to the camera
lens so I can give you a bro hug right
now you know it's still like would you
rather would you rather than move the
fingerprint sensor or fix that Bixby
button which drives you more well you
know what been cold yeah the good thing
one way that they can help you know the
thing is that Bixby wasn't obviously
fully baked at all
it basically released three months later
and then people were already kind of
turned off by the fact that hey you have
this dedicated button you can't people
try to hack around it to use it for
other things than Samsung's like hey
we're gonna update this and not let you
use it to launch you know the Google
assistant or anything like that
I just for them to put so much
dedication to a physical button and for

ladies and gentlemen please give a warm
welcome to the stage president of mobile
communications business
DJ ko
thank you and welcome to pop Avenue
Armory
I'm so excited to be back in New York
with you we are here to celebrate one of
these interesting truly unique devices
the Galaxy Note in 2011 when we
introduced the first note it was so far
heard of the curve and some people
couldn't believe what we had achieved
they didn't understand the power of this
pen were they in love at the big screen
but there are millions of people who
recognize right away that the note was
much more than just another smartphone
they saw it as a canvas for the
creativity on engine for the ideas and a
platform for their productivity so today
we are here to do more than celebrate a
device we are here to celebrate and
everyone who helped make the Galaxy Note
such a success of course the universe
will never forget what happened last
year I know I want but I will never
forget how millions of dedicated Note
loyalists stayed with us their passion
has been a constant inspiration so let
me express my deepest gratitude to the
incredible neut community around the
world
we are here today because of your
support and it is a special honor to
personally thank all of the North
laurels whoever continue your to join us
you play such an important role by
sharing your experiences and offering
you feedback I'm deeply deeply humbled
by your loyalty and grateful for your
insight your passion is the most
important measure of the value of our
innovation and the greatest reward for
our commitment to defy barriers thank
you so much thank you thank you
so truth is as the newt is different
from other smartphones neutral arrays
are different from other smartphone
users they are the ultimate multitaskers
and power users the achievers creating
new way to understand and experience the
world they are why we created the note
today
they form a unique tribe of Graeter's
inventors and doers who look at the
world and see unlimited possibilities a
try so passionate that's three out of
four note we just say is the best form
they have ever owned and almost 9 out of
10 are proud to recommend to a friend
there is no better example of the
strength of this a try and the north
culture they have grated then can up pan
up is a global community of people who
use their northern ass pan to create and
share beautiful works of art it is
remarkable to see millions of people
around the world express themselves
through the universal language of
drawing Khanna is a great reminder of
how meaningful progress enable people to
reach further and do more
here is a another thing I love about the
Galaxy Note it validates our belief in
the power of relentless innovation today
large screen phones are the fastest
growing segment of the smartphone market
and they are defining the future of
mobile technology now after years of
research and development we can deliver
the largest screen that fits comfortably
in your hand
we are multi tasking easier not to take
a more powerful and drawings come alive
we transform the S Pen from great
writing tool into an incredibly
efficient way to switch between tasks
and harness the power of this one now we
are listening new ways to communicate
that are more visual more emotional and
more fun we continue to evolve our
best-in-class camera to take great
pictures in any conditions we were the
first to offer iris scanning as we focus
on advanced biometric security to
protect personal information we
pioneered wireless charging and ip68
water and dust resistant so people can
walk and play wherever and whenever they
want and with Bigsby we are leading the
way with voice touch vision and tact so
people can control experiences to way
their life but Bixby is more than just a
better way to interact with the devices
it is the beginning of smarter
capabilities
that'll help people solve a problems
managing tasks and connect the valuable
experiences so much as a changing since
we launched the first Galaxy Note what
was impossible to the six years ago is
impossible to do without today over the
past thirty years I haven't seen how
magic happen when you embrace the future
and make a bold investment to explore
unchartered territory and so we are here
to celebrate the North Oliver's who
inspires today and to introduce a
smartphone that will inspire the neutral
levels of tomorrow
ladies and gentlemen it is my pleasure
to introduce the Galaxy Note 8
thank you
now let's meet the Galaxy Note 2 8 in
detail thank you everybody thank you
please welcome to the stage senior vice
president of product strategy Justin
Tennison
Thank You DJ and hello everyone it is
great to be back at unpacked to show you
the incredible no date but today isn't
just about unveiling an amazing new
product it's about celebrating what's
behind that product all of you for years
note users have inspired us to think
bigger you've raised the bar for all
smartphones by demanding more from yours
now your backgrounds and passions are
different but you all have one thing in
common
you're not just dreamers you're doers
and the note 8 is made for people who
want to do bigger things watch a movie
on a cinematic screen when you're miles
away from the nearest theater blog about
your most recent vacation while flipping
through all the photos you took or take
a beautiful portrait or create one
yourself with the screen built for
working and playing a top-of-the-line
camera and a pen for expressing yourself
in any situation the note series has
always been designed for people who want
to get more out of their smartphones
year after year you've asked us to help
you do what you couldn't do before the
Galaxy Note 8 is our answer there's one
thing that's always set the note series
apart the large immersive screen we
created the note because we saw an
entire group of people who used every
inch of their device and still wanted
more you were the reason we created the
large screen category you're the reason
we pioneered the edge panel adding an
entirely new dimension to the device and
you're the reason we keep pushing the
boundaries of display technology
literally to give you more space to do
more in March we introduced an
innovation that kicked off a new era in
smartphone design the infinity display
people love the infinity display on the
s8 and s8 plus and because of it they're
using their phones more than ever before
and today we're combining the
revolutionary technology of the infinity
display with the power of the s-pen and
bringing it to the note for the very
first time thank you
the infinity display is a game-changer
for note users because where others see
more screen you see more space to do
what you love and to get things done
with an edge-to-edge display that covers
nearly the entire front face of the
device the no date has the largest
screen ever on a note device to create
it we took a six point three inch pane
of glass and we rounded the corners and
curved the edges this time at a steeper
angle to give you more space to write
and create with yes Ben
and not only can you do more in the
notate you can view more to it has a
cinematic screen that pulls you into the
story when you're watching movies or
videos without any obtrusive bezels or
sensors or camera lenses getting in the
way your view and we did this all
without compromising on design and with
our cutting a cutting edge quad HD plus
Super AMOLED display those movies look
crisp and clear photos are brilliant and
games are totally immersive now seeing
more also means scrolling less so the
first thing I do when I wake up in the
morning after getting my cup of coffee
of course is to catch up on articles
emails my Social Feeds
with the no date I can see more at once
so I spend less time scrolling and more
time caffeinated now in the mornings
before my kids wake up it's literally
the only time I could focus on just one
thing
and as I get into my day I need a device
like the note which is made for
multitasking and for balancing
everything that life throws my way
multitasking is a signature of the note
series so on the weekends when my family
and I drive around town we pull up maps
to check the traffic conditions and the
music player to stream some tombs and
with multi-window
we don't have to switch between those
two apps and now the note 8 makes it
even easier to multitask and to
customize the experience to fit your
life thanks to a pair you can create a
shortcut to launch two of your most use
apps with a single tap from the edge
panel so that means as soon as I get in
the car for that weekend Drive I can
pull up maps and music with just one
touch and it all runs completely
seamlessly thanks to the powerful
performance of the node 8 this is a
phone designed for the way you use it in
fact even though the note 8 lets you see
and do more than ever its body is still
incredibly slim and comfortable to hold
on the outside this is a beautiful
device but what I'm really proud of are
the amazing feats of engineering that
lie just underneath the surface the node
8 is composed of hundreds of individual
technologies from the smallest internal
wiring to the sensors below the glass
and you get to choose your favorite
color as it comes at midnight black my
favorite orchid grey maple gold
and deep sea blue with its signature
large screen display that no date helps
you bring big ideas to life and beyond
the screen it's a device that empowers
you to create whether you're planning a
meeting capturing a memory or shoot
sharing a meme and now I'm excited to
bring to the stage someone who really
knows how to create with the node 8
please help me welcome Suzanne DaSilva
Thank You Justin in the past month I've
had the chance to live work and play
with the no date two of my favorite new
features are the incredible new camera
and the s-pen which let you express
yourself in ways you never thought you
could today we don't just use our
cameras for special occasions we use
them to capture and share the moments we
live every day and many of those moments
happen at night that's why we introduced
the dual pixel sensor so you could
capture vivid photos and videos in
low-light but what's the point of an
awesome camera if you miss the perfect
shot like when your friend finally gets
airborne that's why we introduced quick
launch so you can access your camera at
a moment's notice and remember the days
when you're afraid of taking pictures at
the beach by the pool or in the rain for
fear of getting your phone wet well
that's why we made our devices
water-resistant so you don't have to
worry and we've built on that foundation
of innovation to create a camera that
makes it even easier to express yourself
however wherever and whenever you want
in fact you might even say that the
notates camera is twice as good as
before and I mean that literally we're
proud to introduce a dual camera that
will set a new standard for smartphone
cameras everywhere that's right the
no-date has two separate back cameras
that work together to capture your
experiences like never before one camera
has a wide-angle lens for capturing big
scenes and the other has a teller lens
with two times optical zoom so you can
get closer to your subjects without
sacrificing image quality but here's the
coolest part the node a is the first
smartphone ever to have optical image
stabilization in both cameras that means
you get crisp clear shots Eve
when you're on the move let's check out
the difference between the know date and
a smartphone without dual OS just look
at the difference and that's not all
it's not just photos that benefit from
dual OS it's videos too if you think
that's amazing here's something you're
really gonna love we've created a brand
new mode called live focus so you can
get the most out of the note aids dual
camera you know there's beautiful
professional portrait photos where the
background is soft and dreamy and the
foreground is in perfect focus those are
the kinds of pictures live focus will
help you take live focus gives you the
freedom to decide how much your subject
stands out by adjusting the blur and
focus of the background in real time let
me show you first I'm going to need an
assistant Kelly
can you help me out for a second come on
down Kelly is a radio host from LA and a
super note fan Suzanne how you doing
today good
awesome Kelly we're gonna work on your
profile pic okay gonna be epic make sure
you get my good side alright awesome I'm
gonna launch my camera turn on my focus
mode and now since this picture is all
about Kelly I'm gonna turn up the effect
to maximum all right let's see what but
with God that looks great you want to
come see this oh yeah
let's check that out now he is sexy that
is your new profile pic Kelly
I like that everyone give it up for
Kelly
in live focus mode you can adjust the
background blur even after you take in
the picture so if I want to dial it down
they can but this is Kelley's profile
pic I'm gonna dial it back up in live
focus mode the cameras simultaneously
take two pictures so not only do you
have Kelley's new portrait but you have
all the beautiful detail behind it which
includes all of you Kelley's new profile
pic all of you we call this feature dual
capture that means you can capture an
intimate moment without losing the big
picture the no take camera is a tool for
expressing yourself from composing the
perfect portrait to capturing life in
action no matter where you are but an
amazing camera is not the only way you
can express yourself using the no date
the S Pen has always been the heart and
soul of the note series it's what allows
you to be creative and productive it
combines the simplicity of a pen with
the power of the note and you never have
to worry about charging or syncing the
s-pen and now we've made it even better
it has a finer tip and greater pressure
sensitivity to faithfully capture each
stroke and it's paired with the largest
screen we've ever put on a note so now
you have a larger canvas all these
amazing drawings you're seeing coming up
in the screens around me were created
using the S Pen and post it in pen up
the vibrant community DJ talked about
earlier we created pen ups so users
could share their work or browse through
a curated gallery of s-pen art and today
there are over 2.7 million pen up users
globally
and here's my favorite new feature Penna
now has a collection of coloring book
templates designed specifically for the
s-pen the pent-up coloring books are a
great way for me to relax after a long
day working on the note 8 launch today
most of us communicate by texting but a
text message lacks emotion that's why we
find ourselves relying off pictures
emojis and clever punctuation to express
our feelings but now the S Pen adds a
whole new dimension to your
communication by letting you anime what
you write or draw so instead of just
texting a friend to say thank you you
can add a little flavor to your message
a personal touch makes a huge difference
even if you're just scheduling coffee
with a friend so for the note a we
created live message a new feature that
lets you put some sell back in
self-expression with live message you
can animate anything you write or draw
or add personal messages to photos let's
try it out right now
first I need a picture your side of this
audience is gonna give me the most love
can I hear it
these guys over here all right you guys
ready bring your smiles up all right see
perfect looks good so now I'm gonna take
my S Pen out let's get back to that
picture
I'm gonna take my S Pen out click on
live message select that picture that we
just took from my gallery not gonna lie
the sparkle pen is my favorite now this
is saving to an animated standard
animated message format so I can share
this with everyone isn't that cool
there is no telling when you're gonna
need to write down a confirmation number
creative to-do list or jot down a new
idea chances are you're not gonna have a
pen and paper handy hello s pen and
screen off memo screen off memo is one
of the most popular ways to capture and
easily share your ideas and thoughts
since users love the experience so much
we made it even better now when you pin
a to-do list you're always on display
you can also edit it from there with a
simple DoubleTap and that's not all you
can keep writing and writing and writing
for as long as you want Wow
up to a hundred pages all without
turning on your screen the S Pen isn't
just a tool for expressing yourself it's
a way to understand others and the world
around you as well
you can now translate entire sentences
with your S Pen a feature that actually
came in handy the other day I'm going to
Berlin next week and I asked a friend
for a restaurant recommendation but when
she suddenly delink the whole site was
in German with the S Pen I can just
hover over a menu item
and it will translate the entire
sentence for me it even thank you it
even automatically converts units of
measurements and foreign currencies from
the smallest memo to the biggest moments
the note 8 helps simplify your everyday
and power amazing experiences all from a
device that fits in your pocket the node
8 doesn't just change how you interact
with what's on your phone but with your
phone itself and to tell you more please
welcome my colleague John Wong
thank Suzanne I'm thrilled to be here
especially because I got to talk to you
about to my favorite things Bixby and
Samsung decks with the Galaxy s8 and si
plus we launched Bixby a smarter way to
use your phone every year smart phones
get more advanced but tens of thousands
of features and functions and at Samsung
our job is to bring you those
innovations and make it easy to use them
to their full potential Bixby completely
changes your everyday interactions from
voice and vision control to an intuitive
home screen and intelligent reminders it
learns and adapts the way you use your
device not the other way around for
instance with Bixby voice you can speak
your phone naturally using the words and
phrases you use every day today Bixby
voice is available for English speakers
in more than 200 markets around the
world and it's learning and getting
smarter every day there are endless ways
to personalize your bixby experience and
all of them are at your fingertips but
the simple press of the bixby button
take quick commands with quick commands
you can program the Bixby button to
perform complex tasks or responds to a
custom phrase that means just one or two
words you can launch multiple actions at
once it's just super cool let me show
you how it works so I'm a bit of a
foodie so of course I take a lot of food
photos and for me this involves a lot of
steps so that's why I set up my own
quick command but the custom phrase food
photo now instead of having to do all
these steps manually bixby dozen for me
so let me show you I can press the big
sweet button and say
dude photo bixby automatically launches
the camera sets it to food mode snaps
the pic not only does it do that it
opens my gallery and moves my pizza
slice to my foodie album yeah pretty
cool way that way I can actually move
the actual pizza slice in my mouth and
you can customize your own commands the
way you like for example if I wanted to
get artistic I could have Bixby take all
my food photos in black and white now
after all that Pizza getting a little
bit tired I think it's time for bed what
was Bixby I met my entire nighttime
routine to a single phrase so now with a
simple press of the big sweet button I
can just say good night pigs feet
automatically turns it to do not disturb
mode that's my usual 6:00 a.m. alarm and
it turns on the blue light filter really
cool this quick commands
Bixby's giving you an entirely new way
to personalize your mobile experience
and user phone the way you like big feet
is constantly learning new capabilities
we're so proud how far it's come
and so excited for where it's going and
we have great new apps coming on board
all the time thanks to one of our new
partnerships you'll be able to use Bixby
with Spotify to play your favorite music
later this year
and we'll be sharing more exciting news
in October during our Developers
Conference big Street changes away we
interact with our phones but the no date
also redefines what our phones can be
and and how we use them in our daily
lives so let's talk about Dex in March I
told you about this amazing new product
now full disclosure I'm a little
obsessed with Dex it's super cool
because it lets you harness the power of
a galaxy device sending it to a monitor
mouse and keyboard and with Dex we're
creating a world where you can move
seamlessly from your living room to your
office and carry your work and personal
life in your pocket where you can start
to edit a presentation or play a game on
the subway then finish him on a big
screen and we've been working around the
clock to make Dex even better optimizing
the most useful mobile apps for the Dex
environment take one of the most popular
mobile games vainglory
with game launcher on Dex you can put
the graphics in a full-screen immersive
mode and destroy your enemies with a
mouse and keyboard but of course even
though a lot of us like to play games
and relax we still have to get stuff
done so we have a whole ecosystem of
exciting partnerships that will change
the way you work and play so the other
day I was chatting with my colleagues
about how to show these partner apps in
a real life story and one of them said
to me John you are that story see I have
Dex set up at home and at the office and
I'm definitely bit spoiled my daily
commute involves a 20-minute stroll down
New York's famous High Line to the
Samsung office so this is what I travel
with a laptop no bulky bag let's say I'm
on the High Line and
need to talk to Suzanne about our
no-date presentation we've partnered
with zoom to make videoconferencing
completely seamless so I can just open
up the zoom app and start the meeting
with Suzanne and I love this flexibility
where I can be doing this while I'm
strolling down the High Line oh there
she is
hey Suzanne hey I'm just actually
getting back to my desk here so let me
just dock into the deck station what's
great is cuz I started that meeting
while I was walking down the High Line
on my phone when I'm back on my decks
all I have to do is open up the app and
the videoconference is still connected
pretty cool gonna have to rejoin
reconnect so Suzanne I think I owe you
that updated photo of the note 8 but I'd
like your help with that all right so
let me just share you my screen so you
can see what's going on nice so pull up
Adobe Lightroom go to the photo that we
need to edit here alright it's a
good-looking photo but I think it's a
bit dark so let's do a selective edit
and wow what the mouse is actually
really really easy that's cool so
Suzanne I might need your help with
letting me know when the exposure looks
right to you right there perfect and
just to finish it off let me do a little
bit of a crop at the right angle here I
think that's about good I'll save that
Suzanna how does that look awesome
thanks Suzanne which have you later
yeah now do you see why I love using Dex
all the time super simple super easy
with Dex you can work and play better
than ever it's all powered by your phone
we've always believed that the best
products function as part of a larger
connected ecosystem an ecosystem
designed around you with newly optimized
apps that stretched in every corner of
your life and your screen we're making
it even easier to do bigger things for
years we've pioneered groundbreaking new
products like Dex and refined the
fundamental features that have always
set the note series apart and to tell
you more but how we've made those
features even better please welcome back
Justin Dennison
thank you John with the Galaxy series
we've set a new standard for the entire
smartphone industry and that's because
of you these days your note is a movie
screen a camera a notebook and that's
just a new baseline but over and over
again the note series has reset our
expectations with top the line
performance specs in a suite of
extraordinary features these have
continually redefined what we expect
from our mobile devices when it comes to
performance the note 8 is better than
any note we've ever made remember when I
was talking earlier about how powerful
the note 8 is and how it can run
multiple apps simultaneously well it has
a 10 nanometer processor and a full 6
gigs of RAM that's as much as many pcs
out there and of course you keep your
entire life stored on your phone right
and no calls crazy but we don't think
that you should have to delete your
stuff or get a whole new phone when you
run out of space that's why the node 8
has a micro SD card slot yes thank you
and even without the card it's got 64
gigs of storage onboard enough for huge
amounts of music photos and documents or
according to my twelve-year-old about
one week's worth of selfies it's true of
course when you're storing that much
information you need to keep it safe
that's why we embed Knox our defense
grade security into the hardware and
software and that's why we let you
choose how to protect your device we
have a whole menu of advanced biometric
options including fingerprint facial
recognition and the iris scanner which
is our most secure form of biometric
authentication and the one that I use to
maintain some level of privacy in my
household and convenience isn't just
about having a phone that does
everything it's about having a phone
that you can take everywhere we were one
of the first to give you the peace of
mind that comes with ip68 water and dust
resistance with the Noda you don't have
to worry about getting your device or
the S Pen wet or take wireless charging
which eliminates the hassle of plugging
and unplugging your phone samsung has
had wireless charging since the s6 and
fast wireless charging since the note 5
and what about the competition well
let's just say most of them are still
trying to catch up now you can power
through your day and charge the no dates
3300 milliamp hour hour battery quickly
and conveniently where some see the
brand-new note users see the fundamental
features they expect and love new and
improved from the beautiful display to
the powerful s-pen to our
best-performing camera ever this is a
device designed for people who have big
dreams and need a phone to match them
beginning on September 15th the no date
will hit stores and pre-orders will
begin in a matter of days they
you we are excited and thanks to our
partnership with Harmon the note eight
will come with a pair of premium AKG
earphones tuned by them for superior
listening experience now guess what you
can do oh thank you
but wait there's more and guess what you
can do with those earphones that's right
you can plug them in to the standard
earphone jack with the launch of the
note 8 there is so much in the samsung
galaxy to be excited about users love
the s8 in the si+ which we launched in
April they've quickly become to the most
popular Galaxy smartphones ever and
we're proud to add the note a to that
industry-leading portfolio of devices

exciting event coming up in our future

ephah conference where we'll also unveil
some of the newest stars in the Samsung
Galaxy now as much as we love talking
about the note a we're even more excited
to see the amazing things that you'll do

your support thank you

eight we'll take your calls we'll talk
about how you thought about the know
date maybe something you liked the most
some of your reactions there's always
kind of some fun awkward moments in
there too because come on no it's not at
all it's it's a keynote so as the lines
are building up here and we're gonna
take them and we're already getting
calls in right now
Patrick anything that's stuck out to you
from what you saw here today I mean
think the biggest thing is that not to
the note 7 users four hundred and twenty
five dollars off yeah I don't know if
they I don't I don't think they actually
officially set it in the keynote but we
have a report that basically eligible
customers who bought the Galaxy Note
seven will receive a massive discount on
the note eight by trading in their
current phone and remember they have a
record of who had to initially trade in
their note seven for like an S seven at
that time right and or an s7 edge at
that time so they have a record of this
it will be an instant trade-in value
worth up to four hundred twenty-five
dollars or the special offer on samsung
comm we had our man I can't remember
what his name was Joshua who had called
in that saying they oh I got my note
seven right now four hundred twenty five
dollars off of a note eight four
previous and note seven users that were
about three million of those phones
recalled they did again they didn't talk
about but that is killer that is a way
to say we are sorry and we want your cut
you know we want you back to the
customer we got to show you love that's
huge and the thing is it's a great the
phone looks amazing the phone looks
amazing look I mean it this looks like
so you have the redesign of the body but
also what I'll also love about it is you
have those dual cameras and they made a
big deal of the s-pen which I think on
that screen with the way they
we shaped it a little bit I'll be pretty
compelling - yeah absolutely um we
before we get to the calls we will talk
about more we have so much because you
want this show to be about you we're
gonna jump into the first look of the
note a because we're a sight that
happened to get our hands on it earlier
surprise surprise gonna play that first
look so you guys can digest more things
and then we'll come back here and start
talking about what we saw today
remember last year's exploding Galaxy
Note at 7:00
well Samsung hopes to wipe those
memories away with its new phone for
power users the Galaxy Note 8 and it
plans to do that by introducing
top-notch tech and tricks that you can't
do on any other phone using the dual
cameras on the back this is a first for
Samsung and the notes trademark stylus
the note eights - 12 megapixel cameras
have a portrait mode that artfully blurs
the background this isn't new it's on
phones like the iPhone 7 plus but what
is new is that the note 8 goes a step
further and it also saves a wide-angle
version of the image so you get two
shots for the price of one and then
there's the S Pen Stylus which you use
to write draw and navigate around the
note 8 lets you write yourself a note on
the home screen this is called
off-screen memo and you can also pin it
to the home screen without ever
unlocking the phone if you remember this
from the note 7 before it was recalled
what's different is that you can now
make this up to a hundred sheets long
you can also use the stylus to create an
animated gif of a picture or a word that
you can then share with your friends and
any app that supports gifts including
Facebook Messenger and whatsapp look
it's not essential but it's pretty fun
finally if you like using two apps at
the same time say YouTube in Google Maps
then you can ramp up your multitasking
by pairing the two together you start
from the app edge tab on the side of the
screen that's not all that the Galaxy
Note 8 is plying you with it's also got
an 8 megapixel selfie camera with the
usual filters and a high resolution 6.3
inch screen there curving sides with
barely a bezel and Samsung's Bixby voice
assistant that you launched with that
button on the side the whole phone is
water and dust resistant to even the
s-pen there's wireless charging fast
charging through the USBC port a
powerful processor and a headphone jack
that comes with a pair of AKG earbuds in
the box now the Galaxy Note 8 runs
Android new get version 7.1.1
but samsung says it will upgrade it to
the latest version later on all of this
sounds good but the biggest red flag for
the note 8 is that the fingerprint
reader it's just like on the galaxy s 8
to the far edge of the camera array the
note is a big phone which makes this
placement very awkward to the
unpracticed finger on the other hand the
iris scanner on the front is another
alternative if you own the note 7 which
was a really beautiful phone then the
note 8 looks and feels very familiar but
the battery on this model is actually
smaller which is good if it makes the
Note 8
susceptible to exploding however apart
from the addition of a second camera on
the back and this year's new stylus
tricks the note 8 doesn't seem to push
too many boundaries especially compared
to the Galaxy s8 and si+ but from what
we've seen so far it has all the
ingredients to be Samsung's most
powerful capable phone for 2017
I'm so chill right now
that song so chill I like that great job
on our video team and Jessica great job
on that video so that's just kind of a
look at the note 8 what we are gonna do
is let you I'm gonna calls you and I
Patrick will talk about a few other
things but uh let's cross our fingers
I'm sure this call thing is gonna work
again I'm gonna throw out to Chris come
into si is it Chris Morales yeah what's
up man welcome to the show welcome to
seeing it live you know I want to jump
in with you what did you think of the
keynote that you just saw today oh my
guy whose mind blowing I've been a fan
since the note 4 and what I just saw was
unbelievable that's awesome what was the
feature kind of that stuck out to you
the most that you're like this is the
first thing I want to do with my no date
the camera and s-pen I used the s-pen a
lot for memos and Erica that's what I
was going in earlier for because I was
really hoping for a speaker or some type
of dictation for the s p-- and
unfortunately announced and doesn't have
that feature but the S pen's pressure
sensitivity and that's a finer point
that's gonna be awesome yeah I mean I'm
just a I'm honestly just a fan I don't
obviously have a note product at all I
never have but I love the fact we're
just whipping out your phone and be able
to write notes right on the screen as if
it was a piece of paper like I would add
something I would actually do without
unlocking the screen I think that I
think that I know it was with the note 7
but that's kind of like the hot actual
practical feature that I loved about it
as well that's great so you're pumped up
you're gonna get one of these bad boys
oh definitely I'm waiting for my company
to release them so that way you're smart
you're smart man going through the
company yeah that's what you got to do
it man that's how we do it all right hey
Chris thanks so much for calling we
appreciate it
all right thank you cool thank you
he's a smart one all right let's go
check out Trevor
who's talking to us about the note 8
Trevor what's going on oh I'm doing well
I'm from Canada and I have a note
I had a note 7 as well and I loved it
and I gave it up grudgingly wasn't
terribly happy about that
i and i'm using the s7 edge right now
I'm really really looking forward to
like the size of the screen I've played
with I actually work for a cell phone
company where we sell them to a retailer
so I played with the s8 plus and the s8
and I love the screen and I'm waiting to
see what the screen on this looks like
in my hand yeah that's a plus is it's
not that much smaller than or the nose a
it's not much bigger than the si plus
which is really exciting I mean there's
the body yeah yeah and the the s-pen I
really loved it cuz I've always used it
for drawing and things like that and
when they had dias the note 7 I actually
created a few gifs with it and actually
start doing that again I'm looking
forward to that you were kind of like
teased by the note 7 right you certainly
do from around with all this cool stuff
they had and then they took it from your
hands because the they had to say you're
ready to jump back on did you hear about
what we talked about right after the
show ended about the $425 discount for
note 7 owners to the note 8 did you hear
about that I I did hear about that now
does that mean you have to buy it
outright or is this because I want it on
plan I'm not gonna pay outright for
anything I don't know the specifics for
that they just basically are referring
people to samsung's website right now -
obviously they have been able to track
by serial number and who you were who
had the note 7 so we just know that this
offers going out we haven't been able to
dig into the details but if we can find
that out later within this you know
we're gonna be on here for about another
10 15 minutes we'll let you know but it
might be something that at least
obviously you can kind of dig and maybe
you can find out for us but at the
moment we don't know yeah I just seen
that right now if you want to read it no
I'm looking forward to that I'm gonna be
asking all kinds of questions from my
from my work when I go into work
tomorrow
alright hey thanks so much from Canada
Trevor we appreciate it okay thank you
alright let's jump in here I don't have
a name for this color so there's gonna
have to start talking and we're gonna
see who's there welcome to the show this
is Brian and Patrick from Cena alive
see I can hear the show what's up hey
turn your turn your actual video down
and talk to us to the phone and then
we'll be good to go we were with a
camera because watching the week they
were mostly talking about regular camera
and a photo lens with you know color
court once with Sassoon and watching
that there's gonna be a wide-angle lens
so maybe not the part I was not
expecting that nice so you're a happy
camper aren't you
very cool all right awesome well hey
thanks so much for calling we appreciate
it thanks for the call from all the way
in Puerto Rico my man all right cool
thank you how did you hear that last
phrase says he's thinking about me the 1
plus coz that's it they get the one plus
five with a dual cameras similar to the
iPhone with the zoom and the portrait
mode a lot about half the price of this
thing now it doesn't have the s-pen it's
a lot smaller screen there's so many
caveats but at the same time I think I
think the price is it's respect will see
that probably where things are moving in
the industry however how many people are
gonna pony up that you know grand or
just under a grand for that I also think
though you know the note 8 has never
tried to be a phone for everyone right
it's like literally to me it's more of a
power user and if you love that stylist
action you're gonna get it and it was
the the phone to get with that type of
functionality right like they although
it may not sell nearly as many units as
an s8 or an SI plus it nailed that whole
stylus phablet phone form factor and
functionality so I mean it doesn't look
like it's gonna lose its spot any
anymore you know even though they have
that whole debacle and even at the time
people
I mean Samsung was really embarrassed I
think people forget that Samsung the
company is integrated into Korean
culture like they own grocery stores
hospitals like it's part of the culture
so that was like really a black eye to
just them as a country because of how
integrated Samsung is and so you know
more than anything as a tech fans
although we can like laugh about like
the phones exploding like I want to see
these companies succeed right I want to
see great stuff it pushes other
companies to do better things we'll see
what happens with the iPhones cameras if
they will both have optical image
stabilization I my hunch is probably
right but again I don't want to see
phones like not succeed it doesn't it
doesn't help us and also it gives us
more great stuff to cover quite well
it's you know I think it's also how a
company reacts to something like that
you know you want to feel like they're
being genuine and they're being honest
even if the date was great and they
hadn't been genuine but it's combining
that it's giving that deal to the people
who born 25 now these days you could buy
another half a phone half a phone yeah
half a phone a phone with get a lot of
best pens a lot of excess pens all right
let's go get a few more calls before we
wrap up here just want to get all of
your thoughts opinions we have a lot of
happy campers that have called in I'm
gonna go here if this if this name picks
up properly it looks like general Turner
from going from note 7 to note 8 general
Turner are you there yes regarding the
note 7 and then note my son had in note
7 it gave him no problems but his
carrier told him it's best for him to
turn it in yep he turned it in they gave
him another phone I believe it was
another note 7 which was a total screwup
so he had to revert back to his note 5
and sir
um I'm wondering he should be eligible
for that discount absolutely he should
be we I don't we have an article posted
but other than the announcement of the
425 through a special offer on samsung
comm again because you were linked to
that phone by its serial number there's
going to be some record of it whether so
you're a carrier but I we don't know the
specifics other than going to check out
that offer on Samsung comm how that
plays out even the relationship with the
carrier how does that happen
payment wise how does that happen I mean
this just got announced unfortunately so
uh well we'll see if we can get a
breakdown of that but you know the good
thing is that was I don't see why he
wouldn't be eligible for that it's for
anyone who was a note 7 customer so I
think you guys are in the clear for sure
I know he was happy with his note 7 and
the one that he had didn't give him any
problems but when he had to exchange it
I believe for another note 7 that they
said was should have been better
that's when is it started heating up he
was having issues with it the apps
weren't running correctly and then they
told him to bring it back in and he just
went back to his note 5 yeah I think you
know what a good thing that you can do
here is that one of the things that we
had found out about the actual battery
inside the note 8 is it's slightly
smaller capacity the note 7 battery was
a 3500 milliamp hour battery this one is
3300 so there's a little less juice in
it but that also is probably gonna
that's probably done deliberately for
that for that purpose so I think the
smart thing to do is if you're unsure
and you feel like you know you had a bad
experience just wait a month or so it's
not like there's a huge rush to get it
right now unless you know you're a tech
fiend like some of us are just wait it
out and see what ends up happening over
the course of you know a month or two of
how these phones are performing and then
you know then you can pull the trigger
for your son but I don't have you know I
couldn't understand why people are not
in a rush to get it but ultimately I
think it's gonna be ok this time around
we saw we didn't see any battery issues
with the s8 or Si plus you know anything
significant that was widespread thing
well I'm I'm a tech person and I love
gadgets
no Samsung does make a number of various
electronic items from refrigerators to
phones they're good all right man hey
thanks so much for calling in we
appreciate it all right now
all right cool thank you and he's a good
thing like I think we'll help you forget
there was actually not one but two
recalls yes the second one I mean so and
I think I don't know there's gonna be a
time when we don't talk about it all the
time but I think you have to talk about
it today for now up at the same time
just looking at that phone that was
shown on that crazy state that state
first of all yo look out you know it's
like Celine Dion the Vegas stage you
know feeling that stage I mean crazy
that stage is like might be the
highlight of the show that was insane
Stan you everything about the phone no
but the phone itself I mean despite all
those other things that happen with the
note 7 that was a really great phone and
the fact that they were able to iterate
on that again that newer body the dual
cameras the updates to not only insane
amount of performance of the 35 then the
6 gigabyte ram but also the software
updates I don't think I think it some
people were quite saying if it would
have Android or REO out of the box which
that seems like a long stretch because
it was just announced and we know that
unless you're a pure basically give your
the pixel phone it's gonna take time to
get the Android update yeah it's just
the way it is I mean they just put out
there are ways for people that have some
of the phones are supported the pixel I
think the next six six P and the I'm not
sure if they the 5x is probably part of
that as well typically they are that can
actually upgrade to Oreo right now so
there are ways to do it like to get
directly to the file to the to the disk
image to do it so um you know that that
that is out there all right we're gonna
take a couple more called the lines are
still completely full we just want to
say thank you so much for everyone that
is watching and hanging out with this
it's funny because for the first time we
do a lot of these keynotes and a lot of
times after we do Apple keynotes it's
like people are cathartic Li like
venting about how frustrated they are
right beat yeah is it true totally
opposite right now
dey's example are like happy you know so
I think that's a great thing for Samsung
like it speaks to just the general mood
everyone that is called pinup guys yeah
pinup pan up hey feel black but people
are concerned I mean there are conducted
last guy that just called he's concerned
about his son's photo so there is little
you know there's little thing in the
back of everyone's mind still it's like
for example you know apples own
situation was antenna gate you still
will always kind of here yeah about
antenna gate it's kind of one of those
traumatic experiences that Apple
customers had the note 7 is a traumatic
experience that Samsung customers have
you'll you always hear it kind of you
know and then obviously we have beef
between both sides because you can't
like someone because they have a
different phone than you these days
[Laughter]
those phones were exploding no but this
because you have other companies outside
of tech like Chipotle I think of them
like it exactly right it's always gonna
be there that like crap I could get some
sort of get the poop I get some get some
big poop well you always get poopers at
Chipotle
[Laughter]
but anyway it's always gonna be kind of
with that and how did they evolve past
that and they they did a great great job
I'm glad they did not reference the
Eclipse at all I think glad they didn't
do that their website does their website
doesn't okay I would say otherwise I
would say perhaps they created a little
eclipse of their own today by eclipsing
the note 7 so it's insane to do it you
did alright now let's get a free bar
call this night 914 and we're gonna
stick around for 10 more minutes to get
through a few more because you guys have
all been patiently calling in we love it
so we don't have a name for this color
here but um I think they we have a kind
of like a assistant that transcribes
what they say but welcome to the show
you're on scene alive just start talking
and you'll know if you're talking to us
what up cliff welcome to the show
welcome to seeing it live tell us what
what are you feeling after this whole no
date event I love
absolutely awesome I'm loving it I'm
trying to preorder the thing about it is
I just want to know from Patrick because
we said earlier that the phone is
slightly bigger I want to know is it in
is it in the left to right is it that
much bigger well we know this wider the
screen is 6.3 inches versus last year's
was 5.7 inches I think the body of it is
roughly the same size as it was last
year so that's gonna be the big thing
but also if you look how they integrated
that bigger screen in the s7 excuse me
the s8 and the SI plus how the actual s8
is physically smaller than the s7 was so
it'll be interesting I haven't actually
physically had my hands on the note 8 so
that's gonna be something but this in
pictures and looking at the dimensions
it could be about the same size as the
note 7 but you get that much bigger
screen or almost a half an inch bigger
yeah the the the big thing right because
we have these edge to edge displays
pioneered by Samsung because guess what
they have their own OLED factories in
fact Samsung is supplying the majority
of OLED screens for Apple's next iPhone
but what you have is remember we have
these big bezels that used to be on the
phone these black edges that had no
screen on them whatsoever they're
extending the screen all the way so it's
like a thin line so you're able to keep
that similar form factor but get more
screen I mean that's that is the the
heute the big trend in phone design
across the board across the industry
keep them around the same size but give
you like half an inch more of screen I
mean I'm down with that I don't know
about you so that's why we say it okay I
mean I just want to know is it you know
my thing is the wideness because the s8
was awesome but I picked it up and it
was so now the skinny it was more longer
and I was just concerned was this Note 8
going to be a little wider as opposed to
bigger from top to bottom it's longer
yeah it will be wider without a doubt I
mean I have a personal question are you
worried about how this fits in your
skinny jeans
looking at when I'm looking at a
landscape I'd rather for it to be you
know wider if you hold it straight up
while from left to right as far as long
because it looked like sorry to say does
it look like a candy bar very good all
right well hey thanks so much for
calling and Chris we appreciate it okay
thank you all right hilarious it doesn't
mean and that's like that optical
illusion and they even talk about that
display being like that weird ratio like
15 yeah you wouldn't point five or
something like that and I think the
thing that it's kind of frustrating is
right with certain videos you're
watching it it come because it was so
narrow it complete big black bars on the
side yeah that's gonna like that's kind
of a pain in the butt
alright let's go over to our man it
looks like his name is Dylan Dylan
calling about the no date event what's
up Dylan can you hear us okay yeah man
what's up welcome to the show welcome to
see that live we're doing great here how
about yourself yeah drop it on us what
do you want to talk about that was
really underwhelming really yeah what
were you expecting really impressed at
all what were you expecting personally I
mean I'm just everyone there's a great
thing about this everyone has their own
take so what was kind of I guess did you
have a certain expectation or where you
out with that three GS so I mean take
that was how you will but um after the
whole note 7 debacle I was really
expecting them that to come out swinging
and they just had a headphone jack
you know what Dylan I think you make a
great point but at the same time I also
think that the note 8 job this time
around was just to basically show off
this is still gonna be a solid and have
a few of you know maybe a new feature
allow the cameras and I know that you're
saying guess what the iPhone is probably
gonna have dual iOS I'm opting oh is in
it as well but I think you know for
first Samsung Note users you have a
like kind of many industries a specific
loyal following that you have to satisfy
you also have to kind of show the tech
world as a whole that you're making a
quality product again and I don't think
they're gonna have a problem with that
so I would probably guess you would see
note 9 take another leap but then also
like bro I'm an iPhone user like you I'm
an Apple user who has a lot of Apple
stuff I mean if you're looking for
things to like kind of take that next
leap or jump I mean you know that the
iPhone is gonna have everything that all
these other phones are that have to I
don't know if I have I phones gonna make
necessarily a big leap over others other
than play catch-up with like design with
the OLED screen so I mean what do you
expect from the iPhone if the no date
kind of like let you know this is the
most feature packed phone out there well
I mean to be honest if they don't do
wireless charging at this time around
they kind of be kind of they're gonna
let a lot of people down because I mean
it's honestly the Samsung wireless
charging in the quick charging stuff
that's if Apple doesn't do that they're
really uh really losing out on a lot of
possibly brand new customers and I don't
know the the dual the dual what is it
optical image stabilization that was
cool if they don't if they don't come
out swinging with that then then they're
gonna lose them again but at the same
time I'm fine with the screen I have a
seven plus yeah baby fine with me I'm
not really I'm not really too concerned
with I mean OLED screen would be cool
but they're already reports saying that
the phone's going to be what twelve
hundred bucks or whatever maybe mean I
mean we'll see
it's announced right you guys think
about that too but I mean I don't know
the the mock-ups that they've been
putting on that all the big tech
youtubers have had I'm not real too
pleased with that cut out at the top but
I guess we're gonna wait and see what it
looks like and get in our hand yeah I
think I you don't I don't know if the
cutouts gonna be that big of a deal long
term because also there with with the
way that they'll show some of the other
utilities like the cell signal the Wi-Fi
signal it's gonna become a consistent
black bar across the top most of the
time so I don't I don't think it's gonna
be I was just using the central phone
yes shut out with a knock and it looked
horrible when I saw it like being
presented at that conference or the
summer but in person it's des stunning
like you don't even realize the notch is
there because the way the software goes
around it and I'm sure being knowing
Apple like they're gonna that's one of
the things they would have to address
right away is how they would do that and
in there if any of those mock-ups are at
all reflective of what the actual
product is the notch Athene thinks looks
a little bit better in their mock-ups
than the mock-up I saw of the essential
yeah but yeah in person
look pretty phenomenal so awesome all
right hey Dylan thanks so much for
calling you but you better call us back
on the application yeah I want to hear
if you're blown away or not when the
applique no comes around okay bro I got
a update so basically our last color
before this one was asking about how
wide it is so the Galaxy Note seven was
two point nine inches wide the Galaxy
Note is two point nine inches wide name
is exactly gonna be the same yes very
good toy though it's about half an inch
taller though so growing up 4/10 of an
inch growing up it's going up all right
we're gonna take two more calls and we
gotta we honestly we have to actually do
other work believe it or not we can't
just come on Beach I want to be here all
day I'm here all day yeah pretty nice
room pretty much is all right let's go
over here and talk to Mike Mike has
given us a call at he ropes hold on one
second Mike let me get you in here here
we go Mike what's up welcome to the show
are we going good good if you turn down
the volume on your computer then our
just talk to us directly at the phone
it'll be like a real-time conversation
gotcha all right Mike welcome to the
show what do you want to talk about
today nothing I just see the phone in
person and then you know I was really
really interested to see what Samsung
was going to come back with the note 7
users cuz I actually unfortunately I was
one of them so you know unfortunately I
you know the next-best phone to me you
know I went to Apple unfortunately
I don't have anything against that but
you know I've had the best of both
worlds Samsung and Apple but uh I was
really really blown away by the no date
unboxing it was it was nice so does that
mean you're gonna be jumping back I mean
where do you stand with this because now
you're back to back yeah you know like I
remember right when people first said oh
it's a lightning pour like first there
was a large group up here like oh my
gosh and typically it was people that
actually weren't Apple users that were
first making fun of it and then as I
feel like as Apple users started
realizing this is really damn annoying
then they started getting annoyed with
it and then you have the this kind of
group of ëletís within the Apple
ëletís that'll say one person just ya
know they're like the 0.0 0.1 percent
that are like hey let's just buy air
pods I'm like are you kidding me like I
own I own but yes I do I do have them
for for review purposes ladies and
gentlemen but no it's annoying there's
still so many times like he has to his
point exactly I actually don't like
using Bluetooth in my car it doesn't
sound as clean I like the best sounding
audio and there's plenty of times where
I'm like in a car rental or I'm on the
go and I can't use an auxilary cable I
just can't it is weird that bother me do
you absolutely cable with all the
technology all these phones have how
something so simple can still drive that
decision absolutely so mica we're
expecting you to be in line for no date
is that what I can understand I mean I
heard about the 425 is that is that just
for people that went back to Samsung or
that for all users that had the note 7 I
I mean you know the thing about it is I
there was no specification as if you
stayed within the Samsung family right
meaning you bought an s7 edge
right as you had to return it there was
kind of like an even out program with a
different type of Samsung phone that we
again we don't even have the specifics
on it all they've been pointing people
to do is to go to Samsung coms website
so I would just say locked in whether
it's that seen under other sites to find
out exactly where we can find those
specifics because no one really at this
point in time because we're just out of
the keynote has the exact specifics so
you bought a note seven so you're in the
system but I don't know if that
qualifies you're not I would honestly I
would think so because you had to return
it even if you bought a different phone
after that so we'll just sit down you
know I mean you said you work for
Verizon so I say yeah they get together
you know so we gotta hook it up for you
I'm gonna go make a trip when I got that
a recall notice and how did the I I
didn't return my note seven right away I
didn't want to give it back I loved
everything about it so I was like and
then you know Rhys was like you don't
turn back seriously also forget it
there was as many it was pretty I'm not
a big fan and I think look if you're
again I've always felt a note is a
specific product to specific user like
if you want to note you don't want a
phone that doesn't have a stylus so and
I think I forget that like there's so
many people who did not have issues with
their note sevens and that was the
that's the part of it where yeah you
have this thing that's potentially
dangerous and they had to be taken away
but so many people have such great
experiences with that and to come out
with a no date which looks like it's got
to be able to do all that and more and
in a much sleeker looking design and
more equipped cameras and faster
performance a better s-pen and a lot of
people they need to be like answering
phone calls like old time you're like
Andy Griffith be like hey no hey no time
baby you know it's dropping on the note
nine they're gonna do it oh yeah yeah
yeah we talked about it we want we want
to
spen karaoke like I want I will I will
you know what I'll buy I'll buy don't
care if there's no nine with that would
be s-pen carry okay oh we're totally
doing that we're totally doing that
s-pen okay okay all right hey but
Bueller Mike thanks so much for calm bro
we appreciate it thank you awesome so I
think yeah what does it say - is so well
another thing in the video that our
reviewer talked about was the placement
of the fingerprints and so on the this
is the s 8 plus and you can see that we
have the camera go you can see we have
the camera here in the middle
yeah and either side you have the flash
and the fingerprint sensor it looks like
on the know date that the they put the
flash unit in between the finger and
sensor and the camera ID not to say
that's not gonna prove you still not
gonna be touching that camera your
finger but hopefully that will does help
minimize some of the smudging less
smudgy
let's not new less smudgy design has
smugly Flash's nuts which is OK right
over the see it will diffuse it'll be
okay like soap opera look so um anyways
