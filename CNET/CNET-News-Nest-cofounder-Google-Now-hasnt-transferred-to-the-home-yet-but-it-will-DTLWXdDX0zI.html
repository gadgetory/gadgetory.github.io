what return things and today's special
very early I would say there's been a
promise moving a lot of a 4 e's my
connotation and having your home sorry
that's one mile 11 how do your own take
care of you as opposed to having to
basically the IT staff or how for this
again this is really early days I hope
that all of us kind of the chair our
products build more great things that
you start to see more violence start to
see the products as a skull it's very
early there's a lot of great technology
revise their home again throughout your
life but a lot it's not very
approachable and a lot of Kentucky or
just understand how it works so we try
to approach work we just make it really
obvious and decide well but again might
derive of experience do you have in her
hand it's an easy transition to material
you're using this great experience from
palm of your hand watch it your home you
deserve my butt likes things done such
as really smaller town there's
patient express it's a nightmare what
lessons are allowed but that's a
statement using a long time and in fact
there may actually different be standard
because they're getting their 20 pick it
it's really hard as a device main factor
anything we do so i think the lettuce is
gonna come through shrimp less and this
is a lot like Wi-Fi 15 years ago
ethernet 15 years ago there's a lot of
different ways can't comprises whichever
one has the most momentum that should be
able to bring up is with them so i think
again I'm not work this is not a it's
not a problem this is the early days
like they kept this was five years from
now the disaster actually but I still
very early that there's not a lot of
popular smart devices something that's
completely okay that's it little bottom
exams today I don't we don't have a big
problem like there's a lot of smart
devices so there's a lot of example
things like or leave it now at your
house makes total sense never mind the
backing day we have these internet
portals like putting on that comment it
would serve all your dreams that doesn't
happen anymore
there's a lot of best fits if you want
to go to the coral exactly or equal
gmail if you're avail if you want to
introduce from someone's you don't go to
work then one stop shop anymore that
said there's all the other services that
they're not later now like Google down
where you don't need to actually check
your calendar to the medication say hu
with the airport know that experience
has a transfer to the home yet but I
think on the next few years ago like
this is a very very long road look at
the Internet as a whole life the 90s
video small communities not mainstream
like late 90s charting of a broader with
for some commerce opportunities those
kind of things but it really was until
like this last decade where it was
really the intercon make this is a very
very longer he had a short memory then
how long things take the top of the
scribble on tawa this is going to play
it very poorly across the street because
it again there's no regulations hello
reside privacy general I just didn't
have things but in general I can go to
website type in your lawyer the password
remain kind of nation there's private
estates or a lot of interaction right
right good this is a general problem
that's not just relate this morning that
said this is victor it's the most
obvious answer is the writings in
consumer today I have when you click my
data to leave my stuff the owner so our
community that's it there's a lot of
other organizations that date I didn't
want to get out
advertising reasons or installing stuff
to cross retention upsell and it's up to
class like us to make sure that the
semantics and we keep the consumer's
rights I get plenty for hugging the
privacy and making sure that we're doing
right there it's pretty obvious place</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
