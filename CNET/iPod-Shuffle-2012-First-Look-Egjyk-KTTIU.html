to get music into your ears hey I'm
Donald Bell and I'm here to show you the
Apple iPod shuffle now this is the same
iPod shuffle that's been around for
years more or less the same design and
that same $49 price it gives you two
gigabytes of storage the controls here
are really pretty basic there's a
play/pause button on the front the big
button right on the front then you get
your volume controls on the top and
bottom and your track skip controls you
also get a headphone jack up here on the
top along with that power button and
that voiceover button which you can push
to have the iPod shuffle announce in a
synthetic voice what song you're
listening to you can even press and hold
that button and actually navigate
between different playlists or
audiobooks black mud the Black Keys so
you get a little more flexibility than
you had with the original iPod shuffle
which just took all of your music all of
your stuff and shuffled it up and you
really had no idea necessarily what you
were listening to now I've got that
ability on the back here you've got the
metal clip that is kind of the hallmark
of the iPod shuffle design and that's
all there is to it for better or for
worse
so what's the downside well for $49
you're getting a very small mp3 player
but you're also getting some annoyances
you're getting the super small little
USB adapter for charging that plugs into
the headphone jack expect that you're
going to lose this you're getting the
standard old iPod headphones that have
been around for years you're gonna want
to upgrade these the other thing is I
don't know an iPod shuffle owner who
hasn't misplaced one of these from time
to time or accidentally run one through
the washer now for the same amount of
money you could buy if you if you didn't
really care about the stylishness of the
mp3 player or being super super small
you could get something like the sans
that clip zip from SanDisk
this things around that same $50 price
maybe it was cheaper if you shop around
you get twice the storage you get that
same clip-on design but you also get
features like radio you get a built in
screen here so you can actually see what
you're listening to and do navigation
that doesn't involve a synthetic voice
in your head it sounded weird but that's
what I meant
still I can't blame me for going for the
smaller lighter more fashionable option
here with the iPod shuffle at
$49.00 you're still getting a lot of mp3
player for your money so there you go
that is the Apple iPod shuffle a small
light ultra portable way to take your
music with you
