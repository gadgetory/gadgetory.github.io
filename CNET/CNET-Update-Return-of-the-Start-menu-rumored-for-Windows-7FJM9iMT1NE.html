come true I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your sunat update the start menu could
be returning to Windows a report from
windows journalist Paul Thurrott
suggests that Microsoft will bring back
the start menu in the next update to
Windows and it might also let Metro tile
apps run on the desktop version which
means windows can go back to being a
little more windows II but if true it'll
be several months before we see a
Windows 8.1 update some reports say it
may not happen till 2015 Google doesn't
need special street view camera cars to
update its Maps it can use your photos
Google is leading you upload your own
street view panorama photos to create
your own tour of an area to do so you'll
need to use an android phone to make a
photo sphere it's a 360 degree panorama
photo and from the photo gallery you can
tap share to add it to maps and it'll be
geotagged this can also be done with
photos taken with a digital SLR camera
it'll it Google expand Street View to
hard-to-reach places like ancient
castles or hiking trails Google's

cooler it added a few more video apps
