the CNET studios we're doing a special
pre-taped edition of the 359 podcast
because as you very well know by now we
are still on hiatus I wanted to give you
a couple of little we're not really
hearing so much has changed in the last
three weeks now I feel so I'm so much
more matured as a person finally got
hoverboards man what a crazy three weeks
it's been so Alfred Roger we we have
something special in store today to kind
of fill the gap in yeah well sort of in
an honor of coming comic-con which kicks
off especially tomorrow and which I will
be at tomorrow which is why I'm not here
or am i I don't know we're gonna be
talking about I'm travel is hard you
know we're going to be talking about
upcoming anime our live-action
adaptations of classic anime and whether
or not this is a good or bad thing and
yep it should be abolished well if
you've watched a band real anime if you
watch the Dragon Ball the live-action
take on Dragon Ball yeah you can make
the argument and with that I cannot play
through the whole damn thing why so bad
because it's just I want to see how bad
it would get and it did not disappoint
in terms of how terrible it the
escalation of terribleness for that
movie just kept going and yeah yeah yeah
alright so wait I want to kill like a
thousand birds with one stone here you
say that was bad it's pretty objectively
bad we know this but for everybody out
there actually watching this as it
publishes on Wednesday the 19th put your
lists down below in the comments or
however you want or tweet at us or
something like that rank your favorite
live-action if you want to rank it who's
the worst the best or the worst to the
least worst or whatever we're curious
and maybe if we're lucky we can actually
turn that into like a top 5 a tie as or
something like that we can we could use
some new ideas but yeah let us know what
you think as we tell you what we think I
think Ninja Turtles is probably the
worst way come on dude favorite anime
right
off to a terrible start I'm gonna kill
him I'm gonna absolutely kill him but I
was looking at this site there's Fist of
the North Star I forgot about that one
there was a live-action adaptation of
this with the North Star wait wait uh
totally serious question was that Jackie
Chan or something no no it was played by
a white guy oh god of course it was
course it wasn't Jackie Chan what am I
thinking of I'm thinking of like no I'm
thinking of a different like a gas
station on Eternia line wheel City
Hunter was a live-action when did that
come out looking at this picture a long
time ago oh oh but real early in
Jackie's career oh yeah yeah huh
I'm just looking at this list what
Dragonball Evolution is up there alright
so yeah let's let's get back into
actually your organized thoughts before
he just start rambling on yeah sorry so
we brought the discussion was brought on
by the announcement that Cowboy Bebop
was getting a live-action treatment in a
TV series form that's coming they don't
realize the date yet okay but there's no
network no yeah and and we just got the
the trailer few weeks back on Death Note
the the Netflix movie that's coming up
in the fall does not look bad actually
watch the trailer good
yeah I mean it's coming from great
source materials yes and Willem Dafoe is
the perfect voice for yeah kind of
creepy yeah I mean so he's wonderful
he's kind of he's a creepy creature
pretty much the Green Goblin in that
voice yeah yeah it's pretty much been
Goblin and they got the monster kind of
right yeah look he looked a lot like Dan
at like I was really worried that they
were going to try to westernize a lot of
the aspects of it like the name of the
killer whitewash it yeah as they tend to
do that's my fancy that that's my
live-action versions I don't have a
problem if they stick to the source
material if it's like a really good
story which Death Note is like the the
the plot lines all the characters are
like really cool like and you know they
stuck to it you guys watch you guys read
through the entire storyline I'm reading
or watch those yeah alright I thought
frankly it kind of Rast even halfway
through one when
what's-his-name died
l L what L died yeah yeah spoilers sorry
oops
it's been years years old I mean and I
don't know how they're gonna make that
work in the movie like I mean no
honestly it'll probably end at that cuz
like I don't see them doing like the
whole like every single arc right right
cuz it goes on for why I like it yeah
and then introduction of new protagonist
I don't see them doing the whole thing
but yeah I don't know I thought I
thought that as classic as that story as
I thought it and banding was pretty good
I just thought it kind of like that
second half was a little yeah honestly
I'll probably end it at at that point
and then make a sequel yeah they make
some more money that way make more money
is easier a tell a story that way that's
why when you mentioned that they're like
Lionsgate is interested in making like a
Naruto kind of live-action version
I I thought I think of all the story
hearts in that I'm like they're either
gonna condense it like snow heart
probably there's gonna make multiple
movies no they're gonna do their own
thing like I feel like that story is so
confident now but like you can imagine
the producers in America are just going
to strip it down yeah all right it's kid
ninjas yeah that's basically and they've
got special powers they're like x-men
but ninjas ninjas that's what you don't
even look like ninjas that's my problem
with like live-action like adaptations
though is that like they're just like
alright how can we make this like
digestible for everybody instead of
sticking it to like the source material
yeah kind of thing inherently I mean it
goes after sort of niche yeah although
very popular they did that with like
ghost in the shell' where instead of
like sticking to the original movie
that's what made it so popular it was
essentially they took like ghost in the
shell' the movie ghost in the shell' the
TV series bright ghost in the shell'
like the follow-up like the spin-off
movies like yeah it was just let's just
make this like some kind of terrible
meatloaf movie where we all just put it
in one thing when you said meatloaf
movie I for a second was picturing
meatloaf in the movie which you probably
know what made it better but I mean look
at a lot of the legacy stuff that's
going on these days you reference Ninja
Turtles earlier and just but right now
they have that cartoon series on
Nickelodeon that's apparently coming to
a close as well as a new comic book
series from idw publishing and maybe the
exact same thing they picked from
maraj publishing all the way to the
syndicated archie comics holden elements
from the original cartoon and then like
little dashes of bones i'm not talking
about the movies those don't count I'm
talking about the current comics and the
current cartoon series that are actually
weekly I mean I think from pretty much
everything can't even do that bad stuff
just to like give you a little wink and
a nod I think it's possible to do it
that I just think that like serious
movie producers and you know filmmakers
aren't making anime movies the same way
that like serious movie producers are
making them for like comic adaptations
like you take a look at Mogan which is
like supposed to be based off of old man
Logan now it's not it's supposed to be
though the ideas like I took the idea to
15 is old now yeah that's it yeah but
the idea that exactly like it derived so
far from it but they still made an
amazing movie out of it that's
essentially be its own thing you know
that's essentially what I want out of
like live-action like anime adaptation
you take something and then you like you
don't have to stick to it like
completely but at least make it like a
very good movie to watch as a standalone
yeah or so would that be possible with
something like Naruto I think it would
be like if Marvel can do it so like
frequently where they can make all these
movies like based off of there like
hordes of comics that they have I like
oh but I would argue with Marvel it was
sort of baby steps right like the first
like Iron Man was pretty realistic right
like besides the fact that there's a
good high tech piece of armor but like
things were grounded for a little while
and then they started like amp it up
like oh now we're going to introduce the
Norse God and we're gonna introduce
yo magic like it was it got to a point
where like oh now we're gonna throw out
guardians of the galaxy and we're so
successful you guys are gonna watch it
because that's or how it worked but they
all like inception Doctor Strange they
built that foundation before they went
really weird right so it's it's hard for
anime cuz it's well each one is its own
franchise like where do you would you
wear that spectrum do you go do you
start with like an Ironman where
everything's kinda door do you go all
weird like guardians of galaxies and
just sort of hope that people buy into
it
I mean I feel like
cowboy bebop could actually be like a
guardians of the galaxy I kind of roll I
mean not like heist II kind of Western
II thing works but still that's a risk
and a franchise it's not as familiar it
audience did kind of piggyback off of
the familiarity and recognition of just
Marvel people now know and trust Marvel
as a movie studio people who've never
even consider them as comic book
publishers now I just don't like a
Marvel movie yeah that's how fighting in
the galaxy could get away they could
never have like come out the gate with
that I don't believe that that's I guess
that's Mike watches like Wanda's Marvel
does Marvel success with weird movies
like gardens of the galaxy open the door
to cowboy bebop or is it just its own
thing like when it comes out people are
gonna be like I don't know what this is
this is weird I want to watch it I think
it definitely there's no air forces but
there's no Marvel branding behind it
it's a hard thing to think about because
from day one that was kind of a cult hit
yeah it did open up a lot of doors for
Eastern entertainers lutely absolutely
but it's like anime oh yeah it's still
very congealed concise yeah it's it's
not a mass-market thing this is gonna be
an interesting venture to see I'm
cautiously optimistic still I know
they're Hollywood has been trying to
make Robotech movie for many many years
I just want to see a tech hero Akira's
what a live-action accurate he's
threatened it so many times it hasn't
happened I mean I think it's keep it
keeps falling apart or people keep
leaving but yeah they've been multiple
people who've tried to make that movie
last person I heard attached to it was
Jordan Peele
from get out really yeah kira-kira
I know how much merit could be put
behind that that's just something I read
out in the Internet ether so I don't
want to like propagate rumors that are
let me just fit very well back to my
show and actually I could see very good
or as long as it's like a good
storyteller behind like you know the
camera I have no problem with it right
this that's yeah just taking adaptation
and put like your vision on it and make
it like not cheesy as hell but I mean
here's the greater question how much of
Asian culture influence can you get away
with can
we be incorporated I want to bring to
know that that's the white dude in the
room asking this cuz I know that's a
great question because like we saw with
girls to shell I mean there was
definitely bad but there was I mean to
be fair there were other cast members
were Asian they tried they try to
incorporate some other but they couldn't
get away from the fact that the lead
character was was the I yeah I was so
frustrated when I interviewed the
director Rupert Sanders where he talks
about essentially this is in a different
universe
alright it's a multicultural universe a
parallel universe with races and really
like that much of a thing and then it
gets to a point ok then how come there's
all these Japanese influences in the
movie man but that's it that's what
that's exactly what I'm asking is you
know they're indicate the argument as we
keep moving into the future in the
future and so on and the global
playground and everybody moving around
and eventually just becoming one giant
amalgam of pseudo culture I guess is the
the goal but I mean that doesn't change
the fact that ghost in the shell' relied
philosophically yeah on a lot of Eastern
philosophies yeah and I think it's
definitely dependent upon the the source
material right look with Death Note they
could easily III didn't really know it
was written to be like it wasn't written
like everybody's Japanese actly yeah
didn't have that like cultural hook to
it like it could have been anyone yeah
they're making like Full Metal Alchemist
like a live-action version of that and
those character is supposed to be in
like Germany right and all the names are
those names if you see if you've seen
the trailer for it it's it's coming out
in Japan and everyone in that is a
Japanese movie which actually I mean it
looks okay yeah cool so I mean that
that's that's the question with a cure
then can you do a Kyra they can't be a
Neo Tokyo if they're yeah like right
that was always you you read the the
crap about like oh really make
live-action is gonna mean neo New York
and it's like that's the amerikan gunz
oh there's no biker gangs in New York
there's there are but there's no like
what yeah wait a second there's biker
gangs in New York but I mean that that's
all about the hiroshima and yeah this
you know they there's always been a
deeper
cultural not fear not jealousy I can't
even come up with the right terminology
about nuclear like nuclear dangers yeah
because around Japanese culture and you
know I'm not gonna try to speak over my
own knowledge base here I'm not gonna
pretend to be some expert in Eastern
culture it's not rocket science though
it is nuclear physics that's how a cure
came to be a cure that story doesn't
happen in America and you know but is
there are there Studios like I mean
people can come say it make the defense
of this all like supposed to be like
fantasy stuff anyway like or like i mean
Godzilla's the same way Godzilla is
supposed to be like an allegory I guess
about like the dangers of like
experimenting with like nuclear like
energy and then yeah and yet they were
able to just put Godzilla in New York
and that's because Godzilla self kind of
got away from its core source material
monster not an ally break it became a
monster became a hero
it became other monsters I played
basketball against Charles barge right
it became its own thing and I think
that's why it was acceptable that you
could take Godzilla just not acceptable
though I just turned spiraling down I
mean what I'm asking is are there any
studios in Japan that could do these
live-action scope I you see more of it
nowadays you see it do you guys talk
about death no I skipped over death no I
went straight to attack on Titan okay
and I watched movie the live-action
looks incredible for attack on Titan
okay maybe some of the other aspects are
looked cool but I watched both of them
back-to-back watching the movies yeah I
didn't watch a movie trailers I watched
the movie I tried to watch the movie on
an airplane and I fell asleep it was why
it's not good you know it would have
worked though I mean and this is my very
very personal review of the movies and
the fashion that I watch them is just
don't try to name them Eren and Mikasa
like it had nothing to do with those
characters they changed their
backstories so hard why even go down
that road why not just give us a side
story where you could do whatever the
hell you want because more people are
being affected by Titans why did they
have to try to like reboot the stupid I
don't know Paget all right well we got
we gotta leave at that
we've gotta we're gonna run off into
other things travel back in time to our
former selves in June doing a very
abrupt stop there we should we should do
