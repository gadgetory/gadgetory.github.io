minivans a number of years ago one of
the first places we went was to the Ford
Explorer the original edition now here's
the 2016 getting a refresh let's get
caught up first of all they've got a
platinum level now which is for its top
trim you can push this guy almost to 50
grand
this is for folks who say give me
everything under the hood is big news
2.3 liter EcoBoost for a cousin a close
cousin to the same engine showing up in
the new Mustang raised a lot of eyebrows
on Mustang from the purists at least but
Ford knows that they've got something
going on here they can do more working
the displacement would suggest in fact
you can now get that small 4 in a
vehicle this big that also has all-wheel
drive and the ability to do some real
trailer towing inside smart USB charging
ports you know not all USB charging is
the same this one will sense what kind
of device you're plugging in to charge
the battery efficiently now note some
interface changes on this Explorer it's
this part of involving Ford religion
first of all there used to be a lot of
touch sensitive zones here on this
control panel for things like climate
tuning and volume they've gone back to a
fair number of buttons but kind of
elegantly fared in consumer feedback
sometimes is that you know fiddly touch
stuff isn't as good as a good old
physical but in many cases so see how
these are done this is new over here in
front of the driver this is Ford's first
LCD instrument panel it has physical
dial bezels with the numbers around them
but all the other stuff in the middle
and between the gauges is pure LCD first
time for them and of course you can now
get these vehicles with 180 degree
porpoise camera the front camera that
looks from edge to edge in case you're a
little unsure yourself driving something
of pretty good size we've also got an
increasing array of those driver assist
technologies that are starting to come
in to mid and even lower market and be
more expected by drivers not just gee
wisdom
