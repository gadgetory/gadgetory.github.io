TV now if you're a bit paranoid about
people coming into your home when you're
not around this is the product for you
it is the perfect home alone simulator
it's basically a speaker but on the back
there are little LED lights that will
stimulate you at home and it'll simulate
different situations so you're watching
a movie you watching the football you
using the vacuum cleaner and maybe even
you in the bathroom now it's all
controlled from a basic app that shows
you the different simulations that you
can go through maybe you're in the
kitchen maybe you're watching football
or maybe you're watching kung fury on
the TV there's also an option to build
your own simulation where you can choose
things like where you live whether or
not you have a dog and how busy you are
so you can actually simulate the real
life that you lead while you're not at
home now you can't buy this one just yet
it's going on Kickstarter in the coming
weeks and it should start shipping
within the first quarter of 2018 you'll
be for an early bird price of 150 and
when it goes on retail will be about 3
to 400 and you will have no problem
leaving Kevin home alone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
