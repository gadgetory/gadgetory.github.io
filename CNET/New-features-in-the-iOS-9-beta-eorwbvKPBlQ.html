today and we're going to take a first
look at some of the new features let's
start with the news app while there are
tons of third-party options Apple's news
outlets you pick your favorite sites
then get a news feed from publications
you like it has explore features that
give you suggested channels and topics
or you can browse categories by
scrolling down a search button gives you
suggested searches or you can type in a
topic and look for new stores now on to
the Notes app great for joining down any
type of info you'll now be able to
create checklists add photos and even
scribble with your finger with different
pen types and a selection of colors
what's cool here is you can also send
things to notes so I might find the
perfect recipe in Safari and I can send
it straight to my notes with the
standard share sheet all these notes are
shared across all my devices connected
by my apple ID switching over to
navigation the Maps app now has transit
directions so i can quickly do a search
then find the best public transit
information for getting there it's
useful that the map shows bus and rail
stops and you can touch one to see the
lines that go through that stop you can
also see what's around you with the new
nearby feature by performing a search
and using the buttons at the top to find
things like food or shopping in your
area siri gets smarter in iOS 9 by
searching more sources to give you
better results one of the coolest new
features is that you can ask specific
questions like show me emails from last
Wednesday and Cirie will quickly grab
those emails so you can find what you
want but the general search features are
better too even when you launch search
by swiping right from the first home
screen you'll now get your most common
contacts recent apps you were using a
few things you might want nearby and
news stories when you choose a nearby
item you'll quickly go to maps to see
all the locations that match your choice
so that's a quick overview for the iOS 9
public beta but will show much more when
the official version comes out this fall
i'm jason parker percy net and thanks
for watching
