Generation X tech journalist who was you
know somewhat confused by snapchat and
and why certain comedian musicians who
he was familiar with from Twitter
suddenly seem to be spending a lot more
time on snapchat you know how would you
explain that transition and or apologize
to them ah well first I would say
transition is a bad word it's more like
bringing on more platforms to create art
as opposed to just leaving Twitter
actually sat on the piano to that I use
Twitter a lot to help myself understand
what is going on on snapchat so the
conversation still on Twitter I'm just
snapping a lot more mr. confused all
right so you know but for you what are
what are the advantages of snapchat
actually my favorite thing about
snapchat unrelated to leaving Twitter or
whatever you would call it is that the
editing process is in real time so when
I shoot for YouTube you feel a bunch of
stuff hope you got it in camera you go
back later edit it and make it a video
whereas I'll shoot something look at it
immediately and be like oh my inflection
on that word was wrong delete and retake
and you know you got that take and then
you just publish immediately and that's
the most fun part for me is the audience
that you have on snapchat different
versus other platforms yes definitely
that there are different viewers based
on what you're using I mean there of
course is some crossover and I know that
I got some of my like adult male bros
from Twitter to download snapchat but
yeah it's changes depending upon where
you're putting your art ok and and so
I'd assume then the the engagement and
the relationship you have with your
audience is also much different yeah
it's almost like a different language
you just have to know how you're
speaking even on Instagram it's
different too and where do you see
snapchat going in the coming years where
you hope it goes oh geez if I knew that
I would just be here and be like loaded
and take um I don't know i think it's
organic and we'll find out as we go
along but i really i can't predict I
mean who would guess that it would take
off the way it did
that was not see pakka lips guys we're
done oh yeah all right anything else
exciting got plans for the rnc boy here
I'm headed now down to the convention
center so i think some chaos is gonna
happen you can you make it happen for it
yes I will do my best all right thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
