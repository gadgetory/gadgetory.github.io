I sure don't and which movie should you
be more excited about Toy Story 4 or
detective Pikachu well hey what's going
on everybody welcome to nope sorry
the CNET debate show where I Jeff
Bakalar argue with my friends and
colleagues over three rounds of dead
serious heated debate that winds up
destroying office relationships and
personal friendships joining me on the
show today Bridget Carey hi how's it
going Bridget I came prepared with cards
that means trouble for me okay
here's how the show works we've got
three rounds and Bridget and I will be
awarded five points depending on how
well we make our case on the topic at
hand so who's got the topics and who's
assigning all these points these are
good questions
it's I is Akhtar what's up Baez I
brought a notepad so I'm prepared to we
all have penny paper here we're a tech
company that's how that works okay
Bridget and I we spend about three three
and a half hours flipping a coin and it
turns out bridget is going to go first
in rounds one and three is what's that
first topic all right so Samsung teased
a foldable phone recently and now the
word is that the foldable phone will
come in the first quarter of next year
will this assure in a wave of foldable
phones or is this just a gimmick 90
seconds on the clock all right I'm gonna
start this one off by showing you this
in my pocket you see this yes yeah it
doesn't fit no cuz phones are too big
those are too big and if I could fold
them so I don't think this is a gimmick
I think this is something that is
innovation in phones that we sorely need
because you know what happens we're
constantly promised all these phones
that are supposed to make our lives
easier oh it goes what the battery
doesn't last as long you need some
dongles that can't fit in your pocket
finally innovation that could change the
game for cell phones and solve the
pocket problem okay that's fair I think
your pocket problem is going to be a
very expensive solution to
problem because if you've heard Bridget
Carey but we're looking at like $1700
perhaps for this new galaxy I don't know
what they're calling it like foldable
galaxy she cheap I know it's not cheap
and you're gonna have to wait because
you're gonna have to be a third or
fourth generation adopter for this thing
if we even get to that point because you
and I both know this is a gimmick okay
this is a gimmick put together by big
big big screen and bacon big battery who
are working in cahoots together so that
this thing requires 19 batteries to keep
the phone on all day kind of screwy
there's 10 seconds look I'm just gonna
say that prices are gonna keep going up
no matter what you do okay at least this
could maybe change we would think about
phones and you can multitask it's a
double screen screens I can break and
shatter I as what do you have there man
okay so I think based on the question
and Bridget's very catchy pocket problem
concept and Jeff you proved her point
because this says is it gonna be a wave
a foldable phone you said fourth
generation meanie there wouldn't be a
wave I was you just proved yourself I'm
gonna give Bridget three and you two on
that cuz expensive is very very
important okay that's that's fair even
though if I disagree
all right topic 2 what do we have is
topic 2 two incredibly hyped movie
trailers have hit in the last few days
which film are you more excited about
Toy Story 4 or detective Pikachu
90 seconds go okay the answer is Toy
Story 4 because that franchise everybody
is one of the most important animated
franchises in our lifetime it helps
generations okay that is a
quintessential Pixar staple I mean just
look at this cast okay they're bringing
in keegan-michael key and Jordan Peele
are there more are there two more
likable people on earth I guess you have
to do something to make it interesting
no come on everybody knows that this
detective Pikachu thing is a sham it
doesn't resemble Pokemon in any
meaningful way plus you and I both know
that a a Pikachu should have been Danny
DeVito
Orion revs like he doesn't get enough
work yeses they have to make him Pikachu
also he's a national treasure all right
tell me more about Pikachu okay I'm
gonna say this as someone who never
played a Pokemon video game and someone
who's a crazy Disney fanatic I mean I
even went to Toy Story land at Disney
World I am just all in for the Pikachu
detective Pikachu movie I'll tell you
why okay one Toy Story was already
wrapped up in a beautiful little bow
when all the toys went to Bonnie okay
all had a good cry okay will the next
movie be good I'm sure I'll make us cry
guys really as one they do but it's been
old its tired I want to see investment
in new ideas new ideas like the Pokemon
game which is doing something very
interesting I don't have much time left
I'll just say this what is toy star
going to teach our kids you put googly
eyes on something it becomes to life and
then Pikachu's you know live in harmony
we can all live in harmony together in
this crazy world that's like Roger
Rabbit I like the right driver point
anyway I as well just think of that now
is a tough one that was really well
debated it comes down to we just made
more points yep you're right very
important movie and and really it should
be Danny DeVito sure it should be but
Bridget's got three she's got she's a
dizzy and she went against Disney Toy
Story did wrap up and its new we finding
new Rita - I never saw two and three
alright I'm sure they're green I'm gonna
see forward now also alright score six -
for our final round that's gonna decide
the winner of this week's nope sorry
guys take us to it okay so there's a
claim her for this almost every video
game movie is kind of trashed yeah so
according to Rotten Tomatoes the highest
rated one is rampage you know stirring
the rock clocking in at a whopping
52% fresh either way what do you think
is the best video game - movie
adaptation go for it alright I haven't
seen rampage but I will talk about the
best worst video game movie that really
changed pop culture street fighter okay
how'd you get all those
doctors together in a cohesive story
they did it kind of like in this James
Bondish wake the evil dictator you got
the ragtag crew you got chun-li as a
super journalist because she's cool and
then you know let's just suck about
casting cuz you know Raul Julia uh you
know I say more I could say more but you
know he also made this movie as a dying
gift to his children which is just you
can see his performance come through
this beautiful okay
that's compelling in a way I think the
most amazing and bad adaptation of a
game into a movie with Super Mario
Brothers ok put aside the fact that sure
Super Mario Brothers the movie kind of
had almost nothing to do with the game
in which it was based on that's fine but
look at that kiss Bob Hoskins John
Leguizamo Dennis Hopper doing-doing
Dennis Hopper things this whole time we
got him to be Koopa that's a big deal
and Fisher Stevens is in that movie too
everyone forgets about Fisher Stevens
being in there it was weird it was
strange but at the same time you know
had nothing to do with Mary Brothers
whatsoever it created this amazing kind
of world with out-of-control production
value and an art direction that was
added out of control I've never really
seen anything like it because who would
have put money towards something like
this it's a confusing fungus world it
was a fungus movie which Mario Brothers
does not really focused that much on
nevertheless in conclusion raúl juliá I
can't argue we're all Julie but sure
alright I as worried were you at okay so
listing that based on what you guys said
I mean Mario Brothers or Mario Brothers
as you say this Matt it's Matt you know
but it's fine Mario your brother this is
pretty good on this it's the terrible
adaption adaptation but you mentioned
what makes it a good movie the cast
you've got production values and you do
have fungus which does tie it so that's
gonna give you three points and Bridget
- okay so there you have it the final
score eight to seven I've been bested
once again Bridget Carey the winner of
this week's nope sorry what did Bridget
win Bridget won a hat and a freaking
banana is this like the friggin what is
this is this what is this runner up
nonsense alright you look great in the
Pokemon hat
very timely thank you so much for
watching this week's nope sorry a big
thanks to Bridget Carey and even bigger
thanks for the jits not an easy role of
the judge role and he pulled it off
eyes Akhtar thanks so much hey it was it
I would like another maybe rematch if
you have me you got it alright if you
want to submit a topic that's how we got
the foldable phone because somebody
submitted this in the comment section
