neat lighting products but this LED
color changing panel behind me is among
the coolest it's called the nano leaf
Aurora
we've actually reviewed some of their
light bulbs in the past but this is
therefore a from the label to the flat
wall panel basically here's how it works
it comes in several different individual
modular triangular color-changing panels
that you can buy in a pack of 10 with a
related hub that translates the ZigBee
protocol over Wi-Fi so that you can use
the related app to control everything
remotely it's a really cool interactive
fun color changing light situation that
we've never seen anything like this
before really so the Nano leaf Aurora is
still in its prototype phase it's due to
be released mid at 2016 to the middle of
this year and cost roughly 150 bucks for
a pack of 10 and the hub another thing
though is this dodecahedron this is a
prototype but basically it has a
built-in accelerometer and as you move
it it's programmed to change the
lighting scape to whatever you want so
you can program it it's like this little
switch instead of using your phone you
can just do it manually right on your
couch or wherever and I hope they bring
it to market because it just adds a
whole other level of cool to this whole
nano Lee
or experience</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
