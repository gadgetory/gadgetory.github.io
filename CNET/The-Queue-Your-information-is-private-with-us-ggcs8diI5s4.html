your iPhone and a parking meter with
brains of steel the queue starts now hey
there what's going on thanks for tuning
into the queue the only tech show that
tastes better because it comes in a
McDonald's rapper now on to your must
click moment if you thought it was over
think again rkelly with another ten
chapters adding even more mystery and
love to his hip hop rock now we made a
deal the plan was for me to come home to
bill I did my part so don't ifc
releasing a new nugget every night at
midnight in this never-ending saga watch
everywhere some of this is definitely
NSFW around cnet now how safe are your
searches take a look at someone's search
history and it's clear you can learn a
ton about them where they're going on
vacation that health problem they think
they have or directions to where they're
headed that afternoon for dinner newscom
checking out the privacy policies of the
five largest search engines and found
them really tough to decipher so they
started making phone calls ask.com keeps
data the shortest just hours compared to
google and yahoo's 18 months some delete
it after that time others just partially
anonymize it only Google and ask don't
target ads based on previous behavior
but a well lets you opt out of that
technology confusing yeah it is at least
when we use card catalogs you only have
to worry about it librarians prying eyes
moving through the queue a dream come
true for some iphone users getting skype
on their mobile a company called shape
services announcing a Skype web service
for the iPhone by logging into skype for
iphone calm users can talk with skype
contacts or call landlines and other
mobiles service is not endorsed by Skype
coin-operated parking meter seem so old
school these days many of them take
debit cards but only the photo violation
meter is not only a car's best friend
but also its worst enemy the meter adds
a few nice touches like a no fine
feature which rebuilds your credit card
for more time when you run out if you
choose to do so a grace period feature
lets you pay for overtime even if you
return to your car and the times run out
but the best feature a camera embedded
in each spot that takes a picture of
your license plate and instantly spits
out a ticket for violators how nice
finally the site while Twitter asks the
simple question what are you doing ping
me takes the opposite approach asking
what should you be doing the service
like a to-do list that also reminds you
to actually do it start by entering in a
task or reminder they're called pings
then say how you want to be reminded
through email or text message when you
get the ping you can even reschedule or
snooze it the cool part is that you can
link up to a friend or spouses account
so they can send friendly reminders even
when you're not around a text message
telling me to take out the trash I'm
sold oh this pink is telling me to wrap
it up I'm rich demuro with CNN TV in New
York City don't say it and tell you so
Who am I kidding there's nothing on here
