google that we can pack inside of a show
and we know that samsung's next unpacked
event is coming februari the 21st and
we'll have all the live coverage for
right here on cnet even if that's a
sunday morning now we've seen renders of
the galaxy s7 but review dao dot VN
appears to give us a first glimpse of an
actual galaxy s7 that matches up with
the pictures from evan blast last week
and another image of the purported real
galaxy s7 also appeared on Weibo forums
that match up as well all pretty much
confirming what we will find out on the
21st now a patent application from
patently mobile has revealed how Samsung
plans to reinvent their s pen now I know
you didn't think it could be done well
the new design shows off how users will
be able to pull the Samsung S Pen
partially out of its holding place and
then bend it into a locked position that
would allow it to double as a stand for
your phone pretty slick now this isn't
final but it's what Samsung is thinking
of it should be a no-brainer to
implement all right acc will reportedly
not be announcing anything at Mobile
World Congress but there have been leaks
about the successor to the HTC One m9
phone that's a been codenamed the ACC
perfume that name stinks but thanks to
Evan Blass once again he posted a
picture of the rumour design of the ACC
m10 or perfume that shows the removal of
dual front-facing speakers really an ACC
staple and it's also rumored to be
switching away from an LCD panel to an
AMOLED now we've been talking a lot
about Google VR lately but a new report
from the Financial Times says Google is
working on more than just a google VR
headset they are working on android VR
the goal is to improve mobile virtual
reality by integrating software directly
into Android instead of being isolated
to the single google cardboard app the
new Android vr software might be shown
off at Google i/o in May while the
hardware could be coming in the fall all
right there are lots of players in the
media streaming business and Google is
looking to be an even bigger one after a
report from variety says Google is one
of the tech companies negotiating with
the National Football League for the
digital rights to Thursday Night
Football CBS and NBC are splitting the
TV rights to broadcast those streams but
streaming to non-subscribers was not
part of that deal so normally you'd have
to use a cable login to stream content
from NBC or CBS apps but a stream from
google directly would most likely not
now we know content is king and this
would be a big move for Google if they
get the rights but come on football fans
no Thursday games are typically weaker
matchups with teams that have been
beaten up from a short week and it makes
for a poor product but you think the NFL
cares about that no all right google is
testing out their self-driving cars in
several US cities and London wants in on
the action The Guardian reports the
deputy mayor for Transport has met with
Google to persuade the company to extend
its pilots test to London so that Google
can move to other countries quickly when
it's ready London wants to be one of the
first even if Google has said they are
still focused on the US and new FCC
documents have revealed that Google
wants to disconnect itself from wall
chargers and is testing wireless
chargers that could beam up energy
through the bottom of the car two
companies new york-based he Bo power and
philadelphia-based momentum dynamics
have already sent systems to Google for
testing the nissan leaf and Chevy Volt
have wireless charging products already
available but the setup isn't easy and
therefore it hasn't taken off all right
that's going to do it for this we show
you can email us at Google licious at
cnet com or tweet me at brian Tong
thanks for watching we'll see you guys
next time for some more of that Google
Isha's Google ish's</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
