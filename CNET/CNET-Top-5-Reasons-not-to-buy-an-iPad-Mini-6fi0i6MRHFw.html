apples fourth-generation iPad is a
killer tablet processor smokes the Wi-Fi
is faster and that Retina screen is
still a beauty to behold then Apple
squirted this guy out the iPad Mini now
make no mistake the iPad Mini is a four
star review from CNET it's an excellent
product and I'm sure there'll be no
shortage of ads this holiday season
reminding you of that but a few months
ago I gave you the top 5 reasons not to
buy a nexus 7 tablet so today I'll even
the score with the top 5 reasons to pass
on the iPad Mini starting off at number
5 your old iPad a lot of you already
have a first or second generation iPad
hanging around the house the mini may be
smaller other than that it's just a
rehash you get the screen resolution of
the original iPad and the processor of
an iPad 2 it's just the same old
ingredient stuffed into a new shape it's
like the Apple chalupa at number 4 the
Lightning dock just what everyone loves
a new proprietary charging and
connection standard you can't use this
with the stuff you already have without
buying hideous adapter and I tell you to
go out and buy an airplay speaker but
you just know there's going to be some
airplay 2.0 update that will make all
your old airplay speakers obsolete
you can't win so maybe it's time to look
at number three the competition have you
seen all the amazing tablets that are
out there right now there's the Kindle
Fire HD the nuke HD that Nexus 7 the
Nexus 10 the Transformer Pad Infinity
the Microsoft Surface the competition is
bringing their a-game right now and you
already know what the iPad can do so why
not shop around that brings us to number
two the price $329 you want something
that you can read easily in bed you can
buy 4.5 Kindles with that money
one for the nightstand one for the couch
one for your commute and one you could
just gift to some Dickensian orphan with
a top hat and a cold stained nose an
accent that just sounds like gibberish
the point is $330 plus tax and a smart
cover that's some serious coin for a
shrunken iPad now before we get to
number one let's reel off a few reasons
why the iPad Mini might not be
the worst idea it's a great first iPad
the resale value typically holds up you
can get one with pay-as-you-go 4G LTE it
works with all the iOS apps you already
have it'll keep the kids from stealing
your iPad and most of all it makes a
great gift I can't justify it for myself
but if you bought one for me we're
friends for life but before you hit that
Buy Now button here's the number one
reason to just chill out I've had mini -
it's inevitable it's probably coming
sooner than you think and you don't have
to be a fanboy to know how this is going
to play out
you can see that train of disappointment
just barreling right at you
the next version will have a Retina
display a faster processor maybe even a
better price buy that one and you'll be
the envy of all the early adopters who
just couldn't help themselves right now
there you have it five reasons to avoid
the iPad Mini at least for the moment
we're leaving that nasty comment though
be sure to check out my top 5 reasons
not to buy the Nexus 7 or reasons to
skip windows 8 I'm here to disappoint
everybody you can see my videos every
week over at top-5 cnet.com I'm vonabell
thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
