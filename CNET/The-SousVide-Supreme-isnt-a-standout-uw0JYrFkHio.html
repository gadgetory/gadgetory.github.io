review of each appliance technology
sous-vide supreme so this water bath
style cooker is similar to the caso
sous-vide center we just reviewed it
costs four hundred and twenty nine
dollars which is less than the Casso but
kind of in that same range although it
is relatively close in price this thing
doesn't have a built-in vacuum sealer or
a hose that helps you drain the water so
you'll have to carry this thing over to
the sink and dump it out which is kind
of a struggle so this thing has a two
point six gallon max water capacity you
can set it up to ninety nine hours for
cooking so several days and it has a
temperature range from 86 to 210 degrees
Fahrenheit this model also doesn't have
a built-in water circulator so in theory
it wouldn't be as uniform a temperature
but it actually was quite uniform and it
did a better job of staying closer to
the target temperature than the Casa
sous-vide so while the performance in
this model was better it's missing a lot
of those features that I loved about the
caso sous-vide Center and that brings me
to another point if you are interested
in getting started with sous-vide I
would suggest the $200 Innova one it's a
handheld device it's easier to use it's
obviously cheaper and it's actually more
accurate than the two water bath models
I've tested so you'd still be paying 429
dollars for something that performs
pretty well but still not great and will
take up a ton of space in your house
this is really only going to suit a
small portion of people thank you for
watching this review of EADS
appliance technology sous-vide supreme

sous vide coverage on cnet.com i'm megan
Willerton foreseen it applies
