a look at what we expect from one of the
biggest game conferences of the year III
is where industry Titans like Microsoft
Sony and Nintendo show off what they
have cooking for their respective game
divisions over 2,300 games consoles and
toys will be on display at the show and
we expect at least 75 announcements of
new games or devices the biggest
announcements from Microsoft will center
around Project Scorpio its newest update
to the Xbox we're expecting the company
to answer questions like what does it
look like how much will it cost
when can we buy one and what can it do a
regular Xbox one can't
hopefully they'll also answer my number
one question which is what am I going to
get cup hit from hardware to software
Sony will likely be focusing on updates
from highly anticipated ps4 exclusives
like God of War for the Last of Us part
2 days gone Detroit become human
Uncharted The Lost legacy and the
upcoming spider-man game so in the green
corner there's xbox showing off new
hardware in the blue corner we've got
Sony with all kinds of great exclusives
and then there's Nintendo who's off
marching to the beat of their own drum
but honestly we're equally as excited
about that too we expect a big chunk of
Nintendo's e3 presents focused on
upcoming switch titles like Super Mario
Odyssey but personally I'm hoping we get
announcements for more franchises like
Kirby Super Smash Brothers or maybe even
Metroid of course tons of independent
developers like Activision EA Rockstar
Bethesda and more will be showing off
their upcoming games as well regardless
of who shows up with what it looks like
it's going to be another massive year
for e3 we will be on the ground covering
it as it happens stay tuned cnet.com I'm
