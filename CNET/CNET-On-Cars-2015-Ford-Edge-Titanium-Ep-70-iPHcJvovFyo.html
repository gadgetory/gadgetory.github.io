with one old thing we don't like the
future of the turbocharger is electric
and why you care and how to spot a car
that's been for a swim it's time to
check the tech we see cars differently
we love them on the road and under the
hood but also check the tech and are
known for telling it like it is ugly is
included at no extra cost
the good the bad the bottom line this is
CNET on cars
welcome to CNET on cars to show all
about high-tech cars and modern driving
i'm brian coulis one of the biggest auto
sales stories of the year 2015 in the US
has been the resurgence of the crossover
americans are passed through a recession
we're past hundred dollar a barrel oil
and we're past our guilt about driving
SUVs so ford figures hmm pretty good
time to redo the edge completely for the
first time since introduction let's
drive the all-new 2015 and check the
technique
may be forgiven for thinking we brought
the wrong edge it looks a lot like the
outgoing 14 certainly in its general
shape and volumes and proportion but the
dead giveaway is right here the 15 has
this deeply sculpted side where the past
edge had this kind of black slab side
the grille is a little different the
taillights are very much like a fusion
which is no coincidence because the edge
is largely based on the platform shared
with the fusion overall it's about an
inch longer in 15 that's not dramatic by
any stretch now inside the new edge
Ford's done a lot of work to bring it
upscale and not be so utilitarian now
there's the real problem it's the my
Ford touch with some sync technology
that Ford took a drubbing for four years
it's been replaced by sync three
unfortunately this 15 edge only offers
this outgoing my Ford touch the 16 will
bring you the much more desirable sync 3
you know what to do of course the good
part of Ford LCD interface is over there
in front of the driver where you've got
those two helper screens alongside the
speedo and those are configurable in
almost any variety on the left or change
to whatever focus you care about of for
choices on the right and it each got a
dedicated winged controller on the wheel
that's some affords best UI and HMI even
if this is kind of the opposite anyway
let's take a look at some of the
controls down here everything here is
now a physical button and they're large
and pretty well spaced so this is well
done human machine interface here's
something new this camera button is
going to turn on a front looking cam
this is I think a first for Ford overall
it gives you that sort of going out
forward look when you're sort of nudging
out of a blind space you can even go to
a really extreme fisheye here our drive
controls are pretty straightforward a
conventional automatic transmissions gr
nd s in this case but s isn't a complete
cohesive sport mode it's a sport profile
and accompanying the shifter are of
course the almost common now paddles on
the wheel only one choice though and
that is this automatic
in the back of our edge we've got an
interesting numbers story going on as
another inch of legroom which is nice to
have a compact ish crossover and about
another inch of shoulder room roughly
per two passengers back here here's the
proof in the pudding I set up this
passenger seat for me up there and now
I'm able to sit behind me back here that
doesn't happen in a lot of cars we've
got inflatable seatbelts in the back on
this vehicle I've also got a nice big
panoramic roof up here that extends all
the way back to the rear headrest now
some things have changed in the engine
bay on the new edge and some things have
it first of all this is another standard
engine the 2-liter the little guy in
line for sitting sidesaddle with
EcoBoost technology that means a
turbocharger and direct injection it
used to be kind of a pricey option now
it's the base engine it's also now got a
twin scroll turbo so a turbo that has
two modes of operation to be more
responsive additional engines include
the three and a half liter v6 and the
2.7 liter four-cylinder EcoBoost but
there's your new base the numbers are up
a little bit it's now 245 horsepower up
5 and 275 pound feet of torque also up
five what didn't change is the mpg it
still comes in at twenty four average
which is 20 city 30 highway the last
edge was 21 City 30 highway but the
average comes out the same all of this
goes out through a six-speed Automatic
transmission we have front wheel drive
you can also get these guys in all-wheel
drive and by the way all it wants is
regular gas first thing that struck me
about the new edge is the ride quality
this is smooth and nice and liquid very
compliant I like that like it's a home
run for the market they're going after
now the next thing you notice is the
powertrain is that ok how's the
to the 2-liter EcoBoost turbo dueling
well it actually does fine as long as
you don't let it get buried under car in
other words don't find it loafing along
and sixth when you need to stab at the
power so drop it in sport mode for
example get on those paddles and keep
things cooking some interesting driver
assists on this car one that is not
terribly cutting-edge is lane departure
warning and lane departure prevention
because it has an electric power
steering rack they can address that
digitally until it - knows you back in
that's how they do it perhaps the most
interesting though is this new layer of
self parking technology now this vehicle
adds perpendicular on top of that and
also exit mode so if you're too damn
dumb to get out of a parking spot you
parked in know how that works this will
get you out of it
that front camera is you know it's
useful if you're coming out of a blind
spot you gotta hit that button of course
you got to think about it manually but
it's got a good clear image and they're
also quite an elaborate array of
surround sensors that are available on
this vehicle to augment the front and
rear cameras you have no surround camera
attack however you get a lot of segments
there on the screen as you can see along
with various beeps and color-coding to
let you know what you're about to spring
and coming later not available now as I
understand it but a mid model year
production will be adaptive cruise and
the forward collision automatic braking
okay let's do a 15 Ford Edge CNET style
starts off at 36 5 because that's the
price of admission for this titanium
trim with front-wheel drive and this is
a pretty loaded vehicle but then we
check the box for package 302 a Ford's
just got away with names down there that
brings you a lot of toys the power
liftgate you can wag your foot to open
the panoramic roof overhead that new
active parking assist the front camera
HID headlights blind spot warning the
lane departure and prevention I showed
you on the road voice based navigation
and those rear seatbelts with airbags
built in now 1300 more brings you the
driver assist package which goes further
with adaptive cruise control as well as
forward collision
mitigation braking that's automatic and
for some reason they lump in a tilt
telescope wheel with that and my
favorite option is dealer-installed 330
bucks for a safe in the console what are
you gonna put in there you're driving an
edge you're not James Bond I'd get one
too anyway we're looking about forty
three eight all in for this guy here's
your bottom line on the edge looks a lot
better I think but still very familiar
more room in the back seat always a good
thing that technology and the - that's
sad you gotta wait till 2016 I'm afraid
and the 2-liter EcoBoost turbo engine is
now standard used to be a rather pricey
option

cnet.com well a flooded car whether it's
a long time ago or it's still drying out
is basically a nightmare you want to run
the other way the smarter driver knows
that but not everyone knows how to spot
one we'll show you how
CNET on cars return
well here nearly on Kars headquarters in
Northern California we don't even know
what rain looks like anymore but many of
you have been getting plenty of it and
torrential floods so the idea of being
weary about a flooded car is still very
relevant except for us the problem with
a flooded car is that you never really
dry it out at least not in terms of the
effect of water getting into orifices
and systems that were never supposed to
see water and that water is often salty
that raises hell with metal corrosion
and damage to electronics and wiring a
reputable car dealer should not be
selling a flooded car without clearly
disclosing that a private party seller
has shall we say more leeway to forget
or claim they didn't know so here are
some tips and tricks you can use to find
out if the car you're looking at never
took the big dip now when you get into a
cart you're considering buying and
wondering about flood damage this give
it a sniff you can't mistake that mildew
smell and it's almost impossible to get
out of a vehicle when it's been flooded
now it's possible to get a little mildew
odor because you had clogged drain tubes
up in the sunroof or in the well of a
convertible but assume the worst and go
hunting
second look and I don't mean just at the
floor mat or under the floor mat if you
can try and get a peek under the carpet
that's the harder part to conceal when
there was once flood damage it can be
tough a lot of modern cars really seal
these carpets down but give it a look
you might find someplace to get under
there and third feel feel around up
above the glove box inside that little
whale down in the seat tracks and rails
as well what you're looking for is
little traces of mud that might get on
your hands I mean how else would it get
up there certainly at this height now
there are two sites you can check to get
a car's flood history the National motor
vehicle title information system is a
federal database that includes flood
information now only about thirty five
states fully report into it the rest
either don't or don't fully that opens
loopholes for tidal washing that's when
a car passes through the DMV of a state
that doesn't fully report the nature of
a flooded car flags like water damage
total loss or salvage title then drop
off the cars history also check the
National Insurance Crime Bureau site
it's run by the insurance industry they
report in all cases where claims have
been attached to a car that was flooded
or some other way totaled both are free
to check and both as you can see will
have some holes in their data
it pays to double check the databases
that are out there as well as your own
senses and your gut to make sure you're
not flunking down good money for a car
that got irrecoverably wet
welcome back to see net on cars coming
to you from our home at the mountain
Motor Club just north of the Golden Gate
Bridge
whenever you see a review or video about
a car with a turbocharger you're gonna
hear the phrase turbo lag how little or
how much the car has it's not a good
thing it's the Achilles heel of another
wise great technology but what if that
Achilles heel got erased electric
turbochargers seek to do exactly that
and they make for a historic and
imminently happening car Tech 101 first
of all if you're unclear on turbos check
out our car tech 101 on them back from
episode 2 and our turbos vs.
superchargers episode 15 segment but I
can save you some trouble we can do a
quick refresher on turbos right here
with this Ford EcoBoost four-cylinder
and this is the turbo apparatus this
part picks up the exhaust gas coming out
of the engine and it starts to spin a
shaft on the other end of that is a
compressor that takes air and rams more
of it into the cylinder than the
environment would do naturally and
that's how you get more power out of the
engine because more fuel more power but
there are three hang-ups to this kind of
design first of all since it's run by
exhaust which is the gas and a
compressible gas there's a whole lot of
lag when you step on the gas pedal
before you get the full effect of it
secondly you've got an issue of size and
placement I mean you've got one spool
here another spool here and a lot of
plumbing that means this thing's fairly
big because it lives and runs off the
exhaust it has to live at the exhaust
manifold more or less that takes away
some flexibility for engine designers
who would like to put it somewhere else
and thirdly since the turbo sits in the
middle of the exhaust stream it gets in
the way of scavenging exhaust gases and
that means the engine breathes less well
that's not good for power or efficiency
the electric turbo seeks to answer all
three of those limitations
major supplier Vallejo has an electric
turbo which they happen to call an
electric supercharger
it's powered by 48 volts DC four times
what your car has now this is a new
thing but we covered it recently in our
episode 63 car tech 101 if you want to
brush up now once you have 48 volts this
turbo can be mounted almost anywhere
typically close to the intake of the
engine for the shortest run to push the
boosted air and of course not sitting in
the exhaust path or it can be used to
pre boost a traditional turbo so it
works better that's part of why Vallejo
claims this can increase mpg on a car by
at least 10% and maybe over 15 to
conquer turbo lag there electric booster
always idles at around 10,000 rpm
spooling up to a max of 70,000 to
deliver full boost and almost the moment
you demanded by the pedal outies been
testing it and Valeo says that company
will put it into a production car in
2016 Honeywell and Continental are two
other big industry suppliers who plan to
have electric turbos on the market and
in production cars perhaps a year or two
after Vallejo taking a slightly
different tack is major turbo maker
BorgWarner with what they call an e
booster it's a small electric air pump
that additionally boosts what a
conventional turbo is shoving into the
engine either by being mounted before or
after the turbo itself the e booster is
always a helper not a primary turbo the
fuel economy and emissions targets that
are coming in the EU and us alone cover
enough new cars each year to demand new
ways of managing engine efficiency
opening the door for electric turbos
especially in smaller engine that demand
more nuanced flexible boosting
technologies
in a moment how much wheel is too much
wheel and the top five cars you'll be
glad you bought down the road when CNET
on cars returned
the new Ford GT it's going to be powered
by a 3.5 liter EcoBoost engine that
engine is going to produce over 600
horsepower what means a lot to Ford
going back to Lamar I mean 50 years of
heritage is going to be celebrated next
year you know a lot of people want to
know who we're gunning for and what
we're doing we're gonna show up with one
hell of a race car
I hope Ferraris ready as well buy more
from the ex car team of CNET UK at
cnet.com slash
welcome back to CNET on cars I'm Bryan
Cooley here's the part of the show where
I take one of your emails this time it's
coming in from Keith be writing in from
the Philippines and he says I've got a
Honda City a car you might not recognize
but very popular here in Southeast Asia
I know the car it's a little smaller
than a Civic a little bigger than a
Honda Fit I was thinking of changing my
rims he writes from 15 inch to 19 inch
his question is what are the pros and
cons of larger rims on a car well Keith
first of all you're not just getting
larger you're really going to town 15 to
19 is like night and day your car is
gonna look really different but more
importantly it may feel different in a
handful of ways here's what I want you
to think about first of all is ride
quality there could be an additional
harshness in fact almost certainly when
you go from a 15 with a very thick high
profile tire to a 19 with a very thin
low profile tire a lot more Road in
what's gonna work its way into your
cabin then you want to make sure you're
gonna have good clearance on your new
tires and wheels they won't just be
bigger in diameter
they're also necessarily going to get
wider there's a lot more mass moving in
that wheel well make sure it's not
scraping or rubbing either when the car
is empty fully laden going straight or
making a u-turn next up make sure the
overall circumference of your new tire
wheel package is basically the same as
your old tire wheel package that's the
overall diameter this is important to
make sure your speedometer still reads
correctly but more importantly that your
ABS technology knows what it's dealing
with out there with the wheels that it's
trying to control slip and spin on now
think about your power steering as well
when you get a bigger wheel you also get
a wide
wiill and that means a bigger contact
patch of rubber on the road that has
more resistance to being turned so your
power steering rack the apparatus in the
car is gonna have to work harder you may
not feel it at the wheel because it
takes care of the extra sweat but just
know you might be wearing things out
faster and finally know that your
acceleration and fuel economy could
suffer a little bit because you're
adding a lot more rotating metal weight
that the car has to spin up and break
all the time it's not gonna be a big
deal I don't think but you may feel it
overall the jump you're trying to make
from basically 15-inch donuts to 19 s it
could make your car look like a donk is
kind of drastic I might measure that
back a little and just go with 17s maybe
now I get a lot of questions from you by
an email about buying a new car the cars
you're looking at what's a good value
what's a good car but I almost never get
questions about those cars resale value
and I should it's a huge factor as to
whether or not you're getting a good
deal when you buy a car but it's
typically out of mind because it often
doesn't affect you till the end of life
cycle when you go to sell the car or
when you go to trade it in but think
about it up front it's a big part of
whether you did a good deal or not
meanwhile to inspire you here's a
top-five list of new 2015 vehicles in
the US market that hang on to their
resale value really well
mown taking out pickup trucks here
because they're just a different market
in many ways and often company trucks
and frankly if I didn't they would
dominate the top five so these are 2015
cars and SUVs ranked by the definitive
projection that of Kelly Blue Book
KBD it's the residual value they compute
five years after first sale let's go
number five the Subaru WRX 49.4% left
after five years the WRX has a cult
following I mean can you imagine one
being sold on the use market to someone
who's ambivalent about it
you buy a WRX because you love WRX is
and that does wonders for your residuals
you're selling a religion not just a car
number for the Chevy Corvette forty nine
and a half percent residual the new
Vette is an amazing bargain to begin
with for its degree of performance and
that does wonders for its long-term
value being a two-seat car though does
limit its market options the only other
one in 58 cars surveyed is the Porsche
Cayman and it came in seven points lower
number three the 2015 Honda CRV 50.8%
here we have now crossed that 50% margin
a nice psychological place to be after a
handful of years the CRV is the
best-selling compact crossover in the US
and some part of that would certainly be
buyers knowing that they're going to
have such a nice residual down the road
number two the Toyota 4runner 54.3%
residual value what do you have to say
about this guy it's a classic and a
rugged way that you feel is gonna last
forever before I get to number one the
five worst cars for resale value after
five years along with their miserable
numbers the Audi a5 and Audi a7
virtually the same out he comes in
back-to-back on the list it's just the
wrong list then you've got the Toyota
Avalon at 36.2 Chevy Impala and then the
king of the stinkers the Mercedes S
Class a mere thirty three and a half
percent residual value after five years
if you have one of these and didn't
either release it with company money or
have US US taxpayers subsidizing it
you're an idiot
by the way the best overall brand for
value retention is Subaru think about it
they're built tough they're capable
they've got very clear attributes few
gimmicks and also have a cult
following like the WRX within the brand
that's marketing 101 on wheels the
number one vehicles for residual after
five years are the Jeep Wrangler and
Wrangler Unlimited these are the real
jeeps to many people they're SUVs that
combine a low price with serious
off-road cred and in the case of the
unlimited there's plenty of room to
bring a couple of city slickers along on
your rock crawling exploits and being an
American icon doesn't hurt either thanks
