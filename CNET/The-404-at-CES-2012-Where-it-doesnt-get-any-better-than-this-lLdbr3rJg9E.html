last to make it seem like guys are funny
yeah what's that I'm not you so thank
you so much for being here this is a
totally cool thanks for having me we're
we're like just getting started today I
just spoke up if anyone can tell you do
not biggest right I was weird we were
hosting I had a lot of hosting CES
duties last night but now were after
this we're gonna hit the floor and I'm
really excited and I'm getting my my
group me have you guys in the group we
used that out before actually saw you on
television yesterday partying with a
robot oh right yeah well is that all the
time did you do the robot really cheesy
but Ava the robot rolled out at the
spike party at tryst she was on the list
it was really I don't I didn't quite get
a sense of all of her abilities but it's
it creeps me out a little bit she was
kind of all over the place she felt like
she was measuring me up yeah I got that
Terminator 3 like rise of the machines
fear these things are gonna they're
gonna wipe us out they really are the
end
we're just spilling our own doom right
here yeah so you are CS 2012's
Entertainment matters ambassador that's
a pretty intimidating title for me if
you know ambassador douche go to you
guys know I came last year just as a
just as a viewer and a fangirl
walked around it's very it's very
exciting but it's very big and it can be
a little bit overwhelming we were here
for two days but we didn't quite feel
like we we got everywhere that we wanted
to go and and there they gave you the
little maps but we wanted something the
next time around that sort of helped us
navigate our way and so we started
talking to the folks that entertainment
matters and they said why don't you come
and be the official ambassador and we'll
have a site where people can go and they
can type in what they want to find and
you can you know host some parties and
and tweet about what you like and and
just it bridge the entertainment world
of Hollywood and in this tech world
because it it is so important it is so
exciting we've got to keep up with
what's going on and so yeah I'm
representing yeah I feel like we're
learning slowly but surely a lot of
celebrities they have like a geek side
they're like closet geeks yeah they come
out with soap out of the closet
I'm a tech now I mean I grew up with
three brothers we I was always playing
video games a Atari was our first
Nintendo and then I just have been I
have about a million a million point one
followers on Twitter and that kind of
happened so fast and I feel a commitment
now I feel a responsibility to to be on
top of it and also with the content
that's being produced Huston Hollywood
and adds a producer myself now you look
at kids now and they're watching TV on
this for sure everything is so is so
digital so it's important that I know it
then hell I'm talking about you did a
little short earlier this year with a
Freddie Wong yes apparently a lot of do
that infused me with him because the
green glasses but do you see like one
shot yeah you're kind of here to help
facilitate that yeah I mean it was
astounding the production value that
this I mean you could say he's just some
kid that decided he wanted to make
action movies with his friends for a
couple of bucks versus the tens of
millions that are spent in action movies
and he does it really well and so I had
seen some of his work and I was excited
to to go and play with them and
literally we shot it on Easter Sunday
and we were there for a few hours and
they pulled together just amazing stunt
sequence and it went viral and I think
we have over you know five million hits
but people are seeing it people saw this
thing that was not attached to a studio
that was not not that I want to tell the
studios of it I never want to work with
them again but but it's amazing because
it really is coming people are taking
control and and they're making the kind
of content that they want to see they're
making things with friends they're
having fun and they're able to because
of all the technology I mean people were
like involved in that it was a small
crew I mean I think the whole crew was
fed by one Domino's Pizza
marry that was very basic but uh but it
was blast right it just looked so good
alright let's talk a little bit about
CES because that's why we're all here so
have you had a chance to walk around the
showroom floor yet I haven't but I know
where I'm going I the TVs are always
incredible to me I was with Felicia Day
last night she was telling me I had to
go see the new 4k super super high res
TV so that when I go home I cussed the
TV that's on my wall anyway like a 4k
projector is like literally like you
could start you can see like four is
inside the pores and you know it's just
like we not want to be but to watch it
and see I mean you feel like you're
looking you're looking through a window
if you're watching real life happening
through your screen I mean it's it's
amazing and and we were reading about
less than 6 million light pixels are
coming through I mean just everything
can be condensed and made smaller and
more powerful I like that because I'm
small and powerful but also we a lot of
Wi-Fi the Wi-Fi cameras where you can
immediately upload your shots to your to
your devices and there are wireless
speakers Wireless is always helpful
because I don't know about you guys but
I'm the girl that still has a pin at
home with every old Nokia and I mean I
have probably 50 Nokia chargers and
adapters and I mean all these wires you
don't know what to do with them it's a
big tangle box so Wireless to me is huge
for sure what about 3d you know people I
really just like it just cuz I get sick
I get seasick do you really be a little
seasick with the 3d but it and also
wearing wearing glasses when I'm
watching TV and I don't I don't wear
glasses naturally wear sunglasses but
but I I think it's I think it's
extraordinary that we're creating these
you know something that's been always
been two-dimensionally anything that's
sort of evolving is
imaginable I always think it's like
you're like too cool when you see
someone like walk into the living room
they got their sunglasses on somebody ya
know I'm just trying to enjoy this
speaking of 3d I think I don't know how
you feel about this but I think 3d I
think the platform it can really excel
on is games I think video games in 3d is
a lot more immersive you've done a lot
of video game work before you were in
that game wet by Bethesda are you
involved in anything coming up because I
know a lot of our listeners are big
gamers we love covering the industry I
love to know if anything's going on in
that my my last video game was Fight
Night and that was new for me because
that was motion capture and so instead
of just going in and doing the voiceover
in the studio we actually went in and
more these little one piece cat suits
with little so - actually when I saw the
game see myself we acted out the fees in
these motion capture outfits I wish that
they'd let me put the boxing gloves on
and be one of the fighters not just the
promoters likeable characters we're
working with them for fight night - on
that but again the three the the more
three-dimensional these characters or
these you know we are it's just more
immersive and it is more exciting for
the gamer and even even as I'm playing
some of the games now already I do I get
a little bit discombobulated to do
though because you they move so fast and
I mean look you got a particular game
that you're playing right now or that
you like last night we got a little
sneak peek at the new Final Fantasy we
were playing some of the guys my
brothers are here with me and and my
brother is up is pretty convinced that
Final Fantasy 3 was the best fit that
there ever was but we played last night
it he was impressed with with the new
game I've played it a little bit in the
world of warcraft in the Wow I do
I have been busy and it definitely it
takes commitment I mean you need to be
ready to like hunker down for a couple
of weekends and close the doors in order
Petros and we've been on the move a lot
but I try to keep up also I have nephews
and my boyfriend has kids
teenage boys they you gotta be on the
pulse
you got your cool and you gotta be able
to play and I was always really
competitive growing up with boys always
had to play and had to had to be good
and and you know gonna have your cred so
I want I try to keep up so that I can I
can be the cool aunt before we eat the
break I you know we a lot of our
listeners are super geeky they're really
into film TV and stuff like that
yeah I'm sure you get that all done
right we will be doing the geek world a
disservice if we didn't ask you about
this on IMDB right now your your
accredited what you've never heard of
that right is can you tell us anything
like that is it actually gonna be just
live it won't tell anybody
no it's just a rumor I mean I know Dan
Aykroyd I've known him for four years no
that was 14 years old and we've talked
about it and I mean I would love it I'm
a huge Ghostbusters fan I I I love I
mean Sigourney Weaver to follow in that
woman's foot Sam sure just iconic so I
will see you guys know first no I'd want
you in real life that would be much more
satisfying unfortunately we have to say
goodbye for now but thank you so much
for being here
round of applause the liza deuce very
low have a great show thank you so much
for being here there's a lot more for
for coming your way we'll be right back
after this this is the 404 mr efforts
the show where we all sing
yes 2012 so nice people actually
watching us live let's not pretend
they're actually here we have some
familiar faces the fans of the show
thank you so much everyone for being
here we did and it's getting even bigger
than that right now apparently we've got
a shot on Justin Bieber
that's right Charlie the cameraman is
down there where where Justin Bieber is
there he's going to announce that he is
a he's a robot exactly no no no no he's
introducing a robot demoing a robot like
company called tozi and if you can get
in between these heads and the shot
right now everyone wave to Justin oh he
looks so good in between people like
people are confusing that wave with a
different kind of hand sign yeah what's
crazy he's right underneath the stage
Bieber can it's the future Richard we
should just continue cutting back and
forth between Bieber cam because that's
what people really want to say I think I
don't prefer Justin I think all right so
we have some news to talk about CNN
every year puts on best of CES all the
best products from the show become
finalist nominations and then of course
we award a winner so maybe let's go
through a few nominations that were
psyched about this all right so so
what's grabbing your attention Johnson
well you know we haven't actually had a
chance to talk a lot about apps at the
show right but one of the best of CES
nominees this year is by a company
called or asthma or asthma all right I
heard about this is a new augmented
reality app okay we're actually looking
at it earlier today it's kind of like a
QR code reader but without the QR code
itself and so our asthma will go around
and tag different things this is Kevin
what Kevin was talking about they've
done it a lot in London if you actually
hold your
phone up to Buckingham Palace in London
they've tagged so that it looks like a
bunch of dinosaurs are coming out of
Buckingham Palace on your phone that
doesn't make any sense yeah they'll go
around tagging a bunch of different
think it's not only locations but things
like a $20 bill will look like it's
coming to life and the buildings will
pop out and one right so yeah I was
talking together yesterday about this no
saying that's how you really know that
we're in the future when augmented
reality absurd this is it Skynet it's
really cool that's the next step so I'm
hoping that wins for best of CES is you
know actually I'm looking at this listen
it's nothing that we haven't already
sort of already heard okay before I've
got like the Sony Xperia S that's the
PlayStation Certified right we've got
the Motorola Droid 4 this is just like
five six months after the third one or
two cannot right and Nokia Lumia 900 as
well as the HTC Titan or two so all
right now we're looking I like big
surprises here or is it just for a
status quo it feels pretty status quo
when it comes to smart phones this year
sure you know and it's partly goes into
the same reasoning why Microsoft isn't
going to come back everybody wants to
sort of like own the limelight right
okay and it's kind of difficult to do
that here at CES there's thousands of
products ran out I was a little
surprised to not see the Samsung Galaxy
Note make its way into the best PC yeah
that's right that's like the tenth my
vision it's like a tablet phone hybrid
kind of thing with a stylus and it's not
bringing styli back they really should
have had Justin Timberlake promoting
that absolutely you know here at CES
there are a lot of interesting products
a lot of questionably legal products I
always find that there's always these
Nintendo emulators that somehow are
being sold and I don't understand how
that's cool playing like yeah that's
just you know very skeptical phone on
that but Justin you've uncovered some
straight-up counterfeit stuff that you
think we should be talking about maybe
even alerting some sort of authority and
being like hey you know you're getting
ripped off here yeah we might need to be
screening products more at CES
because we found a couple things seeing
that actually wrote an article lance
whitney checking this check this hour
here it's a beware of counterfeit
tablets that are making their way to CES
if you walk around on the floor right
now a lot of the ecommerce dealers are
selling things like a seven inch Kindle
3 they're just calling it the Kindle how
can how are you allowed to do that very
desert there's a have like two ends and
the it's only $59 so I don't know the
specs aren't probably that I just don't
understand how it's okay for you to call
a product the Kindle three yeah and not
expect to you know get the legal whip
snapping well they have a lot of sneaky
ways of hiding these products like for
example there's a nine point seven inch
Xoom tablet got a microphone rollers
it's not a lot of motorola xoom either
just a zoom just you know they change
the spelling a little bit also there's a
samsung galaxy tablet Samsung two words
you can find that on a website
I don't understand you get suckered into
going to see their booth vetted by
something like that yeah well you know
Lance board this article yesterday and
he was calling out a website alibaba.com
their e-commerce website since then
they've actually taken down the product
so I can't show you the Samsung right
they've already been kicked out of this
job yeah
alright everyone knows who listens to
our show we do something called calls
from the public
we have people call us up so what do you
say we get to a few calls before we
bring Wayne Brady uh what are you doing
about that alright let's do it
time to show the love eighty-six 404
CNET
are you here the the Microsoft press
conference with Steve Ballmer it was
true he's like he's a pretty intense
dude right he's sort of over the top we
had a we had a call that someone
basically called up and is trying to do
their best Steve Ballmer impersonation
so we'd like to share that with you guys
if that's something you'd be into let's
check it out and wait for videos rolling
oh really funny so like the entire time
all yours you know my head be
abomination voice actor we have very
talented Lester's on our program so so I
didn't realize the art that color seems
to think he sounded inebriated but you
know he's just excited yeah yeah he
always has that attitude in his press
conference like that of course so I'm
okay with that
yeah then we have a caller who wanted to
chime in about the wave of 3d printers
that has hit CES Brian taug did a tongue
did a demo of one of those let's listen
to what our friend has to say about
plastic shoes just calling to say I
watch the show we talk about 3d printers
at CES and it has a plastic that was
made from Legos and you guys made shoes
myself
hey that is probably worst idea ever
have a key made of Legos have you ever
stepped on a Lego at night they think
that's the first ball popped in my head
yeah you would think you would not be
manufacturing shoes that around
everything that
it's fine yeah that's not the only thing
that those 3d printers can do and
actually that's true of them that are
nominated for best of CES at scene at
this year the that's the MakerBot
replicator right and 3d cube okay cube
three speaking of new and innovative
things here at CES like we said we had
the brand new beaver cam we're ready to
go back to the beaver cam Justin are you
with us oh he's coming oh okay
Justin has changed his appearance
alright that's live justin beaver below
us right now right here is gone he's
left the building Bieber has left the
building
alarming how many adults are actually
over there just yeah Justin Bieber
another be a lot of grown old guy yeah
not as demographic right yeah that's
okay think I'm a little more excited to
have Wayne Brady up in our eye are you
guys excited for Wayne Brady to take the
stage in a few minutes yeah all right
that's gonna be a lot of fun all right
very cool stuff
do we have anything else you want to
talk about before we hit the break mr.
Justin you did you see this higher
mind-controlled TV hires a Chinese
company okay we're showing off this
headset that you put on and it wires
wirelessly transmits your thoughts to
control a television or video game
really do you guys get a demo of this on
the CNN floor I did not see it explain
it because conceptually I would imagine
you would tune to hockey
it would just be rocky 2470 on one
channel and you have to pay for that
yeah it's interesting it's a product
called the brainwave and basically what
it does is transmits these electronic
signals through your brain okay into the
television set they're already selling
it for about three thousand dollars in
China but they're make its making its
way to States so now do you know
anything about how it works because I
just feel like I would have to plug
something into my temple it doesn't
sound like something you would wear
while lying down and watch
it's definitely sounds or something from
Batman it sounds like something Neil put
John before he got right something out
of the matrix yeah exactly well you're
the video game editor is that something
you know you could leave your hands-free
for good well I remember they one of the
years ago yes they had this sort of
apparatus where it was this air
controlled ball and you use your you've
gotta concentrate on how much air power
was going to be shot out of this
mechanism and right I mean some people
were able to make it work but I put it
on it it was registered I'm an
old-fashioned guy call me crazy but I
like playing games with my fingers yeah
you're Elijah absolutely all right
apparently Justin Bieber is back we're
getting a word he's back in view Oh and
there so this is I guess like the intro
for the robot that they're introducing
that justin is helping to you know break
the ice with here at CES yeah that's
really exciting robots this year we were
talking to lies about it earlier but you
know I Robot right those shoes I make
the Roomba vacuum cleaner right they
came out with their new Ava test bed
that they were demonstrating here it's a
little yellow robot that has an iPad on
top and then it also detects motion
sensing around it so that it won't get
clotheslined by tabletop other people
walking around right but it's kind of
interesting they're saying that the best
use case scenario is going to be in
hospitals to help the elderly around
well that's nice mr. Richard because we
all know that the elderly loved the
latest technology they're not freed up
by robots
yeah they love learning new things I
mean that's the first thing I was
thinking of let's give these elderly
people experience with a robot walking
to a bed and like lifting you out yeah
we can we covered robots a lot on our
show we always have like Oh check out
this robot you know hula-hoop
yeah whatever something like that I feel
like what's the next step like what do
you where do you think robots are really
going cuz I as far as I'm concerned
whenever they can get them to run that's
like always a big deal you know look
it's running back and forth right all
right
now what if we can get a robot to
explain to my mother that the pictures
folder on my computer isn't a website
need a robot for that too much that's a
little that's asking a lot we're talking
about like 3d printers like one day like
the robot plus the 3d printer right like
that is the matrix that you know sky in
it you know in real life yeah absolutely
I real quick before we hit our break I
wanted to bring this up apparently
everyone knows Apple is never ever here
at CES they don't like doing that they
like doing their own thing that's fine
but apparently they have 250 stealth
ninjas or stealth spies if you like
roaming the floors at CES I'm looking
for them now any of you format they're
not wearing their boots right
unfortunately well if you're walking
around the showroom floor you might be
have a chance to spot Greg Joswiak the
jaws of the iOS product market yes
someone actually spotted him lurking
around the CES showroom floor which is
kind of ironic because they always claim
to not care about what the copyright
hears was funny he was quoted as saying
that that he was scoping out some of the
aesthetics of the show booths okay which
sounds like completely has to be looking
at products poor people ripping off the
Apple products I mean like we've already
earlier talking about copycats in hello
apparently has a Ultrabook that looks
exactly like the Apple
book air without the Apple logo on the
front it's just a circle right the only
thing Wilson takes personal exception
tonight now the Big Apple fanboy no one
better touches Apple but I mean they're
there they're here obviously I we think
they're scouting out the competition
and it's a smart thing because let's be
honest a few manufacturers in terms of
you know the the voice-activated
televisions kind of beating Apple to the
punch on a lot of the technology we're
at least delivering it first to market
well they've announced a lot sure we
haven't actually seen like them being
announced
you know available in the Best Buy store
just yet right but you know it's almost
like strangely enough Kinect is more
leading the way rygaards right like
earlier this or later last year we saw
the new dashboard update that gave voice
control and motion control and it seems
like every TV manufacturers just
integrating it into the set sure right
so you can just wave it with TV
accidentally turn it on by speaking too
loudly out on right you know speaking of
Apple announcements they actually sent
out an invite today to an event on
January 19th in New York which will
probably be at Cena will definitely be
there that's gonna be at the Guggenheim
Museum it's supposedly an education
event and you know apples always really
nebulous about what exactly they're
gonna write but people are speculating
that it might be adding text books to
their iBook store that you guys hear
about these rumors Jesse I don't know
how I would do with a virtual like an
e-book in college right one you can't
sell them back at the end of the year
which that was my source back and buy
beer that was my source of income I
don't know you guys in college whenever
it was time to sell back it was like
cool I'm gonna be able to eat for a week
it's basically a glorified pawn shop at
you're actually buy like a real textbook
though is for like the notes written
into like the side of the book or
something right right but like I mean I
think this is a great thing that all
tablet manufacturers should really be
jumping into because those books were
heavy
can you speck every semester about $500
anyway right might as well get an iPad
and have them pre-loaded but I also
spend my time doodling in there
and yeah last time I checked doodling on
an e-book textbook for cop it's not
really nice ruins yeah you know they
should really disable all the other
features on the iPad if they're gonna
enable text books in the iBook store
right because there's just already too
many distractions to work with in the
classroom already without sending an
iPad into the mix right yeah just be
watching YouTube videos essentially
exactly I don't know I when I think
about college and how much has changed
since we've been we haven't been we're
not that old we haven't been out of
college that long yeah and I don't know
if we have any current college students
here I'm not sure about that but yeah
right here I'm always blown away at
seeing photos and everyone has a laptop
when I was in college no it was like oh
man look at that he's so ahead of the
curve with a laptop and got it's not
something that we were used to but now
everyone's you know got one in front of
them during lectures it's crazy yeah
I've heard about a lot of kids getting
jumped for actually using memo pads in
the classroom now it is get out of here
oh that's right so this is uh this is
something that came out on I lounge comm
and supposedly I lounge editor-in-chief
Jeremy Horowitz thinks he spotted an
iPad 3 on the table top of some careless
some careless vendor really like like
that would ever happen again
lilamon bars they've lived in every
welcome everywhere leaving one at CES is
dropping a bomb I can't believe that
that would actually happen yeah well he
had some pretty good credibility last
year he actually spotted the iPad 2 at
CES 2011 which ended up being the real
prototype he thinks he did it again this
year but the only discernible difference
that he could tell because it doesn't
power on robotically yeah is that it's
one millimeter thicker than the iPad 2
that's not a joke that's a big
millimeter can you spot one millimeter
how was he able to do that the table
yeah but one millimeter yet
so I mean that that suggests to a lot of
people that will have a higher
resolution display right because I
apparently have to use like bigger back
lights that sort of shine through sure
and because of that you'll also need a
thicker battery right we'll see people
are also speculating that they're gonna
have a gorilla grass glass screen right
gorilla glass screen on top of it which
means you can probably throw it down a
staircase and it'll survive that's a
great feature everyone I mean is that
something like what is it for you I know
you have a touch pit so you're nowhere
near on the same level I have no concern
but if you were to you know get into the
market for an iPad 3 something maybe
you'd want to buy what sort of feature
do you think people are clamoring for
the most personally I'm clamoring for
the ability to just plug it in use it as
a USB drag-and-drop movie backup viewer
right you know because that's what HP
touch right completely illegal don't ask
any questions
we're going to take one last break when
we come back Duane Brady here on the 404
we will be right back in just a second
stick around there's a lot more for
coming your way
all right welcome back to the 404
streaming live from CES 2012 we're here
at the C net stage eagerly awaiting
Wayne Brady's arrival but first before
we get to mr. Brady it's time to once
again check in on Charlie the cameraman
with the beaver cam okay Lord has a lot
more heads here that's fine he is
somewhere can we get him a telephone
book perhaps there it is look at those
just looking at why isn't anybody
screaming why I've yet to hear one
scream that's unacceptable that is what
he feeds on that is how he sustains life
girl do you like Tinker Bell all right
Justin you're really you're like a naps
guy I know you are your phone is riddled
with pointless apps yeah there's some
new cool apps that we're really excited
about here at CES tell us about that
right um well first of all I got into
apps just recently over the holiday
season right I showed my grandfather
something called the cam Wow app that
uses like photobooth features okay store
your face sure like funhouse sort of
exactly melted its face right off your
blown away guys
everyone have freaked out your
grandparents show them something like
that yeah but ever since then I had
gotten really into apps on my iPhone
right this is really cool one of our
reporters Erik Mack reported on this
from the CES floor it's called Escort
Live okay now listen if I told you that
I had downloaded an app called Escort
Live what would you think at Vegas
invaded it only works within the city
I don't know it's actually no but
actually Escort Live is social radar
detection okay speed traps bike off so
you know I do know a little bit about
that so explain to our drivers well I
just had something happen to me this is
actually going back a little bit
I had a robot give me a speeding ticket
is that is that ever happening you guys
where this camera takes a photo of your
license plate no human was present but
you're getting a ticket because I think
that's not fair well I mean now you that
you have this app you know you'll be
able to slow down to the appropriate 35
miles in a school zone right but I mean
that seems to me that it would take the
attention away off the driving process
something that I think is pretty
important you know eyes on the road ten
and two you know right and that people
should really be into when they're going
are they gonna change the name of the
app because I don't know if that's gonna
you know at least of the users that they
want an attention-grabber but the idea I
think is really cool so basically the
first person that sees a cop on the side
of the road trying to speed to get ready
well that person reports it and that
goes into the cloud and then they get
pulled over but then the next person
behind them is alerted you're taking one
for the team that kind of thing and like
you can see exactly how many people have
warned others about speed traps right
and then every 90 minutes it clears out
the database because obviously there
they move brakes and rope so yeah it's a
good way for crowdsource take it's like
this new sort of almost radar detector
you know not one that's mounted that
doesn't shut up on your windshield but
one word a legal one yeah I guess but
you know what if you don't have service
there maybe you know you don't get
you'll get caught in this trap that's
that's sort of a bummer right right
right yeah do you really want people
using looking at wall are driving down
the road
it seems safe to me alright there's
another the the one of the biggest
reasons why car accidents happen is
because someone gets distracted looking
at I think it's I think it's makeup
putting makeup makeup and shaving yeah
there's another app you're excited about
the dog litter no those are really cool
app on this is actually built into
Android and iPhones but last year you
know how Google Maps integrated indoor
mapping so that you could take tours of
things like airports really malls and
stuff like that someone found out that
you can actually use google indoor
mapping on your Android and iOS phone to
map the CES showroom floor real and we
all know you know you guys have walked
around it gets really confusing China
check out the South Hall the North Hall
there's all these different arrows right
Hathaway sure well if you go to Google
Maps indoors on your phone enable that
and it'll let you check out exactly
where the bathrooms are you can route
yourself with search directions and find
your way around the showroom so how do
now how does that work are you are you
with with the photos sort of technology
it basically gives you like a panorama
version of yeah exactly it's like taking
a walking tour in sort view mode you can
set like I'm at the Panasonic booth how
do I get to the bathroom right it's like
oh wait behind this guy pulling how do I
follow Justin Bieber around someone
should take a panorama in that I would
say that speaking of why don't we check
into the yeah can we do we have that
ability with us right now is going on
and go back to the Justin Bieber can
what he's doing once again not not tall
enough radio they're up there oh we have
an eyelash sure okay we have one eyelash
I can only imagine how miserable Charlie
is right now I mean he's a cool guy but
not a huge Justin Bieber fan I don't
think so I I hear oh so much about this
robot where's the robot no I think you
guys might be right Justin Bieber maybe
the robot they're showing off I guess so
we're still waiting on a Wayne Brady to
get here apparently he's here but he's
walking he's trying to park or something
yeah
I didn't know that he was bringing
himself here but uh I guess maybe we can
look to the audience right now all right
what's standing out at CES with you guys
what's been the biggest you know product
that you've been psyched about anybody
feel free raise your hand you'll win a
shirt if you just speak how about that
yeah yeah is it what do you work for
them how much are they paying you sir
all right so we have yowza anyone else
care to share something guess you dear
I'm sorry Pierre ear all right okay I
think we're just getting suckered and
yeah we really just Shelly no we're 3d
printers what's that
air like meal technology said nm here
feel like Google Wallet right right
that's not on my Galaxy Nexus for all
right everyone well you'll get a CNET
New York t-shirt
we're still waiting here for mr. Wayne
Brady I have you now I'll talk about
something I got to see it sure I got to
see that we you everyone know about Wii
U everyone excited about Larry but they
aren't initially presenting here at CES
right they sorta have a behind closed
doors meeting system going on and Wilson
and I were there yesterday we got to
play a little more with we you you had
never seen it I saw back at e3 woody I
want to get your impressions of it cuz
you you hate a lot you're sort of like
me you're very you're first skeptical
and I'm very skeptical of the Nintendo
we are fine I got to pick it up and play
with it a little bit right um it's it's
pretty cool but at the same time you
know connect and well not the psi and
move but mostly connect still to me
seems like a lot cooler right I like the
idea of beyond to look down and actually
have supplemental you know informations
yeah while you're playing a bit
absolutely but beyond that it's you know
it's cool the graphics definitely look a
little bit better than I expected this
year but it's it doesn't give me
that next generation feel okay the
tripod mount for the controller because
that thing looks really really it's
pretty intense it's a large controller
yeah anyone excited about Wii U you guys
into it they sorta had a
lutely a burrito crowd to me veto do you
guys think about PlayStation Vita thumbs
up all around
I've had I've had a Japanese Vita for a
couple weeks now what what was that you
have one two on you right now
it's downstairs it's always downstairs
it's with Bieber yeah I played the the
Vita for a while now and I've been
playing and I just got to say everyone
if you do get one get Uncharted that
game is unbelievable it's like playing
PlayStation 3 in your hands really cool
stuff and actually tomorrow we're gonna
have john kohler from we will from sony
he's going to come up here and show us
all about the US version of the Vita
which is going to be pretty cool
apparently just announced that their
press conference I believe two days ago
that Netflix will be jumping on board as
a list of apps so uh how are you waiting
what's going on nothing much I apologize
for my tardiness the guy that was
driving me here I've been driving around
the parking lot wanted people he knew he
could just wrap you up he just wanted to
drive you know I've been in Vegas about
45 years well I've been here 25 years
now - I love the advice the cabbies give
you like in Vegas when you're driving
you know you get in the cab and the
first thing they ask you is like oh
where are you going well if I know a
couple of guys who could hook you up
here this is the dirtiest place on earth
I'll be honest if there's anyone here
that's a local and and you're upset with
that will too damn bad because yes the
dirtiest place those cab drivers and
even some of the limo guys - into that
they look very very upstanding and then
you get in the car nice to meet you mr.
birdie pleasure you know I got a cousin
we go there to coach what do you talk
about oh sorry mr. Brady not to mess
with him - he's make you normal cop like
Seagal have a badge and realize yeah so
how are you enjoying yourself fitzy yes
well this is I just walked in to CES
right now like I was just assured inside
so I plan on spending the afternoon I'm
I'm a big technophile and and this says
I've got the gotten the opportunity past
couple years to actually play here for a
few different venues all right now and
it's been an amazing experience to be to
be able to see the latest things and to
touch them and to get stuff ya know this
is a this is like a big get free stuff
for for geeks and nerds it's the best
thing that we we could ever have this is
for Christmas this is Christmas pool for
people that love electronics girls
smiles yeah just give me something that
blitz and whistles and I'm content yes
because this I can turn off
oh look I'm playing with it this is
awesome we're talking about games before
I found out you're actually a big gamer
you're so yeah true you're smirking like
you're about to admit something yeah I
just lost a few weeks of my life to to
Skyrim I am right there with you sir now
I'm glad that I'm in a room full of
people yeah because in the wrong setting
in Vegas you know a guy like you know my
cousin had to go yeah that's a that's
consumed a bunch of my life and the new
the new modern warfare absolutely I've
been online playing angry racist 13-year
olds from Nebraska for months now what
is it with that do they give more copies
down there I don't understand how to
give is up with that
it's a and they're all so young yeah and
the youngest ones talk the most crap so
actually EA named you one of the 20 most
influential gamers last year what did
that was that like that was amazing they
came on the set of let's make a deal and
they had this box and and inside the box
was a trophy okay big now not just oh I
went down to Al's trophy shop right they
went to Tiffany's it had a trophy mate
they're all only 20 of these people 2020
would get given out and I got a trophy
and they gave me a Letterman's jacket a
really cool leather Letterman's jacket I
don't even have a right like they make
me feel like I just accomplished
something but like I should've been
walking in slow motion and big music
behind me you did it Wayne Brady
you wasted your hours
gratulations here take it you've earned
the end they gave me free games and and
and just the title alone because a lot
of folks don't know like now but folks
don't know that I'm a gamer right and
I've been a gamer for here is that it's
actually in my contract when I play gigs
like out here in Vegas or tour and even
the TV show I have to have a ps3 and a
360 in my room you are my idol it's an
every writer and see like some guys on
TV or movies or not well I need to have
the M&amp;amp;Ms and this and getting a crack at
these treats as well as I've got my
video games I'm good to go because the
games keep me from hurting people in
real life just killing people left and
right because so many people walk up to
me with a hay Wain do I have to choke a
bitch if you have that every single game
you want to go off on someone as well
and get the poison out that yes I play I
call up Greg Grunberg and and then we
get online and we play and we hang out
and then you don't have to hurt people
I'm totally understandable well is there
any other games you're looking forward
to or tech you're looking forward to in
2012 in particular yeah like what's your
most anticipated games wow you know what
i think i've i've kept my head down so
much i don't really know what's coming
out now what's on the books well there
probably be another Call of Duty game I
would imagine
well there's one all the time and so
that yes I'm sort of redundant so movie
Call of Duty wats Call of Duty
Sacramento when you mentioned that
you're into online multiplayer video
games but are you also until like social
networking games are you like doing the
farmville Zynga thing or are you like me
and can't stand folks like that okay
there's no judgment here part of me
wanting to do these shows and whatnot is
to show my online love and become a part
of the social media family but I have to
say with a little bit of scoffing and a
teeny bit of derision I judge the
farmville because I love video games so
I don't judge farmville because I know
the social aspect that people get
together and blue
Oh Jimmy wants to sell me a chicken
don't want a chicken in real life I'd go
to Georgia yeah so I don't need Jimmy to
sell me one online for sure so in
videogames I look for a visceral
experience that takes me someplace it
see it it puts me into another world
just like a movie or a book
farmville does not put me into another
world
if I were eight and loved unicorns yes I
mean yeah for an eight-year-old for sure
yes but I'm not a big fan of home I
think I'm gonna try to play that there
is one though that I saw that looks
interesting the Mafia Wars okay maybe
I'll jump in that right if I can't
really shoot someone in real time then I
don't know if I want if I don't see
blood yeah and then if in multiplayer
there isn't a talk where where my guy
goes so do you feel that you know iPad
games are a huge business they're
selling millions of these games they're
99 cents a pop super cheap I come from
the school of thought that yeah that's
nice if I'm in the waiting room and a
doctor's office I need a real sort of
you know handheld I need buttons to be
honest get in there get shopping sushi
and I'm cutting strings yeah that's
great all the Bible throw birds at as
many pigs all day but give me you know
buttons gimme triggers have you had a
chance to check out the the PlayStation
Vita that's coming up have you heard
about the Vita you just made me rekt I'm
so sorry to share that with everyone but
you said you said PlayStation Vita and I
got stirred is that wrong that I came to
Vegas and nothing else third me yeah did
you say PlayStation Vita and now I'm
Wow I'm sorry well you're welcome yeah
there they have a portable gaming system
that's already on Japan coming out here
February 22nd I guess I'm gonna get you
on why did they get the best stuff first
over in Japan so you saw is it a dish so
it's downloadable content so it's
downloadable games or it's gonna come in
like a little card that you pop in on
the top they already have Uncharted of
you are you familiar come on oh that's
fantastic
I'm sure a Playstation 3 really because
you made me a little skeptical with the
card thing because I think we've all
seen remember those old-school that that
I forget the system that there was a
card video game system where it was the
wave of the future where you take the
cards and you swipe him instead of
cartridges right and the cards never
worked they banned and the images came
out looking like someone smashed your
LCD screen yes wasn't didn't take off no
this is a different sort of thing I
think cartridges are sort of lame but
you know they look like little SD cards
you pop them in and you know they have a
chart adjust fitting on this little
micro SD card
oh hello I'm waiting for the day where
you're gonna have to blow into the now
I'm waiting because the great thing
about shows like this in technologies
this is a 12 2012 you know third 39 so
I'm excited as a gamer because I think
that my school of gamers my generation
you know born in 71 71 72 as we've
gotten older now by the time that we
turn 60 you'll be able to have virtual
reality that is better than anything
that you played I hope and yeah that's
what I'm hoping that yeah like there's
so many diseases that that do that could
be cured no get it no okay don't worry
about that that'll fix it I want to be
on a holodeck so I want my body to be
withering away while I'm running away
from the farm aliens in in a virtual
space you know that's something we bring
up all the time you know
I'm about to turn 30 I'm Oh still a big
gamer I think about when I'm you know at
that grandfatherly age am I still going
to have that reaction time yes yes as
long as your thumbs work as long as this
can happen that's it find that like
Michael Jackson experience and a
black-eyed peas experience but probably
for the huge there's a blood type he's
experienced oh yeah Wow yeah are you
into the dancing games yes I just got
Just Dance 3 all right and now we have
Just Dance 3 parties and 4 and and I'm
gonna start posting my videos online of
us playing these men invite folks over
because I've got to tell you and this is
know I killed that game yes I'm a dancer
yeah I killed that game I'm making up my
own moves and laughing at my age
relation I'm talking smack to my 8 year
old and her friends and when the round
is over they lose then I grab their
hands and cousin have the goats you can
