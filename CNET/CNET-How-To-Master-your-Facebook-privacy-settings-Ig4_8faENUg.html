settings it can be hard to keep track of
who's seeing what on your profile I'm
dan Graziano in this how-to I'm going to
show you how to tighten up your facebook
settings to ensure that your information
isn't available to just anyone
venture over to your Facebook page click
on the down arrow at the top right hand
corner of your screen select settings
and then privacy first we're going to
change who can see your post I prefer to
only share my status updates with my
friends but in the who can see my future
post section you can choose to share
them with the public your friends only
yourself a custom list of people or
specific group
however this setting only changes the
visibility of your future post you can
individually change your older posts by
clicking on the activity log which will
show you all the updates you've posted
like or commented on to automatically
change all of your old posts to only be
visible to your friends click on the
limit pass post options followed by the
limit old post button if you would like
a single status update to be visible to
a different group of people click on the
drop down menu next to the post button
when writing a new status next up let's
change who can contact you by default
Facebook allows anyone to send you a
friend request and messages in the
privacy settings you will find an option
to allow only friends of friends to send
your request and change your inbox to
strict filtering which will limit your
inbox messages to only those from your
friends in addition to changing who can
look you up using our email address or
phone number to things that are also
found in the privacy settings the last
thing you will want to change is
preventing search engines like Google
and Bing from linking to your profile in
the privacy settings simply click on the
edit button next to where it reads do
you want other search engines to link to
your Timeline and make sure the let
other search engines link to your
Timeline box is unchecked for more
