Auto Show that Audi unveiled the
third-generation TT the 2015 model now
six months later we've got the Roadster
version just in time for winter earthly
the roadster does away with the token
rear seats found on the hardtop instead
you get a power soft top which is made
with magnesium and aluminum components
saving some six pounds over the previous
version the convertible but still you're
gonna pay about a 200 pound penalty over
the hardtop version weighs about 2,900
pounds the interior of the Roadster is
much the same as in the hardtop - the
obvious difference of course we're
sitting in an S model which gets nice
quilted leather seats and a lot of other
little interior details let's separate
it from the base model but the most
important piece is this twelve point
three inch virtual dashboard six waited
here behind the steering wheel you get
all the information that you need
through this one display including speed
engine rpm is controlled by the Audi MMI
system with this touch wheel here that
we have fallen in love with on other
cars works right here Invidia power
gives you plenty of performance so it's
nice and responsive and this is one of
the coolest pieces of car tech we've
seen a long long time
it'll be two motors on option for the TT
Roadster base will be a four-cylinder
turbocharged diesel motor 180 horsepower
and 55 miles per gallon this one's got
the Petzl version here also a four
cylinder also turbocharged putting out
310 horsepower consumption drops to
about 30 miles per gallon but it will
gets to zero to 60 in about 4.9 seconds
which is pretty respectable base
transmission will be a 6-speed manual
but there will be a dual-clutch
six-speed available as well you want to
enable extra for us pricing has not been
announced but look at about 39,000 euro
in the UK the start we're gonna be
probably expecting something in the mid
40s the US when this is available early
next year to students at the Paris Auto
Show looking at the new Audi TT throats</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
