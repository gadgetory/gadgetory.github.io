picture to Facebook anyway well it goes
from your computer through a bunch of
wires out of your city and travels at
nearly the speed of light until it gets
here this is Facebook's first data
center located in Prineville Oregon to
call it massive is an understatement
it's got buildings big enough to fit
four football fields in and all of it so
that you can view that throwbackthursday
photo whenever you want so Facebook has
six data centers around the world all
but two of which are in the United
States this one was the first and it's
quite a sight many of the technologies
inside were invented by Facebook one
example is air cooling Oregon's nice and
cool and Facebook realized that it can
take air from the outside mix it with
water and computer exhaust and find a
way to cool its computers without
needing to use energy sucking air
conditioners why cold air well computers
can't run too hot or they just don't
work right they also can't run too cool
or they have the same problem behind all
those blinking lights that's Facebook so
is this and this and this how much of
Facebook is stored here well all of it
if Facebook's other five data centers
were suddenly to stop working you could
still rewatch your old ice bucket
challenge video and Facebook hopes you
won't even be able to tell anything was
wrong by the way there are exactly 10
people on staff who fix computers all
day long Facebook is experimenting with
testing its app on a bunch of different
phones even old ones dating back as far
as 2011 the last little nugget a
computer that can learn to paint this is
a computer program analyzing thousands
of paintings and then using that
information to paint one of its own</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
