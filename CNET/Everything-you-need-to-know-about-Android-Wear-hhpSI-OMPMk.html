new wave of smartwatches unless you've
been keeping a keen eye on all the tech
news it might be difficult to quite
grasp exactly what Android wear really
is and why it's important so let me take
you through it Android wear is as my
name suggests Android that you wear the
watch connects to your Android phone
acting almost as a second screen using
your phone's internet connection to
display notifications and other
information it's best to think of it as
taking Google now from your phone and
squashing it into a watch like Google
now Android wear aim to show you
important information on your watch
right when you need it without having to
get your phone out and search for
yourself you can perform searches on it
and control music playing on your phone
see incoming calls messages and other
alerts and surprise surprise it even
tells the time the information is
presented as cards that pop up that you
can swipe through on the touch screen
but you can also perform actions using
voice commands unlike with Android on
phones Android wear is not skinned by
manufacturers meaning that each watch
runs plain untampered versions of the
software that allows for an identical
user experience across all watches and
by key from the architecture the same
it's much easier for app developers to
create their apps there are various
absolutely download on your phone that
have some interaction with the watch
recipe app cook bad for example lets you
find a recipe on the phone then follow
it step by step on the watch there
aren't many apps to get particularly
excited about just yet but as Google has
done it's best to make it easy for
developers to create apps we should
start to see the shells filling out soon
although it's exciting to think of
wearable technology as the next big
thing there's not yet anything that
Android wear smartwatches offer that
makes them a critical purchase instead
of just a novelty buy for the dedicated
gadget geeks its early days though and
with most of the biggest tech runs on
board we're certainly going to continue
to see more models arriving and more
refinements to the software in the
future the next big thing in technology
may not be here just yet but watch space
as it might be just around the corner</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
