enthusiasts compact and the g15 is a
respectable follow-up to that model it's
a little faster with a somewhat
redesigned body and it's got a similar
feature set plus roughly the same photo
quality although at a slightly higher
resolution large but with a shallow grip
it's a little lighter than its
predecessor but still feels solid and
substantial most of the weight loss
comes from surgery Canon cut off the
articulated LCD that's too bad because
the moveable LCD is one of the main
reasons to opt for a camera this size
over a more compact version that plus
the optical viewfinder in the hotshoe
Canon also moved some stuff around on
the body like switching to a pop-up
flash moving the ISO dial to a button on
the back and stacking the mode dial and
exposure compensation dial in an
interesting offset design the controls
are pretty easy to access and operate
though I still think the placement of
the front dials awkward and the record
buttons too hard to feel and press while
JPEG photos don't really stand up to a
pixel peeping level of scrutiny beyond
ISO 200 you can get more mileage out of
RAW files as high as ISO 1600 even for
prints and especially if you're not
planning to view them at a hundred
percent the camera does have a not
uncommon tendency to blow out highlights
but the color and other aspects of the
exposure fare pretty well
the best part of the camera though is
the lens it's fast the maximum aperture
tops out at a nice F 2.8 at the longest
focal length and is fairly sharp in the
center though somewhat subject to
distortion at the sides even at a 50
millimeter equivalent angle of view
Canon improved the autofocus performance
for the g15 making it a lot faster for
shooting in good light in dim light it
hasn't changed much and it's still a bit
slow going from shop to shop while it
doesn't offer best-in-class photo
quality like the more expensive Sony
rx100 it does have the viewfinder and
shoe that the sony lacks and it remains
an all-around good option for advanced
photographers who like jacket pocket
portable
I'm already grinning and this is the
canon powershot diamond</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
