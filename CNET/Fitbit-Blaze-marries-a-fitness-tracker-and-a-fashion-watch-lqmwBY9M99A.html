belays it's a watch it joins a whopping
seven other Fitbit trackers to choose
from how is this different and what
makes it better or worse than an Apple
watch price it costs $200.00 that's $50
more than the best Fitbit the charge HR
but it's a lot less than an Apple watch
sport extra bands cost more though you
can get steel or leather no apps but
features you get a color touchscreen
better design and you get text calendar
and incoming call pings it can record
workouts it has a stopwatch and a timer
and it shows your exercise it tracks
heart rate steps stair climbing and
sleep automatically there are four watch
faces and that's it longer battery life
the battery lasts over four days Apple
watch lasts about a day and a half
weirdly designed it pops out into new
bands and accessories blaze tries to be
stylish its charger is bizarre do people
want to wear one let's say the reaction
is pretty mixed it's just a fitness
tracker Fitbit blaze doesn't do anything
magically new it tracks heart rate just
like other trackers erratically but at
least it's always on and it tracks what
you do pretty automatically
if it's app is full of helpful stats and
it's the app most people use but it's
got strange features built-in fitstar
workouts which are on the watch are just
timers with gifts it's impossible to
really know what I'm doing or if I'm
even doing it wrong obviously I am I
mean a trainer will be helping me avoid
hurting myself
that's Fitbit blaze if you want a basic
fitness watch and you don't mind
charging a couple of times a week this
is for you but don't expect more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
