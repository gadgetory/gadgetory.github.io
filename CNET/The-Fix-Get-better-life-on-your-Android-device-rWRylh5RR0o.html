for having a short battery life but if
you spend a few minutes with your phone
settings you can easily turn that around
today I'm showing you a few tips using
the Nexus 5 running Android 4.4 KitKat
but if you have any phone running 4.1
and above these tips will apply to you
too for starters tone down that GPS
there are lots of ways that sucks up
your battery life even when you're not
using Google Maps so head on over to
your phone settings then location and
choose location services from the bottom
here and you'll want to disable both
location reporting and location history
chances are you're probably not using
them and another tip for GPS back in
that location menu head on over to mode
and choose battery saving mode when you
don't absolutely need pinpoint location
reporting this way your phone will use
less resources to find out where you are
and here's another really good tip you
know Google now ok Google where is the
nearest pizza place you might not
realize it's using a lot of your battery
life so head on over to the Google now
interface and scroll all the way up to
this magic wand tap it and from here you
can see what Google now is showing you
you've got your sports teams your stocks
your places the ones I use the most
battery life are again the ones that
rely on GPS so go down to everything
else and disable all of the features
that you really don't need like traffic
reporting and nearby places if you don't
use those features you're just wasting
battery life for absolutely no reason
and here's one that everyone should know
even you iOS and Windows Phone users
Wi-Fi and brightness will always hog the
lion's share of your battery life of
course you don't want to disable Wi-Fi
you still need to use it but to soften
the blow
head on over to your settings and then
to Wi-Fi and here tap the menu button
and go to advanced
in this menu disable scanning always
available so it's not looking for
networks when you're not trying to
connect to Wi-Fi for brightness make
sure that auto is disabled and that
you're adjusting your brightness
manually to the lowest comfortable
setting you'll be surprised how much
battery it saves you finally there may
be some apps that are draining your
battery life without you even realizing
it so to find out what those apps are
and to get a sense of your battery usage
in general go to settings then battery
and here you'll have a list of apps and
services that are using your battery
with the top two almost always being
your screen and of course Wi-Fi so there
you have it hopefully those tips will
help you get a little bit more mileage
out of your Android phone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
