require years of lessons to master in
fact you don't need any musical
experience to create your own beats with
blocks this 4x4 inch lighted touchpad is
a brand new type of music system
designed to be friendly for anyone to
learn even if you're intimidated by
creating your own music but it also can
grow into an advanced tool for
professional performances here's how
blocks works the pressure-sensitive
silicon surface shows lights on a grid
each block represents a different note
use an app to choose your instrument or
sounds and choose a scale be it major
minor or something more advanced each
scale has its own light pattern stay in
the lights and you'll stay in harmony
you can glide between notes bending the
pigeons sliding into the next note just
by dragging a finger sounds respond to
how hard you press down make a beat save
it to a loop switch instruments or
sounds and keep layering beats on top of
one another
at launch there are 128 sounds available
through the online network noise fm the
site is also where you'll find a
community of other artists sharing their
Tunes even well-known musicians like
Grimes Steve Aoki and RZA are
contributing and making their own sound
packs if you download someone else's
performance the app lights up to show
you how the person hit the notes so you
can play along to learn or even remix
their work and about that app it's
called noise it's a free download in the
Apple App Store so if you're curious
about blocks you can try the app before
buying the whole setup blocks is a
creation of london-based company Roley
previously Roley put a new spin on the
keyboard with an instrument called the
Seaboard
blocks takes that concept and packs it
down into a square light grid the light
pad block and the app is all you need to
get started but you can magnetically
snap on more blocks for more control
including two smaller ones with shortcut
buttons they attach to any of the four
sides the main light pad block cost
about 180 dollars or 170 pounds in the
UK the smaller control pad blocks will
run about $80 or 70 pounds each there's
another cost you may not realize it
requires an iPad or iPhone to play the
music there's no audio output on the
blocks it's sending the sound to the app
over Bluetooth which in this demo was
playing through a speaker oh and if you
want to save and share your creation
with others you're only able to do so in
the noise FM network but the creator's
say additional sharing and saving
functions are planned for future updates
there's also no Android app but that's
coming eventually for now it's just for
iOS and Apple is the exclusive retail
outlet for blocks for CNET I'm Bridget
