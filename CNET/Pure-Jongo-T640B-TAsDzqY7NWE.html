Vegas taking a look at the pure t 640 be
it may not have the snappiest name but
pure is hoping that this speaker will
stick in your memory anyway this matte
black version doesn't look particularly
bombastic but it also comes in a white
version and you can spice both models up
by buying accessory grills which come in
a range of different colors it's not too
massive so I won't take up too much
space in your living room it's got 5
inch speakers and it pumps out 100 watts
of noise pule tells me that you'll also
be able to turn this speaker round and
balance it in portrait mode and that the
logo will also swivel so that it doesn't
look weird when you do that this is a
prototype model however so we can't show
you what it looked like sells alright so
far but there is a kicker this speaker
doesn't have airplay which is Apple's
wireless audio technology you can stream
music over Wi-Fi still bite you're going
to have to use pures own app on the plus
side that app lets you control the
volume of different speakers in your
house from a single interface and it
works on Android and iOS this smaller
device serves as a kind of internet
adapter for your gear so you can connect
this to your existing speakers and then
you can control them using that pure app
that I mentioned earlier the t-64 TB is
going to cost 329 dollars while the
smaller adapter will set you back 119
both the t-64 TV and the hifi adapter
will be out around March April time on
the Westway and be sure to keep it seen
it but everything related to CES 2013</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
