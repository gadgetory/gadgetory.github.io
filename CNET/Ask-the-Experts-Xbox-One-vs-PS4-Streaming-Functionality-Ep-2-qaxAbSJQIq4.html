everyone welcome to today's episode of
ask the experts me and Jeff Bakalar here
from cnet well I guess I'm from gamespot
we're working together we're going to
answer your questions about next-gen
consoles playstation 4 and the Xbox one
we're going to start today question from
Nico who wants to know how does twitch
TV streaming work on the Xbox one should
have done that in the grand theft auto
four boys this is my cousin I tell you
about neko miko thank you for asking
that question all the way from liberty
city right there okay so here's the the
deal with streaming to twitch on Xbox
one there is no deal right now you just
can't do it yeah and out of the gate you
can only stream live broadcast content
gameplay to PlayStation 4 which offers
Ustream and twitch TV that functionality
is coming to Xbox one but right now
correct me if I'm wrong you can only
watch twitch content on your xbox yeah
it's just a one-way street you can watch
the content microsoft has said that they
hope to bring twitch TV streaming
support you know broadcasting your
gameplay in the first part of 2014 which
is really vague and the reason behind
that is that they want to have the app
at the level of expectations of the
twitch audience the level that Sony was
able to do well Sony's this out of the
bah Sony's is pretty good it I think
it's really it is yeah it's very easy to
do once you put your account in it's as
simple as like two or three steps one of
the more popular features for Twitter
which has traditionally been used on PCs
is the ability to archive streams and
access emulator right but for the
PlayStation 4 even though you can stream
right to twitch you can't archive your
streams sony has gone on the record is
saying that that's something that they
want to add in the future but a lot of
this stuff is going to change what's
really cool is you can you sort of have
control especially on ps4 you can change
the way the share button works when we
talk about like screen grabs right now
Xbox there really is no option is no way
to get screenshots at all which is a
game footage but right kind of crazy
right that doesn't that seem like way
more simple than actual footage anyway
nevertheless you can grab a screen grab
from any PlayStation 4 game you play and
you could even bind and choose the
binding
to one of the buttons so if you want the
share button to double click and have
that be the screen grab button that
little hot key you can set it up that
way so that's really cool you have that
sort of customization option available
to you which is pretty red from the xbox
one anything you captured this video
goes to your SkyDrive you then have to
go on your PC grab the video off there
and upload it to Facebook or YouTube or
wherever if you have more options
because way more hoops to jump through
to get to that point how about how long
does it allow you to grab you can grab
up to five minutes and the system
automatically records the last five so
we can jump in to upload studio and we
need to leave that footage if you just
say Xbox upload that it'll grab the last
30 seconds and upload it to your
SkyDrive immediate also a good thing to
point out is that xbox one will actually
for example rise will actually record
certain achievements that you do right
it does it choose a you know sort of
like a unique experience to that console
our next question is from Tucker he
lives in facebook land and he wants to
know if xbox one will record your game
party chat oh no right you got to get
away for the whole thing okay your game
party chat so let's say you're with a
bunch of buddies you're playing ghosts
you're on the same sort of part each
area when you record gameplay footage
with the DVR will it also grab your
check no still still no oh that sucks
yeah then what you can do right now
actually with the video that you have
recorded on the xbox one taking an
upload studio you can edit it a little
bit and you can add narration there or
you can also do picture and picture
using the Kinect camera which may be
some of the stuff they're integrating
the twitch streaming down the road and
it's kind of cool because you know while
it's great to do live commentary we look
like that sometimes you want to gather
your thoughts a little bit you won't
have a more I have a higher production
value of your game DVR if you will you
could do it after the fact which works
out I had a great presentation for
Microsoft where they were showing us how
you added the picture-in-picture
narration so he reacts playing it oh the
recorded footage in the screen don't do
that well do it if you want but we all
know what you're doing right don't we
just don't do that
Jeff that does it for today's episode of
ask the experts we're curious to see
where all the streaming is going to go
in the future nice you're pretty
important join us again for more
episodes this week and next we answer
your questions about next-gen consoles
