you the most beautiful piece of metal
King Hardware ever and we're talking
about the Apple extreme here is oh but
rather the mini version of it the
airport express base station from Apple
now this thing is so beautiful
that's bad now have nothing against
looking good
but this device looked so great that it
produces the correct spec tation that is
performance and feature do not match now
it's been four years in the previous
ever Express model let's see what this
new router has that the previous one
didn't there are three things first the
new railroad now support to do old man
meeting it works on a 2.4 kg hood and 5
gear hood simultaneously secondly it
comes with one LAN port
meaning that you can hook a white client
to it now unfortunately this port is not
gigabit but you can fix that by adding a
gigabit hop to it and the third it has a
standard aerial port that you can plug
any south system to and that worked with
the Apple AirPlay feature that actually
really cool and that's it everything
else is basically the same for example
the routers USB port still does not
support storage devices but just
printers and only some of them in my
testing I found out that the routers
support only the dual stream setup of
Wallis and that Cabot 300 million people
second and not the three stream that
caps at 40 50 megabit per second there's
no support for the new ezio 2.7 AC
either the new routers still doesn't
have a web interface which means you
have to use the airport utility to
manage and monitor it but hey who care
about the web interface when this thing
look at this pretty in fact I suspect
that you care about how it performs
either so for that and all the
information check out the full review
co.com oh yes this router cost by one
hundred dollars which seemed pretty okay
amount ever product and in fact it works
really well for max user but hundred
dollars is a lot more than many
other more powerful rattles on the
market they don't look that sexy though
and speaking of section is once again my
name is dongho and this has been the
very first and quick look at the Apple's
new Apple a crashed base station</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
