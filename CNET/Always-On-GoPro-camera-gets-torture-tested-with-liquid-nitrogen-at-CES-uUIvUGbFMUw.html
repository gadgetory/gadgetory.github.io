for this little stunt from like the
County Fire Marshal and then the Clark
Kent Clark County Fire Department and
I'll be able to have a fire marshal
inspection this morning it's all been
extremely exciting for me
yeah these don't fit that well I'm just
gonna put them right here okay first up
let's go I think we should go with the
GoPro which look is recording yeah so as
it goes to its prior basket recording
the light is still plastic
have you know
the fryer basket not this one
look at that look though near as I can
tell even though there is cold smoke
coming off of it this is a highly
unexpected outcome lapsing how long is
it gonna I can feel the cold by the way
through these gloves which are like an
inch thick how long do you think it's
gonna take to warm up time is different
you know yes that's true all right well
we're gonna that I hear like cracking as
it's warming up though I think of
plastic it's starting to crack as it
warms up all right well this is dramatic
though because the camera inside still
okay I'm calling this a conditional
survival and I am pretty surprised</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
