Samsung Galaxy s4 this time it's the
active which is a more rugged version of
the s4 line let's get it out of here
before we do actually can I just say I
don't know why all the galaxy s4 phones
are not active or rugged in some way I
don't know why you need a different
version of a phone that's more dust
proof drop true for waterproof since
it's been my experience that all phones
could benefit from being dustproof drop
proof and waterproof nevertheless just
gets by a slightly different version if
you want it to stand up to your everyday
life rant over you know this packaging
right yeah I'm kind of over it there is
quad-core CPU etc etc the box here now
even though it's slightly more
ruggedized it actually doesn't feel much
larger and heavier there are some slight
physical differences that we'll get to
in a little bit but it's basically the
same sleek thin design as the regular s4
or the s4 mini or whichever s4 you
happen to encounter unlike your usual s4
s you've got a sticker back here to tell
you sort of how to seat the back cover
for maximum protection against humidity
and water firmly seal battery cover and
USB cover before use make sure to press
below the LED flash to make sure it gets
nice and secure through here there have
been a lot of different tests of the
waterproofness of this camera and we
will of course connect our own
but spoiler sounds like although it can
take a splash a dunking might be
slightly more questionable okay soft
slightly different design and then you
can see that there's sort of like a
rubberized steel all around the inside
of that back case there it looks a
little tougher on the inside I will say
that for those of you who complain that
the expo in the Galaxy line are a little
flimsy feeling
although the back is plastic it feels a
little sturdier and overall the phone
has a little bit more heft which is
actually kind of reassuring let's turn
it on one other physical difference that
you see right off the bat is that there
are physical buttons as opposed to the
touch buttons because those are not
always a conductive underwater I don't
think you're gonna be swimming with this
thing but nevertheless I actually really
liked the kind of brushed aluminum look
of this compared to something like now
obviously the white Galaxy s4 as a
slightly different look overall it
doesn't have that brush metal the darker
versions have obviously darker bezels
but this kind of has a cool
sophisticated slightly kind of tougher
vibe that I'm kind of digging
although size-wise you can see basically
the same just a tiny bit thicker not bad
usually recognized means bulky and ugly
although to me that's just another
reason why this could be just as tough
as
let's do the specs the Galaxy s4 active
has a 5-inch TFT display with 1920 by
1080 pixel resolution that's pretty good
resolution but this is not Samsung's
usual AMOLED display in fact reviewers
say it's considerably less vivid than
the s4 it runs Android 4.2 jelly bean
and of course has Samsung's proprietary
TouchWiz interface the processor is no
joke 1.9 gigahertz quad-core Qualcomm
Snapdragon 600 which is one of the
fastest currently available on mobile
phones
it also has 16 gigs of internal storage
and a micro SD card slot that's
expandable to hold up to 64 gigs
it also has micro USB for charging and 2
gigs of internal ram the battery is 2600
milliamp hours which is rated to 17
hours of talktime and up to 13 days on
standby like that would ever happen
the s4 active has a 2 megapixel front
facing camera and the back camera is 8
megapixels that's a lower resolution
than the original galaxy s4 but again
it's all about the sensor the camera
also features a new aqua mode which lets
you control and take photos underwater
the active includes all of the extra
software features of the s4 such as air
gestures air view smart gestures smart
pods
smart scroll smart unlock and touch wiz
widgets it costs $199 with a two-year
contract
setting aside my rage about the actual
existence of this phone or really the
fact that there are two to choose from
at all I'm thinking that I was in the
store and I was trying to choose between
the galaxy s4 and the galaxy s4 active
and I wasn't totally obsessed with
having my buttons you know
on the screen have to feedback instead
of physical buttons there is no reason
not to get the s4 active you can drop it
it's dustproof you could take it in the
water to me that's exactly what I want
my phone to do and it also does all of
the same things as the regular Galaxy s4
this seems like the obvious buy life is
hard on gadgets for the full review
though that aren't over to seen it and
