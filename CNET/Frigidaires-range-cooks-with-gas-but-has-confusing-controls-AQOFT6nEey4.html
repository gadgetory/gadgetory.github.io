of appliances and right now we're taking
an up-close look at the frigidaire FP GF
30 77 qf this range is gas-powered and
it cost 1699 that's definitely on the
high end as far as stoves go you
definitely have some premium styling
here it is coated in stainless steel and
the oven actually is a true European
convection oven five point six cubic
feet you also have a sturdy gas range on
top with five burners you also have this
very large 18,000 BTU burner right here
which is very good for heating up large
pots of water really quickly for boiling
vegetables or cooking pasta you also get
this power preheat mode which is
designed to heat up the oven a lot
quicker the only thing you have to be
aware of is that it only works in the
single rack mode and it uses the
convection fan to achieve that
temperature quickly this oven is also a
very solid performer it cooks relatively
quickly and also its oven can bake
pretty evenly as well one thing I don't
like about it is that you have this
touch panel up here that's extremely
small it's very confusing to operate you
can't even tell what's happening most of
the time the timer doesn't display the
seconds until you reach below one minute
that also means that you have to put in
one number higher than you actually want
so if you want 10 minutes you have to
put in 11 because it counts down
immediately from 59 seconds it's kind of
annoying I don't know why it does that
the lights on the front are actually
very hard to see from off angle so you
have to actually be staring straight at
it to really know if it's preheated or
not also the preheat chime is extremely
soft making it very easy to just miss
completely if you're in a large or noisy
environment so when you break it all
down this frigidaire range is a little
bit too expensive for what you get it
also doesn't have a lot of the features
that you want to get at this price point
so you're probably better off going with
a range from Kenmore Samsung or
KitchenAid
I'm Brian Bennett before seen it
appliances be sure to read my review of
this oven as well
