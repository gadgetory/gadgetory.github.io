manufacturers are basically giving
blu-ray players away most of them are
identical looks-wise features wise and
performance wise but does the Sony BDP
s3500 Pack hi I'm Ty panel Bri and Sony
has not one but four different blu-ray
players this year all with slightly
different features and the S 3200 fits
in the middle of the bunch its main
selling points are onboard wireless
smart TV and screen mirroring the things
that lacks 4k upscaling and 3d playback
you probably don't need this is a small
player and doesn't look like much it
lacks a front display and comes with an
outboard power brick connections are
very minimal with just one HDMI one
coaxial and one USB the players menu
system is a bit tired having tabooed on
the ps3 eight years ago but at least
it's mostly easy to navigate sadly
there's no easy way to access all of the
streaming services besides scrolling
down a very long list in performance
terms that performs just as well as the
others at the price with minimal
artifacts like jaggies or Giada and
upscaling DVDs works well to streaming
quality is also good if you're looking
to spend $100 on a player that's not
exactly exciting but will get you the
job done then the Sony BDP s3500
is a pretty good choice this is ty
