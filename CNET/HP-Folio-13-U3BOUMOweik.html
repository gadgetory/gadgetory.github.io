cnet.com now the ultrabooks of CES have
come and gone and they're gonna be a lot
more ultrabook still to come but one of
the most interesting solid and reliable
ones we've seen so far this year is the
HP folio 13 now this is a small business
oriented laptop it's technically an
ultrabook
although what is an ultrabook anyway at
this point the lines are getting so
blurred it's hard to figure it out what
this is is a 13 inch thin laptop with
SSD storage like a MacBook Air except
thicker than a MacBook Air and heavier
than a MacBook Air
what you are getting here is a more
affordable price $8.99 at its starting
point which compared to that 1200 or so
price of a MacBook Air is much more
affordable deal and you get 128
gigabytes of SSD storage 4 gigabytes of
RAM and you get that same zippy type of
Core i5 processor that's low voltage but
feels very nice and functionally fast on
these types of laptops you also get a
battery that lasts about 6 hours which
was really good maybe not quite as good
as a MacBook Air but approaching it and
you also get more ports on this check
out the ethernet also USB 3.0 and an SD
card slot a lot of those are missing on
a lot of other ultra books creating a
bit of a disconnect actually taking this
one out to CES was kind of fun because
the Ethernet port made it a little more
reliable for landlines now it is going
to take up more room in your backpack
but it's a little over three pounds and
it's still pretty light compared to
other laptops so it depends on what
you're comparing to it has a small
business type feel the brush metal lid
kind of a slightly no-nonsense design
but you know what it pays attention to
the details particularly the fact that
doesn't feel very flexi at all has a
nice rubberized bottom so it stays put
on your desk if you're typing a lot and
the keyboard is really nice it's full
size it has some nice key travel felt
really good when typing and the trackpad
is pretty large and uses a multi-touch
with a click pad type on it now
everything else is you know kind of par
for the course integrated graphics the
speakers are fine the webcams maybe a
little better than average what are you
using this thing for using it to write
using it to get online the startup time
the boot up time on this
really fast and the cold boot up time
from sleep or hibernation when you lift
the lid was also really zippy and
functional it doesn't make a slight
whirring sound when using it for a while
but if you play with those cool sense
controls for for cooling maybe you can
find a perfect middle zone for yourself
overall at 899 it's a really good value
and probably one of the best feeling
writing ultra books that we've seen I've
seen in the past year now if you want to
pay a little bit more spend $150 more
for Windows 7 Professional you can but
really at that $8.99 price it's really
got basically everything that you're
looking for
I'm Scott Stein and that's a quick look
