just bought a blackberry z10 I'm Bridget
Carey and this is your cnet update
blackberry is preparing to launch a
brand new flagship smartphone this
holiday season Cena has learned that
this all touchscreen phone will be
called the a-10 don't forget the z10
just went on sale in the US a little
over two months ago and blackberry is
already updating it oh and the model
with the physical keyboard the
blackberry q10 that just went on sale at
us stores this week with another top of
the line touchscreen this is blackberry
trying to drive home the message that it
can move beyond keyboards to compete
with the top smartphones today and by
updating the model so quickly you'll
probably see the z10 go on sale and that
means the company can target customers
shopping at different price points
there's not much detail yet about the
ATM but we do know that Sprint will sell
it in november and that's not the only
way BlackBerry's expanding a blackberry
executive has said the company is
working on getting the blackberry
messenger service appt preloaded on
phones from other manufacturers the
blackberry messenger app will also be
available to download from the ios and
android app stores this summer messaging
apps are very popular right now and
blackberry wants a part of that action
since after all it used to be the king
of the messaging apps looking ahead and
there is going to be a ton of news
coming your way next week the big video
game expo e3 begins Monday and we'll get
more details about the new xbox one and
playstation 4 Microsoft goes first with
a press conference at nine-thirty a.m.
pacific 1230 eastern and we hope
Microsoft will talk more about games for
this next-generation console and the big
question on everyone's mind how exactly
will this fee for use games work and
later on Monday Sony will finally show
us what the ps4 will actually look like
oh but that's not all kids the same time
Microsoft is having its press conference
Apple will be having a keynote event at
its developers conference and we expect
to see updates to its operating systems
as well as a few other surprises it's
possible Apple might talk about I radio
the streaming music service it's working
on there's also speculation that Apple
introduced new macbooks and maybe
just maybe a new iPad the Casemaker
gumdrop is so confident that Apple will
introduce the next iPad and it's already
selling cases based on sources that have
leaked specs which say the new iPad
would have a thinner bezel like the ipad
mini I guess we'll have to wait and see
if gumdrop just wasted a bunch of money
or if they were right the apple
announcement begins at ten a.m. Pacific
1 p.m. eastern you can follow the live
coverage of these events at seen it on
Monday and as always I'll be giving you
