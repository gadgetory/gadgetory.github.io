Carey on cnet com and it's time to get
loaded the kobo ebook reader is
following in the footsteps of Amazon's
Kindle Touch the Kobo is now also
offering a $99 touch e-reader that has
advertisements on the screen called Kobo
touch with offers there will be a banner
ad on the bottom menu and deals shown
when it is in sleep mode it'll be the
same as the current Kobo touch e-reader
except buying the ad-supported version
drops the price by thirty dollars the
new Kobo will ship in about two weeks
and this is a big launch week for E
readers the Amazon color tablet the
kindle fire started shipping today and
the barnes noble nook tablet hit stores
this week on wednesday google will be
having a press conference to talk about
a streaming online music service it is
launching called google music but
industry sources say that google has not
made a deal yet to use music from two
out of the four major music labels
Google's signed a deal to our with
Universal but it does not have a deal
yet with sony or warner and it's unclear
if there's a deal yet with emi so to be
a serious challenger to iTunes Google
needs to secure those deals but what's
making negotiations complicated is that
google reportedly wants to also store
your existing music in the cloud to in
other online music news there's a new
free streaming radio service launched in
a day from mixer the mixer social radio
app lets you browse and create your own
stations but the twist is that your
friends can jump into your music station
called the room and chat with other
listeners live the rooms playlist is
influenced by the collective interest of
the group and it knows what you like by
linking to facebook and seen what
artists you've listed as your favorites
users can also share their thoughts
about a song with friends and eventually
be able to send it occations to friends
you can tap your mastercard paypass at a
register to make a purchase or even a
Google Wallet enabled phone but would
you tap your card or phone on your
laptop to make an online payment
MasterCard and Intel are working to add
that technology in the future line of
ultrabooks the tap and pay feature will
use a near-field communication or NFC
which allows for wireless transaction
and the goal is to have in our next
year's computers would you break up with
someone over a text message email or
Facebook message well one third of
people surveyed said they have and I'm
not talking young teens these are adults
according to the study by lab 42
facebook is also the first place people
go when they like some
on more than half said the first
facebook friends someone they're
interested in but once they're in a
serious relationship only a quarter of
people would actually tell a friend
there in a relationship before updating
their profile relationship status so I
should just love what Facebook is done
to communication in romance those are
your headlines for today I'm Bridget
