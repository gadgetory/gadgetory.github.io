iPhone I'm Bridget Carey this is your C
nut update Apple Siri may be the most
well known smartphone assistant that
answers your voice commands but she's
got some competition
Microsoft has its own version called
Cortana you'll find her on Windows
Phones and the upcoming Windows 10
operating system for PCs but she's not
limited to Windows Microsoft announced
Cortana will be available on the iPhone
and on Android phones through an app
this Cortana companion app will first
come to Android at the end of June with
the iPhone version coming later this
year
her powers are somewhat limited outside
of Windows
she doesn't have deep access to change
things like specific phone settings or
open apps but she can do some basic
things like set reminders answer
questions or track flights Microsoft
also is making a Windows 10 companion
app to make sure your documents music
and photos can be available from your
phone through Microsoft onedrive the
benefit is of course if you have a
Windows 10 computer you can still get to
your files across your mobile phone
without owning a Windows Phone and in
case you were curious googles assistant
called Google now also works on iPhones
through the Google app but Google's
assistant doesn't have a female name or
a saucy voice and in other news the
periscope live video streaming app is
now available on android periscope which
is owned by twitter has been a popular
way for anyone to broadcast video from
an iphone since it launched a little
over two months ago twitter said
periscope had more than 1 million users
within its first 10 days the Android
version is going to be the same it lets
you tweet a link to your live video
broadcast and you can chat with viewers
Android users though will get more
control over notifications such as when
a follower goes live its biggest
competitor is meerkat both of which are
becoming a new way to share news or
broadcast your personal life to a social
media audience meerkat launched on
Android about a month ago both apps are
a bit buggy but periscope is more
popular and slightly less buggy
it looks like Amazon is getting into
crafty
to take on Etsy Amazon has been emailing
some sellers on the site Etsy it's a
popular destination for handmade goods
and it's asking for their interest in
selling their creations on Amazon Amazon
has not launched anything officially yet
but this query refers to something
called handmade at Amazon it asks
curious sellers about what types of
items they sell promising to stay in
touch while it sets up shop Etsy charges
sellers lower fees compared to Amazon
but Amazon could pull business away from
Etsy with shipping deals for Prime
members then again not every crafter may
be able to ship something out in two
days for prime if it's custom made
that's all for this tech news update but
there's more at sea Netcom from our
studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
