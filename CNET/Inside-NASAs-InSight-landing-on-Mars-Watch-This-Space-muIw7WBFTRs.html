visitor has officially touched down and
it's ready to start its two-year mission
to survey the interior of the red planet
but now that it's arrived safe and sound
can we all talk about how freaked out we
were also the big question who invented
that special NASA handshake I'm Claire
Railly welcome to watch this space from
the Senate studios in Sydney this is
your weekly guide to everything on earth
you need to know about space and tonight
nASA has safely landed its insight
mission 91 million miles away on the
surface of Mars what have you done this
week that's right the team of scientists
at NASA JPL flew a seven hundred and
eighty nine pound Lander over 269
million miles to another planet
it hit the Martian atmosphere at twelve
thousand three hundred miles per hour
entered at the perfect angle then slowed
down deployed a parachute and blasted
out its own legs with pyrotechnics to
ensure a perfect touchdown all this done
with pre-programmed commands and no
control from earth talk about the
ultimate look mom no hands but it worked
shortly before noon Pacific time on
Monday the 26th of November it all went
off without a hitch and in sight landed
touchdown confirmed okay there's a few
things we need to get out of the way
first off that countdown incites
descending we're hearing the meters
countdown as it gets closer and closer
to the surface you couldn't write it
better if you're in Hollywood 200 meters
80 meters 60 meters but the best part of
the countdown was easily the insight
telecom team one of them looks like
they're about to go to Disneyland the
other one is just sitting there watching
the culmination of his life's work
lower quivering oh just roll the tape 50
meters continent velocity 37 meters 30
meters 20 meters 17 meters standing by
for touchdown there is literally no way
to watch that and not weep like a child
with you watching in Times Square or
sitting at your kitchen table in
Australia watching the live feed eating
peanut butter out of a jar and openly
crying at 7:00 a.m. not that I know also
let's talk about that handshake you just
know that between getting an entire
mission to another planet these two took
the time out to come up with the world's
best callsign for the NASA secret
Superfriends but all the celebrations
were kind of moot because while JPL and
the rest of the world were watching back
here on earth the landing had already
happened it takes about eight minutes
for signals to reach earth from Mars so
while we were biting our nails down here
on earth inside had already landed up
there and it was just chilling out
drinking margaritas and quite frankly it
deserves to according to NASA only about
40% of all missions sent to Mars have
been successful because it's hard work
which leads us to the seven minutes of
Terror that's the term that nASA uses to
describe the time it takes to get from
the top of the Martian atmosphere down
to the surface of
it takes thousands of steps to go from
the top of the atmosphere to the surface
and each one of them has to work
perfectly to be a successful mission and
for all that time remember we're on a
delay so while we're watching the most
difficult part of the mission go down
it's already happened when we first get
word that we've touched the top of the
atmosphere
the vehicle has been alive or dead on
the surface for at least seven minutes
Wow I feel so invested I don't know
about you but NASA makes damn good TV so
what exactly happened in those seven
minutes that made it so terrifying for
the insight mission according to NASA it
takes thousands of steps to go from the
top of the atmosphere to the surface of
Mars during the entry descent and
landing stage first insight needs to
ditch the crews stage that got it to
Mars then turn around so it's heat
shield faces the atmosphere it needs to
enter at a precise angle of 12 degrees
so it doesn't burn up or bounce off the
atmosphere all together after
decelerating from 13,000 to 1,000 miles
an hour
insight deploys a parachute blasts off
at each shield and then shoots out three
legs ready for landing the spacecraft
uses radar to measure how far it is from
the surface of Mars and once it's a mile
away the parachute separates from the
lander and the lander starts its engines
to safely descend to the surface before
shutting them off as soon as it touches
down so of all the steps of entry
descent and landing happened perfectly
and we are safely on the surface of Mars
we'll be ready to do some exciting new
science the good news all those steps
went off without a hitch
after flying through space alone for
more than six months with its commands
pre-programmed inside insight did us
proud and made the perfect landing all
by itself all that while its parents
waited nervously 90 million miles away
so what's next well inside is already
sending us back postcards from its new
home and from here the lander is going
to probe deeper into Mars than ever
before to learn more about its core as
well as measuring seismic activity and
measuring how much the planet shifts on
its axis from this we'll learn more
about the origins of Mars and even get
insight into how earth was formed yeah
kind of worth putting up with all the
terror for that all right that's it for
this week's edition of watch this space
now if you want to know more about
insight and the science behind the
mission check out last week's episode
and if you want to stay up to date with
space news as it happens
be sure to LIKE and subscribe I'm Claire
I Lika Sina goodnight and Godspeed
huh-huh you got to get that
yeah no I have no friends to shake my
hand yeah it's kind of new cuz I made
that up this is only gonna get worse and
a late up to Christmas</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
