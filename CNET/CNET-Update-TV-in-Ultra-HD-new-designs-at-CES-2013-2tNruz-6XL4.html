Carey and this is your see net update
happy 2013 update is back from winter
break and it's time to gear up for the
biggest tech show on earth the Consumer
Electronics Show
our coverage begins Sunday on cnet.com
but there's some news already coming out
about a few products Samsung is teasing
that it'll show off a television with a
new design at the show and on its blog
it posted this photo of a TV sitting
vertically instead of horizontally and
this photo is either implying that it's
a picture quality is very lifelike
or Samsung is hinting at a transparent
display where you can see what's behind
it we saw Samsung showing off
see-through screens
last year with a 22 inch transparent LCD
panel that was for retail stores expect
to also hear more about 4k TVs it's an
ultra high-definition resolution that
only makes sense if you have a really
huge TV screen and that's why
Westinghouse will be showing off 110
inch 4k LED TV now LG and Sony also have
84 inch TVs with 4k and they start at 20
grand don't count on this replacing your
current 1080p TV in stores anytime soon
the same goes with OLED screens on TVs
we'll see more of them but those price
tags will be high say around ten
thousand dollars LG also unveiled some
news about its televisions at the show
the company said LED backlights will be
standard across all LCD TVs so it will
no longer make TVs with florescent back
lights and there will be more smart TV
add-ons like an upgraded remote that has
natural voice recognition and some TVs
we'll have a camera expect something
twisted from Samsung there will be demos
of a bendable smartphone screen and a
bendable television screen these
flexible screens will have a higher
resolution than the ones we saw at last
year's CES but Samsung is not the only
one working on this concept LG enoki I
have recently demonstrated prototypes of
bendable screens today's app to watch is
a new iPhone app from Facebook that
parents should be aware of
it's called poke those who have the app
can send a short message photo or video
to another user and it
and ten seconds after seeing it an app
like this might encourage users to send
inappropriate or embarrassing photos
without fear or as a way for teens to
hide sexy from their parents since the
messages quickly vanish but this isn't
mission impossible these messages do not
really self-destruct anyone can take a
screenshot of the image you sent and the
video messages are stored in folders in
the phone's internal storage so it could
come back to haunt you later the same
goes with a similar app called snapchat
that's your tech news update you can get
links to all the stories I've mentioned
on our blog cnet.com slash
for our studios in New York I'm Bridget
