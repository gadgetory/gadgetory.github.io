players will ya yeah we helped a couple
of you guys iPod your car like we do
every week and we've also got a guy who
wants to know like what's what's really
even the point of all this car
technology I'm antuan goodwin with
Mitchell Chang on the control this is
seen at roadside assistance episode 44
the show where basically we in this case
me because I'm kind of here without the
help of Wayne or Brian Cooley they're
down driving a new Tesla Model this week
as we mentioned last week but this is
the show where we take a minute to
answer your emails your questions your
comments or tweet all of that so let's
get right into it because we have a ton
of emails this week this first one comes
in from Eric who asked last week who
basically last week was saying that you
know he did see a purpose in uh and in
having CD players in the car taking it
back another week we were talking about
the death the imminent death of the
optical media and cars on our other show
car tech live and an Eric basically one
state that there is another purpose to
having CDs and I guess for those who
didn't listen last week's show go back
and do it but basically Eric's point was
lossless audio was a gapless audio was
the advantage to having cities and we
pointed out that that actually still
exists Eric's back this week he has
another advantage and he says that
having a CD player in your car is good
for previewing albums before you decide
if you want to digitize them so yeah I
guess yes that's a good enough reason I
find my laptops good for that and indeed
I guess I bought one CD last year yeah I
got it on my laptop I don't know in the
last time I bought a CD was I think I
bought one TD lesser depends like we did
the last gorillaz album car last year or
the year before because that was the
last audio CD I went to a store and
purchased and we've got another email
about CD players this one comes in from
a victor in pasadena says hi guys i have
a 2010 mazda 5 with a six-cd changer his
daughter bought a few CDs into the car
and they were sliding all over the place
he was looking for a quick play
to stick them and he noticed that
there's a slot at the top of his dash so
he stacked him in there so he uses his
six disc CD changer for storage of his
daughter CDs he never listened to it he
doesn't know why it's there he basically
uses a 30-pin ipod connector and his a
USB port in the car to listen to most of
his music but basically he says that he
wished he would have had the opportunity
to save the money on that six disc CD
changer but I guess it's good to have it
in there for storing junk okay have a
good in every other cds yeah if it were
like a trade that popped out like on uh
on old desktops you could you know
dremel out a space for cup holder that
would be good you need more couple
anymore you can always use more cup
holders and you know I don't know if
it's just me but it seems like cup
holders or end cars are always a little
bit less than ideal the worst cup holder
and this is basically me complaining
about nothing but the worst cup holder
that I tested was in the the porsche
cayman s we had in last year yeah yeah
yeah now you probably don't want to
drink in that car anyway but I was in a
situation where I needed to get food
from point A to point B I wasn't gonna
eat it in the car I just needed to
transport it in the car and Porsche much
like BMW has those weird you know slide
out they kind of hinge out of a hidden
spot on the dashboard and basically I
don't know like a your drink ends up
floating out in space but unlike the BMW
the Porsche when just didn't seem to
lock into place so every time I took a
turn the drink would swing a couple of
degrees the left and to the right it was
terrifying extremely terrifying anyway
uh we got a question from from Twitter
this one comes in from Fun Zone radio he
says hey I need help with a new driver
to keep from drifting out of his Lane he
will take the driver's test in a few
weeks this is a pretty low-tech question
because I don't think you could use I
don't think you'd want to buy a car with
Lane keep assist just take a driver's
test and if you did I don't think they'd
let you use it well how do they know
it's on I think there'd be a light on
the dash oh yeah I guess so first artist
yeah but here's how i learned to stay in
my lane my dad taught me a neat trick is
that most roads that you find yourself
driving on have a nice oil slick down in
the middle of them just like right in
the middle of the lane and if you line
that up with that in about your right
knee your about in the middle of the
lane at most points that said the trick
that I that I use the lineup and I gave
my younger sister and impromptu driving
instruction last time I was at home and
that's pretty much what I told her it's
just like yeah line that oil slick up
with with your knee and you'll be about
in the middle of the lane also another
trick is to actually line your rear view
mirrors up it's a less than ideal but
it's good for getting used to how wide
the lane is but if you aim your rear
view mirrors just a little bit lower
than you normally would where you can
actually see the the lane markers it'll
help you align your vehicle up and then
over time you'll kind of start getting
an idea of how wide your vehicle is and
and how much space you have you'll find
it a lot of really nice cars when you
put them into reverse they'll
automatically aim their mirrors down to
help you parallel park but that's also a
good way it's not the ideal way to aim
your mirrors because you're basically
aiming them away from your blind spot
and they're not really doing very much
good for monitoring that but it is a
good way to kind of get used to how wide
your car is and if you're looking over
your shoulder at your blinds but like
you probably should be in your any time
that you are driving it probably won't
be too much of a detriment so I hope
those tips help out we got another email
in from Louis or Louis basically says hi
guys what are your opinions on the new
Prius C would you recommend it over the
regular prius do we have a launch date
and pricing available for the u.s. uh
yeah yes yes yes yes yes and yes um the
I haven't actually driven the prius c
and as much as I you know basically
complain
about the the regular prius I do kind of
risky acknowledge that it's a pretty
good car as far as like getting people
from point A to point B in an efficient
efficient way I'll reserve my judgment
on whether i recommend it or not until I
get a shot to drive it and that should
be actually pretty soon because they're
starting to show up in the press fleet
now and it is definitely going to be
available in the US this year pricing
right there as you can see our video
users starts at 23 990 so there you go a
little bit cheaper than a priest but
it's also a little bit oh wait
entry-level preseason 19 7 10 and then
top of the line is 23 990 go on sale on
march and march yeah so get me one for
my birthday or don't get be something
else I thought yet though hope that
answers your questions we should
actually have be getting one of those in
sometime between now and mark I think
the next email comes in from Cass on
Benton Illinois says do you guys know or
think Apple would ever consider making
an aftermarket car stereo I for one
would wait in line and pay the first
generation apple text to have one
installed one that would integrate the
iphone or ipad with touchscreen controls
I'm losing faith in the aftermarket
companies ever producing high-quality
car stereos that integrates well with an
iphone this would be a market that Apple
wants to stay clear of I can't say for
sure but I was wondering your thought
what's your thoughts on the subject are
and I don't think apples going to do it
much for the same reason they don't make
what is that was at the ipod hi-fi you
remember they they at one point they had
a boombox that they sold that's right it
was a called the ipod hi-fi they don't
make that anymore i don't think and it's
i think basically apples kind of
realizing that the market for us is
actually the core stuff will let other
people figure out how to use our thing
so I don't think Apple is going to get
in on the car stereo market especially
considering the African market car
stereo marketed kind of shrinking anyway
it's not gone but it is
smaller than it was now had the ipod
came out in 1994 at the height of the
car stereo boom we'd probably be having
a different conversation right now but
right now i think you know apple from
where Apple standing I need a Bluetooth
30-pin dock connector and ipod out
probably enough for most users needs and
their kind of wanting the car companies
to kind of get in on that again it's
also something they can license and
still make money off of that works with
ipod a sticker that you put on things
and and they don't actually have to put
the R&amp;amp;D and actually building anything
in that case so i don't think they're
actually going to they're going to do it
but there are devices that i mean for
example the the thing is called the
devion dash that we talked about on car
tech live two weeks ago basically lets
you stick your your ipod into the
dashboard and it becomes your screen so
i mean there are solutions to that and
and and as we'll talk about in a little
bit of a couple emails down we're going
to start talking about the ipad and the
dashboard also more so we'll come back
to that but a next email comes in from
bowden in houston texas he says hi
Antoine my wife travels a lot for work
and is in and out of various rental cars
quite often she used to rely on hertz
never lost navigation system and the
rentals but now i've installed motionx
on our iphone 4s and want her to use
that instead can you recommend a good
universal mount that would be reliable
for using motionx and various rental
vehicles i would like to get her a
universal mount that is durable and
small for easy travel well since you're
specifically pointing out that you want
to use your ipod for navigation I would
probably steer you in the direction of a
universal mount that also has a built-in
GPS antenna of its own for example the
Magellan Magellan that has a GPS melt or
tomtom basically both have GPS mounts
that have built in the Magellan premium
car kit for iphone
or the the tomtom car kit for iphone
both have built-in GPS receivers that
are more accurate than the one that's
built into your your iphone let's say if
a better photo of a this is not really
what I know it's not the one uh it's
called the Magellan premium car kit for
iphone or you can just do tomtom just if
you want to illustrate what they look
like tomtom does just have a name or
it's just Tom Tom car kit for iphone
probably should have put that link in
the show notes but basically you get the
universal amount of the suction cup
which you can put on either a dashboard
with the puck or on the windshield which
is probably going to be what your wife
ends up using but then you get the
advantage of a louder speaker for
turn-by-turn directions and Bluetooth
hands-free calling you also get that's
the tomtom mount right there you get the
louder speaker for Bluetooth hands-free
calling you get a superior gps antenna
so when you're doing things like
navigating in cities and around
skyscrapers you get more accurate
positioning more accurate positioning
means more accurate turn-by-turn
directions which means much less
frustration and don't let the branding
fool you on either those cases they will
work just fine with the motionx gps
application so that would be my
suggestion the tomtom kit also is super
thin as use you kind of saw in that
picture it's basically just clips onto
the back of the the iphone and it has a
very very low profile mounted sarah
there uh I forget what they call it but
it's a very low profile mount it should
fit in her luggage or in a person pretty
easily Magellan yeah there's the
Magellan when it's a little bit bigger
than the the the tomtom kit but I think
both of those are really good I've
actually tested both of them you can
find reviews for those over on cars cnet
com we've got another email that comes
in from Stefan he basically wants to
know what's the best possible
aftermarket head unit for a 1992 2002
acura RL used an iphone forest and an
ipad I've had to actually any
would prefer to have the largest screen
available plus nav and obd mounting if
at all possible what can he expect to
spend on such a unit we I think we
actually answered this question last
week um who was asking about this last
week when I basically recommended the
the avic Z 1 30 BTW which is actually
going to be out and about a month or two
or the Alpine I any z nine to eight HD
both of those are going to have really
good integration with your Apple devices
your ipod your iPad for streaming your
music and what not this is a yes that's
the pioneer one the Alpine again has
that gigantic 8 inch screen so it's even
bigger than the Pioneer which i think is
seven and some change so if you're
looking for the biggest screen possible
and an index unit those are probably
going to be the ones that you want to
look at again look at the show notes for
last week's show for that and I think
there you're going to expect to pay
about 1,200 bucks for an index stereo
with navigation at this point with a big
screen and an ipod integration your
other solution since you've got an ipad
2 lying around just use your ipad 2 you
can get a kit from proclip for example
for about 50 to 70 bucks that will let
you mount your ipad on your dashboard
and then all you need of one hundred
dollar stereo that lets you put stuff
steering wheel controls in and you can
actually just use your ipad for
navigation turn by turn direction with a
nap you have to purchase an app to run
that and then also you have a big 10
inch screen which is two inches bigger
than the biggest unit that i can
recommend it's also cheaper to go that
way but it's more complicated as far as
installing and setting things up and
getting things working the way you want
them to work the other thing that you
asked about is the obd2 integration and
you're not going to get that with a car
stereo or with your ipad without
purchasing an additional sort of obd
reader none of the major car stereos
that i've tested or em aware of actually
comb with the obd built into them so
you're going to have to get either
a Wi-Fi or Bluetooth obd connection and
and then you'll be pairing that either
to your most likely to your iPad or your
iPod in that case and running an
application that'll allow you to monitor
whatever parameters you're looking for
whether it's fuel economy or check
engine light or whatever you're looking
for there how much extra is that reader
usually they run anywhere between about
sixty seventy dollars to about 120 it
depends on which one that you're looking
at plx makes one and they're the ones
that are popping up off the top of my
head and I think they're plx Wi-Fi is
yeah they're Bluetooth modules $99 their
Wi-Fi modules about 150 and then there
are also other brands that are available
but we can I guess kind of dig into that
probably on another show we get another
email actually a tweet which I thought
was actually really interesting this one
comes in from s prof 68 and i hope i
pronounced that properly and basically
he's saying that his Bose audio system
in his 2001 out EA for distorts when
it's cold and then the sound improves
the longer is it that it's on and he
wants to know if it's an amp issue and
if it's a cheap fix and I basically
asked him I you know I guess a little
bit later as a follow-up tweet you know
what he was talking about as far as
distortion and he basically says below
45 degrees Fahrenheit it basically
sounds kind of like a poor FM signal the
same from all sources and there's no
rattling that he can hear and so this
could still be any of a number of
culprits some people say that amps
perform better when they're warmed up
but at the same time when they get too
hot then they start distorting also so
amps are pretty sensitive depending on
the kind of amp and I didn't do the
research as far as what kind of amp Bose
uses in their system but amps are pretty
sensitive to temperature so it could be
the amp it could also be any of a number
of things sometimes tweeters for example
are particularly a temperature-sensitive
and if they get too cold or too hot they
can also distort and sound pretty bad
there have also been you know I guess
sometimes I've in the rarest rarest of
cases I've heard of things like the
copper in the connections actually
drawing up and not making as good of a
connection when you get too cold but uh
I think you'd kind of be outside of the
parameters would be comfortable
comfortable for you to sit in in a car
so it could be any of a number of issues
I don't know necessarily if it would be
a cheap fix because I don't actually
still don't know what the issue would be
so I will actually toss this out to some
of our listeners I like to do this every
now and then and if you have an audi a4
of this generation i think it's the the
b4 chassis code b5 chassis code and you
have the bose system and you found
similar issues with your sort of system
sounding bad when it gets cold and if
you know a fix to it give us a tweet
send us an email will give you the
information at the bottom of the show
get two more emails before we get on up
out of here one that actually kind of
confuses me this one comes in from Barry
see he says I enjoy your reviews but I
want information rich text not video
also it's the performance of the vehicle
that interest me 0 to 60 times handling
range etc not the infotainment system
Barry so you think he's watching the
videos and not realizing there's a
perfectly good written review that fits
beneath the video in most cases that
Wayne and I put much love and tender
care into so we talk about all of these
things we usually don't do zero to 60
testing because I mean it's it's nice to
have that sort of you know bravado sort
of thing but I feel like in most cases
it's not super important to most
consumers also know where you're getting
here media from mean 0 to 60 times
they're super easy to find on the
Internet we're pretty much the only
publication that covers infotainment
our technology seriously and that's what
we focus on so you kind of gotta know
what you're getting yourself into the
equivalent of I think going into a Thai
restaurant and demanding chicken
parmesan like kind of got to know what
sort of restaurant you ran and ending
and we do provide most of the
information that I feel like berries
asking for but we're not going to stop
focusing on infotainment because that's
why everyone else loves us I think so
sorry Barry and that we got one more
email us comes in from hung in Virginia
he basically says I have a 2005 subaru
legacy gt that has nothing more than an
in-dash CD changer for entertainment
tech a few years ago I got a parrot mki
9200 hands-free bluetooth system and
installed it in my car and I've loved
every moment of it since then and since
my audio system my radio stopped getting
reception I get all my in-car
entertainment navigation and more from
my smartphone via bluetooth I even gave
away my beloved garmin nav since the
google nav on my android phone has more
up-to-date maps with traffic all for
free the parrot system also plugs has
plugs for ipod iphone USB aux jackson an
SD card my question is does factory car
tech even matter anymore especially with
the restrictions that manufacturers are
baking into them like not being able to
enter an avid dress while on the move
i'm currently looking for a new to me
car and i kind of wanted something with
no car tech other than a nice stereo
having bluetooth streaming is nice but
if not i can always install a parrot
system for about 300 bucks in addition i
want to replace my current phone with a
samsung galaxy note and it's 5.3 inch
screen will look really nice on my
dashboard streaming the hours away that
I spend in my car I'd like to know your
thoughts on this thanks hyung so he's he
is more exterior ave an aftermarket he's
kind of like me because this is sort of
a use case that i find myself in which
is why when i get in a car and it has a
ton of tech i'm happy but then i get in
a car and
has bluetooth audio streaming I'm
usually just as happy because I think
there are different kinds of users and I
think this is the reason that in-car
technology is still going to be
important it's because there are
different use cases there are different
kinds of users I mean you've got people
who can you know really who know how to
take advantage of the the voice commands
on their phone who can you know punch in
a Google search without really looking
at the screen and then you've got people
who you know take 20 minutes to open
their email and I feel like for those
people that sort of separation of here
is what's happening in my car versus
what's happening in my phone and maybe
some communication between them is good
um but it's I don't know it's it's kind
of like for me the the metaphor of do
manual transmissions even matter now
that cars will shift themselves or just
driving even matter now that you know
you know if in five years cars drive
themselves there's always going to be
someone who has a different use case
from you there's also still a large
contingency of people who just don't
have smartphones we spend a lot of time
talking about smartphones and and and
high technology here at cnet and that's
there like pretty much everybody I know
has a smartphone but there are still not
everybody my dad still has a flip phone
a case in point there are still people
who don't keep cutting edge with their
sort of portable devices who see their
phone as basically just the phone for
those people navigation in your car is
still important I think being able to
bluetooth pair with a phone and get your
address synced with your dumb phone I
really hate to call them that but your
dumb phone is still important and so
it's kind of one of those things where I
find myself doing this as an editor
often where I'm basically like well I
think that's stupid because it doesn't
apply to me but as an editor we kind of
have to look at things objectively and
think well for someone is this useful
for someone I've got like a FM bluetooth
to FM transmitter on my
my desk right now and I just I
personally think it's the dumbest thing
ever because I'm just like well when you
just plug in or change your stereo at
this point but you know there are people
who don't want to do that who don't want
to rip a stereo out of their car there's
a there's a bunt there are a bunch of
people who I think are just actually
just you know into the whole gee whiz
factor of like oh my car does this my
car does that you know there are a
number of things I think there are also
some people who you know maybe look at
their car is like it's its own ecosystem
and you know maybe I changed phones you
know every six to twelve months but I
don't want to have to deal with that in
the car you know it's cool to be
relearning interfaces and and there's
also the whole issue of you know car car
technology is usually but the very few
exceptions more stable than anything
that I've ever dealt with on a
smartphone if you're you're listening to
pandora and you're on your smartphone
and it crashes then and not to say that
pandora crashing i'm just using it as an
example but if it crashes it's an
inconvenience when you're walking around
but then if you find yourself fumbling
with the music a lot while you drive the
interface on your smartphone isn't
really designed to be used at arm's
length if for example you find yourself
in a situation where you're outside of a
cell phone signal and you need to
navigate being having that stuff stored
locally is still important and i kind of
feel like again yet you can get your
your map stored locally on your
smartphone but again it's different use
cases for different people and i think
is important for us to continue to cover
these things just kind of because it's
important and again it's kind of kind of
goes back to the whole you know the car
is a gigantic mobile device and you see
a lot of this with the the manufacturers
where they're all taking different
approaches at things were you know some
of your manufacturer Toyota's are
basically offloading most of your stuff
to your smartphone and or basically
offloading the connection to your
smartphone but still allowing you to
store your apps locally on your in your
car but then for
basically saying your app lives on your
car on your phone and the car just talks
to it there we're seeing all sorts of
crazy things happening as far as
connected cars for our smartphones and
cars and as far as as the OEMs basically
finding some sort of a way to to make
using technology in your car safe a
simple solution is duct tape your iPad
to your dashboard or duct tape your
smartphone to your dashboard but then
then you get the I guess the the
temptation thereof you know well maybe
I'll tweet this or maybe I'll see what's
going on facebook and I think that you
know at least having a safer way to do
those things are sort of you know even
you know block block those things is
it's kind of important but I don't feel
like I'm kind of rambling at this point
no no I understand what you're saying I
mean it's a it's there's a lot I
understand your point about you know
technology for those who just have flip
phones and don't need all that other
stuff Linden people like you and me who
lino pretty much use smartphones in our
oh yeah but I mean I feel like I have
not gone maybe six hours I mean
discounting sleep without like touching
my smartphone for some reason I feel
like I'm pretty adept at like navigating
the interface even at arm's length but i
still find doing certain things in the
car on a smartphone with a 4.3 inch or
you know for some might inch screen
difficult and I feel like I also kind of
under still my talent as a driver so you
know I feel like oh well if I you know
am feeling you know nervous about going
into you know for example I really hate
to keep using Spotify as an example like
I've picked on them last week on the
show but if I go into Spotify and I'm
trying to like find a song and you know
they've got windows that pop up and
parts to the interface that fly it up
and that's all pretty intuitive when
you're walking around with the device in
your hand
but then when you're driving and you're
at arm's length and your cars on the air
your cell phones on the end of a
windshield mount and every time you hit
a bump it jiggles around a little bit
and it's just like you factor all of
that up and you realize that something
as simple as picking a song has turned
into two minutes of nuts they're not
looking at the highway and it's
terrifying for me will mean it's scary
for me but I feel like it's terrifying
for you know for example 16 year old me
on the road trying to do the same thing
if I had a smartphone at the age of 16 I
would be dead man right now because I
had I had a hard enough time looking at
the road and in you know not running
into everything in the city of Augusta
Georgia with little more than a CD
player if there were a smartphone on my
windshield and the temptation to do all
the stuff that you know that that comes
with with having a smartphone I don't
know I feel like I may have trouble
don't double the number of cars that
actually have it's quite possible it's
quite possible anyway but i think that
said interesting discussion maybe we'll
talk about this again next week when uh
when wayne and Brian Rebecca's I'm
pretty sure they have some some
interesting thoughts on this I'm also
pretty sure that they'll agree with me
though but for now let's say that we're
out of emails and call it a day Mitch
