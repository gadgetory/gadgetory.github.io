LG's cool suite at the Mandalay Hotel
this is an 8k oled television the first
one available in the market later this
year no price yet it's gonna be really
expensive but hey it's an 8k TV and you
also might have noticed it's pretty
gigantic this TV is 88 inches diagonal
that is really really big there's some
larger TVs out there but for an OLED TV
the biggest ever and of course the
highest resolution with 8k now of course
there's no 8k content today okay has
dubious picks from quality improvements
even with the TV this large but this is
an OLED TV which has the best picture of
any technology we've ever tested this TV
we expect to be a spectacular performer
it's got this cool stand here it's
actually part of the television itself
it's a little rectangular silver thing
of course you can pop the TV off and
wall mount it if you want look around
back those speakers pointing up and
there's also a cool little flange along
the bottom here to send that sound out
into the room it's a pretty nice overall
design on this TV itself very minimal as
you expect from an OLED TV LG says it's
improve a video processing on this set a
little bit it's added some AI to the
secret sauce there it also has the
ability to get some more noise reduction
out of this set so again we expect very
good picture of course Steve ibly
stratospherically expensive so let's say
you can't put an 88 inch OLED you still
want 8k from LG they're selling an LCD
TV this guy is 75 inches
aka LCD it's actually the smallest LCD
we've seen so far in the United States
announced for a k' resolution again you
get all of its processing and everything
but the picture is not gonna be nearly
as good because it's an LCD based
television should be pretty decent but
again we'll have to know when we check
it out LG is also selling standard 4k
versions of its OLED TVs this is the e
series it's got a new design here the
bottom is nice and clear they're also
putting in some cooling features this
year including ability to work with
these clip speakers with a new whysa
Wi-Fi standard that allows it to
actually play full 5.1 surround sound
without any wires the set also has that
improved processor and LG says that it
can work now this year with Alexa and
Google assistant so you got both of
those digital assistants on the TV at
the same time you long press on the
Amazon button and you get Alexa on the
TV itself first time that's ever been
done you're looking at LG's e
this is a standard OLED television as in
4k resolution not 8k is 65 inch here
there's also a 55 inch size and 77 inch
size in some series LG hasn't made too
many changes in the sense the previous
year they've improved the processing a
little bit but this is a pretty standard
OLED TV LG has not told us its pricing
yet this year but you know you do expect
it to be relatively expensive just like
it was last year and again one of the
best performing TVs we've ever tested LG
has also made a couple of improvements
to its Smart TV system they have the
ability now to interface with the smart
home devices that are compatible with
the set you can pop up the smart home
screen here and drive around and control
things like lights and thermostats LG
says there's plenty of them compatible
this year so that's a nice new addition
you can also mouse over the Netflix icon
here you can see shows pop right up
individual shows you can jump right into
there's also the ability to rearrange
the apps themselves at LG can
automatically sense which actually views
the most and move those to the front of
the line that's a quick look at LG's 8k
and 4k OLED TVs here at CES 2019 David
