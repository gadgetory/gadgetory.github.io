tuning in to the 404 show on CNN TV I'm
Jeff Bakalar I'm Wilson 10 I'm Justin
you and this is the show where you are
today's lucky winner that's right and
tell them what they've won Justin you
know we're not there yet we have won a
great guest today we cannot be more
excited to welcome Megan Scavo on the
show today Megan you are the GM of the
game developers conference and events
thanks so much for taking the time being
here on the show thanks for having me
it's my pleasure it's our pleasure we
were a big gaming show we talk about
games all the time so your presence is
super relevant around the corner the
game developers conference is coming up
in March that's uh March 5th through the
9th so uh a lot of people heading out to
there I don't know I I'm not going to be
there unfortunately which is a bummer
and we talked about this before I'm so
Megan's got a personal grudge she
doesn't wanted and you have every right
to be 19,000 people come to that show
not you this is gonna be eighteen
ninety-nine I said it's really upsetting
but let's back it up a little yeah let's
talk about what GDC actually is exactly
a lot of people know III it's like the
electronic entertainment expo that's the
big one that's that's where they roll
out all the major video games and you
know they roll out the booth babes GDC
is a bit more behind the scenes but its
its stature is definitely starting to
rise over the last couple years as you
know the the tech that's involved in
video games becomes more and more
important so I hopefully haven't stolen
all your thunder can you sort of explain
to people who might not know a GCS yet
well this were actually in our 26th year
wow oh wow so we've been around for a
really long time we started in someone's
garage and it was called the gate the
computer game developers com not the
garage developers that G would have
worked fine jeje know you're there when
they were developing minesweeper is that
what you're gonna say no come on I mean
that's that's where we've evolved sure
right and at some point right the i
think it was about nineteen ninety-eight
there were these consoles on the market
and suddenly they've decided let's drop
the computer and just make it that game
the game companies gotcha um and we are
you know it the name kind of speaks for
itself sure for people who make video
games it's really hard to explain what I
do for a living to most people but you
know it's nineteen thousand game
developers from all parts of the
industry all parts of the world who
they're together every March and just
talk about what they do right how to do
it and it's the largest annual gathering
of developers hands down uh and you know
we're talking about this little before
you know there are other spectacles
around in the gaming industry GDC still
sort of has that credit being the most
sort of uh you know maybe the most
integrity maybe the most sort of vital
to that actual line of the gaming
industry lash right it's not it's not a
laser light show no I mean it's you know
it's it's very technical it's a
technical conference and we I think
we've managed to survive so long and
thrive and to continue to grow is
because we have one focus and that is
programming content for game developers
and as long as we just follow that path
I think we do really well tailoring to
this day a little bit of background so
like a lot of these developers and they
spend all gear they spend millions of
dollars developing these 3d graphics
engines which essentially you know in
this day and age is to make stuff
explode look even cooler right so like
is that you're really just dumb do we
have one hour lectures that you talk
about how to do that how to blow
something up and make it look as the
Michael Bay tutorial I'm not rifle so
that you're hitting you know I mean
they're toxic but but it's those little
details like when someone you know like
a character cocks a gun in a video game
there's a lot of physics and animation
and graphics that's involved now when
that doesn't work it kind of ruins the
gaming exposure for sure so so now I'm
sorry you've been doing you've had this
new GM title for how long now uh but
I've been working with the director
before that yeah correct uh so I mean
you've you've been to a lot of these
shows I want to get you know I wanna get
like an idea like what you would call
your your your highlight moment
something I know last year was the
25th anniversary that was a super big
deal for you personally do you have like
a moment that you look back and you're
like man that was crazy um my favorite
moment yes surely meeting Miyamoto
really yeah that's a huge deal for a
huge deal and working with um I guess
familiar with the mega64 guys know when
I'm sorry with what mega 60 yes
the-the-the make videos right yeah and
they they've been doing videos for our
the game developers choice awards
ceremonies yeah and they really wanted
Miyamoto to do a video with them and you
know we worked really really hard to get
an intended to do it but they wouldn't
agree to it and still like that day oh
really the mega64 guys shot at that
afternoon and it aired that night and it
was like one of the funniest things I've
ever seen it wasn't so glum in Miyamoto
pretending to like get really angry at
them pretending to be Mario right he's a
very interesting guy on he still sort of
I I got to meet him once when we fit was
coming out and it was sort of just like
oh you know he's like oh you look
overweight you should try and see if you
can make well no it actually what that
was through his translator he's like
that says you're very fat kind of just
like this oh my god oh that's a bad
that's a bad hand gesture he was calling
you overweight no but uh he's a very
interesting guy and he still I just see
a little kid in him all the time
whenever whenever I see him so excited
about maney still making games for sure
still doing it alright so GDC 2012
coming up a couple of weeks what do you
expect to be well what do you expect to
be the the major themes or is mobile can
be big is just shinier exploding your
stuff funny my explode explosion you
know we talked about whether we're gonna
that what the themes are each year and
its really GD c is such a broad view of
the industry right it's hard to pinpoint
a theme um but we definitely have some
really cool mobile phones that we've got
a whole smartphone and tablet summit two
days dedicated to that for them you know
Google is very active
and you know I think Apple might
actually be there this year but
smartphone is kind of the exciting stuff
right now we talk about trends are you
know we always try and analyze the
industry and see or try and predict the
future although it's like the job the
other man it's impossible Arbeit master
in our Chairman goes what does megan
think about the current sequel mania
that is overtaking industry I mean you
know resident evil 6 was just announced
and that's not even a that's like the
14th game and I love those are people I
know and I love resident evil I still
don't think there'll be a game as good
as resident evil 4 but that's my opinion
aside I mean what do you think about
this there are certain games that just
you know have sequels maybe whether or
not we want them they continue to come
out it's almost mirrors the movie
industry people keep buying they do stop
buying these games are alternatives
they're already at GDC there's a whole
we have the independent games festival
right and and two days dedicated indie
game which is very important very
important and we actually couple the
independent games awards with our sort
of triple-a award ceremony the game
developers choice awards right and you
get to see such a spectrum of video sure
hmm that'd be you know you're plenty of
alternatives arm what do you what do you
think about uh you know the the media
attention on GDC compared to what
something like III gets and I and this
will sort of lead into a conversation
about what we were talking about before
with uh with you know award shows and
stuff like that but what you know where
do you sort of see that because I think
GDC uh you know maybe not might not be
as out in the forefront as much which is
understandable because it is for you
know behind the scenes of is for
developers are what is in so many ways
that you can mark it like towards of
course it's like you I'm sure it's not
like ever walk around just you know uh
programming it's it's it's it's meant
for to act as a vessel for connections
and stuff like that so but what do you
think about that well I mean it's
definitely hard to pitch GDC to suppress
be right there's not a lot that that
every audience is going to to read and
seeing oh that's interesting sure but
GDC offers a lot of
very cool alternatives and like we have
this thing called the game design
challenge we've been doing it for many
years and what we do is we get three
developers and we give them a game
concept and then they have like 15
minutes to pitch that concept to the
audience and it's always these very
interesting ideas one time it was like
design a game based based on a Nobel
Peace Prize and design a game based on
an Emily Dickinson poem this year it's
design a game that can be played in 10
seconds Wow okay and so they're all
these restrictions and the things that
come up that's amazing come with hermes
I'm sure what I mean what's your opinion
you talked a lot about smartphones and
mobile mm uh you know to big frame works
on like the iphone android corona and
unity what's sort of really exciting
about those from a programmers
perspective is that you don't really
need to be like a major programmer you
don't have to went to school for years
and studied all sorts of advanced
geometries and things like that a lot of
that stuff is baked in so it lets you
know it opens the door for amateur
developers for amateur game makers if
you have an idea for you know like cut
the rope and things like that or just
really kind of very simple games when it
comes to the engine behind it are we
going to start to see a lot more of that
a lot easier development tools at GDC
coming up well Unity's got a full day of
content that they're going to have yeah
and Google's got a couple developer days
there you know we focus we have a whole
entire business track that kind of
focuses on indie gamers indie game
designers so yeah there's a lot of that
a lot of people are sort of leaving
their jobs and trying to make it on
their own it's so much easier to get
your game out there there's some you can
get it on xbla put it on PlayStation
right there are so many opportunities
now I find that um you know you look at
like what Apple's done with sort of
making it very easy to make your own
movie and now they're doing it with
textbooks I still think that gaming as
yet to break that barrier I mean
obviously very cool very closely super
close were on on the edge of that and
and that's gonna happen for sure and
your next year it's gonna be like I game
like this Yeti is something that
something's about it and that will be a
very interesting time I want to talk
with
you about the whole award stuff because
everyone who listens to the show knows
how I feel about the spike video game
awards which seems to be at of the
current state of the industry the de
facto sort of award show whether or not
people in the industry agree with that
is another story from my experience
talking to fellow colleagues is up no
they they don't really look at it with
the highest regard and you look at what
GDC is done with the game developers
choice awards and that to me is the
Oscars of the gaming industry to be
totally honest i think that i would i
would much rather want to go home with a
GDC award then i would whatever it is
like you know i don't know what it like
a gold enjoys by india i guess the
comparison might actually be more akin
to like the technical Oscars like it no
no I know about is something so because
the the you know the way that the spike
awards have been sore presented over the
last couple years is a little bit of
this you know fanfare I mean imagine
going to the Oscars and seeing like just
trailers and trailers trailers that sort
of crazy yet here uh you know it's it
feels much more um legit I mean and I
thing I I mean we're coming up on the
12th annual one that's happening March
7th during the show you know I feel like
that is something that really under the
right circumstances could really turn
into something even huger I mean where
do you see that evolving too well it's
an interesting question because we have
you know we would love for it to be
broadcast sure and we've spoken to
people about it being broadcast but they
really want it to change in order for
that to happen because you have to sell
advertising right and where it is right
now we we won't change our format our
format is we are celebrating our
industry and we're doing that by having
hosts that our game developers and we're
giving me Awards to game developers and
the games right we're identifying them
by name like we're celebrating these
people right and that just doesn't sell
Eric that's just not sexy i yes well if
you pop in maybe like a best explosion
award or yeah well no but that's the
whole point you don't do that and that's
why it's good and we won't and we won't
change and maybe eventually people will
catch up
and that's kind of what we're hoping but
in the meantime the same way we've been
doing GDC we're just going to go on our
straight and narrow and do what we do
and hope that people catch up if you see
a lot of elements of the game industry
in the movie industry slowly coalescing
with each other obviously like the the
movie industry borrows a lot of tech
from you guys uh and then at the same
time you guys are borrowing alias
Hollywood talent I mean two weeks ago we
had Eliza Dushku on the show and she was
talking about voicing over video game
characters so like there's a moment
maybe in the near future where those two
industry sort of combined and turning
this huge just entertainment man the
thing is you can't let the Oscar steal
my watch don't steal to be like oh the
best voiceover that's gonna be ours now
ya can't let that happen you don't
really focus on that sort of thing we
focus on discipline forever ceremony so
it's sort of best game design best audio
best art direction things like that and
I like this category like innovation I
think that's really smart um you know
and and I don't I don't want to like put
you on the spot here a little bit and I
know you can't pick a favorite game that
just wouldn't be night and just like me
I can't pick one even though seen it
makes me do that every year you know I
sort of have like a top ten right what
what are you playing now what's what's
gotten your attention lately I right now
I'm busy with GDC so the only break i
have so you're just not doin anything
maybe you never done live yeah i'm a
little obsessed with tiny tower right
now okay Oh fair enough so I pretty much
update that every day right what about
last year like what was some games from
from 2011 that really uh that really
grabbed you oh well red dead redemption
probably was the thing I spent most of
my time okay all right you finally got
around it did for sure for sure I really
like the Zambia I was gonna just say
like is there gonna be a zombie category
like at the gd6 like a zombie I would
because I would love that i don't think
that would fall in line with the girl
that's an idea yeah right I just hope we
don't get into the whole vampire thing I
can't play zombie games I'm actually
terrified get scared really playing
those games that seems like an actual
work hazard for you i hate that
everything there's a lot of zombie game
yeah there's almost too many i think
there are too many officially alright
very cool what we're going to take a
break we'll have a lot
more to talk about with Megan when we
come back stick around there is a lot
more 404 coming your way we'll be right
back this is the 404 mr f'ers the show
where we all sing songs
alright welcome back to the 404 just
watch a very interesting video of a 3d
printer we're all about these 3d
printers lately it's just so interesting
how many things they can actually we
just watched a video of a 3d printed
vinyl record I was playing the portal
theme song yeah I guess you printed it
using a pattern for the grooves and easy
so slow it's amazing technology right
have you seen this it's not right yeah
never knew printers would grab headlines
in the way that it's doing that's making
your day crazy yes making your year
technology is sick let's keeping you
employed I just reviewed in the 80s now
they coming back whatever you call this
takes someone was asking me on a radio
hit I was doing there like so why am i
buying a 3d printer I'm like well if you
run out of a doorstop if you are sorted
over really like an extra chess piece a
look at the whole collection you need
you need to know if you need a house for
your stick figure than absolutely yeah
that's that's pretty funny um so you
know like we said GDC is around the
corner and megan wants us to let
everyone know that games about our
sister site is streaming some live stuff
from the event so there's reaming the
award show they're streaming both awards
ceremonies were streaming the
independent games festival award
ceremony followed by the game developers
choice awards ceremony which is hosted
the share by Cliff Bleszinski cool
cliffy B cliff getting in there he's not
really quickly be anymore no he's sort
of like I'm look he's like Puff Daddy
has a look just call me Diddy net you
just call me CB what is he was just
clawed they has a full name was
interesting I like that happens I like
that he's growing up now he's growing up
and you know he's one of the like the
faces of the industry ready sort of uh
got that important thing going on so
yeah whatever you want to call wait
what's the story on this user con so
clicking we're gonna in trouble now oh
is that his game he loved himself
someone he however it I don't know the
etymology but he you know evolved this
nickname whether or not I don't think it
was not my choice wasn't like Prince's
that prince was like call me print right
right being like
hey call me beyond abusing himself does
a grown man in his thirties like yeah
he's not going to call me cliffy B I
make video you know it didn't work like
that not how uh but ya know that's
really cool that he's hosting that and I
think I'm actually gamespot is going to
stream some some sessions too because we
do these things called classic game
postmortem okay where we look back at
games over the last like 30 years sure
they're designers come in and talk about
what it was like to make doom you know
or so I think they'll probably stream
those as well very cool who also real
quick before we get to the news I'd we
didn't touch on this in the first
segment I want to kotaku has named you
one of the most important people in
gaming yes and what I mean I mean that's
a that's a big honor what uh would it
would you have to say about that i'm i'm
very curious as to what you know what
your response to that is a reaction
rather it's it I feel like it's less on
me and more on GDC Oh pushing the
pressure it's because GDC is such an
important part of the year and part of
our industry that you know I happen to
be in charge of it well very cool and
congrats on that thanks pretty awesome
um let's get into some of the news
topics of the day Megan's gonna discuss
some of the stuff with us Wilson whoa
what's been rockin you today well the
speaking of like award shows sure the
Oscars announced their their top picks
for best films and it's like Hugo one
Scorsese film picked up 11 Oscar
nominations so this is uh I'm just
finding about out about this morning
looking this is a good you know sort of
video game motion capture kind of thing
that we can talk to Meghan about because
Hugo is a 3d captured film right so they
shot it with the 3d cameras uh they they
motion captured ok so it's know if now I
I don't know much about I know it takes
place is this I'm not sure we were
talking about at this point oh you guys
just don't you can't figure it out we
don't have Google yeah right anyway
google that so would it tell me about
the movie no it's about like this kid
who liked works inside of a clock or
something like that I don't know the
details of it but apparently it's
racking up nominations left and right i
mean let's just look at the best picture
best director
um what else as they have they got I
don't know but were they got they got 11
total I'm sure a lot of there are
technical awards as well let's go over
best picture because best picture always
sort of rocks me and there's a few
movies in here that kind of shine right
there's nine there's nine uh let's go
through the artist the descendants
extremely loud and incredibly close the
help Hugo Midnight in Paris Moneyball
the tree of life and war horse Megan you
were shaking your head yeah I don't
remember what which 1i I didn't like
extremely loud and incredibly close you
didn't like that I've not seen it I've
had widespread negative reviews about
this movie yeah I don't know people just
don't like it whether not worse no
incredibly loud and solos that one uh
would that's what Sandra Bullock and Tom
Hanks it's about uh I've seen like
posters of it I have no idea what it's
about though it's just liked about the
World Trade it's about a guy father dies
in I I not 11 and uh you know he's his
child sort of interacts with him with
like clues that he leaves behind and
sounds great in theory but apparently
I've read a lot of reviews people do not
like this movie I've not read it
pleasant is this just like the
obligatory tip of the hat to Tom Hanks I
don't I don't know what I don't know I
saw Midnight in Paris did you see my kid
I really enjoyed that last I was a
little shocked to see Best Picture
nomination but I love Woody Allen I will
do anything he says and if he it's been
a long time for hands in a while on that
point did you like match point you
didn't like match point our friend Brian
likes match point I like match funds
agree you didn't like much point I
didn't like that place interesting i
remember the last one I actually liked
but I was happy with this one I'm like
ah he's back sure no that's awesome I
mean he pops out a movie every year one
of them is bound to stick right uh
warhorse everyone knows that is I was a
little shocked the tree of life uh that
is up so that so in brip it was in that
also right it's to brad pitt movies
nominated money balls are like behind a
lot of big films yeah any ball money
ball one its usual the descendants i did
not see the artist i heard the artist
was a unique i do not see that yeah this
is uh
weird Jonah Hill yeah nominated Best
Supporting Actor how about that uh Nick
Nolte mm-hmm really sweet in the bottom
of the barrel here this is got a Grace's
best actor in a supporting role but what
movie was knowlton Nick Nolte was in a
movie called warrior I think that was
about the MMA stuff right MMA I have no
idea actually we just we have to be
honest like movies this year as you can
speak to this may be a little bit it's
like movies just don't interest me
anymore like and that's the way through
the utmost awful thing you could say I
have a degree in this stuff yeah and
every time I walk past the movie poster
I literally like a little part of me
dies right that cuz I know I because in
this is my thing I go to all them
because movies now their titles are just
what they're about yeah that's the
problem Horrible Bosses bad teacher man
on a ledge right there just right I mean
they're just there's just no thought
it's very insulting to be honest the way
we the way we're perceived by movies
dude but as a collective audience I
really feel like they're just like oh
just throw him in there like look at
like ghost rider right wasn't that know
who saw a ghost writer they're making
another one coming up next month naked
people I don't understand oh I don't
know I know he was in a little financial
trouble but oh my goodness it's the
first year one of the first years at the
major box-office receipts has declined
significantly right well maybe harder
than to actually just playing video
games at home course I mean like you get
you get 12 hours for 60 bucks playing a
video game that you can replay again and
again for half that yeah you can take a
girl out for two hours right maybe maybe
and that's if you don't eat anything you
brief you go to like the 7-eleven before
and stuff your pockets full of like you
know gummy worms and I not spending that
the reason why it's like Hollywood makes
one of two films they either make huge
huge blockbusters you've got to see in
their full of all these amazing effects
and 3d graphics flying all over the
place or they make these like very let's
not say low-end but like far cheaper
films almost indie style where it's like
very very cheap relative to Hollywood
stock you know uh budgets like 10 15 20
million dollars
and there's very little in between you
and I feel like the blockbusters have
been a huge disappointment over the last
year yes yes and I used to love being
action sure like i can watch
independence day any day oh yeah uh
watch that speech all day kidding Bill
Pullman up there was bluffing there that
would be like they're there hasn't been
no no no it if you could almost see
though like parts of the video game
industry almost following that round
obviously like you get like the the the
st. the sequel itís or whatever you
might call it like every year they know
they can bank on this 500 million other
person or be a movie right but the more
superheroes are left but usually those
games are pretty freaking awesome I mean
and they deliver they definitely do the
Transformers movie keep doing it for
people i don't think so four hundred
million dollars later apparently it did
for a huge portion the population not me
it didn't nine certainly not me yes like
i would love to see giant robots fight
each other but please put a little bit
of intelligence in the story just like
it's something credible you know the
only franchise that seems to be
delivering is Batman that's you know
like Chris vernos oh man and it's going
to be an end of july it's over what what
in 2011 was there one film that you were
like okay this i love other other than
midnight in paris i liked bridesmaids
yeah I did too i enjoyed that I thought
it was funny it was a little down after
a while maybe yeah I mean it really is
getting bad and I don't know I didn't
see Moneyball I didn't i've heard good
snowballs about it did you see I saw it
I do you think Jonah Hill deserved an
Academy Award nomination I saw I don't
know that's enough Jonah Hill didn't
really say much in that movie had maybe
four or five looks kinda nervous Oscar
Ganesh's a 45 unload with her love I
think that's what it was because he
wasn't cracking jokes every fight was he
still glad I think that was the surprise
not that so there's no a skinny skinny I
mean he was on his transition phase I
think I'm very interested in that
because to that battlefield early either
some weird whenever I look at
now right he doesn't look this doesn't
look right extra skin you got used to
seth rogen too after he lost them yeah
but i don't think the change was his joy
wasn't as easy he lost he probably lost
an entire body that's amazing and look
obviously it's great he's healthier now
whatever it is but man oh man strange
I'm a little surprised that grow the
Dragon Tattoo didn't net more
nominations ruin him out Rooney Mara for
Best Actor because when the Academy does
tend to shy away from remakes to you
know it being a norwegian film right um
and it was a huge surprise with martin
scorsese won best of her departed in a
party because that's based on the
chinese film right um so i think that
that's more academy politics than
anything very interesting so we'll link
to the award nominations in our rundown
today you can check that out at the 404
dot cnet com let's uh let's get into one
more story before we hit the brake
Microsoft is uh choosing to discontinue
microsoft points finally it's in an
option for trash instead so now you
won't have to break out the calculator
every time you want to purchase
microsoft points you can actually just
say okay I want ten dollars with the
points I mean it really is I don't buy a
ton of stuff you know the xbox live
arcade store right it really is every
time you buy something it's like okay
how much is 700 microsoft points yeah
yeah you literally have to break out the
calculor do you do like oh that was
about eight bucks okay why can't you
tell me in the first place here likewise
it's very strange um but obviously
Sony's been doing this since the get-go
doing just straight up cash and I think
this is smart I would imagine all your
current points will just sort of
automatically transition into cash or
somehow they might charge you to do that
as xbox live you can become a bank I
don't know it may be a better interest
in what I'm doing but uh yeah this is a
smart idea and it seems like a logical
evolution well I mean why do you think
obviously the reason why they did in the
first place was that confusion was so
that you wouldn't think 800 points was
ten dollars right um that little bit of
math apparently is a is a big step for a
lot of people
I just felt like I was in why are they
going back that's the big question
because their xbox live our gay teens to
be doing pretty well yeah I don't know
do you have any insight on that why they
would be doing that this is the first
I've heard of it I don't know why they
would do that but good for them I guess
I always felt very you know cheap
whenever I with the points thing it made
me feel like um you know going back to
like the arcades when you're like cash
in your tickets you'd like oh I spent
for 40 bucks playing skee-ball and I
have a thousand tickets but it only gets
me you know this parachute yeah there's
a lot of content on yeah yeah sure so
you know I think people are using it a
lot more than they'd have in the past
and then probably getting feedback you
know hey this is a pain if there's one
thing you could change well the whole
point system sucks okay we're going to
do that we'll take one last break and
we'll finish up the show with Megan here
on the 404 stick around we will be right
back
Oh
and welcome back to the 404 Megan
skyview's here today with us having a
great time with Megan you're fine I
don't think I'm ever gonna leave I you
know what happens this is the thing once
you're on and you have a somewhat decent
time it means you are sealed by contract
to come back whenever you're in town all
right that's the my work here uh we have
some other questions from our chat room
that we want to relay to to Megan uh is
I don't know who this person Oh Ellie
says he wants to know about what your
opinion is on the whole idea of hardcore
gaming and handhelds we talk about this
in our pre-show a little bit uh what's
your take on it you know because
obviously the Vita is what three weeks
away that's right around the corner arm
you know I'm sure there'll be a very
legitimately sized portion of portable
game developers at GDC where do you see
the Vita coming in in this marketplace
what do you think about the 3ds I I know
it's a lot but what do you think yeah I
mean I think I think there's something
for everyone and they're always going to
be someone who wants to play on a
handheld like Odin actual handheld
device sure like a Vita or PSP or IDs
you know my mother has a d/s and loves
it and spent hours on it that's always
the the the you know indication okay man
there is something here my dad place my
dad plays of the ds2 only when he does
something but you know it's it's it's
it's interesting that he they pick up on
that I mean it's all about it's all
about expanding the market right and
reaching other gamers sure and so there
are always going to be people who want
to play those games there but there are
new audiences that want to play quicker
or shorter easier games but so portable
sure yeah i mean i don't know i'm always
back and forth on this I like the my
Vita I've been playing at a good amount
but I don't find myself playing it
outside of the house i got it made my
ps3 you know and if i'm just sitting on
the couch and I look up I'm like oh
there's this huge screen TV but now I'm
gonna go back and just really strain
myself um what do you think about uh
d and the 3ds I've always thought that
3d is a great platform for gaming but
now with the Hannah what do you think
about that well I mean there it's it's a
little different 3d vs 3 the 3ds I think
is super cool yeah I mean no glasses
there there are definite games on there
that that required that are fun right um
3d gaming with on a TV I don't really
really I don't really want to play games
with glasses I I'm surprised a bit about
that because you know I I feel like the
the thing that's wrong about 3d TVs is
most people watch movies or TV shows and
very like passive kind of way right
whereas I gains by their nature active
so like you you're thinking to yourself
okay I have to pick up controller the
idea of picking up a pair of glasses
isn't really that far-fetched I find it
distracting I am distracted I don't like
3d but I don't like 2d movies either I
mean is it because you know gamer game
developers really haven't found that
magical way where that extra dimension
really does add to the gameplay I don't
think developers care about making games
in 3d I think I think um I think they
get told to hardware makers care about
making games and dizzy but the
developers do not because like there you
would imagine I'm just speaking you know
out of a possibility like things like
they'll see how far your opponent is or
you know peek around a corner or being
really immersed in another world is
exactly what you would want you know HD
realistic like next-generation gaming to
beat I mean cuz like it's at some point
polygons or polygons that's that's great
but like how do you bring it to the next
sort of evolution of immersive gaming I
don't maybe technology is still that
that technology is still a few years
away I feel immersed in it when I'm in
the 3d yeah I there's something
distracting I I tried playing killzone 3
3 night I sat down for like a half hour
and yes the game was built from the
ground up you could tell the production
value was there it was intact on last
minute and so you know it's it's a
legitimately cool illusion but in terms
of whether or not it added something
that I wasn't getting playing it in 2d
it did not see what I think is oh it's a
like at what avatar did 3d was around
for decades before avatar came out on
what James Cameron did I think that was
really sort of revolutionary
breakthrough was he didn't make a movie
the same way that you would make a 2d
movie and a long long articles about how
he framed how she created but he told
the story that was where the innovation
comes from and I'd like to see that
happen you know with 3d games at some
point I don't know if it'll happen did
not like avatar I didn't you know it was
really it was cool to look at me as far
as entertainment right yeah I mean and
and I know what you're saying listen I
know you're saying like yes every effort
was made to respect that the fact that
the film would be shown wide in 3d up
but you know I mean I've watched in 2d I
don't think you lose anything really i
guess i watch in 2d I'm it looks like a
PlayStation game well it does anyway I
mean I hope it look like a halo him as
far as out there but yeah I think the
guy with the mask I was like this this
is cut out what is do am i watching a
trailer uh but now I I think I don't
think gaming really needs 3d like the
movie theater industry needs 3d I don't
even think the movie theater industry I
think they need vacuum cleaners more
than I do I wish it was a joke but the
absolute truth yeah but uh but no I have
to really I don't think while i do think
gaming is the is the only platform or 3d
really might catch on in terms of a
mainstream thing where you know you know
i always look back and say okay you're
sitting on your couch it's time to play
games I gotta put on these glasses I
gotta do this idea uh I think games
might be the only Avenue where it does
work out in that regard but you know I
don't think a developer like you said
their primary concern priority is hey
this thing's gotta look good 3d you know
that's just not something i don't think
any chair i'm saying to a lot of people
get headaches from it i mean when i was
i played a super stardust in 3d and i
was playing wipeout in 3d wipeout in 3d
I don't know how I wasn't just flopping
around right yeah really bad and this is
and yes talking about three this is a
guy who got nauseous from watching like
a hawk you man
ngo 3d a documentary 30 is just like a
safari / too much too much color yeah
yeah so you know I don't know just I
know you're not a big fan of 3drose a
the other side of it is that when i
watch 3d movies about halfway into it I
just stopped paying attention to 3d and
my mind just thinks it's a 2d movie I
get the effect as right it's not as
extreme agree with agree not to mention
when you're the theater it's always
darker whenever you put those glasses on
things get darker right uh yeah III
don't know we'll have to see where that
evolves but uh yeah I I guess if there's
one sort of preview that you could give
for us the that maybe you know you
clearly have your ear to the ground on
what's going on with GDC 2012 is there
something in particular you're excited
about this year that we could sort of
tease out for our listeners yeah there's
a couple unannounced talks that um that
I can't wait to and they will now I
guess their remaining oh no no no no I
can they're just not they're not up yet
but we're definitely going to try to
close out the show with the one-on-one
conversation with notch from minecraft
really yeah that's a very big deal baby
marcus a huge deal antonio and he's not
really a fan of getting on stage he
doesn't like the dog he's very shy so
we're gonna put him on stage with Chris
Tucker who was a programmer on spore and
he they're just gonna talk about
Minecraft that is very cool I think it's
gonna be pretty amazing absolutely uh
yeah minecraft is something super
ambitious that's caught on like wildfire
it's insane the amount of attention this
games getting so that's really cool

conversation I'm sure everyone is going
