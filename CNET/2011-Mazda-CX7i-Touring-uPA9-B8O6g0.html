is a mazda6 turned into a crossover not
at all
it's actually a completely different
platform the last time Mazda had a
midsize crossover was back when they
made the Navajo which was paired up with
the Ford what Explorer that each I don't
remember but I think it's a really
good-looking SUV especially for the
price it looks a lot better to my eye
than the MSRP would suggest let's check
the tick yeah that's a really nice cabin
inside this cx-7 too bad it doesn't have
any tech at this trim level let me
explain how this works if you get a
Mazda cx-7 in the i' category which we
have here it's kind of a lower trim if
you go to the S category that's where
you can get into the turbo motor
all-wheel drive if you like and some
really good tech options here you're
really limited
that's my LCD screen that's all I've got
to work with you cannot option
navigation in this guide this little
helper screen on the left is fairly
useful what does it show it'll show you
various sorts of vehicle maintenance
stuff your average fuel economy and
speed and a pretty good music display
it's nice to have also that's it over on
the right is their renditions of the
traditional Japanese eyebrow screen
which gives you all the basics always
there a persistent display always a good
idea your media sources are a six-disc
in-dash CD changer again you know if you
load that up with mp3 or WMA discs which
it will digest you need a lot of tracks
in there so it's kind of a virtual iPod
that's good because there's no iPod
connector on this car not dedicated nor
via USB the best you've got is a
standard aux jack down here in the
console aux brings you to either
Bluetooth audio or that aux jack we saw
in the console notice on Bluetooth audio
I am getting my meta tags that's nice
now here's an interesting feature they
kind of took from the GM playbook see
where it says push for play pause down
here if you're on a radio station for
example I can hit this guy for pause
when I pause it it'll hold my radio
playback I'm not sure how much of a
buffer it's got and then it'll pick it
up later when I push that button now all
that stuff goes out of
Bose audio system again we're at the
Touring level on the I family of cx-7
this is really complicated over here
your audio controls they have audio
pilot which is the noise cancellation
thing and of course bass treble fader
balance that's about it there's no
mid-range or anything like that
now notice you also get a backup camera
on that little screen which is
interesting it's a nice feature again on
a car where you can't even option
navigation weird mixed messages here
where you can't get an iPod connector
where you can't get USB but you got
pause play of audio and you got a backup
camera
hmm the camera is nice and sharp you
know it's funny when screens get smaller
they look better this is why your iPhone
looks so great and it's hardly even
trying small screens tend to look really
sharp this one benefits from that but
again I felt always like it was
claustrophobic like do I really have a
good idea what's back there in this case
I'd rather have poorer resolution and
more real estate for a backup camera and
that of course is cut into our reverse
gear of our 5-speed automatic the only
gearbox available on this car
pretty straightforward stuff back to
drive and then over here for your slap
stick for your forward for downshift
back for up shift no paddles on the
wheel and I don't like the way they've
got the shifting arranged that's not
intuitive to me for me an up shift is
when you go up or forward and a down
shift is when you go down or back
they've got it flipped you get used to
it if you buy this car but not if you're
just driving it for a short while
now as I mentioned we're looking at an
eye trim cx-7 here that means we've got
a two and a half litre inline-four
naturally aspirated sitting sidesaddle
across the front driving the front
wheels only it's not a very impressive
engine to be honest 261 horsepower
161 foot-pounds of torque you know kind
of fair to middlin and more like fair
this guy weighs 3,500 pounds and has the
profile of a large loaf of bread so zero
to sixty is our leisurely 9.8 mpg though
is pretty good for a big heavy loaf of
bread 20 28 if you get an S trim vehicle
lots of things change the engine
actually gets smaller 2.3 liters but
turbocharged and probably pretty
high-strung because they're ringing 244
horsepower to that guy you also have the
choice of all-wheel drive should you
want it and you get a six-speed
automatic but that's another video okay
what's it like driving a refrigerator
its kind of appliance like I don't mean
the undue respect it's a very pleasant
vehicle off the line right off the gift
they've got it geared right and they've
got the software programmed right where
you feel like you've got really good
perky torque it's later on when you're
really starting to force the speed above
about forty or work your way up a grade
at highway speed things begin to get a
little bit crummy it starts to become a
vehicle that's just underpowered
the handling is is nice Mazda is always
done a good job of having a tight yet
not tiring suspension in my experience
so this car would be a great long leg
cruiser but at the same time never feels
wallowy or loafie yeah it does it does
nothing badly I'd like to consider that
2.3 liter turbo engine but my concern is
in a 3,500 pound vehicle with big wind
resistance that you're going to have a
high strong very peaky motor that's
small displacement they must be blowing
the hell out of it to get 244 and
sufficient torque to make a big
difference so I don't know if that's
gonna be more satisfying than this guy
shifting helps a bit but lack of
horsepower and torque is lack of
horsepower and torque there's no way
that and if you see back there lack of a
third row of course you have a spacious
two rows is kind of how I feel about
this car and inside it's quite nice the
light interior does help but nothing
cramped about even though it's only a
midsize
okay let's price our 2011 mazda cx7 i
Touring so again the I family is the
bottom three cars I think touring is the
top level of Vettes this is definitely
the middle of the pack 27 - is your
price includes just about all the tech I
showed you which in many cases is
missing some key parts and on the I
family you can't even option into things
like navigation that's where you're
going to want to consider the s with the
turbo motor and better overhead you can
put a really dopey rear seat
entertainment system in this guy it's
1,200 bucks don't do it it's one of
those Center of the car ceiling mounts
that drops down right in the way of your
rear view mirror and looks real
aftermarket from the shots I've seen
just go buy a couple iPads and save
money
