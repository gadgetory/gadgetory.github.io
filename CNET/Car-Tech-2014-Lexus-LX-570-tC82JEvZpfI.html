those who cruise the land of country
clubs this is the Lexus lx570 big
luxurious but don't let its gilded
exterior and cabin booyah it's a real
body-on-frame off-roader let's drive it
check the tip now in a sense the LX is
really the Lexus LS of SUVs it's a
full-size SUV it's a body-on-frame
construction which makes it technically
a truck that also means the thing can
pull 7,000 pounds on a trailering load
you've got all-wheel drive as your only
configuration and as we're going to find
out it's a fairly complex system three
rows of seating inside our standard
Lexus says it'll hold eight people
although I'd hate to be number six seven
or eight now inside this big boy you've
got a lot of traditional Lexus cues one
thing I notice right away is a lot of
traditional gauges here again kind of in
truck style you've got things like oil
pressure and temperature gauges and
ammeter things that most of their cars
have given up years ago but it makes for
a nice substantial feel now let's get to
the head unit where most of the tech is
gonna play out we see this navigation
system before and the media choices and
of course the optional mark levinson
upgraded nineteen speakers surround
sound so all of this is quite familiar
still what I want to take you to is
going to this area called apps in the
upper left this is what they call Lexus
enform it's the cousin of Toyota Entune
right they're kissing cousins very
similar and you've seen this before as
well the nice thing about this system is
you install the inform app on your phone
and it cloud loads all these apps one
time under the Bing app again no Google
search here you do have the ability to
kind of do a free-form search for just
about anything and you can use voice if
you use this voice icon the voice button
on the wheel does not tie into this
system which is a little inelegant San
Francisco Giants and there you go hit
that it's going to take you to
information about the Giants and I bet
it's going to show me how to get to the
ballpark yep there it is so it's very
sort of tuned toward automotive it
didn't bring me up you know box scores
or the history of the Giants or who's on
the mound today it just went to what I
need to know for a vehicle application
very
smart I Heart Radio which have always
had contempt for because why would you
have an app that just brings you the
stations of one ownership group I won't
even use it movietickets.com I'd prefer
Fandango myself here's OpenTable again
you can use voice search which is the
key way to operate this find a table at
7:00 for a party of four at trattoria
fresco not bad that's pretty good for a
relatively unstructured search finally
you've got Pandora which again uses the
app on your phone then puts it into car
mode and brings all the control up here
and finally your Facebook implementation
here is strictly Facebook Places
basically checking in as you drive
around nothing more than that you can't
look at your wall and make long post or
anything like that fortunately now the
downsides of this system first of all as
you may have noticed it's kind of dog
slow and I don't attribute that all to
the fact that it's using my phone's 3/4
G connection I think there's some
processing delay going on here that
needs to be sped up secondly if you were
out on the road with this a whole slew
of these functions get locked out but
not all of them it's a weird hodgepodge
which doesn't let you operate with a
single clear set of behaviors it drives
me nuts and finally under Yelp notice
there isn't a voice search button here
as there is for almost every other app
in this application suite and of course
this cabin abounds and creature comforts
you've got heated and cooled seats
you've got four zone climate control and
right here in the console under the
armrest we've got the optional cool box
which looks like it's set up for about
two bottles which is a controversial
space allocation and of itself uses the
air conditioned to pump in the coldest
air it can wing and there's a pretty
good job in there plenty of camera tech
on this big boy luckily go into reverse
and you've got a couple of options here
first of all you can change up what they
call your Park Assist this gives you a
variety of indications of where you
should go to park but it's not a self
parking vehicle that technology is not
available on this LX and I think that
might be useful but it does give you a
zone to aim for I'm not sure it's gonna
help a lot of folks who can't park it'll
just be difficult in a different way but
that's my opinion and then when you're
creeping forward like a mile or two per
hour you get this front camera but the
other one that's really valuable the one
that looks over on the right side
because in a vehicle this big in this
tall you have no idea what's down over
there and this lets you keep a peak on
that's quite useful now as so often is
the case in life what's going on in your
hindquarters is important to pay
attention to split tailgate the upper
part going that way the lower third of
course comes down to make a nice little
bench and also give you a lower lift
over now these seats here in the third
row are fairly substantial the room
isn't bad I mean it's basically for kids
or adults you hate but here's how you
clear the area although it's only sort
of clear drop the headrest first and
then you've got these buttons here that
will lower each of the seat backs now to
get the remaining seat assembly out of
the way you go to these buttons over
here that lift by power each of those
seat clusters up to the sides of the
vehicle now you may think it's a huge
waste of space to have these sort of
sitting like that except notice that
Lexus has them flush with where the
wheel wells are anyway so you don't lose
a lot of actual floor with now under the
hood of this big boy is a big motor 5.7
liter v8 but nothing tricky about it not
even direct injection 383 horsepower 403
pound-feet of torque all-wheel drive
only six-speed Automatic through a
standard Torsen center limited slip
differential pretty serious gear zero to
60 is 7.5 seconds which may sound
unremarkable until you realize this
vehicle weighs 6,000 pounds its MPG
rating is commiserate at 12:17 now
things get really interesting when you
get down to all these buttons around the
shifter then over here you've got your
high and low four-wheel drive controller
next to that you've got your crawl
button this will take you crawling up or
down at supercareful modulated speeds
there's also a turn assist technology
button next to that and then here are
some degrees of crawl on a rocker switch
and next to that you've got a height
adjustment rocker this lets you go
anywhere from 3 inches up from normal
all the way to 2 inches below normal a 5
inch range of taking this guy up and
down thanks to its air suspension
finally your suspension controls sport
normal and comfort and as you can see
we've got a lot of ways to fiddle with
this vehicle I hope you're into
off-roading
okay driving the lx570 is as I mentioned
got a lot of LS DNA and it's smooth all
the responses you get back from the road
or are refined and almost muted
depending on your position here on the
suspension in particular this is a very
responsive engine and obviously a big
and powerful one when you tip into the
throttle you get to measure it amounts
of power right now because we're not
dealing with turbos and because they've
got the computers and such program to
stay alert it's a very responsive Drive
and that makes it actually enjoyable to
drive around and even though it's huge
I like the normal setting on the
suspension I've gone to sport and it
just seems to get a little jittery and
little nervous coax the gearshift over
here into the sports side of the gate
even if you don't shift and now you're
in a sport mode that just revs a little
higher hangs onto those gears and little
gutsy your way all in all I think you'd
be surprised how much this does not feel
like you're piloting a ship by the way
if you need help driving something this
big you should shop elsewhere the lx570
is mostly lacking in driver assist
technology it does offer adaptive cruise
control but no lane departure tech no
blind spot tech and no automatic full
braking to prevent a collision
okay let's price our big crimson friend
these don't come cheap they're high-end
vehicles and they're big capable
vehicles so eighty three five base
nicely equipped but to get it fully seen
that style you've got to add about
eighty four hundred dollars for the
package that gets you Levinson sound
fully cool and heated seats that cool
box in the console a card key instead of
a wireless fob adaptive cruise control
the DVD rear sea entertainment rig I
could easily live without and the
parking assist visualizations on the
main screen so all in about 92 grand if
you're looking for that costly
kind of luxury you find in Lexus LS but
you also want serious offroading and
towing ability this might be your guy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
