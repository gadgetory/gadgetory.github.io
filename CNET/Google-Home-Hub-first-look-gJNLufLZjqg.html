is it it's called the Google home hub
and look at this thing
it's so small it can fit in the palm of
my hand we've seen similar tech as
Google assistant is built into smart
displays from Lenovo and JBL but Google
really tried to streamline the approach
here and they have a few new tricks
so like the smartest place from the
Lenovo and JBL you can use your voice to
control your smart home add something to
your calendar search something from the
web it can show you personal photos you
can watch videos you can listen to music
my favorite feature of those is here too
which is recipe assistance ask for help
cooking say chicken tikka masala and you
can go through the ingredients one by
one you can go through the steps one by
one and Google will save your place if
you want a multitask Google assistant
has built in here the same assistant you
get on your Google home and it works
really well on smart displays Google
uses the screen to show you more info
about the weather about local
restaurants and so you get an assistant
that interacts with you visually as well
so the new stuff first of all there's no
camera on this thing you can make video
calls but they be one way video calls
the reason for that is Google wants you
to be able to put this on your
nightstand and in places in your home
where you might not want a camera
instead this little guy is an RGB light
sensor what that allows it to do is if
you're looking at videos around an
ambient screen with a clock and the
light in your room changes the screen
will adapt so it's not blaring at you
they said they wanted to do away with
the billboard effect
Google's also debuting live albums which
helps the assistant sort through your
pictures by place or by person so if you
take new pictures of your kids and you
want that album showing on your smart
display it'll automatically pop up there
as part of your running slideshow but my
favorite new feature this thing is
really good at controlling your smart
phone you could always do it with your
voice and on Lenovo and JBL you'd see a
little display control this
if you slide down there are your smart
home controls quick and easy for turning
off your lights it knows I'm in the
kitchen so it's got the kitchen light
right there and then it has an option to
broadcast the message it has an option
to check on my smart cameras again you
can do that all via voice but this one's
making it a lot easier to control your
smart home with a touch
Google's not leaving it smart display
partners in the dust here apparently
it's rolling out its new features such
as these smart home controls to the
devices from JBL and Lenovo as well but
Google wanted to create a one-stop-shop
for controlling anything with your voice
or with a touch and the Google Home Hub
might fit that bill it's due out later
this month for 150 bucks which is a nice
price and it looks nice enough and cute
enough that you might want to put it in
any room in your house and I'm excited
to test it out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
