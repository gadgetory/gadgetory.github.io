buzz report the show about the tech news
that everyone is talking about this week
it's the new iphone of course also a
billion future Facebookers tweets in
russian and unicorns but first it's the
gadget of the week the gadget of the
week is not the iphone 4 as everyone
might expect it turns out there are
other gadgets out there in the world I
know right who knew actually we'll get
to the iphone later but for now the
gadget of the week is the droid x
verizon very cleverly held an
announcement on wednesday the day before
the iphone 4 launch to give details
about the next droid and it is a beauty
it's kind of like verizon's version of
the evo but not with 4g it does have a 1
gigahertz processor a 4.3 inch display
hdmi out an 8 megapixel camera that
takes 720 p high-res video and like the
evo it can act as a hotspot for up to 10
devices for an extra fee and it goes on
sale in mid-july but come on why
wouldn't they announce it today you
can't blame them for trying to steal
some of that iphone thunder and speaking
of which it's iphone 4 weeks some of the
folks who managed to get a pre order
through got a nice surprise a phone in
the mail as early as Tuesday jun 22nd in
fact a couple showed up here on
wednesday the 23rd but of course
Thursday was the day of i phone lines
interestingly best buy and ATT both said
that they would not have any phones in
stock on the 24th and then Apple said
the white version won't even be
available into the middle or end of July
yeah way to draw out the buzz with the
summer long lines there Apple marked the
iphone 4 reviews are in not surprisingly
they are all pretty positive but then of
course all the reviewers are in San
Francisco or New York so most of them
are saying that the biggest problem with
iphone 4 is you guessed it 18 th may be
of some tech reviewers set up shop in
Omaha I would be like a whole different
story also in the news this week in case
you were wondering social networking is
kind of a thing russian President Dmitry
vanov is in San Francisco this week and
among his stops Twitter headquarters he
stopped by for a sit-down with Evan biz
and while he was there he sent his first
tweets I was all excited to follow him
and then I remembered I don't read
Cyrillic speaking of Russia Facebook CEO
Mark Zuckerberg confidently declared
this week that is almost a guarantee
that Facebook will reach 1 billion users
in the next three to five years they've
just got to get Russia China Japan and
Korea on board those are apparently the
only four countries where Facebook is
not the leading social network I kind of
wish duck was exaggerating about the 1
billion but he's not because this is the
new internet people get used to it and
now for a new segment on the buzz report
that we are calling lawyers gone wild
thinkgeek.com got a 12 page cease and
desist letter this week from the
National Pork Board because thinkgeek
described a product on their site as the
new white meat the pork board said that
infringe on its trademarked slogan the
other white meat but here's the thing
the new white meat in question here it's
canned unicorn meat and it's from a
listing that was an april fool's joke
yes the pork board sent thinkgeek a
12-page cease and desist letter over in
April Fool's joke about unicorn meat
that didn't even say the other white
meat it just said white meat how much
did this cost the pork Farmers of
America and legal fees oh and here's the
kicker the National Pork Board is
actually planning to ditch the other
white meat slogan completely they don't
like it anymore but i guess the lawyers
still plan to use it because once a cash
cow always a cash cow or cash unicorn in
this case and finally let's have a look
and what's clogging the tubes obviously
that kesha song tik tok was begging to
be mashed up with the original Star Trek
I mean who couldn't see that coming wake
up in the morning feeling like
the door I'm gonna hit this city so I
leave brush my teeth with a bottle and
Jake is gonna leave for the night ain't
coming back I'm talking try not all up
clothes clothes boys blowing up my bones
bones whoa that is some good editing and
actually way more watchable than that
super yucky actual video yuck and that's
the buzz report for this week everyone
I'm mollywood and thank you for watching
get a little bit
fine we see the plan
the body
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
