welcome to the apple pie for everything
you can think of good and bad inside the
world of Apple let's get to it and the
big story this week is Apple going to
get rid of the 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack on the iphone of course they are
it's Apple now according to the reliable
Japanese website Macotakara the big a is
planning to remove the headphone jack on
the next gen iphone in favor of an
all-in-one lightning connector why Apple
because they want to give us what we
want a thinner iphone 7 in fact removing
the headphone jack and only using a
lightning port would allow the phone to
be a whole millimeter thinner the report
says Apple may also release lightning
equipped earpods to support the new
audio output and a 3.5 millimeter to
lightning adapter would be required for
compatibility with wired headphones now
this is completely different and you
can't compare it to apple changing from
their 30 pin connector to lightning the
3.5 millimeter stereo jack has been
around since the mid 1950s that's when
Charlie was born hey cool it daddy-o I'm
a true Eisenhower baby I'm proud of it
and how will you charge your phone at
the same time while you're listening to
music well the new iphone end up coming
with the adapter well the adapter allows
to charge and listen to music if it
comes with an adapter or if you lose it
what does Apple gonna charge us 25 bucks
for a replacement because yeah you know
it's Apple now really I like the move I
really do but there's obviously a lot of
unanswered questions and speculation but
as long as those three hundred five
hundred dollar headphones that a lot of
us have invested in still work I'm all
for it now the right he might have been
on the wall already back in June of 2014
Apple's new made for iphone program
specifications allowed manufacturers to
create headphones that connect to iOS
devices via a lightning cable rather
than a regular headphone jack at the
moment manufacturers have been very slow
to adopt lightning compatible headphones
an iphone 7 based on this story will
most likely change that so if you're mad
if this whole thing gets you angry don't
get yourself worked up over this Apple
is saving us one
one millimeter to make sure this phone
looks really good in our skinny jeans
I'll write in more future iphone stories
Japanese website Nikkei reports Apple is
planning to switch the OLED displays and
iphones for the first time starting in
2018 the report says Apple has notified
its suppliers with LG and Samsung
sharing a large portion of the OLED
panels for future iPhones the move could
also hurt apples current LCD screen
suppliers sharp and Japan display OLED
screens can bring sharper images and
brighter colors compared to LCD but
typically have a shorter lifespan and
higher manufacturing costs all right
Taiwan's economic Daily News says Apple
is preparing to introduce a new macbook
air at next year's WWDC the new macbook
air is said to be bringing a slimmer
design and will come in 13 inch and a 15
inch size this time around there is no
report if an 11 inch or will be part of
the family and it may not be after the
release of apple's ultra-thin 12 inch
retina macbook that could take up that
spot the report says the slimmer design
will be realized by fully redesigned
components inside the machine and is
expected to launch in the
july-to-september time frame all right
amazon prime video could be coming to
the apple TV in the next few weeks we've
never seen the video service on an Apple
TV before and Amazon even took the Apple
TV and chromecast off its site because
they said the products didn't offer
their prime video service amazon appears
to have confirmed to engineered an
Boston weeks that is developing a TV OS
app that will arrive by the end of the
year and how about some more gaming
content for Apple users Sony Shuhei
Yoshida better known as shoe to gamers
announced on twitter that the company is
working on an official Remote Play app
for the mac and pc that would enable
users to stream and play their ps4 games
on their desktops and notebooks that's
kind of a big freaking deal since remote
play has been limited to Sony devices up
to this point now getting better gaming
on the mac no matter how you do it is a
big deal and shoe gave no official
timetable for when we can expect to see
it all right now I'd like to take a
moment to make a correction from last
week's episode I forgot to credit I'm or
with their video footage when we talked
about the Apple pencil and the surface
pen it was an honest mistake in we just
wanted to say sorry I'm or keep doing
great work

the first one I think I actually
deserved out of all these 364 episodes

portrait of your own I beat easy with
the iPad pro so take a look at some of
these masterpieces from my artist corner
