at being a burglar I'm gonna see what
happens when I sneak into a backyard of
a house in my own neighborhood in a
suburb south of San Francisco what I saw
is this surveillance drone made by a
start-up called sunflower labs
it's startup Hope's wealthy people will
start buying these next year to ease
their minds about raccoons that are
checking out trash bins in the middle of
the night or to keep burglars away if it
comes to that I knew what to expect but
imagine if you were a real burglar
confronted by a buzzing airborne camera
if somebody's on your property doing
something they shouldn't be doing and
I'd draw flies out I'm pretty sure
they're not that continue drones are a
hot item in the world of tech mostly for
things like monitoring power lines or
creating show-stopping real estate
listings home security could bring the
technology to average homeowners too
when costs come down here's how
sunflower labs technology works first
come the sunflowers yard lights that
actually are bristling with sensors a
vibration detector can tell the
difference between footfalls and car
traffic and motion sensors can tell I'm
a human not a deer or a dog if sunflower
labs computer thinks I could be trouble
it'll send a phone alert the homeowner
can push a button to automatically
launch the drone to take a look in this
case you can see me snooping around the
backyard the drone isn't too loud when
you're indoors but take it from me
somebody skulking around the property is
going to notice when the drone
the burglar will know that they've been
noticed and it's very similar to either
a security guard at the very least a dog
that's barking at you the drone that has
no offensive weapons it is not going to
go up in your face it will fly probably
about 20 feet above you the drone itself
looks like a standard quadcopter but
it's designed to be relatively quiet and
to land automatically and it's
weatherproof base station of course
there's the main security camera the
security camera is specifically made for
low-light conditions so you can see it
well at night and at the very bottom is
our landing camera which locks in on to
the landing beacon of our system in
order to bring the drone down the
viability once it slides into this
landing station these contact points at
the bottom of all the motors actually
touch the charging ring and the drone
stays always fully charged the system
won't be available until 2020 and it'll
probably cost hundreds of dollars a
month like a high-end security system
but eventually sunflower labs expects
that prices will drop and federal limits
on drones will ease today the
regulations do impose the restrictions
on how the system can be operated but we
believe that within a year or two the
regulation will catch up and allow
something this to be fully legal and the
function that's fine with me because
honestly I'm pretty sure I would make a
terrible burglar</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
