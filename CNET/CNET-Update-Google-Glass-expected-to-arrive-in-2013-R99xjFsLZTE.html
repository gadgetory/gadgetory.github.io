its own event in March HTC unveiled the
one just a few days ago and it's already
offering bribes for you to buy it HD c
is given out one hundred dollars for you
to trade in your old phone for the one
but if you have a phone with a high
trade-in value go check somewhere else
like gazelle or ebay because you might
get more for it somewhere else then with
the promotion LG also wanted to get
ahead of the phone announcement blitz it
unveiled a pair of Optimus f-series
smartphones but these are mid-range
phones and the Optimus line the high-end
model is called the optimus G but these
eps will run Android 4.1 point2 Joey

free music streaming app that's kind of
like Pandora but a station isn't built
around an artist or genre rather you can
pick a playlist based on your mood or
activity such as walking away from
explosions taking the day off at the
beach or perhaps you need songs for an
afternoon energy boost 90 style it's
just another neat way to discover new
music and you can also set alarms and
