want to watch online you ever go hunting
online to find a TV show or a movie but
you're not sure if it's on Netflix or
Hulu Amazon Prime or somewhere else well
here are five tools you can use to solve
that problem and number five is
streamium unlike the rest of the
services on this list steam EO is an app
available for Windows Mac Android and
iOS it does not have a web component
stream your searches through iTunes
Amazon Netflix YouTube and others it can
also act as a media manager so if you
want to play your own video files on it
you can stream you is polished and works
quite well I just wish it had a web
version coming in at number four is go
watch it calm it's a pretty
straightforward site with a good landing
page showing you what's new the search
feature is quick but the results are
split between TV shows and movies let's
say you find a TV show you want to watch
like Parks and Recreation go watch it
can send you to the season page of the
show on Amazon or Netflix if you want to
go directly to a particular episode from
go watch it it requires lots of clicks
if you're just looking for movies you'll
have a much easier time number three is
just watch calm this site is very quick
search for a show like the flash and
boom you get the results upfront telling
you how many seasons are available to
stream and on what services you can
click through to the show page which is
a bit sparse there are episode
descriptions but you'll have to click to
see more information just watch comm is
great if you know exactly what you're
looking for on top of that it also has a
pretty nice new release section that
shows you what's been added on tons of
services it's also really easy to filter
by clicking the icons above the timeline
and number two tracked TV if you're
looking for a very powerful search tool
that also syncs up with your media
center look no further than tracked TV
if you don't care about the media center
stuff this search tool is still great
each title page gives a ton of
information with descriptions of the
program and even a stat like total
runtime of a television show did you
know that it would take two days 18
hours and 15 minutes
to watch all of Game of Thrones now why
would you need that information because
you're deciding how to schedule your
life around a binge show what kind of
question was that
at number one is real good calm it
searches through a boatload of services
paid free TV everywhere and even Direct
TV now the search is also really quick
title pages show both the IMDB and
Rotten Tomatoes score if you like that
kind of thing
real good presents television shows
really well descriptions appear when you
hover over a thumbnail one of the
features I really like on real good is
when you click on particular episode of
a television show real good will send
you to that episode on Netflix or Amazon
real good gets you to what you want to
watch with less clicks I'll be honest I
dislike the phrase I'll be honest
because it implies I've been lying the
whole time anyway
it was really difficult to rank these
services let me know which one is your
favorite am i as actor and I'll see you
