cnet.com and i'm here with the monster
clarity HD micro bluetooth speaker this
is not the I clarity speaker this is the
clarity HD micro this carries the list
price of around two hundred dollars let
me get it right
out of the way it's not worth $200 but
it is worth about $125 this is a good
little Bluetooth speaker it's just a bit
over priced at $200 it competes with the
Jawbone Jambox and sounds very similar
offers very big sound for its size you
can crank the volume of both your
smartphone or tablet and the volume on
list and this will play very loud
it offers a reasonable amount of bass
for a small size but some people will
obviously think it's a little bit thin
really is strongest in the mid-range
vocals do sound very clean on the
speaker and all in all it is a pretty
detailed speaker obviously it does have
its limitations some of the extra
features you get in this it does have an
audio input for devices that don't have
bluetooth you can connect a non
bluetooth device to this it does charge
via USB it has a rechargeable battery
gives you about six hours of battery
life playing at a moderate to higher
level volume and you can change the
grilles on this it has removable grills
they come in different colors it cost
around $20 each so that's kind of the
accessorizing of the speaker there's
also a hand strap for it and it has a
rubberized bottom so that if you do get
a lot of bass out of it it doesn't move
around when you play it at loud volumes
finally it's worth mentioning that this
does support the apt X codec that's
found in certain smart phones like the
galaxy s3 that offers in theory slightly
clearer bluetooth streaming it doesn't
matter as much with a smaller speaker
like this but some people will think
it's a nice added feature that it has
that compatibility all in all a worthy
competitor to the jawbone jam X not
worth $200 but if you can find it online
for $125 or less I have seen it for
those prices it's definitely worth a
long look I'm David karna and that's the
monster clarity
HD micro bluetooth speaker thanks for
