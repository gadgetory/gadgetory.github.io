Jeff Bakalar and it's time to get loaded
Apple updated its line of ipod music
players in a pretty significant way the
ipod shuffle thankfully got its buttons
back the ipod nano by far received the
biggest change dropping the iconic click
wheel for a tiny three centimeter by
three centimeter multi-touch display the
ipod touch now comes with the
high-resolution retina display from the
iphone for a front facing camera for
facetime calls and HD recording on the
rear the ipod classic remains unchanged
from last year's model at 160 gigabytes
the new ipods are available for
pre-order now and shipped next week
Steve Jobs also announced new updates to
iOS starting next week iOS 4.1 will fix
the proximity sensor issues but also
allows for HDR photography that means
the iphone 4 will now take three images
in rapid succession at various exposures
to pull in detail from highlights and
shadows iOS 4.1 also brings along game
center which is Apple's gaming social
network along with iTunes ping which is
Apple's new social network for music
sharing and discovery that functionality
is also built into itunes 10 the company
also previewed iOS 4.2 which will be
released in November for the iPad
bringing multitasking folders and
finally wireless printing to the iPad
Apple's one last thing moment was a
drastically different Apple TV
previously apple TV allowed users to
store movies and music in the devices
hard drive but the new hardware does
away with all of that instead now it's a
streaming centric device which can play
movies TV shows and music streamed over
your home network can also stream
netflix titles in addition you can now
rent movies for 499 or TV shows for just
99 cents the new Apple TV will retail
for only ninety-nine dollars in some
non-apple news Microsoft has released
windows phone 7 20 ems so that they can
complete their enhancements and
customizations to the new mobile
operating system in time
for the holidays however there's no
specific dates on when these models will
be released the FCC has unfortunately
struck another blow to net neutrality by
delaying action on new rules that would
subject wireless networks to the same
net neutrality rules as wired
connections now this is all after
Verizon and Google struck together a
framework that most advocates of net
neutrality viewed as a significant blow
to the movement and finally sony has
released three new models of its eerie
ders with enhanced touched based e-ink
pearl technology the new models will
cost 180 230 and three hundred dollars
respectively but wireless connectivity
is reserved to only the high-end model
it's kind of a bummer considering the
lowest and kindle and nook still have
Wi-Fi and there are only $149 those your
headlines for today I'm Jeff Bakalar for
cnet.com and you've just been loaded</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
