resurrected from the dead its latest
fight to survive is now in the courtroom
net neutrality can be a messy topic but
here to help us digest what matters in
this latest chapter of the saga is seen
at senior writer
Maggie Reardon thanks for joining us I'm
glad to be here alright so right now on
the court there's two different sides
going on on one side you have Zilla a
bunch of Internet companies state
attorneys generals trying to fight to
keep net neutrality going yes so
basically they are fighting against the
the FCC's repeal of the rules which they
did back in 2017 so they're they're
saying they have a bunch of arguments
but one of the arguments is that you
know the FCC really didn't have any
right to repeal these rules and then
like the attorneys generals are actually
you know picking apart the aspect of the
repeal that says that that the FCC
preempts any states from passing their
own rules this is the the DC Circuit of
the Court of Appeals so basically this
is like the the appellate system is like
right under the the US Supreme Court
so there were three judges today who
heard nearly five hours of my arguments
which is this is unusual for oral
arguments even like in an appellate
court like they don't usually go on for
five hours so I think everybody was just
kind of like the bathroom I got to eat
something like I mean even even the
justices were kind of like this is long
let's like speed this up and get through
this but but it's a very dense topic and
there there was a lot to cover and there
were a lot of arguments to go through
this is the kind of situation where
there was like a clear winner or what
are you hearing well I guess sort of the
biggest takeaway is yet more uncertainty
like we really don't know how this is
gonna come down and that's true of most
like appeals court decisions because
really like the the oral arguments are
just like one aspect of this whole case
and you know what the justices sort of
focus on is a little bit telling but it
doesn't tell the whole story they
some other procedural challenges that
were made as part of this right and so
those might be the arguments that end up
kind of winning the day and so net
neutrality could sort of be saved on a
technicality and we can kind of go into
some of those yeah and yeah so like one
of the issues was this issue of public
safety so part of the complaint was that
during some of these crazy wildfires
that were happening in California Santa
Clara firefighters their service was
throttled by Verizon
now they admit that like that by itself
isn't really a net neutrality violation
right like they had a service contract
with Verizon Verizon could you know just
like they can for me I am unlimited
service if I use too much they can like
throttle me back right that's not a net
neutrality issue per se but what they
were saying is but now the FCC has
basically as part of its repeal of net
neutrality like they've abdicated
authority for everything because they
went hands-off approach they're like not
my job it's the Federal Trade
Commission's job so Federal Trade
Commission you deal with it but what the
public safety community is saying is
like well but what about us like you
didn't even like consider our concerns
that maybe there should be some sort of
exception for Public Safety and there
were a lot of comments in the record and
that was something that Judge milette
really sort of hammered in on and was
asking the FCC like I mean like did you
consider this I mean and they didn't
really have a very good answer for that
so that could be an area where the court
says like well at least you should've
like considered it you know like show us
your work here so because they did it
that could have been a technicality that
could have been a technicality right and
then the other big area is so the FCC
repealed like most of the net neutrality
rules the one thing they kept is this
notion of the transparency rule right
that
the idea that you guys spelled it out
right you just got to tell me right you
got to tell the consumer if you're you
know get a favor
Hulu over Netflix you know the FCC has
to cite like what authority it has to to
do anything right so they cite this part
of the act this sort of little minor
part that actually was Congress changed
so like the FCC adopted its rule in 2017
they cited the section of the act as
their authority for the transparency
rule in December then some in the spring
Congress updated the act they actually
you know took out a little subsection
and rewrote the language and then then
the rules actually officially came off
the books in June so they're basing this
off a rule that now no longer is there
exactly right now the FCC are used but
it still gives us authority and but the
what judge Millette sort of really
seemed to hone in on is but you didn't
stop and like give the public a chance
to comment whether or not they thought
that this like changed your analysis
here right and that's something that's a
procedural thing like the FCC you know
there was something that was significant
that changed from the time they adopted
the rule until it went into effect
Congress made a change to the law that
they were basing it on and they didn't
stop to consider whether or not they
still had the authority and that could
be the technicality that you know kind
of like makes the whole thing crumble so
where do we sit now after five hours of
these arguments now we sit and wait we
wait for like four to six months thanks
Maggie and thanks for watching
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
