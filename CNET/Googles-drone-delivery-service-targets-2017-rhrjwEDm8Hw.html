your Google Isha's for everything Google
that we can pack inside of a show let's
jump into it this week and Google is
standing by Chrome OS and they made sure
there was no confusion with a new blog
post after a Wall Street Journal report
last week claimed that Google was
planning to merge Android with Chrome OS
and completely phase out Chrome OS it
also claimed that Chromebooks as they
are known right now would get a new name
to match the new OS well none of that is
happening Google made it clear they've
been working to bring the best out of
both operating systems and there are no
plans to phase out Chrome OS at all and
a more Google News the tech giant
announced the official date for project
wing it's their initiative to deliver
goods to consumers via drones by
sometime in 2017 the project was
initially run inside Google X they're
secretive project Research Lab but is
now believed to be under the control of
the larger company alphabet now their
earlier work had them testing drones in
Australia with custom-designed drones
that can hover and winch down packages
for delivery competition is fierce in
this space with Amazon and Alibaba
working on drone deliveries themselves
now Amazon says it's octocopter z' can
send 2.3 kilograms of goods within 30
minutes of an order being placed in
Alibaba ran a three-day trial of drone
deliveries around its offices in Asia
earlier this year
all right the Nexus 6p has been in
consumers hands for the past couple of
weeks and like every phone it's also
going through its own torture tests
YouTube user Jerry rigged everything
does everything from scratching it to
burning it because that happens all the
time and then proceeds to bend it with
his bare hands we haven't seen an
overflow of Nexus 6p phones being bent
from sitting on them but there's a point
where these torture tests become just a
bunch of eye candy more than anything
else so what about a phone that could
actually survive one of these tests and
live to tell about it
well Motorola is claiming their new
Droid turbo 2 has the world's first
shatterproof display for a smartphone
and their claims look pretty legit now
on this video by techrax
he drops the phone in
survives but then takes a hammer to the
screen not once or twice but multiple
times until it shuts off the screen
never shatters it has indentations and
marks on it but it never shatters that's
pretty sweet and a good sign for the
future but I'm not buying a phone just
because it won't shatter and I know many
of you are in the same boat
okay oneplus revealed their second phone
of the year with the oneplus X you know
the phone CEO Carl Pei hyped up as the
best oneplus phone almost immediately
after the oneplus 2 was announced but
the reality is that it's a smaller sized
phone at a 5.5 inch screen and an even
cheaper unlocked handset at that with
expandable storage for a 249 price tag
now it also takes design cues from the
Apple iPhone 4 with glass panels on the
front and back and that metal trim that
we know and for those holdouts our
longtime fans of BlackBerry's the new
blackberry Prive which is the first
BlackBerry handset powered by Android
will be available on AT&amp;amp;T in the US on
November the 6th this includes its sweet
looking smart slide keyboard and it's a
potential turning point for blackberry
if this design resonates with enough of
its users now an unlocked version will
also be sold by blackberry and is only
compatible with GSM networks all right
that's gonna do it for this week's show
you can email us at Google issues at
cnn.com or tweet me at Brian Tom thanks
for watching we'll see you guys next
time for some more of that Google issues
