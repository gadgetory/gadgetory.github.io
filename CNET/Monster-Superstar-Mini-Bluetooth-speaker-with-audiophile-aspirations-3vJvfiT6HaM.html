splash-resistant wireless bluetooth
speaker that the company describes as
the world's smallest audiophile
bluetooth speaker it's available for
around a hundred and thirty dollars
online and comes in a few different
color options hi I'm David Carr doughy I
review a lot of the portable Bluetooth
speakers here at seen it and I'm not
sure I've run into any tiny Bluetooth
speakers that audio files would really
like and I have my doubts the superstar
would impress any audio files that
doesn't mean it's a bad little speaker I
like it's form factor and it has a nice
soft to the touch silicone cover that
wraps around this plastic body you can
prop the speaker up vertically or lay it
down horizontally and have the two small
drivers fire upward and have the base
port on the back reflect off a surface
with a built-in microphone
it has speakerphone capabilities and
there's a line input for non bluetooth
devices it charges via microUSB and
offers about five hours of battery life
that's average for this class of speaker
as far as sound goes it's got some bass
but not a lot in a reasonable amount of
clarity at lower to mid volume levels
like a lot of these little speakers it
plays loud for its size but also
distorts with certain tracks at higher
volumes
I like this speaker particularly it's
designed but there are other speakers
out there that sound as good or better
and cost less the JBL flip to for
instance which can be had for around $99
that's about what this should cost too
I'm David Carr Noy thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
