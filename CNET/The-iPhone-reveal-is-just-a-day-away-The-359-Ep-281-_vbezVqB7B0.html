Inge and Bridget Carey good morning

hey very serious podcast the iPhones

up here today if it wasn't obvious right
probably this whole week of the podcast
we're gonna be talking about the iPhone
so send it as many questions as you one
to discuss Apple and all things iPhone
related we'll get to as many as we can
at the end of the show in case you
haven't had enough i phone right now we
haven't even seen the product yet so but
we will see it tomorrow so I think it
has a screen it may actually have a
touch screen we'll also be talking about
a new rumored feature from Twitter to
make it easier to do tweet storms God
knows I could use some help figuring out
how Twitter works so much we can do
stream storms on periscope yeah that
would be great anyway let's get to the
podcast send in your questions and
comments BVG we'll get to them at the
end of the show and let's do this
here we go for the recording of the 359
podcast be back in three two
welcome to the 359 I'm Ben Fox Ruben I'm
Alfred hang and we're grace today with
special guest and our resident Wonder
Woman Bridget Carey I love that intro
thank you
okay so Apple's iPhone event is gonna be
kicking off tomorrow at 10:00 a.m.
Pacific 1:00 p.m. Eastern you can watch
it live on apple.com so right before the
big event
big event some more leaks emerge this
weekend with the names of these devices
apparently coming out it's supposed to
be the iPhone 8 8 plus and iPhone X
that's the big special one the best
guest up until this point were the 7s 7s
plus and eat I know they're just gonna
skip it all together but like is this
does I mean
that the ex is gonna be the watered down
version or is it gonna be this anymore
and then next year will be the double X
and then the triple X will be the one
but is that significant that we know the
names now or is it like we've already
exhausted all our apple coverage I mean
our just talking about the names I think
it's interesting because it's you know
they're getting rid of like this whole
like 7s like you know it's kind of in
between our latest and our like the one
the previous generation this one's more
of like this is gonna be like the super
high end it's too similar so it's the
tenth year that's why they want to make
it special and the iPhone Pro just
sounds kind of lame too but it would
have gone people were thinking maybe
that was gonna be the name I remember
but yeah X x marks the spot
does it also have like claws that come
out of it and I think maybe they also
realized that the 7s and the 7s plus
were like too much of a step down name
after they like created this special
well DMX come out on stage and yell X go
and give it to you another another
interesting bit our colleague Ian sure
wrote a column today on the new iPhone
saying basically that it's going to be a
snooze writing quote the bottom line is
the iPhone has become predictable
expected boring boring I mean if you
really are covering everything at all
times and looking at everything you're
like what is there to expect I mean
sometimes you don't really need a big
surprise to have something that you want
I mean dinner for me is expectable yeah
that doesn't mean I go home would come
on like it's like it's if it's something
I want like I need it you know it's not
some things don't have to be crazy
adventures you don't need an iPhone like
you need dinner but I do appreciate a
lot of things don't need to be like
crazy exciting all the time your life is
not gonna be changed drastically anymore
by a phone because you're still gonna
use Facebook or whatever you by bombing
tools you're like taking the train to
work in the mall
is expectable and boring but i don't
like you know i shouldn't have to go on
an adventure everytime that's just my
like my point of view
alright and ian if you're listening i
liked your story so there's that at
least last we also wanted to mention
twitter is reportedly working on a new
feature to make it easier to do tweet
storms this is fabulous we obviously
need more tweet storms part one of 278
i've always hated to tweet storms i've
always felt that if you need to just
post it in a notes thing like take a
screenshot of it and just having them
one tweet or link to your blog because
it's a tricky way to get people to read
your opinions that nobody cares about
yeah at a certain point you're just
replying to yourself over and over again
I mean they better not make that tool
able to do like a 50 long tweet storm
I hate because there's so many people
that think that their opinion is too
important for a single tweet that they
have to like I'm gonna write a tweet
storm about the two of you crapping on
tweet storms has so much more to fix
besides true exactly and it's if
anything it'll only make way for more
racist manifestos on social yeah no no
time to like second-guess it just just
and have it nicely for all right also we
wanted to just kind of cap the show a
bit of a bit of them were serious no we
wanted to send our thoughts to the
people affected by hurricanes Harvey and
Irma don't forget to donate if you can
yeah my family's in Florida and they're
okay they're dry and safe no power but
obviously it just kind of puts a strange
lay on this iPhone launch for a lot of
people who are in Florida cuz I'm
thinking if you're dealing with this or
if you're still dealing with you know
the problems with Harvey you're not
thinking about a new iPhone right now so
true I'm sure they'll probably address
it at the Apple Keynote
yeah if you want to read more about
these stories check us out on CNN I'm
Ben Fox Ruben I'm Alfred Inge and I'm
Bridget Carey thanks for listening
so jumping right into the chat we have a
question from lost legacy regarding the
iPhone of all things you know you stole
that right out from underneath us how
about I was back after the after the
show and duex gonna give it to you how
would I have stolen that from you if you
never even brought it up cuz I was
keeping in my back pocket I wanted I
wanted one good one-liner you stole it
right was the question though was
anyways lost legacy ask do you think
they'll split view multitasking on the
iPhone no no maybe it's a good what is
it that already a new feature in iOS 11
it is well but but for the iPad right I
mean like doing split for you
multitasking I mean if the X is big
enough maybe it could be III just think
the problem is is with a smartphone
screen it's too small to actually do
multitasking I true you can do it on
like the same size screen I think
they'll do it I think people might be
excited if they do in fact do it I think
they need to do these things people
excited about yeah yeah yeah and people
were excited when it actually did come
to the iPad that's I probably won't use
it there's a lot of features I still
don't even use on my iPhone I'm like oh
wait yeah I can do that so good question
good question next question we have a
question from Zacchaeus that's a cool
name speaking of names he says what do
you think of that name iPhone X I think
is very corny I mean I I bet it's
supposed to be 410 I think they want you
to say that sounds cooler yeah but yeah
I think I think it's like very like 90s
like we're extreme it's like no no
you're right there are gonna like say
it's 10 and an exit but that doesn't
make any sense what about like a couple
years from now when they need the 10 for
the actual eyes this has to go it's a
review
you cannot keep naming iPhones
eventually you have to you're gonna end
up in the second
yeah so in that case looking at the
different terms and names now because we
have the SE we have you know now like
these three other phones that are
expected to come out is the iPhone line
now getting a little too confusing for
most people not us was recover it but
yeah right I just started with one phone
that was the whole time to someone last
week who bought their first iPhone and
they put he bought it last week and they
bought a six let me just say that the
iPhone 6 I think was the pinnacle of -
I'm gonna miss the button I'm scheduled
the home button I'm I don't know I might
hold out to just wait and see miss the
headphone jack still yes I still women
don't go I still have a iPhone 6 and I'm
very happy with it
maybe I wish the screen was better maybe
I wish the camera was better but I have
a headphone jack I have a home pod
sounds very important that the screen
and the headphone and the cameras are
very I mean I get what I did actually I
just I think it's very corny but I mean
what else could they do we've got some
fun suggestions in the chat iPhone
they're gonna screw up the naming
convention anyways great mr. lizard and
Josh they're talking about the iPhone 8
pro iphone 8 air if they're gonna go
with the Xbox one my phone 1s scorpion 5
dolphin dolphin I would buy that yeah
right Lisa Frank stickers all over mr.
lizard says do you think they're just
going to go ahead and skip a iPhone 8 s
and iPhone 9 I think it's pretty I think
that series is going the way of the C
series which remember that they're just
gonna go through the whole alphabet now
did they have a 6 C though no no they
just did or once and
I see it was for weed you weren't ready
to go bigger you just wanted to hold on
to that size yeah
Jeffrey's asking if we think if the
iPhone X is the really gonna be the name
or they're just that's one more veil
around leaks it's a better name as far
as I'm concerned I mean do you think
like it's a code name is that is that
kind of like the question yeah okay what
kind of like the Gamecube was the
dolphin like mad before yeah if that was
I believe it it sounds like that's what
they're gonna stick with sounds much
with the 10 year it feels it feels like
just it is just a name but I I think
it's a much better reveal on stage
tomorrow than just saying like after
they already introduced the 7s and the
7s plus featuring Dante from Devil May
Cry I'd be into that doing the Naruto
run all right so let's go to another
question Michael Brown our buddy Michael
Brown hey Michael what do you guys think
about the future of the iPhone in
general is this the beginning of the end
of iPhone excitement that was a long
time ago yeah - excitement is generally
just been like here's the same thing
with better specs yeah people are just
happy to get a new toy yeah we're
talking about this before the show I
feel like the six was a really big deal
that's when they introduced the bigger
screen iPhones and people were
legitimately thrilled about that though
those were some like gangbuster sales
like people did not expect the iPhone
could sell any better and then the six
completely obliterated yeah because the
redesign was pretty good there are
things that have made iPhone stand out
lately Siri and mobile payments and
unless you have something like that
there's not a lot of excitement to be
had over the same thing that that's just
bigger right when last year and the
hardware has very much been the same and
from the rumors that we've been seeing
correct me if I'm wrong here
the to step down versions what are we
gonna call them now the eight and the
eight plus aren't gonna be very
different
step down version now well from from the
axe but either way those are probably
going to look very similar to the six
the 6s
the seven which means that now you're
going on four years without a major form
factor change to get that form factor
change you're going to have to upgrade
and pay $1,000 for it
yeah the factors gonna be the X that's
the change is that you're talking about
yeah cuz otherwise you know not gonna
you know what you gonna change how much
more glass can you put on they should
make it like a tiny version of the
Nintendo switch where you could take off
the top to like bezels and then use that
I missed the day of like wacky phones
vectors in your watch yeah like wacky
phones trying to like have like two
screens to compete against and stand out
against other smart phones are turning
into a game console you made me think of
that the n-gage to go back to Michael's
question I think that there may be an
opportunity for a lot of excitement
around the X I mean like this is gonna
be a brand new completely different
iPhone and I'm a little more skeptical
about the possibility of it especially
because the price it basically takes me
out of the running of potentially buying
it but it's certainly going to be much
more interesting than the past two years
basically the same thing does anyone
else like me watch with like your
fingernails in your mouth like going oh
gosh and biting my nails to go what are
they gonna change and like am I gonna
have to like hate it because only in
anticipation of the fringe factor yeah
my fingernails are on the pizza that
would get coverage much like how
political reporters get election night
pizza it's but I do feel like the iPhone
has gone the way of like vanilla where a
lot of people will still eat it a lot of
people will still like it but I'm not
gonna get excited over vanilla like are
you hungry
but yes Alfred is hungry today I'm
always hungry
all right hungry for news for content
all right let's shift gears a little bit
and there's a few people in the chat
that want to know about the watch and
what the future of the watch is going to
hold do we expect any major redesigns
coming up LTE inclusion how that's gonna
affect everything going forward etc yes
I've been following it because I'm
tasked with writing about the watch come
tomorrow there's been a lot of rumors
about giving LTE function for it which I
think would be a great change to a form
factor where I don't have to carry a
phone around with me anymore and if I
wanted to talk on the phone
talk to somebody which who makes phone
calls anymore you know just just do a
little Power Rangers thing I was hoping
you say Dick Tracy but all except power
who's Dick Tracy okay ranger doorbells
and Dick Tracy but there had also been
rumors of a camera being added to it
that one I'm not so like I don't believe
that much they want to do it kind of
like well if you unlocked with your face
that might be the camera right well they
wanted to do for the watch at least more
of like a like a Jetsons thing you know
where it's like a face communicator
thing as opposed to talking on it like
Richard a trademark or whatever whatever
his name is
yeah they were going for my like a
Jetsons thing with that I don't believe
that rumor that much I feel like that
would kill your battery life if that
were the case
yeah if you waste time on the phone you
mean no no no no on the wash oh they
would have to have some like crazy
battery to be able to like last more
than a day with that
I just it's just gonna be more guilt
that I don't work out so I don't want to
buy one the other thing we should at
least mention to is that they're been
hopes and dreams that they would create
like a circular face and maybe that's in
the running but I don't thinks I do I do
Bridget's face hell no I hate to wear
watches I think everybody does but I do
hope it does have the LTE thing because
I think that could be where the iPhone
kind of goes next as opposed to you know
carrying the phone in your pocket at all
times you can you don't need the phone
anymore if it has LTE
some people might say you know I don't
like I don't want to use anything with
like a really small screen what I do I
mean I think typing like this would look
really dumb but I feel like you'd get
used to it you might feel like a spy it
would be kinda I have no problem I just
want the watch from cold tonight anyways
back to the chat I'm Prodigy says
question do you think the color schemes
are any good shouldn't there be more
options yeah I think I'd have a blue
phone ever blue iPhone don't you think
that's gonna be like copycatting too
much the Google pixel everyone's got a
blue phone but Apple hmm you're gonna
I've never been really
phone colors because like people put
cases over their phones anyway the only
reason I got this clear case guy so you
could see my rose gold phone well I just
on a rose gold case for that but he
wouldn't have known that I waited longer
to get my Rose iPhone what what's the
gold color this year what is wash gold
blush gold wait I saw something with
blush I think it's blush gold at this
time they're doing some other gold this
year and Space Gray and I yeah I would I
felt like they actually went out on a
limb a little bit more with the five
seas and I'm kind of sad that they
haven't done anything even close to that
since then the world needs more color
well wasn't the 5c outside like plastics
it was easier to like adjust the color
on that
yes whereas with our the rumors that
it's gonna be like aluminium this time
around
aluminum yeah and maybe well the X I
think is supposed to be glass on both
sides oh that's that's different yeah
enjoy I don't know how I gonna color
that's my little color gonna be the
little nubbin on that on the on the
front screen oh do you have a name for
it I called it nubbin but like it's the
nagy somebody somewhere named did not I
was like the third I we've all decided
to call it notch for reasons that I
don't understand I I thought
forehead would be a good one but
whatever I'll still come on yeah they've
fallen in a tech media zeitgeist mm-hmm
all right let's get to a few more
question before I wrap it up for the day
do you think iPhone X will switch to
OLED yes that's the rumor yeah I me
haven't heard otherwise right well we
also thought that the 7 was gonna switch
to a light remember I don't remember
that was too long ago come on maybe we
didn't think about it we definitely said
like they should because that's like
pretty much a standard at this point and
yet they're they haven't well yeah for a
lot of Android phones for sure
especially the Samsung one so problem is
again you're gonna have to spend a
thousand dollars to get the OLED screen
or just buy a Samsung if there's an OLED
screen yeah
there will be an OLED screen I like
that's the strong rumor
I think that's about it for the
questions today we are gonna have a
pretty packed day tomorrow and on that
note we want to remind everybody that we
will be late tomorrow as our cohorts in
San Francisco will be covering the event
