seenot appliances and right now we're
taking an up-close look at the brand-new
KitchenAid siphon Brewer coffee maker so
this machine definitely looks different
from the standard drip machines are
gonna see at the store if you look at it
looks like some sort of cross between a
gumball machine and maybe some high tech
or even 19th century lab equipment it
uses vapor pressure from water that it
boils and essentially will use it to
force it up into the brewing chamber
essentially you get a lot of the flavors
and complex aroma as that will otherwise
get lost when you use conventional drip
machines one thing I have to say though
is that this Brewer and siphon brewing
in general does tend to have a more
cloudy texture to the coffee it's it's
not clear it's not as smooth or silky
but it's really a delicious cup of
coffee you can definitely get a manual
siphon brewer and for not that much
money but this is one of the few that
actually can just plug right into your
wall and you just flip a switch and boom
you've got your slice and brew in about
five or six minutes
Wow I definitely think the KitchenAid
siphon brewer is a handsome product it
is a little awkward to operate you have
to basically make sure that you have a
nice seal so that the vacuum pressure
will actually happen there's also the
issue of clean up you have to basically
wash every part of this by hand it
becomes a drag you have to actually
clean out all the grounds and can't even
put the main brewing chamber in water
and submerge it because it might
actually you know crack the glass and
that's something you definitely don't
want to do with this thing despite all
its complicated cleanup I have to say
sai-san brewing especially the
KitchenAid siphon brewer has this really
wild way of ruined coffee when you
actually look at it it's really violent
it's exciting you see all the steam or
the vapor come up and just push into the
chamber and then there's a lot of
bubbling going on and then right after
that you just cascades down in one fell
swoop it's really something to see so if
one of your hands on the KitchenAid
siphon brewer you're gonna have to wait
until July when the machine is going
be sold in williams-sonoma stores
exclusively after that it will be
offered more widely in August so
hopefully you'll be able to scoop this
one up for two hundred and fifty dollars
