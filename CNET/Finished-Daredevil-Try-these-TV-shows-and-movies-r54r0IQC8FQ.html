daredevil and find yourself missing Matt
Murdock the Man Without Fear we feel
your pain here are our picks of what to
watch when you finish daredevil
superheroes have a way of stealing the
limelight but Gotham sets in Batman's
hometown when Bruce Wayne himself is
just a kid gives the Dark Knight's cast
of side characters and aspiring villains
some much-deserved screen time
if after daredevil you're looking for
some slightly lighter entertainment
agents of shield is a more
family-friendly superhero TV show as an
added bonus it takes place within the
same world as the Avengers movies so
it's an easy way to beef up your Marvel
Universe knowledge don't touch Lola if
what you like best about daredevil was
the cheeky grin of Charlie Cox then try
Boardwalk Empire the Prohibition era HBO
drama in which the British actor plays a
significant role my assertions from apps
already Watts a few more Boardwalk
Empire also tackles the same themes of
crime and corruption and city
development and is tense stylish and
violent in equal measure this isn't the
time for hurt feelings they seem done
but I feel if underappreciated
superheroes are your thing you might try
Punisher warzone this gritty Marvel
antihero has a very simple mission to
kill every criminal he can and this
none-too-subtle adaptation is pretty
faithful to that finally taxi driver
starring Robert De Niro and a very young
Jodie Foster is the definitive tale of
New York vigilantism you guys got to be
a Secret Service man I was just curious
because I thought maybe I'd make a good
set against the backdrop of a crime
infested new york city director martin
scorsese gives us a more grounded look
at personal justice and its consequences
than you'll get from any superhero show
you're talking to me that should be
enough to tide you over until daredevil
returns if you have any other
suggestions let us know in the comments
and happy viewing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
