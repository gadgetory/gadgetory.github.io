is your Avengers infinity war spoiler
free review this is the third Avengers
movie and it's been built up over the
past ten years over the course of 18
movies this is the 19th film in the
Marvel Cinematic Universe so how was it
Avengers infinity war was really really
good
it is easily the best Avengers movie is
it the best Marvel movie that's
debatable
Black Panther and Captain America the
Winter Soldier are probably better and
that they are generally self-contained
how was infinity war as a culmination of
a decade of storytelling it was kind of
amazing each of the Avengers films so
far set up a new status quo the first
one built the Avengers as a team and we
had the Battle of New York the Marvel
world became very aware of an alien
threat and that the Avengers were
Earth's protectors age of Ultron had
huge ramifications for the MCU
because of what happens in sokovia then
there's infinity war you have heroes
from all over the MCU joining forces and
combinations we have not seen before in
the trailers you see Thor with the
guardians of the galaxy spider-man
talking to dr. strange and lots of
Avengers teeming with wakandans the MCU
characters are more intertwined than
ever before this is a war that's been
building for some time now and the film
delivers infinity war does set up a lot
of future storylines which I cannot
mention here because this is remaining
spoiler free now do you need to watch
every other Marvel movie for infinity
war to make sense now I don't think so
if you watch infinity war on its own
without watching any other Marvel movie
you may be generally confused as to who
each character is however you will be
able to understand the main story Thanos
wants to take over and they're a bunch
of superheroes in his way
that being said here are the movies you
should probably watch before seeing the
latest Avengers movie I don't consider
this a spoiler since so many of these
characters are seen in the trailers at
the bare minimum watch the first two
Avengers movies to fill out the picture
watch guardians of the galaxy volumes 1
&amp;amp; 2 for
firm understanding you probably also
want to watch thor ragnarok Captain
America Civil War and Black Panther
Avengers infinity war does lean on the
previous movies for characterization but
since this is one shared universe each
character is relatively consistent with
how they are portrayed in other Marvel
movies cap is brave Iron Man is smart
and Groot
well he's Groot is this film more
enjoyable if you read the Infinity
Gauntlet comics from 1991 yeah I think
so there are not two the miniseries but
it's not required reading for the film
let's talk about Thanos he's the main
antagonist in the film you know the big
purple guy Marvel movies have had a
tendency to not have the greatest
villains Thanos is built up throughout
the film as a true threat to the known
universe
he is menacing and he backs up his TUC
Thanos has his motivations and they are
clear that helps flesh him out as the
antagonist
he joins kill monger and vulture as a
top 3 Marvel villain also of extreme
importance is the CG Thanos is a
computer-generated character so that
effect is key if you are going to
believe Pano's is dangerous I will say
phantoms looks better in some scenes
compared to others but generally Thanos
is relatively believable there are some
great subtlety that is seen in the
acting of Josh Brolin that transfers
through to thanasis CG face Danis also
has a few underlings beyond the masses
you've seen the battle in Wakanda they
could be fleshed out a little bit better
in the film but they provide a good
threat let's talk about pacing and
post-credit scenes I don't believe this
will give anything away about the film's
story but if you consider that info
spoilers you probably won't hit stop and
the player now okay we good good at this
screening the movie was about 2 hours
and 15 minutes long that time is from
the start of the film to the credits
there was one post-credit scene and no
mid-credits scene the film is packed but
not rushed affinity war does not drag
either this Avengers movie is extremely
important to the Marvel Cinematic
Universe the directors did a great job
putting everything together in a neat
package it mixes humor with drama and
great action you know like a Marvel
movie usually does we've got lots of
coverage on the Marvel films over
cnet.com including how to watch the
films and TV shows in chronological
order how many times do you plan on
seeing infinity war let me know am i as
that term probably going to see infinity
war again and maybe again maybe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
