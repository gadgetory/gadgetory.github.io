Francisco I'm Connie Guillermo
editor-in-chief of CNET news and I'm
here today to introduce a very special
guest speaker Alex garland is known to
many of you for his sci-fi work books
scripts directing projects and we're
going to talk to him about those
projects and something coming up in the
next month so please join me in
welcoming Alex garland to CNN so thanks
I'm a print reporter so doing video is
always a new thing for me but I hope
that we make this an engaging and
interesting QA for all of you thank you
Alex for joining us I'm gonna get up
because the cameraman said move over a
bit see we're tweaking so it'll be like
a reality TV moment yeah you happy all
right sorry
that's all right all right so I have a
little brief intro of Alex that I want
to read off and then we'll get right
into questions we're gonna be talking
here for about 45 minutes and thank you
for everyone who sent me your questions
there are about 50 cards that I could
have brought but we're gonna try to keep
it to 45 minutes here so as I say Alex
garland is a writer and director some of
you might have read his books the beach
anybody add it to your reading list just
don't don't do that none of you read it
and it's fine it was like 25 years ago
it's fine so add it to your reading list
it's a cult classic some of you may have
seen the movies that he wrote the
screenplay for 28 days later
sunshine never let me go
dread and for the past few years he's
also started directing so anybody here
has seen
ex machina for ex machina he also earned
an Academy Award nomination for Best
Screenplay later this month a new film
he's directed and written the screenplay
for annihilation is coming out I was
lucky enough to see it earlier this week
this is going to be a spoiler free
discussion as much as we can make it but
I hope that you get a good sense of that
movie I recommend everyone go see it
because the one thought that I had after
I saw it was thought-provoking in a way
where you walk outside and you kind of
walk into the wall cuz you're still
thinking about what you've just seen
okay here's my first question for you
this is very unscientific but I looked
up on Wikipedia and they internet the
descriptions of all the projects that
you've worked on and here are some of
the words and phrases people have used
subtly intelligent stylish cerebral
dystopian surreal strange and
interesting a sci-fi fantasy a human
drama quietly disturbing
post-apocalyptic car story a sci-fi
action film a poignant coming-of-age
love story with undertones of sadness
and horror running zombies in daylight
in London so fair to say you've spent
most of the past two decades in sci-fi
but I read that you were a history major
and maybe sort of an indifferent student
wow this is a good example of how
reliable Wikipedia is probably my mum
wrote most of those comments I suspect
and I studied history of art ah art I
did Manchester University between I
don't know age of 19 and 22 but ya know
I did I was there I studied history of
art and was barely present and I'm not
sure it led to anything but I sort of
enjoyed it kind of well I think it's led
to someplace that I want to talk to you
about the
big discussion in Techland this day
these days is about people getting into
science and technology engineering math
stem and I read and maybe I'm wrong that
you got into science in your 20s on your
own and sort of discovered it which is
unusual way for people to get into the
topic that is true when I was at school
I I struggled actually at school and I'm
47 I think probably education is a lot
more kind of relaxed now in some
respects or I hope it is we got streamed
into like slow groups and fast groups
and stuff like that and some of the
things certainly things like mathematics
in fact pretty much everything I was in
the slow group and when it came to
science with physics and biology and
chemistry I wasn't able to take any of
them as exams because my my performance
wasn't up to it so I had to take this
thing called environmental science which
is what they gave to people who couldn't
do the real science and and I think I
just I think I just figured that it was
all beyond me and in many respects it is
all beyond me except as a layperson I
can be interested in it and in my
twenties I I began to hear things that
related to science such as it would be
like a little detail that the faster you
go the slower time passes and that kind
of thing or sort of puzzled me it didn't
fit with any sense of time that I had
and so I started reading but really as
an uneducated layperson and that that
never really stopped I'm now 47 and I've
been trying to get my head around
collapse of you know wavefunction or
whatever as best I can and which isn't
very much but but I understand why it's
interesting so yeah that's true and and
then I I tried to put it in the
narratives as much as possible because
there is something strange about the
well the way the world is functioning at
the moment where there's a massive
disconnect that there are disconnects
everywhere almost everywhere you
look between people who have and don't
have or know or don't know and one of
the areas is science and it's a it's an
increasingly rarefied group and the the
knowledge gap is scary and I don't think
helpful so I guess I try and include it
in the narratives I write also I would I
would say you've had a career in stem
just based on the work and what you have
written I've had a career in stem a
science tech engineering math you've got
a stem background oh it's them
that's an Americanism and it's lost on
me sorry but but I think it's probably
good so thanks it was a compliment in
case you weren't sure having seen a lot
of your work and read some of the
screenplays actually that are online
probably you don't know that but the
future is a very strange kind of
unsettling place in your creative world
and I'm curious I know that you're a fan
of B movies and you call them paranoid
sci-fi films that you watched in the 70s
like Soylent Green Logan's Run Planet of
the Apes West world how that informed
your take on sci-fi in your work oh well
I work in genre I I write thrillers and
sci-fi movies and and then to some
extent try to subvert them but actually
some of those older films were in
themselves very subversive they're their
typical - usually their
anti-authoritarian in some kind of way
and suspicious and take all kinds of
risks and yeah that that's the stuff I
grew up on and I'm of course it's found
its way into to what I do yeah ask -
sci-fi you've said that you like the
genre because and this is a quote allows
for really really big subject matter
without having to be embarrassed about
it that's right when I first started I
always felt like I had to smuggle ideas
in to the stories so first movie I ever
wrote was 28 days later which is a
zombie flick and
there were ideas into it but but they
were they were kind of buried or hidden
for the most part and I realized
increasingly that in science fiction you
have permission you have permission for
big ideas and actually most sci-fi tends
to work as analogy or metaphor in some
kind of way and so I increasingly
gravitated towards it it just you didn't
hurt yeah like you said in the question
you didn't have to feel embarrassed
about the idea in fact it's almost
encouraged what about comedy would you
ever do one I just tried to write one
so yeah it's kids movie I got two
children and I just wrote two scripts
back-to-back actually one of them is a
kind of tech thriller which is set here
actually in San Francisco I'm about to
spend coming back in a few weeks to kind
of look around and try and find
locations and that kind of thing
hopefully you know all things being
equal we'll shoot later in the year so
that's great
but I've got two children and they've
never seen anything I've worked on it's
always too violent or druggie or
whatever and so I thought I will try
before my daughter gets too old to do
one kids movie she's 10 if I can get it
done within the next two years she'll be
interested
okay what about VR ever thought of doing
a movie in viewer I am a big video game
or I love video games and so I'm I'm
aware of VR I've got the PlayStation VR
headset and a friend of mine has got
oculus rift he got it set up and running
because he's super smart and this was
maybe before it was like commercially
available they had like a development
kit for it or something there and I
think it's amazing I think it's
application probably this is the kind of
audience that would correct me it's
application seems more suited to video
games than to filmed narrative
and it's it's not it's not because of
anything other than norcia
actually in a videogame you're
controlling the camera and so you don't
get the seasick thing where the boat
moves in a direction you're not
expecting and you start to feel terrible
what I have found in in anything that
looked like a cutscene where the camera
moves in a certain kind of way it's
difficult it you get a you get a
visceral response you get an inner-ear
type problem a nossa type problem and a
kind of stomach type problem you sort of
lurching feeling I I don't know how to
direct the gaze in that kind of VR and I
don't which you do in film easily with
lighting and focus and stuff like that
I'm not sure how you do that in VR but
mainly I'm not sure how you move the
camera without making people want to
throw up or take the helmet off but
video games awesome so I guess we'll
have to wait and see somebody come up
with oh yeah all I'm saying is I don't
know how to do it but some of them maybe
your kids yeah I want to ask you about
ex machina and so sorry if we discuss
spoilers for people who didn't see it
but too bad it came out in 2015 you said
you felt huge affection for Ava and it's
her story that you were writing and her
journey were most concerned with telling
and the character of Caleb Smith is
meant to be ask the audience watching
and learning it as he learns what's
going on and so I was curious about why
was that the story wanted to tell why
was she the focal point for you because
the film had two separate sets of
concerns I mean one of it was sentient
and artificial intelligence and human
intelligence and that's very kind of
apparent but there was another set of
interests in it as well and it were I
think loosely speaking you'd say
attached to gender initially so you you
have a machine that looks female and how
is the gender attributed is it something
that is contained in a physical form
it conferred upon the machine by other
people why would the word it feel
inappropriate to the machine and which
would imply conferred and or is it is it
simply an appearance and so initially
there's a gender discussion but then it
becomes something else as well which was
literally just about objectification
which is that this young kid caleb is is
set a task does this machine have an
interior life it's it's very very
straightforward question he is asked the
question and the audience is asked the
question at the same time so he in that
respect as a surrogate for the audience
and at a certain point the machine stops
looking like a machine when the Machine
first appears it is very clearly overtly
a machine but the Machine aspect is
increasingly hidden and as the Machine
aspect is hidden the question stops
being asked so now that might not be
true for every audience member but
effectively there is a twist at the end
which is that the machine does have an
interior life now that would not be a
twist if you had continued to expect
that the machine had an interior life so
why was it in there because it was the
preoccupation of the film any plans to
continue the story no okay there was a
lot of just there was and is a lot of
discussion around it artificial
intelligence and you've said that
writing ex machina has not made you an
expert on it but you wrote an op-ed
piece for the New York Times in 2015
basically defending AI and calling out
people like Stephen Hawking's and Elon
Musk were afraid of it and you said that
it's not the machine component of AI
that scares you but the humans can you
tell us a little bit about your thinking
there yeah I mean that that's a
reductive argument but I think it's
broadly speaking correct I think you can
make a good analogy with nuclear power
and nuclear power is clearly powerful
and therefore potentially dangerous but
it becomes about
application of it I think there is
another thing I felt as well which is
the eye I don't like Luddite thinking
III understand that technology is
potentially dangerous but I also think
it's potentially beneficial and you just
have to take a measured approach to it
I live in Britain and in Britain we have
a National Health Service which is run
by humans and it seems to me to be
perfectly plausible that the state-run
National Health Service would be better
run by an AI that that doesn't seem
dangerous to me that seems potentially
beneficial all sorts of political
decisions and how you attribute
resources might simply be better done by
an AI so I'm a mile armed by that no I
think it's a possibility
there's other areas in which AI could
potentially be very dangerous so it's
not to take a benign or paranoid view
it's just to take a measured view how
much AI have you adopted in your
personal life do you have a smart
speaker do you talk to your phone no I
don't I'm I'm sort of slightly too old
maybe but my son does you know I've
noticed when he sends a text message he
doesn't type it in he talks it I'm sort
of used to the disconnect in some
respect I I saw it with my parents when
they couldn't use a remote control on a
television and it's it's sort of in the
nature of what happens but even though I
don't use those things particularly I'm
aware of them to the extent I can be and
I don't feel alarmed by them
let's switch and talk about annihilation
um but before I dive into that you have
told others that you came to the project
because Scott Rudin the producer wanted
you to read the book but you had gone to
him to talk about another project what
was the other project oh it was more
just I've always got a project kind of
that I'm mulling over and
and it was it event essentially got
folded into annihilation but ya know
Scott came to me with the book we just
worked together on ex machina he said
read it and I was struck actually by the
books originality actually it just
wasn't like other stories that I'd read
one of the things that happens with
stories is that we repeat them where we
say the same story again and again and
again and we we change details or
elements but essentially it's the same
story and and this felt outside of that
and for that reason alone I was very
attracted to it and it also had a very
strong atmosphere very unusual
atmosphere and so I felt I did want to
work on it whilst not being entirely
sure how to work on it and and the the
preoccupations of the other project just
folded into the new one
annihilation you've described as truly
alien and that was what you were going
for as well maybe I'm wrong maybe the
internet got it wrong again
no but what does that mean truly alien
oh it was that when we when we deal with
aliens we we often make them like us in
some way maybe they want to eat us or
maybe they want our water our resources
or they want to teach us about galactic
federations or whatever it happens to be
but these are all sort of human concerns
and and it seems like a legitimate thing
to say that an alien might not be like
us in any way at all and we are
motivated by things and we have agendas
and an alien might not have an agenda or
might not be motivated and so it was it
was an attempt to create an alien alien
and you talked about the journey that
you're taking us on as suburbia to
psyckadeli a-- psyckadeli uh is that
right where's the san francisco you
should know
well that's the way you described it not
me and I I'm curious about that as well
what does that means how does that play
out in the movie in a spoiler-free way
as you want to describe in a literal way
the story starts in suburbia and ends in
psychedelia and in it was a sort of
shorthand on the film it's the way we
used to talk about it to each other and
it had a purpose to it as well because
if you if what you want to do is is end
in a place that is strange that is truly
strange the means by which you get there
become very important and if you start
something strange so not in suburbia
which let's take suburbia is as
representing not strange although of
course it is a reach sure what you find
is that strangeness has a diminishing
return we we're sort of proximity based
creatures and we get acclimatized to a
state quite quickly and so by the end of
the film what was strange is no longer
strange it's just the landscape in which
you exist and so it felt like it needed
to be a progression from something I'm
thinking about it because I just saw the
movie and that obviously makes a lot of
sense having the director explained to
the screenplay and the book part ways
that's been a topic of a lot of
discussion and as someone who's written
screenplays that are very faithful to
the original material like never let me
go and or maybe semi faithful like dread
you have said that annihilation was a
chance to do a free-for-all and why is
that what about the material may be it
may be free form rather than
free-for-all what what I felt when I was
writing the book when I was reading the
book excuse me that's a as Freudian as
it gets
was that reading it was a dreamlike
experience and I wasn't sure saying
effectively in an adaptation like never
let me go I could kind of cut and paste
narrative right and I couldn't do that
in annihilation I
it was the experience of reading the
book that felt most relevant so I did
something slightly odd with the
permission of the writer that's what I
thought I had at any rate I hope I did
which was to do a it was an adaptation
which was a memory of the book so
instead of going back and rereading it
and underlining passages I did an
adaptation from my experience of having
read it without going back to the book
and what that means is that sometimes
the film correlates very closely and
sometimes it doesn't so it really as a
function of memory and I thought that
that was a way to be faithful to the
thing that I experienced most strongly
what which was it's dreamlike nature the
film focuses on an all-women team so it
passes the Bechdel test which says that
you have to have at least two women it
who talk to each other and about
something besides a man there's a very
loud debate going on today about
diversity in the role of women in a
variety of industries Tech Hollywood etc
so I want to applaud you for saying over
and over again it doesn't make a
difference to you that the story is
about women scientists it's just that
it's about scientists who happen to be
women does it surprise you that people
say to you oh but this is this is women
this is a no they're pushing new ground
nobody said that to me and and also it
was it was an adaptation of the book and
that is the case in the book I I don't
want to sort of take credit for what or
Jeff did really but it is true that it
didn't interest me I thought that this
was to some extent a reaction to ex
machina I thought the absence of the
argument was the thing that was
interesting if that makes sense it yeah
in a way I don't want to say more than
that it was the absence of the argument
I found interesting I want to applaud
you for that as well as a woman in tech
because we're get tired of hearing about
great CEOs or leaders and then having
them being qualified as great women CEOs
or great women leaders what about the
behind the camera Oh an i elation looks
like a pretty mixed crew but the
director editor cinematographer music
those are all men true but the head of
stunts and actually all sorts of
departments were not I mean look but but
you know what I'm not gonna you
is is the film industry dominated by men
yep
statement of fact it is alright I
understand that you did a lot of
research for annihilation and talk to
geneticists about evolution mutation and
I I want to understand what's the most
important takeaway you want the people
who watch it to have when it comes to
the science in anihilation not much it's
it's it's it's not really science it has
an agenda which is really about
self-destruction I would say it clues in
the name yeah it's it's more sort of
metaphysical than science I'd say there
is science in there to kind of ground it
there was a principle this might sound
strange but if you think of a dream if
I'm saying that what this film is
dreamlike dreams feel grounded in some
strange kind of way so now this is a
dream and to my right there's a grand
piano and a couple of moments later it's
a polar bear and you don't within the
dream say why is the grand piano now a
polar bear it's actually part of the
dream logic and it's part of the dream
you're having and it all makes sense and
so it felt important that the film had
that strange sense of grounding in it
but it's also like not free for all but
free form it has that quality as well so
it was it was a sort of mixture of the
two I wouldn't really take the science
to explicitly in some respects although
it's that did you have fun making it no
it was a nightmare it was a truly
unpleasant film to work on but well it's
just a statement of fact but I'm very
proud of the film and I'm proud it was
made by collective I work in a
collective I work some of the people
I've worked with them for 20 years and
we worked flat out hard on this and it
was a good group of people not easy not
fun but we ended up with something we
collectively felt proud of it's going to
be distributed in a very unusual way
we'll be able to see it here in the US
in China Canada and then Netflix has the
international distribution rights I
think everyone knows how you feel about
that you designed a movie for the large
screen I'm curious though what you think
about streaming services as a way to
distribute movies and what the potential
you see there yeah it's an entirely
separate issue and what I feel is that
broadly it's a good thing if I ask
myself what is the best bit of filmed
drama I saw last year it's Handmaid's
Tale and I saw that on a streaming
service I think some of the most
sophisticated adult content adult
meaning morally complex rather than
pornographic was on streaming services
and on the small screen in general I'd
say on television television or
streaming so so I think it's good and it
disseminates stuff very widely and it is
more comfortable with complex matter I
would say then the big screen is the big
screen is has a problem which is its
opening weekend and the film's cost a
lot of money
and if they don't make they don't
generate a lot of money in the first
weekend people lose their jobs people
don't work again it's sort of serious
and difficult streaming services are
different it's it's a more passive
relationship it's you know ten bucks a
month or whatever it is that someone's
paying to participate in it and it
allows for more creative freedom so I
think that's a good thing
well you can also pass take it back and
go what
right and watch it over and over again
and that to do you binge watch you mean
just like watch a ton of stuff in a day
yeah yeah
aside from Handmaid's Tale what have you
been watched last man on earth
I think that's it okay
it probably isn't there's probably other
stuff I can't think well there must be
some kids stuff there you get sucked
into no I know I can walk out the room
oh you know what I like adventure time i
watch that with the kids um what movie
would you like to see may that you would
never make yourself I don't know that's
like what's your favorite color um
what's your favorite color I don't have
a favorite color and if I really had a
movie I wanted to try to make I would
try to make it that's that's the plus of
my job you know yeah nothing on that
okay sorry
last year you signed a deal to develop
some TV projects for X F 4 FX excuse me
and one of the questions that was
written in was having written dread and
had been made some comments about
perhaps it's not the the best take on
dread would you consider doing no it was
the best take it was well no I mean I'm
being glib I was very happy with dread I
was really pleased to that film it
bombed in the box office but the film
itself other was pretty cool okay
would you consider revisiting dread
definitely not no but that that's just
because I I I don't like working in
franchises I don't want to work in
sequels just cuz life is short and I'd
rather try something different okay
in 2005 you wrote a script for a film
adaptation of the popular video game
Halo it was never made into a film so
what was your vision for halo can you
tell us I was a long time ago
I basically oh I know exactly what I did
I went online
and somebody had done a transcript of
the entire video game every bit of
dialogue and every cutscene and I
followed it very closely that's what I
did and I wanted to do a faithful
adaptation of hallo
I actually really dug hallo some of my
favorite video game experiences were
working through I don't know maybe no
one in remember say hello but it was it
had its hardest setting was legendary
and it was hard and it was a split
screen because I don't know I'm not sure
we had the ability to hook up you know
play online and me and my brother would
get stoned and play a low and gradually
claw our way through the legendary level
and I loved it so I wanted to try and
honor that but then they didn't make it
into a film too avant-garde sort of
stone or avant-garde yeah you've also
co-written a bunch of other video game
things in slave Odyssey to the west you
worked as a story supervisor on the game
Devil May Cry why do you like video
games what's the appeal of writing for
them I grew up with video games 47 there
was a kid my like my best friend
actually lived a couple of streets over
his mum and dad went to America came
back with pong you know like a tennis
game and I just couldn't believe it
I I thought it was the most amazing
thing I'd ever seen started playing
games never stopped grew up with him
like I said space invaders pac-man then
Nintendo blew the world open and Sega
followed and I just kept going and I
thought it was fantastic and I never and
and it's been really kind of a beautiful
thing to see how video games have
exploded and become so sophisticated if
there's any gamers here you'll know
probably the Last of Us which is the
most amazingly sophisticated narrative
with complex morals you know of the sort
I said streaming services is doing so
well well there it is happening in video
game and
I enjoyed working on it I'm it's
probably not something I'm too
well-suited to in some respects I'd love
to do it again
but really I like playing them I like
experiencing them and playing them I
think that I think they're amazing I
think their potential is spectacular do
you let your kids play oh yeah for sure
I mean me and my son play destiny in the
way that me and my brother used to play
Halo we don't get stoned because he's 14
but I mean we we enjoy it if you could
be a video game character who would that
be this was a question from my office
yeah it's fair enough all right there's
a game called tempest which is an old
arcade game and I would be the weird
spider thing going along the top
shooting at the aliens I want to ask you
just about Tech in your life are you
addicted to a piece of tech no I'm kind
of separate from it I've never been on
Twitter or Instagram or Facebook or any
of that stuff my kids do it I I come to
all these things late and I actually
think I need to get up to speed with it
more it's it's not a judgement but there
is stuff about it that scares me I don't
like public crucifixions at all and I'm
really sick of hearing about it on the
media I if I if I was on Twitter I'd be
dead you know I'd be crucified I'd be
hung drawn and quartered because
glancing thoughts crossed my mind and I
haven't thought all of them through and
I make mistakes and I changed my mind
the next day and I find I find the rush
to judgment kind of sickening actually
and and also banal you know kind of
banal and boring I'm truly truly tired
of it and I don't want to be part of it
I feel anxious about my children being
part of it but what am I gonna do is
there's the way of the world okay well
that was not a you know squishy answer
on social there
self-driving cars good or bad so it
depends if they crash and kill someone I
mean let's broadly say good as long as
nobody gets hurt okay fair enough would
you go for a ride in one yeah sure what
technology do you wish were invented
specifically for you time travel
anti-aging longevity new lungs that kind
of stuff what technology do you wish
were never invented
aside from social hmm nothing nothing I
mean if I really thought about it maybe
something but like I said I'm not
Luddite I don't know if that is saying
that means anything to people Luddites
being the people that smashed up the
looms during the industrial revolution
and were anti technology and I'm not
anti-technology I'm scared of its
applications but but the technology
itself I think is neutral usually I
think um what do you think of Silicon
Valley you visited here a couple of
times as you said you're about to
hopefully set a movie here TV series
yeah um I think it's intriguing I think
it's it's a sort of self-fulfilling
prophecy of its own sort in some
respects and it's it's clearly on a kind
of expansion scale it scares me because
I'm left-wing and old-fashioned in some
respects and what I see is very very
powerful corporations without much
oversight government correctly has
checks and balances built into it and I
don't see the checks and balances here I
see I see capitalism and capitalism is
dangerous capitalism is more dangerous
than tech I believe in regulation
and so so it scares me I don't trust it
it's unelected I don't believe that
purchasing a product is equivalent to
election it's it's a it is a different
thing you can you can unelect someone
later you can't unelect the corporation
so i feel weary so don't own a lot of
stocks in tax then I don't own any
stocks in anything as far as I'm aware
but but that's that in itself isn't a
judgment it's just laziness
I'd like to make money out of it if I
could that would be cool but it's it's
more no I I'm talking about broader step
back things if you guys are tech people
you guys are powerful you know with
power comes responsibility take it
seriously that's all
aside from social media is there
something that stands out for you that
you think Tech has done particularly
wrong it's been it quite easy you're
saying social medias done it wrong it's
not the social media it's the way it's
used it's it's people being kind of
crude acting like a mob that that's not
the media that is the behavior of the
people within the media it's people not
being forgiving in the way that we are
when the person is standing in front of
us have tech companies done stuff wrong
yeah of course I'm sure they have every
corporation every person has that's
maybe the point I'm not I'm not talking
about it in those terms I'm saying power
power is dangerous tech companies are
powerful therefore they need some kind
of regulation that's all I just circling
back because we're gonna wrap it up here
in a few minutes but annihilation it's
definitely a thought-provoking movie and
people are gonna have expectations
having seen ex machina what's the best
thing that you want people to say after
they walk out what do you want them what
would you consider a high praise I'd be
grateful if they went in the first place
if they walked out feeling that it was a
kind of visceral thought-provoking
experience that would be ideal
I would I would say it's probably a film
to see with an open mind and and
hopefully a film that is that stays with
people to some extent that's what one
always hopes I think it has a definite
mood and I wonder did you listen to any
particular music to get you there
because the music is kind of interesting
when I was watching the preview people
were kind of following along with your
soundtrack and I just wondered what the
inspiration was when you sat down to
imagine what that would be well I know
it's hard for you guys you haven't seen
the movie sorry
well I work I think as I've said in a
collective I'm not controlling those
things I'm not interested in pyramid
structures and the people responsible
for the music in a way the people who
should ask I thought the music was
beautiful and powerful but I didn't
write it
and it was written by these two guys
Jeff Barrow and Ben Salisbury and Jeff's
in a band called Porter said he's not
really from a film background is from a
like a rock background I guess you'd say
and Ben's an old mate of his and they
make beautiful music together and I just
dug what what they were you know the way
they responded to the work that everyone
else was doing and that was their
contribution it is very visually
stunning the music has an effect and
just a spoiler alert water plays a big
role in it and you used a lot of visuals
around water so go to the restroom
before you see that movie just I guess
my last question is you've been talking
about these movies and your work is
sci-fi we're all fans video games huge
crowd here but you get asked a lot about
how you think and how you process sci-fi
and how you come to make these films but
what questions has nobody ever asked you
that you'd like to answer then you'd
like to talk oh my gosh these questions
you ask um so now my job is to think of
a question that no one's ever asked me
that I'd love to
asked its I'm gonna ask it to you what
have you always wanted to be asked how
do you come up with such great questions
okay
and that's the sort of dropped the mic
moment and then that's the end of this
right we can certainly ended here good
thank you very much Alex garland for
joining us here at CNN you know start
from the beginning what do you think I
do when you're away you think I'm out in
the garden pining
