Heiner with my cohort Bill Detweiler
back again to crack open more of the
latest technology this time we've got
the galaxy s 9 so what are we gonna do
with it
yeah so we're gonna take it apart we're
gonna crack it open like we always do I
practice in almost every galaxy I think
since the original launch we always love
cracking open the Samsung tech so we're
really interested to see what's inside
the s9 see how hard it is to take apart
see how hard it is to repair it
very good we learn a lot of things when
we do these bill you know from early on
from cracking open all really all the
most prominent smartphones starting with
the the first iPhone blackberries HTC
Motorola Samsung devices we've packed
open a lot and I remember early on we
would see some of these devices and
crack them open and you could tell a lot
about a company by the inside of their
devices and there were some devices that
you could tell they were really
jury-rigged and you would look at him
and say oh my gosh look they've taped up
these wires they've got stuff you know
it's a mess in here and very early on
when samsung started making smart phones
you I remember you saying to me
these devices are design so well all the
ways happen
I mean Samsung has always been a
hardware coming I've always been an
engineering based company and so it was
always a pleasure to take them apart now
the only thing that is not a pleasure
these days on the other devices is all
the adhesive that goes into it so as
everybody can see we're using a heat gun
here and we're actually applying heat to
the back of the plastic cover that's how
we're gonna get into the s9 this has
been sort of the standard way that we
take these apart for several years now
with several versions and we're also
gonna use sort of a modified guitar pick
or another thin plastic tool yep to
wedge between the back cover here and
the edge of the the frame the main body
here so that we can get into the end of
the phone and so I after I've heated up
the adhesive here there a couple
different ways to do this but we like
the heat gun we're gonna try and slide
this in here and in all fairness because
we didn't want this video to be an hour
and a half long we precooked this a
little bit obviously it has a battery
inside but we've already pre loose
the back so we can get straight into
cracking open so cooking shows where
they make all the ingredients and then
they pull it out of the oven that's
right so what we're gonna do is we're
gonna slide the pic in you can see how
easy to slides around normally this
would not do this but you've already
softened this already soften the
adhesive up here so that makes things a
lot easier when it comes to taking these
apart you do want to be very careful on
this
there is a flexible cable it's inside
near the cameras okay that we'll see
when we take this apart that we don't
want to cut through so you really only
need to insert these you know just a
quarter-inch not even that much few
millimeters inside the device to cut
through the adhesive that's around the
edge of the device you know that's what
helps keep the dust out of the device
that's what helps keep the moisture and
water out of the device
and so that's why they use adhesive
instead of screws so it used to be
screws right all these device screws it
used to be you could pop it loose
mechanical connections Clips snaps but
now it's adhesive again is it because of
everything being so thin idiots
a lot of it's because for the IPS and
the thinness you really want to make
sure that there is it you can't get the
dust and you can't get the moisture in
and people want everything to be thin so
you need smaller screws you need fewer
mechanical connectors got as we as we
lift this off here I'm going to lift
this up you can kind of see if I tilt
this up I don't know if we can get a
close-in shot there you can kind of see
the cable that connects the back plate
here to the to the motherboard that's
underneath another frame we're only real
careful cuz you want to tell this on
nectar you could really tear it that's
right yeah I mean it's designed to be
popped loose but we definitely don't
want to tear it know we crack these
things open so you don't have to but
bill has a great track record you're
putting 99% of the things that we crack
open we actually put back together again
and because we have this idea that we
you're gonna do it you know we want to
do it in a way that if you were having
to crack something open to repair it or
to learn from that you can still use
that's right we don't want to destroy
the devices and so I've separated the
back panel from the rest of the body of
the frame or the phone here and this
cable here is actually for the
fingerprint scanner that's on the back
okay so um you know oddly if you were
going to
replace this you could probably you
might be able to remove the fingerprint
scanner on the back and just replace
that okay it might come as a single part
it's you know manufacturers release
replacement parts in different ways and
the vendors that actually make
replacement parts come in different ways
but it's nice to see that if the
fingerprint scanner gets broken you
don't have to replace the whole phone
right you can yeah replace that is an
individual component it's always been
something not like about Samsung they
really componentize their devices so
that you can repair that a little more
easily and importantly they did move
that fingerprint scanner on the previous
devices it was over to the side here a
very awkward and on the note on the
previous Samsung having moved it under
it's better it's it's like you know
naturally you tend to put your finger
there it's not as nice as the you know
Nexus devices the pixel devices where it
has the bigger you know circle but it is
easier than the Samsung Galaxy S 9 or
the the note 8 yeah now the other so
we're gonna go ahead and start taking
out the screws that are inside of this
one thing I also like about Samsung
devices once you get into them they're
usually the same you know their standard
Philips screws you need a really small
screwdriver like we're using here either
a Philips like double zero or triple
zero and you can see inside the phone
before I take start taking off the
screws we can see there are a lot of
screws but they're all going to be
Phillips screws and I would bet I bet
they're all about the same length okay
so we'll be able to easily sort of put
these screws back together and put them
back together without having to know
exactly where they go so we can't see
the board's yet the circuit boards that
are inside of this all we can do because
it's covered by this sort of internal
this mid frame here now this appears to
have the wireless charging so the
induction coil on it right here yeah so
we'll need to move in the battery we can
see peeking out behind it we'll need to
remove this to actually get down into
the battery sometimes these things might
have the near-field communication built
into them but everyone you know when
they have alarms charging they have that
so I'll go ahead and start removing
these little screws here no pentalobe
screws which is great and and no
different sizes so we run into with
especially some of the Apple devices
they'll have multiple different kinds of
screws they'll have different lengths
though heavy wind off still
you know we'll stand off at the screws
yeah go into that then you have to use a
separate screwdriver to take apart that
is one thing I really do like about
samsung devices very nice so one of the
things that we've been doing you know
audience who've watched these before
knows as we've been doing these for a
long time some of the first devices that
we cracked open back in 2006 were Xbox
360 the one of the early iPods and so
you've been doing these things always
with this look of what can we learn from
the technology what we can learn about
maybe what chips are in there that we
may not know about as well as you know
what can we learn about you know not
only the repair ability but also
potentially the durability sometimes
even these companies will put technology
in there that's not activated and so
there are times when we learn you know
that there are chips in there that are
not feature part of the feature set and
so that tells you something about a
future feature they might enable or
potentially you know a feature in a
future device so there are lots of
things that we learn about when it comes
to cracking these devices open and we
always try to do it we've said it
multiple times we always try to do these
with an air of not destroying the device
that the being able to put them back
together in fact you know like you said
we we do that on a fairly regular basis
I think the only thing that we ever
really broke there are a few things that
we had to take apart and had to destroy
to take them apart if you've already
watched CES was it was 2016 well yeah
actually or 2017 where we cut apart a
sphero bb-8 toy and to use the Dremel on
that yeah poor bb-8 but like when you
pull out the dremel and have to you know
saw through something though every once
in a while that's fun
I'll do that with maybe a hundred dollar
toy I'm not gonna do it with a thousand
dollar phone yeah and that's the other
one so why do you care about repairing a
smartphone well because they're so
expensive these days because people keep
them for so many years it's really
important that you know people are gonna
trash these maybe every year yeah so
it's important that they be repairable
that people understand hey look this is
the device that
gonna have for a while I'm gonna keep it
for a while and I want to be able to
either take it back into the
manufacturer and have them repaired or I
want to be able to take it to a
third-party repair store and know that
hey the speaker goes bad hey yeah the
port one of the charging port stops
working hey I drop it I cracked the
screen you know what's gonna you know
where can I get it fixed how much is it
gonna cost me and you know because I'm
in what says the investment right yeah
what's involved and hopefully this these
videos help you to be better informed so
if your speaker goes out or if you have
a cracked screen you know you can
understand and also somebody can't pull
one over on you and say like oh when you
put through the screen I have to take
everything apart and the motherboard and
pull out the battery and you can say
well no actually I watched the cracking
open and saw that in fact all you have
to do is you know X Y Z so this is to
help you be more informed about the
devices that you own and devices in
general so that you can be you know an
informed consumer yeah yeah and informed
about tech so we've already taken out
all the screws I'm not sure whether I
had to take out all the screws to
actually remove this little mid-play but
we've taken out all the screws just to
be safe
now we're gonna kind of gently cuz this
is really thin right now wires in there
so we're gonna be really gentle and do
our best to kind of using our little
guitar picks here to pry this open
without cracking anything without
breaking anything cuz when you're doing
this we I haven't taken this apart
before like I said I did pre kuk the
back a little bit just so it would be a
little easier to take apart but we
haven't taken this apart before so I'm
not exactly sure how everything comes
apart now there we go so now we can lift
this off here like that and then we have
the sort of this mid frame which
contains some electronics now you might
think yeah you just look at this if you
haven't watched the video Oh what is
this is it just something I can throw
away or something no it's not this
actually contains important components
that you can't just sort of toss and
throw away other than just the the
wireless charging possible you can see
that it looks like the yeah it looks
like the charging coil is here on that
your contacts are here so we'll set that
aside right there and we get our first
sort of real look into the device and
what always fascinated me is that how to
layout has change you were talking about
sort of the construction we
to see really thick sort of wires in
these we used to see tape some of these
devices here in these devices now
everything is flat almost these days
there's very few mechanical connectors
everything is very well laid out it's
compact you know they try to pack as
much tech into these devices as possible
the other thing to sort of notice on all
these devices when you look inside we
can see the main system board here this
is going to be our port and our speaker
assembly down at the bottom is the
battery right you can see how much yes
the battery really takes up inside the
devices and and that's important when
you think about you know we want these
devices to last a really long time yeah
and so it's important that you have you
know it takes a sizeable battery to do
that right and there's a lot of you know
everybody remembers the old you know the
the Samsung Galaxy Note controversy of
course with with battery batteries yeah
and it's understandable when you're
trying to cram so much capacity so much
power in such a small space you know
it's gonna get hot if you don't
dissipate the peak heat well enough it
causes problems if you don't engineer if
the battery swells and you have a small
space if you have a poor manufacturing
in the battery you just get a batch of
bad batteries and you are yep tested um
all of those I'm not saying any one of
those contributed to the Samsung to the
no problems but you know if those are
all problems that occur because of these
tight tolerances that are inside these
devices now one of the things that we're
going to do is I'm gonna make an attempt
to actually remove the battery it is
actually glued down so I'm not sure
whether or not we're gonna be able to do
that but even if we can't we're gonna
remove the circuit board and we're gonna
remove the speaker assembly okay without
removing the battery
you know the batteries do have adhesive
on the back of them some batteries like
the iPad or the iPhone have a tab that
you can pull sometimes and will help
like a the strips that you put on a wall
okay and kind of remove those Samsung
does not and so we could try and heat it
but we might we might have to we might I
don't want to avoid setting the battery
on fire and eating it too much or
puncturing it so I might leave it
connected to the frame the other thing
you notice the first thing I always do
when I take devices apart is I
disconnect the battery what I don't want
I don't want power throwing flowing
through the circuits I don't want to
touch it even with something that we say
is an esd-safe tool yeah we want to
avoid any kind of short-circuit any kind
of static discharge we don't want to
damage the fragile circuits inside this
so we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna
see and you often talk about being very
careful with the battery it's one of the
areas you need to be most careful with
you don't want to puncture it with a
screwdriver you don't want to you know
be stabbing it or have metal devices
that you're using to you know pop that
thing out you don't because that's when
you know you could have safely hissed
have a have a fire right sparks a couple
years ago we cracked open the Apple
pencil the scene at stage yeah yes we
actually had smoke we did spark that fun
on stage but you know we were kind of
worried about the fire marshal when I
first moved here I popped this off and
you can see removing the front facing
facing camera yeah like the ambient
light sensor here so we're going to
remove that and decide it just pops
loose we can see the other the rear
camera here at the back you can see the
the earphones piece the speaker right
there this is actually a vibration motor
for the yeah it's the vibration right
there no it's it's what makes it vibrate
in your pocket so we're gonna try moving
here populist we're gonna pop off all
the little cords yeah so the connectors
here we just want to be real careful we
do not want to break any of the cords if
I were to damage the battery to cut that
cord that wouldn't be that much of a
kneel that much of a problem to replace
but if I break one of the circuits on
the motherboard I mean it's really hard
to solder these really small components
the whole thing is probably just trashed
me not the whole phone but the circuit
board yeah is is is is gone at that
point so what we're gonna do is we're
gonna like pop this off here we're gonna
try and I'm gonna see if I can get done
so this device one thing to note that
get you know one of the big things about
the s9 and the s9 plus with its dual
camera is that Samsung has built into
this the camera itself has a processor
now and so that processor is what it's
doing to do that super slow-mo you may
have seen some of
the promos about that 960 frames per
second really really slow mo but it also
is what enables it to do some some
low-light photography which of course if
you've worked with smartphones you know
is the worst feature in smartphones is
that low-light photography and so this
device what it does is it can take three
photos and three exposures and then it
can use that to make a better low-light
photo you know one of the big problems
with low-light photos is noise they're
very grainy and so the AI so the process
are attached to the the camera is what
enables it to do that so that's one of
the most important things about this
device and we can see Bill is talking
about how up near the camera here
there's a lot of technology in there and
one of those things is is a new feature
in this phone which is a processor just
attached to the camera so in the past
you had processors just attached to
maybe the wireless chips you had the
processors that were obviously graphics
processors that were separate this one
has its own camera processor yeah I'm
being very careful here I don't see any
other screws but even the motherboards
are usually held in pretty tight you
know yeah and so I want to be real
careful when I pop this loose I think I
am gonna try I am gonna be able to
remove this without getting the battery
which is what I want to do I don't want
to puncture the battery I don't want to
do anything that could damage the
battery start a fire yeah the fire
department to show up but you do have to
be really kind of careful and that's
what you owe you see this is why I
missed a screw so if you look right here
it's a silver colored screw and it's
holding it's right next to the device
and so that screw was preventing me from
removing the motherboard and I just kept
going and just kept forcing it and just
kept trying to bend it would you mind a
crack I might've cracks on board the
chin now if I remove the screw let's see
what happens I am there it goes right of
Samsung devices you know I can just lift
and these are among the most spelt
devices on the market you know I just
came back from mobile world
Congress and it was interesting to
compare some of the competitors have
come out now with their own you know
bezel list smartphones and they compared
to some of these Samsung devices they
really do feel like you know almost like
a brick comparatively yeah they have
they have really outdone everybody in
terms of the thinness and sort of the
spell feel of their phones that's what
they're best at you know they've had
some other challenges this device is
trying to match Apple in terms of an
emoji interesting ly enough hasn't done
real well with that you know that
avatars they've gotten some animo agree
and and then let's just showing my age
you also have the fact that they're
trying to do the face facial recognition
scanner they haven't done that integrate
that is that quite as well on the facial
recognition but they make an incredibly
spell device yeah and so here we were
after removing that last screw that
eluded me and actually broke one of my
cardinal rules I should have removed the
SIM card slot or the SD card slot here
but I did not so that pulled out that
was holding the the circuit board in we
have the circuit board here our little
l-shaped circuit board of the
rear-facing camera on that we talked
about as we've talked about in kind of
some of our previous I'm gonna remove
the camera if we come over to the back
the camera usually is held on with a
little connector here that's just
pressure fit there's a snaps on so very
good that like that and the camera
should again that's all loose probably
their most advanced feature the most
advanced new feature in this phone is
the camera with some of that
intelligence that AI built-in that's
gonna let you take low-light photos it's
gonna do the nine hundred and sixty
frames per second super slow-mo which
makes for great demos and really fun but
that low-light camera is probably what's
gonna be the best now seen it in its
test it had some mixed results with the
with the low-light camera so this is the
first time that it's it's trying to do
to do that it does have a doesn't do a
lower aperture as well so there's some
physical attributes of the camera but it
is a step forward but there's still work
to do as you can see when you when you
read the scene it
you on this there's our little camera
right there and again is this is nice
when cameras and phones are most phones
are like this their component has so if
the camera graphs you can replace the
camera without having to replace the
main circuit board without having to
replace two batteries not having to
replace obviously the screen on this and
it's usually the screen on honestly Oh
or they assembly for the screen that's
the most expensive part on okay on these
phones the most offensive single part
yeah the process oh yeah even more than
the process of the processor compared to
the phone or the screen actually is
fairly cheap fairly reasonable okay
we've got the camera separate the rear
facing camera got the front facing
camera we've got actually the rear
speaker assembly here we took that off
and we've got the mainboard
out now I'm gonna look real close at the
mainboard and I'm gonna look for the
chips that are on the board I'm gonna
look the chips on the board to the
processor the mid chips the Wi-Fi the
radios all of that they're underneath
these silver screens mote these silver
shields most of these are yeah EMI RF
shields they help filter out
electromagnetic interference protect the
chips
and sometimes they're attached to the
circuit board with clips they just snap
on yeah other times they're soldered to
the boards now yeah they're soldered to
the boards then the only way to get them
apart is actually to cut them or to
desolder then I don't want to do that in
this case we ought to put this phone
back together right we want to make sure
that it works so I hate to if I cut
these off it'll basically damage it
beyond repair which is not what I want
to do yeah so we're gonna take a metal
tool I'm gonna try to pop these loose
just to see if I can get something under
them yeah looks like they're soldered
together so we might have to call it a
day
with there might be as far as far as I
can go and on the board doesn't mean we
can't look at some of the other
components in there it just means it
might be as far as I can get it yeah I
just I'm a little concerned I want to
make sure that I don't damage any other
parts on the motherboard there are
places you know there are other people
who will actually sort of tear the
devices all the way down to the bare to
the bare components and I love that I'll
it's a great source of information
the people that do that yeah but we
always try to do this with it with the
idea of putting them back together like
I said so yeah I don't want to do that
on this case now what is we can tell you
we can say actually what is behind here
we do know great specs on the phones you
know when it first came out the iPhone
first came out and some of the early
iPods first came out we didn't
necessarily know exactly what we're on
these devices but now all the
manufacturers release that information
put it everywhere so it's real easy to
sort of find what the hardware is on
these devices and so for example we know
that this has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845
processor we know that it has 64 gigs
this one is a 64 gigs of storage and yet
the flash we know that it has a qualcomm
acoustic audio processing chip we know
that it has a maximum PMI C on it the
power management IC we know a lot about
the hardware that's inside these devices
I'll be doing without having to sort of
destroy them to find that out now the
last thing I'm gonna try to take the
last thing we're going to try and take
off one of the things that often gets
damaged on these devices beyond the
battery just like said beyond the
battery wearing down you know we've had
battery gate with the iPhone and
batteries these lithium-ion batteries
are only good for a certain number of
charging cycles recharging cycles and so
they do wear out after a while usually
you know most people don't notice it
within the normal lifespan of the phone
but some people do weigh out the Samsung
the problem they had in the note 7 they
you know here to have put that behind
them they said that they have a number
of checks in place that's enabling them
to QA these devices so that they're not
gonna have that problem we haven't seen
follow-up devices we haven't seen anyone
so as long as the company sort of
learned from those kind of mistakes I
think there were some issues with the
tolerances and the battery and so it's
we haven't seen that issue and I'm not
necessarily I'm not concerned about that
as long as you're not puncturing these
batteries as long as they're not doing
anything bad to them we haven't had any
reports of issues with this with the new
phones you know hopefully that will
continue to be the case but so we're
gonna remove another part what I was
talking about that gets damaged a lot
are the ports you know you're always
connect
things to the porch are using charger
you're connecting your headphones or
plugging them in and out and so these
can get drunk in them they can get
broken
you can break connectors inside of them
it's my favorite feature of this the
headphone jack that's my favorite
feature device you still like the old
three-and-a-half millimeter headphone
jack I do alright but you can't these
are componentized so basically if we
remove these sort of these small little
cables here we removed a couple screws
I'm gonna pop loose a few connectors
here at the bottom and we should be able
to remove let's see if we can get it out
you were just talking about a headphone
jack yep so we're gonna try and see if I
can't take the headphone jack out a
little bit you know a lot of these
devices a lot of the manufacturers have
removed the headphone jack and it's it's
not part of the pixel it's not my part
the iPhone of course you know I'll be
gentle you might hear that you do I mean
not forcing it is what has enabled you
to be able to put so many of these
devices back together um the other thing
you mentioned the Qualcomm 845 processor
that really is a desktop-class processor
that's what I need with these devices
you know these devices run as fast as
computers now and the Samsung decks as
as many of you may know is the is what
enables you to take this device and plug
in a mouse a monitor and a keyboard and
use this as a desktop computer and with
this processor it's really fast enough
now up to do that and save something's
kind of teased in the future it's likely
that it will build that into its
monitors so you'll be able to take a
Samsung phone connect it to a Samsung
monitor and that monitor can have a
mouse you know and a keyboard attached
and you'll be able to to simply use it
as you use one device as your computer
yeah and the nice thing about that from
an enterprise standpoint from from a
business standpoint is that you know all
of this the device the information on
this device the data on this device is
locked down according to company
policies right so a lot of our users on
TechRepublic
really care a lot about that the fewer
number of devices you have to manage the
better chance you have of securing your
data and so that's a very good thing
also Samsung
Knox is a nice feature that allows you
to separate your work data from your
your personal data so those are features
that do matter with this device and if
you think about even into the future
this is not a 5g device but it can do
gigabit LTE and if you're thinking in
the future this year you know this
device has a desktop class processor
next year the galaxy s 10 we're
expecting will have 5g in it that can
get up to do two gigabits per second of
coverage so of a speed and so you're
talking twice as fast as Google Fiber so
now you're talking about a phone that's
as fast as a computer on this as
powerful as a computer and it's as fast
in terms of its connectivity as the
fastest computer that you have
connection that you have in your home or
in your business so these devices really
are becoming the center of the universe
in many cases and so we're gonna we're
likely to see that continue in this
device is an interesting step in that
direction definitely and we can see we
have removed the we removed the threat
your favorite component yeah headphone
jack right here we have your headphone
jack there we go we've also removed sort
of these little component clusters we
have mounted on separate little circuit
boards PCBs connected with these flat
cables here we have like the port for
the bottom the charging port yep yes we
have a microphone there and so you see
that a lot these component has parts
that you can remove and replace that out
having to replace the whole phone now
we're gonna sort of call it a day on the
teardown here we could like that we
could keep going I could try and pry
this battery loose there's nothing
really to see behind the battery okay so
we're just we're not gonna worry about
that left on the frame of course is the
screen and like I said that's the most
expensive component if you were to crack
the screen you know how it gets replace
depends on the manufacturer some fun you
know some manufacturers replace it all
as one unit some manufacturers will sell
you just or aftermarket component
vendors will sell you just the screen
itself you try to remove the glass you
know but usually they're sold as sort of
the unit that you replaced the whole
thing that's gonna be the most expensive
part the battery is essentially adhesive
onto the back of that yeah there's this
case here right and there there may be
there's probably a fit there's a film
behind the screen okay there's some
protection behind it some shielding
behind the screen here and the battery
will actually be adhesive to those
little the plastic sort of mid frame
here this little frame so yeah so Kerry
yeah that's kind of it you're still some
components like we said connected to the
you know connected to the body and we're
going to leave those connected the body
not necessarily worry about taking them
apart because again we want to put it
back together we want to put it back
together in working order and not have
to worry about trashing all right thanks
Bill good stuff that is the galaxy s 9
if you've got other tech you'd like to
see us tear down new tech hole tech
anything in between leave us a note in
the comments we're always looking for
the next thing to tear down that's it
for cracking open thanks for watching
we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
