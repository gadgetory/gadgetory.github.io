Chromebooks I'm Bridget Carey this is
your C net update Google's Chrome
operating system for PCs may not be
around for much longer
Google is working on releasing laptops
that run on Android and that's according
to a report by The Wall Street Journal
which was also backed up by other news
outlets but Google says it is still
committed to Chrome reports indicate
that Google is working on merging the
two or maybe it's more like having
Android absorb Chrome this new merged
operating system could be out by 2017
and we may get a sneak peek next year
Chromebooks are an interesting breed
these are pcs that run on Google's
Chrome operating system which means only
Chrome apps work on these systems
research firm IDC estimates that
Chromebooks only make up 3% of PCs today
but Chromebooks are very popular in
schools there are hundreds of thousands
of these machines in classrooms today
with students using Google Docs for
education but maybe the concept of a
Chrome operating system hasn't caught on
yet to the mainstream consumer whereas
everyone knows what Android is there
have been signs that Google sees Android
as something that could be a desktop
experience in late September Google
unveiled the pixel C tablet it runs
Android marshmallow 6.0 and it has a
keyboard case it was pushed as a
Productivity powerhouse having Android
be the one system on all device this can
be a good thing for Google if you have
Android on your phone and your laptop
you're more likely to invest in Google's
world of movies music apps and other
services at which point there's less
incentive for you to jump away to Apple
and developers should be happy that an
Android app will just work automatically
on a laptop but don't let this news
confuse you about the chrome internet
browser that's a separate thing that's
not changing
in fact Microsoft just created a new
Chrome browser extension so you can
quickly create a new office document
from the chrome toolbar yeah
Microsoft who wants to push its edge
browser is plain ice with chrome
Microsoft also updated office online by
integrating Skype voice and video liddie
make a call right from inside a document
in Word Excel PowerPoint and OneNote and
in wireless news t-mobile may have some
huge news to share soon when it comes to
streaming netflix on your phone or
tablet t-mobile is expected to let
customers use unlimited data when
streaming some video services like
Netflix or HBO the carrier has a news
event scheduled for November 10th with
the teaser tagline we'd never hit pause
but reputable mobile news leaker evan
blas tweeted the spoiler thursday if
this is true it's very similar to
t-mobile's music freedom program where
customers can stream as much as they
want from dozens of services and it
doesn't count against their monthly data
limits that's it for this tech news
update and there's more at cnet.com from
our studios in new york I'm Bridget
