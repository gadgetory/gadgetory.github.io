that is set to open on December 18th
2015 I suspect this isn't news to any of
you most of you are probably wearing
your Boba Fett underoos as we speak I
mention it because amongst us
are millions who have never seen Star
Wars or worse have only seen the
prequels they're gonna be playing catch
up and they need your help so for their
sake and for the sake of everyone around
you who's gonna be dealing with your
purely speculative critique of the new
movie I've made this top 5 Donal Bell
and assuming George Lucas or Disney
don't sue the pants off of us and this
week's top 5 I'll be counting down the
best viewing orders for the current Star
Wars movie saga starting off at number 5
episode order makes sense right you
start off at Episode one and make your
way through the prequels before getting
to the original trilogy I recommend this
to no one
first off Episode one The Phantom Menace
is universally regarded as awful to
anyone over the age of 10 you're gonna
lose people if not with Jar Jar than
with a hundred other unnecessary
characters in that film but most
importantly going in episode order
spoils the biggest plot twists in the
whole series
certain family bloodlines are made
abundantly clear by the end of episode 3
which makes it really weird in episode 4
the original Star Wars that no one is
telling Luke some very critical
information about the guy he's trying to
kill or the girl he's trying to kiss you
so how about number 4 chronological
order you go in the order they were made
starting with the 1977 original and
looping back around to the prequels you
preserve the innocence of the original
the surprise of Yoda and the plot twist
that really anchors the whole entire
series this way works but with one big
flaw at the end of Return of the Jedi
when Luke looks as the Fallen mentors in
the midst of that furry rave George
Lucas slipped Hayden Christensen into
that lineup looking like some Jedi
hipster anyone who hasn't seen the
prequels at that point he isn't gonna
put together that the voice of James are
old Jones
how comes out of this twerp also it
means that your Star Wars marathon is
gonna end in the prequel episode three
which just doesn't feel right so how
about we try option number three
flashback order you start with the
original two episodes four and five
establish the characters people actually
care about and then cut back to the
prequels one two and three to see their
origin story and then end on six Return
of the Jedi this way there's no spoiling
the original or the twist of empire you
get the back story of Vader when you're
most curious about it
and you leave the most satisfying movie
ending for the last and this time you
know who the hell that skeevy ghost
teenager is but maybe there's a simpler
answer at number two the original
trilogy keep it short and clean who says
we even have to acknowledge that the
prequels exist Jar Jar can be a secret
we keep from our children like Disney's
Song of the South the new Star Wars
Episode seven is set to take place
thirty years after Return of the Jedi
that's true then everyone from the
prequels is probably dead the original
trilogy will be more than enough to get
people up to speed and then it's just on
YouTube explaining why that ghost at the
end looks like a hungover Starbucks
barista which brings us to number one
machete order conceived by rod Hilton
and named after his blog machete order
takes the flashback order and does
something magical it goes for five two
three six and it treats Episode one like
the forgettable unnecessary bastard that
it is all of the most flinch inducing
parts of the prequels are gone no Jar
Jar no podraces no Darth Vader and
diapers no trade disputes no
midi-chlorians it's actually astounding
how little episode one matters to the
rest of the story everything you need to
know about episode 1 is summed up in the
opening scroll of episode 2 in fact
booting out episode 1 makes episodes 2 &amp;amp;
3 better the Padme romance seems
age-appropriate and Anakin seems like a
jerk from the get-go it also makes the
return of the Jedi better because you
jump from Anakin's falling to the dark
side straight to Luke's parallel story
of temptation ending in Redemption this
time I know it sounds sacrilegious
mixing the trilogy's up but give it a
shot
so there you go five ways to watch Star
Wars ordered from worst to best
that's just my opinion to tell me why
I'm wrong or suggest an alternate order
of your own you can tweet me at Donald
or post a whole essay over at top-5
