mean seriously this was a standout 12
months I've got a lot on my list I
couldn't quite possibly fit them in one
little video so here's a little taste of
what the best of 2017 had to offer in
games horizon zero dawn blew me away
with its unique storyline and engrossing
world far off in the future where
robotic animals ruled the earth
the long-awaited 1930s cartoon inspired
platformer cuphead is a gorgeous game
that absolutely nailed its throwback
style better than anything I've ever
played
it's as challenging as it was impossible
to look away from and easily one of 27
teams best The Legend of Zelda breath of
the wild might just be the best Zelda
game ever made
not to mention perhaps the best launch
title Nintendo has ever offered as well
Fiona switch odds are you play this one
so you know free people of the
resistance Astrid to the top
wolfenstein to the new Colossus had a
lot to live up to considering its
predecessor successfully rebooted the
first-person shooter back in 2014
Wolff - redefined over-the-top with a
brutal telling of a dystopian alternate
past where the Nazis have taken over all
aspects of American life 2017 received
the best Resident Evil game in over a
decade Resident Evil 7 hit every note
that the classic survival horror
franchise is known for all while
impressively assuring the series into
the contemporary with a genuinely
horrific story and unforgettable
characters speaking of best ever super
mario odyssey is definitely a contender
for the best mario game ever this entry
absolutely knocked it out of the park
with Mario's ability to capture enemies
and objects not to mention the inclusion
of classic 8-bit gameplay around every
turn if you have a switch Zelda and
Mario are two must plays and the last
game I'll feature here is a short
narrative lead Riven game called what
remains of Edith Finch that quite
honestly left me an emotional wreck this
is one of the most special experiences
I've ever had in a game thanks to its
thoughtful storytelling and heartwarming
design this is a beautiful game and one
of my very favorites of 2017 now I know
what you're thinking how did 2017 do it
I don't know but it made my life a lot
better to see all the games that made my
final list and there are a lot head over
to Siena calm and then as you do
complain to me on Twitter I'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
