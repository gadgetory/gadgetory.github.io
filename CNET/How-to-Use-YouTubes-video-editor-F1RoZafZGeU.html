I'm going to show you how to use
YouTube's Video Editor to make a video
out of several clips well a little basic
when compared to software based video
editing tools YouTube's Video Editor
works right in your browser and does all
the hard work on Google servers meaning
you can edit HD video on just about any
computer as long as it as an internet
connection the first thing you're going
to want to do is head over to
youtube.com slash editor here you'll see
a list of all your uploaded YouTube
videos on the left hand side a story
board on the bottom and a preview of the
finished product on the right one thing
to note right up front is that you
cannot actually upload videos to the
editor itself your videos need to be on
YouTube first if you're just dumping a
few clips from your digital camera our
advice is to upload them as unlisted
this sends them to YouTube but they
won't show up two people have subscribed
to your YouTube channel or in the
services search engine in case you don't
recognize one of your uploaded videos
you can play it just by hitting the
little arrow that shows up when you
mouse over the clip this opens up in a
pop-up window
when you found something you like you
can simply grab it and drop it down to
the storyboard or hit the little plus
icon in the top right hand corner of
each clip once the videos are on the
storyboard you can rearrange them freely
the storyboard is also where you do all
the editing to start an edit just mouse
over any clip in your storyboard and
click the scissors icon this will open
up a video in a pop-up window
where you can drag and change at the
beginning and end point to get a finer
level of control over these in and out
points you can click the small arrows on
the top and bottom of the clips timeline
YouTube is calling these nudges since
they can only change the length of the
clip one way or the other by a fifteenth
of a second to see your changes after
making a nudge or two just hit the play
button it's worth noting YouTube
currently does not let you split a clip
so if you want to use a different part
of the same clip or just repeat
something again you drag the video into
the timeline multiple times and trim it
down to just the parts you want if you
want to add some audio to your projects
you can just pick a track from YouTube's
audio swap library in the audio tab on
the top left just like videos you can
preview these before adding them to your
work
then drag them down into the storyboard
keep in mind that adding an audio track
to your movie will wipe out all the
sound that was there before and after
you've done this there's no way to go
back without starting a new project when
you've got your clips in the right place
and added the music you want you just
give it one last look by hitting the
play button in the preview module on the
right if everything looks good you just
give it a name hit the publish button
and YouTube does the rest once the
server is finished processing your new
movie it will show up in your my videos
list for everyone to enjoy
I'm Josh Lowen soon and this has been a
how-to on using YouTube's Video Editor
happy editing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
