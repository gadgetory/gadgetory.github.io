these ones sound a little bit different
they're called the IQ buds and they're
noise cancelling earbuds you can control
them with an app to adjust the sound of
the world around you so that you can
adjust frequency have an equalizer and a
volume control for example you can boost
the speech in a loud environment so you
can hear better of course you can also
use them as wireless Bluetooth earbuds
for playing music and you can have a
blended audio effect kind of a little
bit like augmented reality for your ears
so you hear music and the sound of the
world around you they come with a
charging case that gives you three
charges every time you put them inside
and you get around four to ten hours of
use every time you put them in your ears
of course there's varies depending on
what you're listening to and how loud
you have the volume the controls on the
earbud are all touch so you can tap to
change tracks or you can tap to take
calls and switch between presets on the
right ear bud we've seen similar
wireless earbuds with noise cancelling
and volume adjustment features before
such as the here active listening in
here one buds I did try the IQ buds in a
pretty loud environment at CES and they
do sound good music sounds nice through
them it did cut out some of the
background noise but the real test will
be when you use them on a plane in a
restaurant and in other such
environments they cost two hundred and
ninety nine dollars and they're
available now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
