television this is actually not a
television it's a projector
this is Sony's VP lvz 1000 is ultra
short throw 4k HD our home theater
projector that mouthful cost you twenty
five thousand dollars but as you can see
here you get a gigantic picture out of
it 100 inch televisions from Sony for
example cost about twice that so again
if you want this really gigantic picture
and you don't want to have a dedicated
dark home theater room which is what a
standard projector and screen system
requires this is probably as close as
you're going to get if you can see the
light comes from the projector up onto
the screen from the bottom so the idea
is that it pretty much disappears into
the room you're never going to walk in
front of the projection to put a shadow
on the screen or something like that one
thing is different from this projector
and a regular TV is that you need to
supply your own screen the one here is a
motorized version that can come back up
and down and have a really cool effect
you want to disappear completely specs
on this projector great you get HDR
capability 2500 nits which is very very
bright for projector and uses the laser
light engine so you get twenty thousand
hours out of this never need to change a
bulb of course extremely expensive for a
very high-end audience but if you have
the money you want a hundred inch screen
that's bright enough to watch and pretty
much any lighting environment it's a
pretty good deal of course the market
for this projector is really niche at
this price but if you want it and can
afford it it's a pretty amazing piece of
equipment let's look at Sony's VP lvz
1000 s short-throw ultra HD projector</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
