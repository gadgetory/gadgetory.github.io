vicios PC launch event in new york city
now Vizio has entered the PC business
where they haven't been before
announcing all-in-one desktops as well
as ultrabooks 14 and 15 inch models and
they're going after the premium market
while announcing a starting price of 898
for all the models now the 14 inches
have a kind of a macbook air type look
unibody aluminum design and they have a
special keyboard that they say took some
months to design on the all in one side
the design is almost no more of a
throwback in terms of a stand-up monitor
with a little bit of a connector to a
base which is where the computers a
Vizio claims that's going to be a lot
better for running cables behind without
them dangling now the packings also
include a remote control and a trackpad
not a mouse and there's also HDMI in as
well as out for connecting peripherals
like blu-ray players or even game
consoles and Vizio is definitely pushing
that TV connection claiming a much
better screen quality definitely looking
at the tilt at the models here on the
floor they do have a really nice viewing
angle a more premium feel than on some
other laptops at least that I've seen
the 14 and 15 inch ultrabooks are going
to come a third gen intel Ivy Bridge
processors they're also going to have
solid state hard drives and a lot of the
same features that you've seen in
ultrabooks but starting at 898 they're
claiming to undercut some of the price
on the premium competition like the
macbook air and like HP's envy spectre
xt that could be the competition we're
seeing here the keyboard does feel
really good so does the trackpad and the
screen looks as good as advertised and
that aluminum unibody construction
definitely has a premium feel and a very
solid feel when you pick it up Vizio
certainly entered with a bang trying to
go straight to the top in the premium
market I'm Scott Steiner to look at
vicios new ultrabooks laptops and all
the computers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
