offer Siri Alexa and Google assistant
voice control this is great from a
convenience standpoint but what about
security is it really safe to control a
lock with your voice the answer really
varies by platform folks using Siri to
control their door will need an iOS
device with the August lock and apple
homekit configured they can then lock
and unlock their door either within
Bluetooth range or remotely with a
fourth gen Apple TV no pin or passcode
required that may seem like a potential
security problem but again a burglar
would have to steal or otherwise have
access to someone's phone to control the
door on demand Alexa offers a custom and
a native voice control skill the native
skill phrases are more streamlined since
you just have to say Alexa lock the door
rather than Alexa ask August to lock the
door but you can only unlock your door
with the custom skill command since
someone could realistically shout at
Alexa from outside to unlock the door
you need to create a secret code as long
as you're careful who you say it around
and that it isn't something obvious like
1 2 3 4 you should be fine from a
security standpoint Google home
customers can't unlock doors via voice
control but they can ask the Google
assistant to lock the door
and for the status of the lock auguste
says an unlock voice command is coming
later this year while voice control and
lock security is important to consider
I'd personally be comfortable using any
of these August integrations in my home
and if you aren't yet sold in a platform
you certainly have options with August
Siri what's the status of the office
door
your office door is locked
great Alexa asked August to unlock the
office door okay can I have your pin
code sure it's fun I asked dog is to
unlock office door and to update the
status would you like me to check the
state of the law no thanks
good boss okay Google lock the door sure
do that you might like August want to
give it a try
yes sure here's August I'm working on
your request to lock off this door would
you let me to check the state of the law
now okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
