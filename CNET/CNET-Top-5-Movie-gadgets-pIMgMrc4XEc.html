time we meet we count down another hot
cnet list I'm Tom Merritt movies have
very few of the restrictions real life
has so it's no wonder that some of the
very best gadgets ever exist only in the
movies I asked around on Twitter and
Facebook and elsewhere to find out just
what movie gadgets are your favorites
let's count them down at number 5 the
hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy first
of all it has the invaluable advice
don't panic print it on the cover
secondly it can answer any question
about anything in the universe wanna
know everything there is to know about
Earth mostly harmless coming in at
number 4 the neuralyzer from men in
black the best way to forget your
troubles is to have them wiped from your
memory by looking into the friendly red
light of the neuralyzer what was I say
up to number three the tricorder now you
can go on forever about Star Trek with
its transporters and universal
translators and such but it seems the
tricorder captures the minds of cnet
fans a tad bit more and it's one of the
few Star Trek gadgets that's actually
been built and sold sliding in at number
two James Bond's watch whether it's the
gharat watch in From Russia With Love
the Geiger counter from Thunderball or
the many communication watches bond
always has a useful and stylish gadget
on his wrist before we get to number one
time for another Lane pries be one of
the first ten people to answer the
question correctly in the comments for
this episode of blog sina TV calm and
you could win a replica Naboo pistol
here's the question what was the name of
the company that made the TR 107
tricorder mark one known as the first
real tricorder alright let's get to our
number one the top movie gadget number
one it's the laser gun and see you
didn't have a chance to win one now I
always think of the Star Wars laser gun
but it could also mean the phaser from
Star Trek or even the ray gun from fifty
serials like Buck Rogers but you have to
admit
a laser gun is what every kid holds in
their hand when they're fighting off
space aliens well that's it for this
edition of seen at top five don't forget
to answer the trivia question for a
chance to win your very own laser gun
I'm Tom Merritt see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
