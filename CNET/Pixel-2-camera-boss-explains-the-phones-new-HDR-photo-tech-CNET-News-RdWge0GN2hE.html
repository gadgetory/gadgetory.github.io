engineering director at Google for the
Android camera team
okay so first on the fundamentals so
image quality video quality speed
shutter latency time to open we double
down on all those right so everywhere
better than last year you know better
photos better videos on top of that we
added some new features so we added OS
for even crisper photos and more stable
videos ok the portrait mode we added
motion photos face retouching I think
the experience is really evolved so the
technique we use is we capture a burst
of photos and then we combine them
together in software it does make a
really high dynamic range high quality
final photograph so with OS now every
single frame in that burst is sharper
and cleaner so the final result is even
sharper and cleaner than been before and
in video mode in video mode so a problem
that if you don't have OES is that if
there's motion blur within a frame you
got a little bit of a wobbling so jiggly
look to the video but by running optical
stabilization within video recording -
it's even smoother we get rid of that at
motion shake and it's now like a more
stable feel
we're capturing much darker versions of
the scene where the highlights are not
blurred out this guy is still blue and
then we do some very sophisticated noise
reduction by combining frames together
and then apply tone mapping to get to
the final rendition so you're able to
preserve the highlights and the blue
skies and also in the dark areas we see
detail in the shadows so they're
actually two techniques the first
technique is machine learning so by
training a model on the million images
like a lot of images we're able to
understand the foreground background
segmentation and you know on both the
front and rear camera you know do you
know a really nice background blur
additionally for the rear camera we have
a special sense of Penelope referred to
as dual pixel where every single pixel
has both a left and a right off and
conceptually Alesi you have two slightly
different viewpoints of the scene as if
you like move your head a little bit
left and right and that is enough to
give you actually a depth map of the
scene and combining that with the
machine learning model we can get an
even more accurate portrait photo as
well as photos of things that part
people
there are a lot of dual cameras on the
market you know they may not all be that
great dual camera is a you know it
brings a lot of trade-offs with it you
know
for example takes more space and maybe
the battery smaller you know often the
second camera is really not very good in
low light and for us the light is super
important because smaller pixels in a
shallower sorry a narrower aperture but
in the end I think that the you know
image quality that the get quality the
capabilities wanted to bring to the
table were really like I said a single
camera experience and I believe that we
we met that goal you know best photos in
the world best food is in the world
fastest captured saying Foss is open
time it's hard to complain about that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
