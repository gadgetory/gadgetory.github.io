we're going to take a look at the Yamaha
rxv 475 this is a 5.1 AV receiver in the
middle of Yamaha is line and it's
currently selling for $400
like most multi-channel AV receivers the
Yamaha has a big metal chassis that will
take up a lot of space in your TV
cabinet the two-tone finish on the front
has a sleek look especially the matte
black on the bottom although the front
is cluttered with buttons that you'll
likely never use it's kind of tough to
say that any of these big boxy receivers
look nice so if you're looking for a
more attractive option check out my
rancis slimline and our 1403 that's
available for the same price the
included remote is needlessly
complicated even for an AV receiver
there are all kinds of confusing design
choices including two power buttons at
the top a grid of small numbered buttons
for selecting inputs and mysterious star
buttons on the side that don't have any
obvious function unless you have a lot
of patience you'll be better off
replacing it with a quality universal
remote for $400 receiver the rxv 475
offers a decent set of features although
most competing models offer a little
more there are five total HDMI inputs
which should cover most home theaters
although Akio pioneer and Marantz offers
six at this price the Yamaha does have
an Ethernet jack on the back but it
doesn't have Wi-Fi so you'll need to
connect via ethernet to use its
networking features which include
built-in airplay Pandora internet radio
and DLNA compatibility that's not quite
as many services as other receivers
offer but if you're a heavy streamer
you'll likely want a dedicated device
anyway Yamaha does offer Wi-Fi and
Bluetooth add-ons for the rxv 475
although they're pretty expensive so
you're better off using third-party
accessories anyway unlike Denon Yamaha
doesn't offer guided setup right out of
the box
although plugging in the set up
microphone does bring up some on-screen
instructions for its automatic speaker
calibration the rxv 475 has a very basic
text-based menu system which looks about
ten years out of date
although that's surprisingly common on
Seavers at this price once we got the
speaker's calibrated the sound quality
on the Yamaha was excellent
we had resident audiophile Steve
Guttenberg give a listen to the Yamaha
and he compared it to the pioneer vsx
823 - K and then on AVR e 400 and the
Yamaha came out on top with the powerful
sound that easily filled our listening
room movies and music were handled
equally well with plenty of detail and
overall a balanced natural sound and
that sound quality is ultimately the
strongest reason to buy the RX v 475
over its competitors it doesn't have the
most features and its design is a little
underwhelming but it did edge out its
competitors in our listening tests
ultimately it wouldn't be my first
choice at this price level as I find the
sound quality differences to be pretty
minor between these mid-range AV
receivers but this is still a good value
especially if you're a fan of Yamaha
sound I'm Matthew Muscovy ak from C net
and this is the Yamaha RX v 475</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
