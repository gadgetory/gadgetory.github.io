studios in first floor of San Francisco
California it's the up at bite extra
country podcast and I cannot talk with
your host mr. Bryant ah oh man good
afternoon everybody hey we have a
special apple byte extra crunchy extra
money this is episode 55 in the house a
special guest pretty much the man at
seen it that has touched fondled
frolicked and put in his ear every Apple
product known to man mr. Scott Stein
calling us from the NYC what's up Scott
hey how you doing oh man are you tired
of talking about this stuff I mean come
on let's be real yes I need a break I
actually had dinner with my family last
night it was a wonderful ow this is
amazing but uh we appreciate your time
here and we'll just kind of jump into it
you've been able to play with all of
these Apple devices um we've had our own
impressions but let's just our top with
the iphone if you had to kind of give it
you know whatever your three key points
or what makes it special or why would
someone do it what would you say about
those the iphone 7 and then the seven
plus so i would say the number one thing
will be water resistance i'd say the
number two thing would be a bit more
battery i'd say the third thing well the
number one thing would be the camera for
the seven plus obviously for the seven
plus camera for both and i would say it
would be water resistance then it would
be a bit more battery did you were you
you know at some people complain about
how it didn't look that much different
weren't we didn't expect that on the
star so to me it doesn't bother me that
much because that's kind of what we've
expected it's more of these kind of
incremental things that have made this a
better phone if you're already in the
ecosystem yeah exactly and i think you
know because it's all integrated because
they launched the OS and the hardware at
the same time and that's something that
you know you see it another phones it
doesn't show up and that can it can be
frustrating it's designed all you'll be
there for you at that one moment and you
can tell that it fits together but um
you know i'd say this time it's not a
necessary upgrade we always say that but
i think particularly Mary but it's a lot
faster but the thing is I I say that as
a caveat because I think we've already
got really fast bones yep i 100% of
there with you if we didn't have to
review these thing
if I didn't host this show called the
Apple biter extra crunchy I would not
upgrade this phone I just wouldn't and
I'm on a success I'd be happy with my
success but the biggest reason success
Yeah right and I but the biggest reason
we're if anyone's gonna even really
upgrade to either of these things it
comes down to the camera specifically
the seven plus right yeah but you know
the thing is 7 plus camera I say dot dot
dot because the coolest thing you can do
with that camera which is that depth of
field boca DSLR like effect that's not
available yet on this that's going to be
launching later this year so we haven't
even gotten a chance to review and play
with that now hopefully it's good we
obviously don't know we've tried it but
also will there be other updates to the
camera we don't know maybe you want to
wait a year wait for that to be more
polished and that's why I feel the most
comfortable about waiting on the next
generation phone is because we have this
dual lens camera it is you know arguably
the best camera on the market but it's
still not fully fleshed-out bouquet
effects there it only works with
portraits from what we know it's may not
be it can be affected with other things
but not to that true shallow depth of
field that we've seen with those
portrait pictures so to me it's getting
there but once it starts supporting
other things like food flowers and
animate objects on top of portraits then
you're talking to me about a phone that
I'm really interested in purely because
of its camera yeah I think they're gonna
do that I also expect that at some point
you visible talk about augmented reality
or other things you could do with dual
cameras I'm sure that dual cameras will
be used for a lot of interesting things
next year and it's kind of like touch ID
it's worth it's for one thing and then
you start seeing it for more things
right now it's just like the very early
days of the idea of a dual lens camera
yeah so you know we kind of got the
overview everyone it kind of knows what
to expect from the iphone 7 and 7 plus
let's talk about the Apple watch is this
really the series to the watch that
should have come out on the first
generation well there's two things one
is the software and that's something you
can download on any Apple watch and I
really feel like I've been trying it now
on an existing first gen apple watch I
think you should do that if you have it
you don't certainly don't need to
upgrade but then yeah like we talked
about like sports or sport fitness and
there was the originally the apple watch
sport but it wasn't really a sport while
it was just a cheap watch or the cheaper
watch it was still expensive this one
the new Apple watch series 2 is a sport
watch it's a it's swim proof and it has
swim tracking at GPS which is meant for
sports writer display so it's really a
sports edition do it do does it make you
feel compelled to upgrade because for me
I have a genuine watch the GPS is nice
but I'm personally not that super active
hardcore hikers so just watch os3 alone
makes me feel like I got a brand new
watch it performs you know I know it's a
little faster but the performance on a
gen 1 watchos 3 watch still feels good
to me yeah I think it's going to be fine
for most people and I just liked I
really like the water resistance but
that's to me it's like the Watchers in
the shower I think it's just a matter of
when we check in now and look at Apple
watch it's at a point now where I think
you don't need a SmartWatch but it does
a better job minus battery life of being
a SmartWatch than anything else outfit
yeah and then finally Scott we all know
the air pods man i'm sure you've talked
about ad nauseam of how they look I
think you know before we we even got our
hands and you got your hands review I
just said look the tech on there is
amazing but I don't know about the looks
what has been your overall take the
whole thing so so funny the first I
became a mean and then he worked on me
anywhere they felt like here you you you
you were part of that man is amazing so
that was a thank-you world for that they
do look they do look silly but here's
the crazy thing Apple's saying you'll
use these set of your regular wired
earphones I have been I realize now over
a week these are my go-to over the wire
included your pods I find that they're
pretty easy to use and I think battery
life is good enough you can quick charge
them and I never have to worry about so
that's a nice the problem i don't like
is that the way that bluetooth and these
things work it's not the same as it
align in so if I'm doing a skype like
right now I can't use it for all things
or the sound sounds a little different
um it doesn't work with video recording
so i couldn't do like a first tape with
one eye we're digitized and
also uh sound still hiccups these are
pre production units so you know we they
may change but I still get occasional
Bluetooth hiccups not as many as normal
but um that's frustrated you know you
even came across a problem where we were
setting this up and Scott looked down
and he's like crap i have a lightning
connection on the actual earpods i have
but i don't have the adapter and now i
gotta go find either new headphone set
or new adapters that i can even do the
skype call and that's one of those
things that is going to happen purely
because Apple is pushing us forward
there's this transitional stage where
we're not even anywhere close to being
in an all lightning digital audio world
by any means no anything even you know
USB see either of those were not there
so you know the fact that that happened
kind of shows how it's not there yet but
they want to push you there and I think
about what we think about these things
are like Pro Tools the headphone jack is
a useful tool used by everyone and I
don't know when you remove that and you
just go to lightning I'm not sure how
that all shakes out you know I think a
lot of people who rely on their phones
for a lot of work related things audio
and other things it might get really
frustrated or maybe it's fine but yeah I
feel like all of a sudden the thing as
simple as oh I don't have the right
headphones or I forgot the dongle here's
one we did a battery test this behind
the scenes they did a battery test of
the iphone and we were connecting it to
do to do audio pass through for one of
the tests and I realized that hadn't
left anyone with a dongle so we almost
weren't able to run the test so you
couldn't even have the audio pass
through it's just like you're gonna
always have little things like that for
at least the next year then sure maybe
we get over it but for now especially
since doesn't have us bc you're ending
up in this forked paths that um that's
gonna be annoying I think ultimately I'm
going to keep my dongle on my lightning
headphones and just tape it up and make
sure it just treats itself as one living
cable and I was gonna walk around with
it that's a good idea I think you need
to do something like that and don't lose
those headphones because then like I
feel like I'll leave those headphones at
home well you like yeah carry four of
them in every pocket you know it's funny
you say don't lose those
don't lose those headphones because last
week on this show Beecham and I were
joking about look someone's gonna make a
piece of rubber that connects the two
air pods and creates this air strap on
them and you know what happened like two
days later yeah all these things are
like hey look the new air strap the blah
blah blah like the headphone connector
and I'm like I could roll with that I
think I could roll with that one thing I
really think okay there you go and I
haven't worried about losing them yeah
although we did have one thing we're
like our photographer Sarah took photos
with these and afterwards and she
brought the flashing to close and the
magnet on the flash like sucked up one
of you and I didn't realize it and I was
like where'd the air pods go and it was
like glued to her flap like like a magic
trick well Tim Cook has continuously
said these like he forces the word
magical into every conversation with the
air pods it's a little embarrassing well
you what I know it's too much of that
one thing i like is that and i don't
think people have said this quite as
much you can just pop one in and make a
regular phone call with just any one of
the air pods just a single one just like
a bluetooth headset back in the day yeah
and actually I really like that because
I feel like whenever I'm on a regular
headsets I never know where the mic is
or I have to lift it cuz it doesn't
sound that great it's not a way better
right there ok you telling this is
connected is not gonna do you um I don't
know how to connect it to a Mac you
can't do it yet the UM that's the other
problem well lets you have bluetooth I
don't know if we connect in my connect
it should connect this is like the thing
it's like this big nested you know will
it work if i do this but the fact that
you can make phone calls and people can
hear you're reasonably well so they
could work for that that makes these
pretty useful yeah overall take of just
all the products did did one really
stand out to you personally for whatever
reason um I think the air pods are an
interesting concept if you're an Apple
watch out but that's a lot of stuff to
buying into because you can take phone
calls now and it passes through knowing
links products are pretty standard
updating I think the most needed upgrade
that improved a product may have been
Apple watch
but mostly through software and now I
feel like it is something that that I
feel like is in in a flawed territory is
at the top the iphone is another upgrade
you know it's it's very solid but I
worry with that headphone jack whether
it's the best upgrade for everyone yeah
the ole you know what Scott thanks so
much for your insight I you know thromb
better it's definitely a lot better you
know it's always it's always a leather
yeah you know it always it gets Scott it
gets better exactly it gets burped and
one thing next year we're wondering
about big improvements to the next
iPhone next year could be a very big I
think next year's gonna be a beast of a
year yeah I don't see how it how can it
not be when you have a phone that pretty
much looks around the same for three
years in a row it's gonna be a beast one
else'll this whole year for Apple has
been a very small year for upgrades yeah
and I feel like next year you're going
to see big shoes drop big shoes drop is
that even I think I think you're gonna
see like a lot of these products that
you may have been expecting like what
about like an an iPad that's more like a
laptop I feel like it needs to complete
the journey well look I've been waiting
for them to show me something like that
because i love that i have yeah prefer
for a while for a while but we'll we'll
give them a little more time we'll see
what happens i'm scott thanks so much
for calling in we appreciate your time

that was I'd okay yeah that was so we
were okay we were let's quick story this
is not inside baseball Scott and I after
all the commotion of the apple event
ended up finally seeing each other
probably at the end of the day I was one
of the few people left in the office
maybe three of us and we're like hey
what's up we start talking we're
catching up and then one of our
co-workers to be unnamed I guess was on
a on a phone call you're gonna prove a
phone call or press in her life she was
on a live radio a live radio hit in an
office that freakin holds 200 people go
to a private room so instead Scott Eyre
marilyn scott scott and i are merrily
talking and then she comes she's like
pissed at scott she's like well you were
done it at it and I'm like yo yeah

thought and I saw Scott just taking this
punishment on his face like he was just
like you just take a head 500 miles
across the country you you were taking
it like and I saw your face just like
all right I'm gonna and she was giving
it to you and inside I was laughing hell

world this is a bit deep openoffice
syndrome Scott you're good you're you're

would have told her like go to a private
room and do your interview there don't
talk to me like that I'm a visitor you
know I'm in a stranger in a strange land
I gotta I gotta go with the flow I did
come into and I was like hey how's a guy

the office you me and that person i

Steven I devices evolving your home very
nice beautiful alright let's catch you
up with what's happening we wanted to
take care of Scott off the top because
that's one of things everyone's talking
about but this is where things stand
here and now they might change the day
so that's why people that subscribe this
audio podcast you gotta listen quick and
early the iphone 7 lines have already
started ahead of friday's lunch wow that
they are there but this is what's sad to
me there's kind of a bit of conflicting
stories Apple came out outright and said
look the initial quantities of the
iphone 7 plus every single model the
iphone 7 plus are entirely sold out in
addition to that all models of the jet
black iphone 7 are also sold out and if
you wait in line and hope that you can
get one of those models because you
might have missed the pre-order maybe we
were at work you know the online system
that also had its own issues you will
not be able to get them so i was before
the show I was actually down in San
Francisco at union square in line wait
to check out to see what was going on
and there were people that were hoping
to get a seven plus or a jet-black seven
that really bums me out and it they have
been waiting since last night so since
Thursday night and they're going to wait
or sorry Wednesday night they're gonna
wait till thursday night and do it I
mean that's a these are loyal fans that
are waiting for this is this like the
apple store just wanting to get press or
something or they or did they not know
did the people that work there not get
this information so that's the thing
there's that there's a Miss
communication here Apple officially is
telling all these news outlets yeah we
don't have any but then on the ground
the retail managers and associates there
these guys talk to four different people
and the Miguel
and Justin shout out to you guys and out
there i hope you doin okay but they
asked them and everyone says you know
what we don't the classic line and this
is true with carriers uh we've been told
this we don't know what we're going to
get until we get it but to me if you
know I know Apple is saying it from the
top that there's no seven plus or jet
black sevens don't make fans that
actually give a crap about you wait in
line for two nights just tell just break
the news to them yeah that's a bummer I
think I think it's it's a horrible we
went to even ask we directly went to ask
the retail associates on behalf of them
the retail associate still wouldn't give
us a clear line the guys in line like
you know what we're just gonna wait in
line if if we can't get it then I guess
we'll get a matte black but I'm like but
you been waiting here for two days dog I
know like a big waste of time to dig
waste of time and money someone listings
like why didn't you do the pre-order son
who does that quite honestly I don't
care how people pre-order or try and get
these phones if you're a multi-billion
dollar company just communicate that
effectively the people waiting outside
in line that's all I ask yes these guys
these poor guys even even on top of that
in New York so New York has given the
first ten people in line that have been
waiting some of them in waiting for more
than a few days right over a week or so
even more than that just to plot their
spot because they don't know what's
happening with inventory levels some
people 10 people have been given one
hundred dollar gift cards from Apple the
first ten just because they waited in
line and they're not going to get a
seven plus or a jet black is that worth
your time no it'll buy a third of the
air pods or 230 dirt but I you know I
just can't these kid these guys were
like pumped about Apple they wanted to
be in the store and you're just gonna
let someone down like that and you know
that I'm I said it for the video you
guys are producing about that we got we
we have we have something special for
you in the actual apple byte we're doing
the show a day earlier because a I'll be
gone tomorrow but we got some special
special little some some cooked up for
you so up we'll find out how that whole
situation plays out but according to
Apple directly you
not get any any iphone 7 pluses or a
jet-black 7 but if you are someone who
is going to wait in line so if you hear
this you tell your friends tell your
children tell your kids tell your wife
don't go away don't know and I googled
hide them from the apple store that's
hide your kids from the apple store um
we know that iOS 10 came out and there
were some bumps in the road there was
the first hour so it was freezing or
breaking people's phones telling them to
restore the phone then people had to
like plug it into itunes and potentially
if they didn't back up pretty much lose
all their information not be able to
update their phone uh if you did not
back up that was resolved about an hour
to later but the saga of the drama from
every iOS rollout day still continues
t-mobile is now warning owners of an
iphone 6 6 + + 5 SE these three
customers they're telling you do not
download iOS 10 they're getting reports
of connectivity issues I had a few
people earlier tweet me like uh is there
something wrong with the cell signal
because I just updated my phone and I'm
on t-mobile and at the time no one
really knew what was happening but
indeed it looks like to be some
compatibility with the carrier and apple
and them are both working on a fix but
at the moment they're telling you do not
do not do this yeah i saw you know i got
the update like we were in a meeting and
everyone's like iOS tens available now
and i was like looking at it and then I
start seeing stories like people's
phones are breaking so I have not done
it yet so I'm not experienced iOS 10
well emp'd everyone wants to jump on it
I get it but I put it on a an extra
phone first like a kind of like a dummy
phone before actually bat alone yeah
just like dude would Batman put iOS 10
on his phone on day one probably he
probably he would get it he would get it
beforehand and then tweak it and modify
it so that it would work to his life his
Butler like make work out the bugs alpha
alpha B right yeah Jeremy Irons the new
but the new Alfred me like checking it
over masta that's Dewayne I don't think
it's a good idea
it's not a good idea so just be careful
about what's going on over there just
just take your time with this iOS app so
what what advice would you give to
someone like should we wait for Apple to
make a patch or are they can announce
like we made an update to the update or
how's that gonna say yeah they've done
that the bay to the updates they did
like a for update update last year was
an update to the update apple says that
it's good to go but t-mobile and Apple
specifically are saying hold off okay so
I from what I have seen for the most
part it is the update is actually
working pretty nicely for people but you
know if you're if you're a t-mobile
person now that we know the facts right
now just don't do it um in general i
like to wait a day or two before you do
the actual upgrade and i think it serves
everyone um better just just to wait it
out like what what are you on right now
i'm on the success but you're on the
success success yet why did I think
you're on a five because I had a fight
for a long time and then I was forced to
upgrade to the success when you know
there was you won't be able to you have
to go to the plan oh yeah you had a
changeover yeah so like literally within
three hours of midnight I got the
success over the phone with apple okay
so that I won't have to go through that
see yes I didn't I don't know if we
talked to we talked about we did yeah it
was alone it was like in February giant
january or some because I was worried
with you I was like um tell me think you
have an iphone 5 don't update don't
update to iOS handle by the way now like
if you're on to me if you're on a 5 or
5s don't update iOS 10 at all the
operating system is not really made to
be very compatible it'll just be a more
frustrating experience that's like such
a bummer to hear that mess know it's
messed it's messed up though Apple has
done this for years and they've kind of
it's kind of been swept under the rug
there was a class action lawsuit that um
by by a group of people who are just
saying like look apple just basically
saying oh if you have a phone within two
years you're okay but if you're not
you're pretty much screwed but they're
still gonna force you or at times Apple
has kind of jokingly recommended you hey
it's time to get a new iphone wow you
know is this is this latest issue
specific to the plus or the iphone 7 and
the iphone 7 plus or is it on both
phones the t-mobile issue just the the
most recent bricking your phone it was
it was basically every
every phone okay at that I was there's
just the seven plus yeah it had it most
likely had to do with some sort of
authorization on the server level to be
like okay green light you're you know
you are good to actually download this
update and then it gets kind of hung in
the middle and then you have to restore
your phone I've seen that happen to me
when I've been trying to put like you
know and that's why they say connect to
itunes you have to do the resort they're
saying like okay a cup on your computer
yeah they're basically saying the
computer and your phone are talking each
other so it's going to start shop from
scratch but so make sure you reboot that
just talking about iOS things I love
things I don't love I think that look
over all iOS is a great improvement and
I'm not here to talk poorly about iOS 10
but change can be hard Oh an ins in all
cases when we talk about change I have a
list of pet peeves here like I'm not
gonna call these bad apples these are
more pet peeves because well apples not
doing it deliberately but um you know I
I need to express these to you because
I'm sure they're like annoyances right
people yeah people that are listening
I'm sure are feeling our pain okay this
is not affecting everyone because I try
to find out what's going on people but
it is affecting i would say maybe like
half people my number one pet peeve is
my battery life I don't know what I'm
doing with my phone differently because
I'm not but when I'm two hours into the
day and thirty percent of my battery's
gone and I've just been texting and
looking at Twitter occasionally not the
whole time like that that doesn't that's
not right my phone never went down that
low and when my phones like basically at
ten percent at like 2pm all right
something's yeah that there's a problem
what I mean is different for every iOS
upgrade that I've had to do there's some
change in my phone that I have to go you
know some setting have to go change so
I'm sure like someone here at in our
office will figure it out make a how to
video how to extend the battery life on
here I so I'm sure that's gonna
come out and there will be i mean i'll
i'll do it for you it's called turn off
everything that makes iOS 10 iOS 10 yeah
it's right off everything that's turn
off raised awake tracking you and all
that stuff to all the notifications they
look nice and they're pretty but i think
look the way that they display them and
it's like all baba wawa I got imagine
that's actually taking up more resources
than it had
beginning problem Ross just goes from a
low-level standpoint you know yeah I
have bluetooth on everything like that
but it's it's a it's a power hug some
guys like dude mine only went down two
percent I'm like did you plug it in
again during the days like oh yeah I did
I get are you kidding me are you effing
kidding me dude seriously know that a
bad apple that a bad apple a' another
another thing the changing of the home
button this is like riled people are not
experienced oh my gosh so basically iOS
10 changes it where it asks you to
physically push down on the home button
to unlock your screen but for years we
have been trained to swipe to unlock or
just rest your finger on the home screen
and it unlocks right asking us to
physically push it like our brains
aren't working that way like it's really
been trained to do it another this is
this is the world's greatest first world
problem it's at the damn home button
okay and so there's a way I I couldn't
stand I couldn't take it and so there's
a way I put it on my Twitter and it blew
up a little bit i saw that right it
hella blew up it was like it was cool it
was a cool workaround but it was still
like three different steps you had today
it's always raised away it's call a
setting homie so basically you like on
your settings general accessibility find
the home button and then after that
there's a rest to touch or something
like this raised to wake no no there's
raised awake that's a different thing
there's so many things rest to touch
where basically you can write or rest to
unlock we're basically you touch your
finger on the home button instead of
actually pressing it and then it'll lock
your phone because that's what we've
been doing for years okay I have it you
want me to play this video from you know
that's it's so fast yeah people can hear
how know if they can hear I can make it
turn it up okay i'll see we've got yer
okay here's how to change the settings
if you hate pressing down that hole
button let's jump into it go on your
settings fine general fine accessibility
scroll skool skool find that home button
home button home button home home right
there and then look right here rest
finger to open turn that bad boy on I'm
going to come out here got my phone I'm
gonna put his sleep let's do the Rays to
wake raised a week and then
depressed and stressed my finger on it
boom shakalaka that that that's that too
bad yeah that's how you solve first
world problems I'm changing lives I'm
changin live via Twitter video via
Twitter video so that that bug meet the
crap on me but everyone's like thank you
i can't i can't do i can't deal with
this thank you like met grown men were
saying i love you like ice and I would
just because I enjoy that it is always
the fact that someone loves you because
you showed them a tip on their phone
I'll just write back to like I love you
too man i straight-up watch that because
I didn't want to know that right now
from when i get mine some guys like my
wife loves you and i'm like i love your
wife her I mean and he thought like you
know I just like to mess with people so
that's another thing that I don't like
notifications you get a boatload
notifications but they don't group them
together so really yeah so like you know
if you had five email notifications yeah
just a bunch them together yeah now it's
like every time you get an email it's a
different that goes into a fetal into
its own little bubble mmm every action
is our own bubble that's a problem
that's and they dated that's stupid
that's still I don't like that um the
keyboard and the lock sounds they've
changed them like let me see if I can
even capture this it's so it's a little
obnoxious it's like did you like bro did
you really have to change that bra like
for real so let me see if I can get into
something here it's like this and then
like changes sound and it like um it
it's like trying to be creative but it's
no it's not trying to be like bb-8 or
sun during a listless stripes and see if
i can get see might get this for you I
don't hear I can't hear okay it's okay
don't worry no one can hear it forget it
that failed and off yeah what is bro um
but everyone that knows how annoying
that that think the little tap x like
and then it's I used to like it how is
more like kind of now it's like it's
like boot it's like bubble pops it's
like the type you see we can flying in
on YouTube no do this I slow so it's
like I almost 10 but it's like poop it's
like a boop boop boop it just it's just
not good so I don't want to linger on
that but and the lock sound sounds like
and it's weird it doesn't sound like a
close it's like a
us back with another video and I am
going to show you guys that that's not
it it's never mind sorry anyway so
that's kind of annoying then the
probably the biggest thing is I don't
know about you all but I do turn off the
reduce motion effects do you return
those I know I don't think I've ever
played with that okay so this is like
when you're using your operating system
it does these like every time you open
an app it does like zoom into that oh
yeah I hate that crap right yeah I hate
that animation stuff so they the new my
messages I messages has all these crazy
you know confetti filters and different
you know invisible ink and all that
stuff if you turn on the reduce affects
the motion effects option which is only
supposed to affect the phone and like
the parallax effect that's like when you
look side to side it looks kind of 3d
but it's not and some of the animations
oh yeah if you turn that off it affects
I messages which is a totally different
app it doesn't have anything to do yeah
someone's gonna say oh it's reduce
motion effects in the description in the
settings it says visual enhancements
that have to do with the parallax you
know effect for icons and moving in on
the interface like don't tell me
confetti falling or invisible ink has to
do with motion effects so if you happen
to turn that off because you want your
phone to work snappier like just jump in
apps yeah you lose the ability to use I
messages in that way and I'm like this
is completely unrelated like that's a
bum they're not related at all stupid
man first two that's another first world
problem they'll be like Cinnabon this
whole list is first real problems okay
and then I got I got your WTF for the
day oh okay so no everyone's time out
their iphone but then you're talking
about their iPad okay but i'm gonna show
you what tell me how does this make
sense okay on the ipad they have a movie
app they have a podcast app and they
have a music app okay let me show you
the movie app you know how it is right
it's like laid out you have all your
tiles and icons or anything right this
is very normal right you watch a movie
you play it it goes full screen i'm not
going to show you any more than I have
to now the podcast app is a little
different because it's like you have all
your podcast here but then when you play
them it has like this tiny navigation
bar autumn right it doesn't fill the
screen right this is tiny ass navigation
bar your psyche okay yeah fine okay I
can lift it up I can get it full screen
yay good right we got that but by
default by default we don't really want
to go to that screen oh you don't you
just want it to pop up oh yeah now let's
go to the music app this is my favorite
thing that they did here not okay so
it'll really good little more you're
gonna love you in Haiti more okay so
fine you have like the ability to go to
your library and you have this drop-down
a playlist and artist I'm gonna go to my
place here im gonna pick a playlist and
yes or some music might play out of here
I'm going to try and not make it play
just so that it doesn't undisrupted but
when you play a song let me show you
what it looks like do you think it's
gonna go fullscreen I have no idea okay
let me um let me try hope it would you
hope it would okay let me show you what
happens when you try and play a song
here let's get a good one okay here we
go this is what the interface looks like
oh it's this random it's like a shaped
it's basically like they took part of
like the phone OS uh-huh and just popped
it here on the side yeah totally and it
hasn't you see all this ugly crap in the
background that does nothing and there's
just empty white it stays easier it's
just this little column on the far right
like who the heck made this crap like
where's my beautiful music like where's
my beautiful music it's over here in the
corner this is so stupid but that's
that's just for the ipad right yeah but
like they yeah they just made it totally
different I don't know I should stop
complain about my first pathetic trust
me I'm just only complained cuz like we
all like this is like you it's new its
new we're all supposed to complain yeah
all right let's get you to change is
hard change change is hard um but also a
change that maybe is just hard to
actually happen or make happen apple and
title we've heard all title the music
service we've heard all these rumors
about Apple acquiring title but
according to Apple music head Jimmy
Iovine he told BuzzFeed news directly we
are not looking to acquire any streaming
services you know what that means we are
going to acquire a streaming sir like
saying the opposite how many times in
business have you I'm we're just messing
around here but don't we wouldn't be
surprised and the reason why is there
been so much talk about this but title
recently released their latest earnings
and for basically what is this they was
acquired in early 2015 by jay-z and a
group of other musicians right they made
this huge splash but according to their
filings title took on a net loss of
roughly 28 million dollars last year
ma'am purely because of the you know how
much it costs to restream and the money
that they're pouring in based on the
user's how many people actually using
their service they think they have
roughly around four million 4.2 million
pain subscribers right now but that's
just not enough to cut it apples is
around 17 million Spotify just announced
as they flex their muscle there at 40
million paid subscribers for supply
that's pretty big so the two beasts
right now are gonna be Spotify and Apple
yeah title do you think those multi
millionaires who are all about business
want to keep on losing money like that
hell no hell no no but you know what i
think title like they had a good model
where they're gonna have exclusive
artists on just their platform for a
while but they I think they blow it by
letting the artists get their stuff on
iTunes right away you know like a week
later a week if they if they hung on to
those things like maybe a month or so I
think that would definitely increase
some numbers I don't know a hundred
percent agree with you the the thing is
that they they were freaked out because
they realized oh people are still using
the other services instead of like you
said it's scared it's like why not just
be strong for a month I mean let's be
honest it's not like they're need money
right now no I mean we know the money
game but if they want to change the wave
of how things are going you just got to
kind of hold out why do you think people
go on strike because they're trying to
change the wave of what's happening to
move in their favor you can't put out a
song and then a week later give it to
apple music and spot yeah you can't say
it's this is exclusive on title for one
week I mean come on that's that's
nothing like a week as as a flash in the
pan or even two weeks people are like I
got it in two weeks yeah good I'll I'll
listen to whatever else people are
throwing up online so I can hear it
first but i'll get in in two weeks I
wonder where YouTube music comes into
this because they're like a huge player
too but they never really seemed to get
mentioned in all these sort of music
streaming
use stories you know I think YouTube is
always you know they kinda have their
google music service in the background
but they just never been a big player
because people just don't think of them
as a music service I know right in
psychology all listen to music for sure
too costly for video to boot you know
and they were hoping they can convert
that but it's just not happening that's
weird right there there's a point where
sometimes no matter what you have you
you're late to the game and people just
aren't gonna jump on like what for you
would you all of a sudden just switch
loyalties to youtube music right now no
haha but I mean I do i watch a vivo and
I'll watch a commercial to watch a video
it's no problem so I mean I you know I
probably use it just as much as I do any
other platform like iTunes or something
it's true it's true so um don't worry
right now Apple and title are staying
apart but I'm curious to see what titles
future is because they can't continue to
lose money like that they're artists
aren't in the business of losing money
you just got to take our advice be
strong keep your stuff exclusive on
title next usher album if you really
care sure go to title I'll buy it if you
go to if you hold out long enough it's
like Usher available on title and it's
like a week later I could buy it on
iTunes I'm not gonna go over to title no
I don't connect Lee why would I do that
so there you go all right uh we forgot
to mention our phone number at the top
of the show because we wanted to jump
right into it which typically leads to
people not calling but I can tell you
right now you guys call us a lot so the
number is 1 800 61 62 63 84 your
voicemails your name where you're from
your comments your questions we're gonna
zip through these we've we wanted to
give you guys some extra love today so
we're gonna go through a bunch all right
here we go call number one numero uno
figure out from started oh no what was
the one thing hey Brian I was wondering
if you were able to figure out from the
keynote what was the one thing that we
cannot live without on this new iphone
my guess is the Nintendo but hey we'll
see I agree Nintendo well they got us
they put in the little Nintendo sneak
ball yeah this is in reference to Tim
Cook's um you know remarks on CNBC maybe
like
three or four months ago that we're
gonna show you something you can't live
without and he was really excited about
and we made fun of him for saying that
yeah I had the Mario up in his pocket he
was just like dying to pull it out and
go guru guru did you do jack I do go
doo-doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo-doo
doo-doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo-doo haha so
I don't know I really I can't say what
that feature was because there was a
there was not one it's like like I'm
like I've said don't stop saying the
word magical like I know what magic
looks like like it's a rabbit out of a
hat yeah it's david copperfield walking
through the Great Wall of China on a TV
special it's david blaine nude inside a
block of ice that's that's magic that is
actually wasn't only nude right well he
might have been in his undies well yeah
yeah that block of ice thing that was
crazy what's crazy to DES Haluk did he
do one where he's underwater also for a
suitable yeah I don't know if that one
worked out very good I think they had to
drain it earlier something cuz he like
freaked it was like he was trying to do
it for days but it like I didn't happen
yeah yeah and then there was another one
he just stood up on a high like thing
just up on this little bit like a few
things like a week you just did there in
New York yeah kind of like using um wet
latina trans mints yes yeah that I mean
blame duty blame pulled like a threat
out of his stomach on a TV special i
know i love to scare house i do that's
magic said okay next god thanks girl hey
Brian hey Stephen my name is Matt I'm
from jacksonville florida and with the
removal of the headphone jack on the
iphone 7 do you think they're going to
do that with all their products across
the board or do you think it'll be like
an iphone exclusives saying like the 3d
touch on the iphones and no other
product love the show guys thanks thanks
for calling man uh I definitely agree
with you it's kind of like the Gateway
right now the iphone is the play to get
the idea of it into the mass market
without affecting and really shaking
people's brains too much just because
people the phone is a one on one
relationship
meaning you know you have a TV and like
one TV can be shared with four or five
people but a phone everyone has a phone
and is going to get a phone so once you
start introducing behaviors to that
whether they like them or not just kind
of start getting used to it and you kind
of use that as the gateway drug to then
get people to adopt these different
behaviors on something like your iPad
next maybe now laptops desktops it's
going to take a take a while before that
happens you know this whole lightning
connection because it's still Apple
proprietary you're more likely going to
see a USB digital connection they're
going to fight each other this is kind
of like firewire and USB back in the day
for video there's going to be a digital
light you know lightning vs. USB and
there they will I don't know if they're
gonna stand side by side are they going
to keep them separate my platform but I
can't see it at least in the next year
to every device being like this is like
five years out I mean I would not put it
past Apple because we've seen the
optical drive disappear we've seen tons
of USB ports disappear all kinds of
ports disappearing so I would not put it
past them I wouldn't either it's not
going to be within the next two years
yeah definitely not just from a standard
like certain things need to work with
other things an iphone can be
independent it's really like its own
mini computer yeah so can live in on the
island a laptop a little different but
it it's going to happen eventually it's
their vision so yeah okay next call uh
Jonathan the Bay Area I just wanted you
to talk about of the fact that they
didn't mention anyone who bought that
Apple watch goal apple watch edition
version there's no upgrade program they
just said with a ten-thousand-dollar old
watch i jacked you thought yeah you're
you're stuck with the
ten-thousand-dollar old watch like it
was replaced by the ceramic one which is
1249 but that'll give us next year
honestly i don't i'm glad that i
personally don't know some person I
don't know anyone personally who bought
the damn gold edition watch like I would
question myself if I literally knew
someone who did that that i would call
my friend because I
no yeah I don't know anyone either but
that should make any way like a
celebrity that should make us feel good
yeah that we don't know someone who
caught the gold edition watch that
speaks highly of you as a person all
right next call hey guys Vince Brennan
ingleton Ohio so the w1 ship is great
technology on point Khan was wondering
why they wouldn't apply that to the
Bluetooth speaker whether if you Apple
were be either one wouldn't even have it
I'm Alexa echo kind of deal going on as
well so what you guys thought on that
it's got to be coming eventually I would
think but thanks you either I think
he's putting the pieces out there and
he's picking them up and put into them
together I with without a doubt this w
one chip is their chip of the future
from managing all audio devices from a
standpoint of why haven't they put in
this speaker yet it's most likely
because they already have their own
speaker product that they want to launch
with it and then from a headphone
standpoint you've got again you've got
to get people comfortable with the idea
of using a technology a certain way I
think earphones headphones is an easy
way to get people to be like oh I see
how this is and then all of a sudden
you're like oh yeah now all your
speakers are they do have the w1 chip in
beats headphones so we know beats makes
other stereo proddy o products it's
going to happen we'll just wait and see
how long it takes there's probably one
of those chips in a speaker in like an
RD room somewhere oh yeah headquarters
oh yeah for sure for sure okay next call
hey guys my name is yasir i'm calling
from Toronto Canada love the show up in
listening and watching for a really long
time both of you're doing a great job so
my question for you guys is for all
these people that are just looking for
phones for processing power so they're
able to install apps that can do more do
you think there's going to be any
performance difference between the seven
and the seven plus and for those of us
already on the success is there worth
upgrading thanks
so from early benchmarks we do it's not
official by Apple but the word based on
these benchmarks is that the seven plus
does have three gigs of ram compared to
the seven which is equipped with two
gigs of ram the reality though is
there's nothing where we've seen the
seven plus be so much more advantageous
that you have to have it to do major
processing tasks are they both faster
camera yeah unless your camera guy mean
that's really the seven plus is more
about the camera than it is about the
processor we aren't seeing any specific
apps written directly to take advantage
of all that power so if you're looking
for quote unquote the most powerful
Apple phone shurfine get the three gig
one but that's just on paper the actual
result it it's probably not going to be
that much bigger of a difference for you
yeah and and screen size right people
three assess those two things you're
getting you're getting those phones for
other things versus you know raw power
okay next call hey guys my name is yeah
I'm calling ya hey ya sir what's up yo
sorry guys Michael from New Jersey I'm
calling so did pretty much angry at
Apple right now first reason is for all
the Apple customers that purchase the
iphone an upgrade program they everyone
knows that they don't have enough stock
so people aren't able to reserve their
iphone now all new newer reports are
coming out of that they're going to take
from their store spot to give back to
the other people who preordered already
and we're on the upgraded iphone program
which makes sense but if Apple was to
roll out a new program they shouldn't
have issues with supply if they're going
to say that everyone who upgraded uh who
was on this new program should
automatically able to get a rifle so
double bed Apple this is a disaster for
now people waiting online people are not
going to wait on line this should have
been thought out alright thanks love the
show by one hundred percent agree there
were reports that because Apple did such
a poor job with the iphone upgrade
program again it's the program that you
signed up to basically garen
to yourself the ability to upgrade when
the next iPhone comes out a lot of
people didn't a lot of people were set
were said told that okay fine I want to
pick this up at a store they weren't
able to when some were pushed to be able
to pick it up from a store the inventory
was already gone later on Apple did
reach out to some but again not all so
not everyone was happy about this some
iphone upgrade owners to be able to get
the 7 plus that they hoped for and pick
it up they were reached out and
contacted directly but again this didn't
happen to everyone the majority of
people were left out in the dust it's
ridiculous there was a class action
lawsuit that is being put together
against the iphone upgrade program and i
think it's a bummer because clearly they
over-promised under-delivered that's
like one of the cardinal sins and just
customer service and retail and if you
were hoping to get an iphone and you got
screwed by Apple you should be unhappy
but also you're like well what can I do
they don't even have the phone to the
stores so remember them like selling
this pitching this is like oh if you
have the plan if you're on the plan
you're gonna get the phone first before
everyone you have it right away lumumba
so the first time they're doing it
there's already hiccups it's it's a
disaster as he said and phone call
that's a bad apple that bad that's a bad
apple right there ok another call got
two more hey Brian I just wanted to say
i love your streams i love your videos
men keep up the good work and i also
wanted to get your take on the new jet
black color I know that color is uh very
easily and prone to scratch I wanted to
know if you're gonna get that color
would you put a case a clear case or a
hard protective case on it thanks man
he's putting me on the spot cuz he's
like yeah I know it scratches and are
you gonna get it my pre order was for
the iphone 7 jet black oh but see I I'll
be the first one to make fun of it
because Apple just basically every year
dictates a new color is the new black
right yes it was like gold was the new
black three years ago rose gold was the
new black lash
and this year jet black is the new black
so you know they come up with a cool
color I'm gonna definitely put a case on
that thing I'm probably gonna because I
if I got jet black I should probably try
to show it off oh yeah you gotta show it
off like the first week at least yeah
something like that so I'll get some
sort of clear case put it on there and
then I'll put one of my fancy shmancy
like trendy cases that looks like a
tropical island and then it'll be done
with so you got me I got it I always get
these like really thin Matt cases yeah
those are dope these are pretty much
they feel good in here I think the matte
black actually looks really cool for the
others with iphone okay okay next last
call hi my name is Matthew and I'm from
Detroit Michigan my question is about
this October event we might be having do
you think to introduce a new version of
ilife and I a completely redone version
I work with the new collaboration
features and what do you think they're
going to do with the macbook air I know
what they're going to do with the
macbook pro but what do they can do with
the air and do you think they'll lower
the price of the pro I really hope they
do because 1999 is way too hot all right
there's a lot of questions here let me
try and get through them first of all
with I work I expect us to see some
level of I sorry of ilife stuff but I
wouldn't be surprised if it gets pushed
until next year for the ipad event with
that is rumored we do expect to see some
sort of macbook imac event this october
but the reason why i say pushing over to
the ipad is because if they are really
going to do this on the ipad and they
are really are going to show us some
level of collaboration they've kind of
got to show it to us working on both
products maybe they maybe they don't you
know we got a little tease of i work at
the apple event recently maybe they go
full force with it on the max but i
think you've got to involve both
components of what is your productivity
platforms obviously all macs and then
maybe depending on how you define
productivity the ipad pro but I life
hasn't been touched for a while I think
they're starting to show you even in
their photos app that they're trying to
automate this stuff more like memories
do things like that the videos that kind
of
set stuff together they're almost like
focusing on more automated stuff that
just happens because they don't
necessarily believe people have um you
know the time the goof with this stuff
but I think iphoto and imovie if you
really look at them do you do you
desperately need a significant overhaul
with them and because it typically
targets the general consumer probably
not so I just went I would be surprised
if they gave us anything major in the
form of ilife also because the resources
are spent in like other places they've
got so many different products so I hope
they do something but we'll see and then
he also asked Oh MacBook Airs yeah this
one you might be sad but I think the
macbook air line as we know it is a most
likely going to go away so I think the
new product line after all is said and
done will be the 12 inch macbook which
is the USBC one this is the ultra-thin
that is really to me going to be the new
macbook air and then beyond that you'll
get a 13-inch macbook pro and a 15-inch
macbook pro that's just what my gut
tells me the macbook pros will obviously
have that oled touch bar but that
macbook air is thicker than the current
ultra-thin macbook it's thinner than the
big mac book but based on how you see
their design concepts work the macbook
air is really an old dated design so I
really feel like it's going to go away
or it might serve as like the
entry-level laptop and they won't really
do much with speed boost but it'll be
the ultra thin and then the regular
macbook pros yeah maybe they like make
it some sort of educational exactly
exactly so that that's that's what I
think it is but hey I could be wrong
