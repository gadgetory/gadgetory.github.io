one of the best TVs for the money
available today well it's not as good as
some of the higher-end models I reviewed
this year if you're on a tight budget
and don't care too much about built in
Smart TV it's a great choice you're
looking at the two sizes I used in my
review a 50 inch model and a 65 inch
version the e series comes in sizes all
the way down to 23 inches but I'm only
recommending models 48 inches in larger
why because they're the ones with local
dimming the feature that improves
contrast and punch especially in dark
home theater environments the image
quality of these series TVs is head and
shoulders above anything else in their
price range styling is generic as you
might expect from a budget set with a
glossy black frame and relatively thick
cabinets the little legs have patterned
cutouts that look a little different
from the norm but that's about it
remember what I said about built in
Smart TV to watch apps like Netflix and
Hulu on the e series you'll need to cast
them from your phone you also need to
use the phone to access TV settings like
individual picture adjustments using
Vizio Smart cast app for iOS and Android
it works okay but in my book having a
real on-screen menu for that stuff is a
lot more convenient Vizio includes a
simple TV remote for basic functions but
unlike the more expensive Vizio models
there's no included tablet overall if
you prioritize image quality in your
cheap TV then the Vizio e-series is a
great choice but if you want the
convenience of built-in smarts you
should go with a Roku TV instead of
course you could always attach a Roku
device to this TV and get the best of
both worlds I'm David Katz my frissina</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
