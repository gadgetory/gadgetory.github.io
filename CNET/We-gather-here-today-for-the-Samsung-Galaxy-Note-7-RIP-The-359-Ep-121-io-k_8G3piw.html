it's time for another edition of the 359
podcast brought to you by cnet fresh and
tasty this is jorge it's episode of 121
with Ben Fox Rubin and Alfred and good
morning guys what are we talking about
today hey Josh I am fresh and tasty
apparently we're gonna be coming back to
the Samsung Galaxy Note sevens very big
news that they've killed off the
flagship phone they stopped sales and
now they've just stopped production all
together so we'll get to that in the
show this might be the last time we
talked about the note 7 I doubt that
well we'll think of some excuse so the
note 7 is an ex Harambee zombie phone
alright that died and then it came back
as a meme we'll also talk about a rumor
about Amazon potentially starting
convenience stores so that'll be
interesting and also one of the dumbest
memes of 2016 selfie high fives I don't
really get it but we'll talk about it on
the show it's not even a high five
though but like it's on my 5 yeah I for
clapping yeah selfie clap it's yeah I'm
gonna cry at some point but we should
after the show or maybe during the show
I don't know so as always send in your
questions comments will try to get to as
many as we can after the show and let's
get started alright and here we go for
the recording of the 359 podcast episode
1 21 and 32 welcome to the 359 where we
talk about the top tech news of the day
plus whatever crap we want to throw in
I'm Ben Fox Rubin I'm out for dang ok so
pour out some liquor for the dearly
departed samsung galaxy note 7 samsung
confirmed Tuesday it will permanently
stop making the trouble device after a
world wide recall didn't stop the phones
from catching fire Alfred how bad is
this for samsung it's I think Samsung
will still do fine as far as the note 7
goes I think it's it's dead in the water
obviously it's finished yeah that's true
but you're right Samsung I think still
makes refrigerators and washing machines
and televisions that don't catch fire so
until everything else that they make is
also catching on for our I still think
so
phones are fine it's very unfortunate
that this happened to the note 7 but I
mean it they had to kill it it you know
it had to be put out it's me I don't
know if you want to I think you're
arguing that this is going to they're
going to be able to hermetically seal
the note 7 and say hey this was a bad
phone we didn't we weren't able to do a
good job with this one but I don't know
don't you think that this could be like
a significant long-term reputational hit
for these guys they had already done a
worldwide recall and weren't able to fix
the problem i mean like to me that seems
like a pretty big issue i think phone
wise they're going to have to deal with
a lot of PR hits over the next year or
two but I mean at keeping in mind though
Samsung also makes a bunch of TVs they
make washing machines like you said they
make a ton of stuff yeah they're huge
like electronics conglomerate and then
I'm saying unless until those things
start exploding I think we'll be fine
they'll be slightly phone wise though
there it's going to be a very like high
Mountain for them to climb so what do
you think phones we should talk about
what note 7 people should get now that
you shouldn't have your note 7 well the
galaxy s7 and the s7 edge have not
exploded and and they're pretty similar
they're like i'd say maybe like ninety
percent kind of the same phone yeah yeah
yeah you don't get the stylus but at the
same time you're still going to get a
lot of the same samsung feeling from
that one I've had mine uh s7 and it
hasn't exploded on me yet that's that's
good to hear so and if not that and if
you want if you just don't trust Samsung
at all anymore i mean i would recommend
getting a pixel phone yeah the google
pixel I don't think it's hit the market
quite yet but you could pre-order it now
it'll come to you by you know i think
it's mid october i believe so that's
that's a pretty good idea and then you
know HTC makes good phones LG you've got
a lot of options out there if you want
to stay within the android universe
there's a lot of alternatives out there
the the note 7 dying is not doesn't mean
the end of smartphones for you nobody
panic so a little bit of public service
if you haven't notes Evan Samsung and
you
regulators strongly recommend you power
it off immediately get in touch with the
place you bought the device to find out
about a refund or an exchange next
amazon is reportedly looking into
building small convenience stores this
news comes after a report a few weeks
ago that the company plans to open a
grocery pickup location in Seattle are
these good ideas as Ames aim is on
pushing into brick and mortars I've just
never been to Seattle so I can't say
what they're the state of they're like
you know convenience stores are but I
know if it ever tried it in New York
they would not work out at all you know
there's a convenience store in every
corner and Amazon trying to push into
that just isn't gonna work yeah I I
think that it's definitely like a tough
push for them because as you said
there's an enormous amount of
competition but I mean you know they try
all sorts of things who knows and it
just completely goes against you know
what Amazon was built on the ho total
delivered to your doorstep and now it's
kind of and that was the convenience of
it all that now it's hey you could come
to our store and you know they did build
a bookstore so I wouldn't completely
write this one off and say hey it's
never gonna happen so but like how
successful has their bookstore bit oh
it's mostly showrooming point so last
with what little time we have left high
five selfies can you tell me a bit about
this what is that other favorite thing
that I've seen so so people are trying
to take selfies of themselves giving
themselves high-fives but they're not
really high five is just you clapping
your hands right but you're giving
yourself a high-five but are you gonna
how are you taking the baseball you're
amazingly touching the phone basically
like have your phone out and then like
move your hands really fast horrible
idea it's a great way to break your
phone do not do it I mean if you have a
note 7 go ahead it's right right anyway
if you want to read more about these
stories check us out on cnet I'm Ben Fox
Rubin I'm Alfred Aang thanks for
listening got a lot of conspiracy
theorists in the chat about why the
notes about the note 7 and how this is
just a big PR stunt no other other
phones are guilty and you know I I PR
stunt in like from Samsung I don't know
I'm I can only read so many they're
flying sabotage from from Apple Apple
sabotage that's a pretty good skin
spirit I get that one I do have to ask
our viewers so if
any of you are keeping your notes Evans
please send me an email I'm at Alfred
dotting at CBS I com I'm trying to spill
your last but it's felt ng it's also
it's also in the what our description it
is yes you can find it there but if
you're keeping it send me an email I'd
love to talk to you about and see why
most of my friends who I thought were
gonna keep it at are actually returning
it now yeah I mean it's a safety issue I
mean no his gun his issue with it was
like why are you returning it now after
all this he's like well now it's like
actually banned from places like I can't
go into life oh that's true you can't
bring it with you under like yeah so
he's like well now I have to return are
like that's why because you can't go
into places it's the new smoking but
like Sir sir you can't bring your Galaxy
devenir but again yeah if anyone
watching this is keeping it please send
me an email again its Alfred da ting
that's just spelled ng at CBS I calm so
I don't know if my this conspiracy
theory reference is going to be accurate
for the commenters but I remember when
coke came out with the new coke it a
bombed completely like they did all this
taste testing everybody in the blind
taste tests had said the new coke
clearly taste better than the original
coke they changed the the recipe and
people were livid they were absolutely
super pissed off at coca-cola New Coke
was Pepsi it was right I mean like in
over seven is a grenade so so needless
to say coke went back to the original
recipe and sales went through the roof
and they asked him afterwards they were
like oh you guys did that on purpose
that was a publicity stunt and coca-cola
was like we're not that smart and we're
not that stupid so if this has anything
to do with a publicity stunt I mean like
Samsung would have to be threading the
needle pretty pretty impressive well I
would say the difference between this
one and the coke story is that people
actually probably got hurt so that guy
to be a very bad down there and then
having a slightly more saccharine
tasting coca-cola yeah
for sure there's more than a few people
presently watching on a note 7 ah ok so
Duck and Cover Duck and Cover and my
recommendation to you as I've said on
the show several times before with the
original notes Evans and now the
recalled notes Evans is you should power
it off and return it as soon as possible
i'm not gonna knock them for doing that
I i I'm legitimately curious though why
are they watching it now and then
planning or turning it later or are they
so you know just saying you know this
phone is so good that I'm willing to
risk you know what's happening I me no
such thing and if it is you know what's
so good about the phone that they want
to keep it like it's a really good phone
on its merits other than the fact that
it explodes I mean like how good would a
phone have to be for you to take that
deal breaker brick because for some
people they are and I'm legitimately
curious like why is this phone like so
good that like I've tried to convince
people to keep these things I just want
to know it's not I can't I can't have
that weigh on my conscience phone
anybody on anybody that is watching on a
note 7 please stop watching me right now
turn it off let's speculate for a second
Zach wants to know what they're going to
do next do you think they're going to
try to rush towards what would be the
essay even though we're probably not
going to see anything called a note ever
again so I saw a headline yesterday that
said they're not going to rush it out
because they rushed out the note 7 to
try to beat Apple to the punch they
wanted to get the note 7 out the door
before the new iPhones came out like a
phoenix from the ashes and writing says
that's what we mean I was named it's
gonna be the Samsung Galaxy Phoenix as a
terrible literally frommel ideas
literally from the ashes sorry so they
don't want to do that again by trying to
rush out production and then having
another battery problem or something
else so when they do come out with the
essay they can't have two flagship
phones that have completely conked out
so they wanna when they do come out with
it one would imagine that it would be
during Mobile World Congress I think
that's in march in February or march
they want to make sure that they you
know dot all their eyes cross their teas
and make sure that this is a functional
flagship phone so i don't think that
you're going to see the s8 early I don't
think are you saying
again I think you will see you know I
think I think it's my landing I don't
think so I really that I mean like I
think what you're saying makes sense I
just don't think they would do it I
think they will come out with a note 8
they spent a lot of time building up the
brand but Nick it only takes so much
that you know completely ruin it it's I
mean like I think the hardware will
still be the exact the hardware was
really good I think they're gonna drop
the Knicks they could fix the exploding
problem it's a great phone so we'll see
we'll see what happens with that Samsung
just dug themselves a million foot hole
in my opinion according to Zach they
might lose all customers by the next set
of releases for the phones and tablet if
you look at okay so I don't think that's
true because there are still some
dedicated people Samsung is the die
maybe is literally by their samsung
phones samsung is the biggest smartphone
maker in the world there's no way that
number goes down to zero or that they
might not even lose their number one
spot I think number two is a Apple I'm
with outfit I think they're just going
to rename it I'm gonna statistics gonna
stay they're gonna keep calling it the
note I think everybody knows what that
is and I don't know what else they would
want everyone everyone knows what it is
now because of all these explosions and
then I think I think when the whatever
new iteration or that comes out you know
everyone's gonna be testing it on like
to see you know its battery and how you
know if it explodes that I mean it's all
eyes are gonna be on that yeah that
doesn't matter what I just can't believe
they're recall I can't believe they
screwed up the recall they did a
worldwide recall yeah that was really
embarrassing everybody was like okay you
got one Mulligan no big deal whatever
and then that one also screwed up and it
just to me it seems like they rushed out
the recall to me like that to me seems
pretty obvious and that's just really
unfortunate zg onyx thinks that otterbox
should capitalize on this by making a
fireproof case I love that idea I think
that's a really solid idea oh yeah
otterbox we'll have to get into the you
know like bomb diffusion business or
something like that yeah props to David
in the chat for bringing out the NBA Jam
terminology boom shakalaka I agree Wow
well we're going on fire
look I'm eating up yes NVA Jam
references how many people that God cast
ever how many people in the chat are
jumping back across a river to Apple
after this honest question legit in the
question legit question just curious
I've seen some tweets about the galaxy
note 7 where it was people were saying
oh man now Samsung is gonna make me get
a iphone 7 because they were like
recalling this I'm think they're not
making you do anything there's so many
Android phones they're so many like more
android phones than the iphone somebody
had like a crying emoji where's i don't
want to get an iphone 7 why didn't why
are you doing this to the samsung again
go to cnet.com and find out all their
current smartphone availability options
there are so many options yeah uh
Michael Brown a long time dedicated
viewer listener thank you for sticking
around with us for so long how much do
you guys think the pixel should have
been sold for and why how much it should
have been sold for correct oh god what's
the price on that thing like 650 at the
base price yeah what's wrong with that
that's you think that's too much I think
this country Pettitte I think 400 or 500
would have been how much I that's how
much I would have paid for it uh I mean
they packed a lot of stuff into that and
they're trying to I mean in some ways
pricing is consumer expectations you're
trying to hit a certain market so
setting it at 650 as the base price also
elevates it to the level of flagship
phone yeah but most flagship phones have
a carrier deal with it where you know
you get like you know some amount of
money off you know based off of that
pricing but with the pixel it's
essentially only verizon that you can do
that with mm-hmm so i think if i were to
get it from the google play store or
anything like that i think 400 500 would
have been maybe even 400 to 600 would
have been like a normal price for me to
pay for that i I could have lived with
600 I think 400 is a little too low for
that and phone I think they sold me on
some of the you know impressive features
on it and I'm certainly curious to see
it when it reaches the office that's
already here I'm very I'm like very
excited to see the pixel phone it's a
great great timing your google too
because everybody now wants to see and
they
they have a bigger size the XL is 5.5
inches which is I think reasonably close
to the size of the point what's going on
fri bob says samsung the Volkswagen of
phones yeah yeah i think more accurately
the you go of phones right now we can
trust any of our you know multinational
conglomerates to placate us with their
stuff anymore yeah i know i was never in
here for that I hate every product out
there right yeah that's why we hired you
yeah your hate of products is important
I actually just use a carrier pigeon
that that's pretty impressive Munich a
hey good for you people jumping back to
LG people jumping back to the stylo but
they're anti iphone it sounds like
that's fine that's why I think I said
you don't have to go to the iphone
mm-hmm definitely and some people very
not into the LG yeah yeah I haven't
spent much time with the LG phones so I
like the flex I thought that was a
clever idea where like it actually
flexes a bit let's let's recommend some
alternatives right here on the spot if
you are stuck with the Samsung and it's
time to finally bite the bullet what
models would you guys suggest right so
we inspect my Karen we had mentioned by
carrier most most of the flagship phones
are available for any carriers I would
say so there's the HTC flagship phone I
think what are they on the HTC m9 at
this point yeah so that's a very good
phone very strong build you know it's
it's got a very good body and it always
gets because we're and Cena if you don't
have a if you don't have a risin or if
you you're don't want to wait for the
pixel I mean HTC makes like the pixel so
well actually see makes ya they make
sure that that's like the hardware
behind it right yeah so I mean at the
very least you know that they are
they're good at like actually
manufacturing a phone I think if you
want to stick with Samsung the samsung
as you said the s7 and the s7 edge I've
also been very well-reviewed are you get
the the previous edition of the oh yeah
the note 6 I mean guys if you ate it is
it the note 6 I think it's the no vive
they skipped past
like the yeah yeah the sex yeah so
because this one was so good they
decided that they didn't make it what if
the next one was the sex right so I go
back to they said you like sorry guys we
we accidentally skip but yeah if you
want to just go back to the note 5 I
mean I it's perfectly fine device well
you brought with you a note 8 right
there yeah top secret is a secret no tag
just do away with all smartphones yeah I
said yesterday let's go back carrier
pigeons definitely i'm using i don't
know i'm fine with my iphone 6 I like my
headphone jack I like my iphone 6 with
the home button that doesn't work I
don't need anything new and yeah I i
I've also been avoiding this suggestion
but you know you can also get an iphone
yeah it's fine it that's like kind of
like the default like smartphone of what
you should get if you still want the
headphone jack at the success that's
fine i'll stick with that all right what
if I still just use the phone as a phone
just sorry how dare you oh alright are
we gonna call it yeah let's call today
