appliances here on my front porch with
bought home automations doorbot doorbot
is a doorbell security camera and
intercom all-in-one it connects to your
local Wi-Fi and you can use the related
doorbot app to see who's at your front
door now this is an excellent idea in
theory because it's basically like a
digital peephole so that you can be
sitting on your couch or out getting
groceries and you'll receive a push
notification when someone rings the
doorbell one problem that I see with
this is that not everyone will ring your
doorbell so maybe you're expecting a
package from FedEx or UPS and you can
get a notification when the doorbell
rings to see if it is that person or
that needy ex-boyfriend that won't leave
you alone it also has a built-in speaker
and a microphone which allows for
two-way talk so you can hold down a
button on the app and speak and then
release it to listen to what they say
unfortunately I couldn't get this to
work at all and the one time it did work
the quality wasn't very good and on top
of that the video quality is pretty bad
the feed was really pixelated it was
hard to make out a face and depending on
the time of day or if you're under a
covered porch there might be a lot of
shadows making it completely impossible
to see who is actually at your front
door so you're basically spending $199
for a really snazzy doorbell the
doorbell works great it has a nice chime
but that's about it
and one final word of caution if your
Wi-Fi connection is spotty at best at
your front door this will not work at
all
my Wi-Fi router is about 40 feet away
and the signal only has to pass through
the front door and it still struggled to
find a good connection so while I
wouldn't recommend this product today
I'm really hopeful they will improve
some of these glitches because I really
think an all-in-one sort of security and
convenience device like this has a
practical application in
thanks for watching I'm Megan Millers
