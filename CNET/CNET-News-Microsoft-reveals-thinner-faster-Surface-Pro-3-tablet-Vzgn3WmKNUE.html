that can replace your laptop surface pro
3 let's take a quick look at that look
at how thin it is so as a point of
reference the best way to kind of look
at this device to start is to let's use
surface pro 2 because you can just kind
of see the comparison surface pro 2 is
packs a ton of punch it has all the
performance that you needed in your full
laptop and as a performant as anything
on market we then took that product we
took that exact same performance
increased it pushed it from the 10.6
millimeters that started at and pushed
it down to the 9.1 millimeters you see
onstage pretty incredible we've grown it
to a 12 inch diagonal now I want to
explain that to you really quick pushing
it to 12 inches was critical if we want
to do more if we want to help people be
more if we want to be more productive
sitting right in between the tablet in
the laptop and getting to the point
where you can replace your laptop this
is a critical critical element 12 inches
it is a beautiful screen it's a three by
two aspect ratio which we'll talk about
later it's something that hasn't really
been done before in this size it's a 20
160 x 1440 display we call it pixel free
it is the same ClearType technology that
you've seen in surface pro 2 it's
optically bonded it has the highest
contrast ratios in the industry critical
productivity not a sexy word I totally
get it but to be more productive to help
yourself do more to get more done the
higher those ratios are the less eye
strain you have I know it's subtle but
it matters it just means you get less
tired that's super important as much as
we designed in thinness we designed in
lightness so important to understand the
best way to really get a feel is to hold
it the second best way is to kind of
show it so let me do that really quick
i'll put the surface here i'm going to
grab this macbook here and i just want
you to look at that it's very important
to understand yeah kind of cool here it
is this product's a great product of
course and the macbook i totally
understand why it's being used
but it is best in class when it comes to
thinness and lightness there is no
debate now we have a 12 inch screen I
want to compare it to the 13 inch for a
reason on our 12 inch screen because of
the beautiful screen and all of the
rendering and the work of Windows to
optimize it with this screen when you
pick it up you will look at it it will
feel great the reason it will feel great
is because we have optimized to the
scaling of Windows perfectly on this 12
inch screen you get six percent more
content than on this 13 inch screen that
is a factor of the ratio of three by two
as well as the scaling it is gorgeous</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
