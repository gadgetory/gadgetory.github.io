an IP rating of 67 doesn't make it
completely waterproof
in fact Apple's warranty still won't
cover water damage so spills and
splashes may be okay but anything passed
that will be at your own risk or in this
case ours if you've already seen our
scratch test you may recognize this guy
this is an iPhone 7 that has already
been through a little bit of torture but
we took it to the Apple store and they
confirm it is only cosmetic damage and
that it wouldn't affect the water
resistance so let's test Apple's actual
claim that this thing has an ip67 rating
that should mean it can survive immersed
in 1 meter of water for up to 30 minutes
so we just let this foam sit for about
15 minutes because when we first pulled
it out of the water we noticed a little
issue with the speakers where they
didn't sound very good now we're going
to run all of our tests and see how this
looks so far you can see the screen
looks great doesn't seem to have any
issues with touch here we've got a home
button it seems to be working the way it
should
volume up and down on the rockers are ok
and if I press this power button that
seems to work as well now if we go over
to then place a little bit of music
we're gonna see how these speakers sound
definitely got some volume again it
didn't have that the first time but I'm
only really hearing audio to the bottom
speakers
it's supposed to be stereo doesn't seem
like it's dried enough to fix whatever
the issue is with the top speaker we're
going to see if this microphone can do
some audio for us so this is your iPhone
this is your iPhone on water and that we
can definitely see a waveform there
indicating we're getting some audio in
let's see how it sounds
yep we're definitely getting some audio
on it sounds a little bit staticky
though and I'm still getting nothing
from the top speaker so all
ready we're running into a little bit of
an issue Apple recommends letting it dry
out for at least five hours after it's
been exposed to this much water but we
continued with some real-world testing
starting with underwater photography
this is your iPhone this is your iPhone
on water this is your iPhone this is
your iPhone on water up next is the duck
test in case your phone happens to fall
into the deep end your iPhone 7 on water
iPhone 7 on the water we haven't drawn
it yet so let's try the swim test
so obviously we're not at the pool
anymore we're back in the office I'm dry
the phone's dry and it's at about 24
hours to recover and while most
everything seems to be back to working
order the speaker's still aren't in
their original condition the volumes
nice and loud again but next to a
pristine iPhone 7 the audio doesn't
sound quite as rich in fact the high
frequencies even sound a little bit
jagged but considering we tested this
phone way beyond the rating I'm actually
impressed it's working at all but your
phone may not be as lucky and speaker
damage is definitely a possibility if
you push it beyond the limits like we
did today
so don't risk it never purposely
submerge the iPhone 7 and if you happen
to by mistake wait at least 5 hours for
it to completely dry before you plug it
in again
