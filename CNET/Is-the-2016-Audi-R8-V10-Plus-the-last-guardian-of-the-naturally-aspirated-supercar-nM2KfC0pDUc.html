LDR rate but not the r8 we know it's an
all-new one it has a mean of face lasers
for eyes and a fixed carbon wing
it's 5.2 liter v10 produces 610 brake
horsepower and delivers it to all four
wheels this is the r8 v10 plus the
fastest r8 you can buy today I remember
when the original r8 came out it looked
unlike anything else it really was a
pretty pretty car
it was also usable because you could see
our topic and you could put things in it
challenged the 911 in the everyday
usability stakes and it's v8 engine well
well it's one of the favourite engines
of all time it was also Tony Stark's car
and I really like Iron Man so run it
made it pretty good in my place and this
new one well I already hopes it will
build on the successes of the old one
it's not much of a secret that the r8
and the Lamborghini Gallardo shared a
few key things not least the engine in
the v10 r8 the same is true of the new
r8 and the Huracan they have the same
layout and some remarkably similar toys
and the v10 plus version of the r8 this
one has the same 602 brake horsepower
engine to play with from launch the
power is aided to the road by a 7-speed
dual-clutch transmission that can send a
hundred percents the talk to the front
or the back as needed sadly there isn't
a manual option for this all the Lambo
hurrican it seems that that is a thing
of the past now as is a v8 option which
i think is a crying shame because the
last Jen's v8 is one of the best
sounding engines ever you might
recognize it
also gone are the distinctive side
blades that looked a bit weird to start
with and then just made sense on top of
that the new r8 can weigh up to 50 kilos
lighter than before thanks to aluminium
carbon fiber and some clever engineering
Aldys managed to make a 602 brake
horsepower 413 pounds foot car that can
hit 62 from rest in 3.2 seconds and will
top 205 miles an hour it'll do nought to
124 in less than 10 seconds if you're
feeling brave as well
the interior is loaded with lots of toys
you got big comfy seats a virtual
cockpit like what you get on the TT and
lots of buttons on the steering wheel
one for starting the engine making the
exhaust noisy the turbo mega nuts a
button even though this isn't a
turbocharged engine and the drive select
and all the audio stuff as well so there
are lots and lots of tech but what is it
actually like to drive 7-speed gearbox
absolutely amazing when you're in
dynamic mode which is Audi's for sport
it can be quite aggressive it'll change
quite harsh and it can jolt the car so
it makes it feel either like you fluffed
a manual change or you're in a racing
car I think they were going for the
latter rather than the former in normal
mode in comfort it's actually really
Pleasant dynamic it can be a bit harsh
on the springs but in normal mode it's
just really nice been bending round the
smooth ish mountain roads and the rise
been really soft that has been really
quite pleasant however you probably
don't want to hear about comfort mode
because well that's a bit boring really
isn't it so is the rub in dynamic mode
in Sorrento rain Mike Yannick gathers
pace it is so fast it's it's kind of
take your breath away or heart in your
mouth good lord this is quick this
shouldn't be going so quick the road
soaking wet I'm being irresponsible fast
it's awesome it's not 262 time is on par
with hurricane obviously but also a 911
Turbo S but the way it delivers its
power is very different 911 big dollop
of torque and a kick in the kidneys this
very smooth very linear but very very
aggressive now grip wise we have been
utilizing the Quattro system lots of
lovely four-wheel drive action
it has a surprisingly large amount of
grip terrifyingly so I shouldn't have
been able to get around some of these
corners in say a rear-wheel drive car at
the speeds I've been managing where the
car seems to feel very flat very level
say like a proper supercar the steering
I've got a bit of an issue with it
doesn't sit quite right with me it takes
a while to find its groove and then once
you hook it up you feel it work properly
and I can get to work with it hello
Quattro you get to work with it but it
doesn't feel the most precise in the
world the traction control system I will
say is top-notch
because I should have been killed twice
today thanks to the weather the brakes
carbon ceramic they're interesting
because I find them a little bit grabby
but once you start to get to learn them
they feel a little bit more natural I
think these are the kind of breaks that
you really spend some time getting to
learn and to figure out now I've said a
lot that this car shares much with the
hurricane and well he does there's no
denying that
with the Italian you feel it's a little
bit more delicate you don't really want
to project the wrong way for fear
something might fall off but the Andi it
feels a little bit more solid a bit less
special there's a consequence the
Lamborghini feels infinitely more
special than the RA but this feels a bit
more solid now this being the v10 plus
we've got a carbon fiber wing on the
back as standard they say it's to
generate lots and lots of down floors I
don't think that's true I just think
it's so people who have bought these you
can identify other people with the same
amount of money and the people with the
normal v10 with a retractable little
spoilery thing well they'll just look
down on them which is a bit of a shame
because I'm told the base r8 is pretty
amazing now here's the rub the r8 in the
hurricane that shares some of its bits
with are becoming something of an oddity
while neither have a manual both have
mid-mounted naturally aspirated v10
engines it's just gone turbocharged it's
got its California t4 turbo and 488 GTB
the new 911 that's gone by turbo and the
Merc AMG GT has two turbos onboard as
well the cars that are coming out are
changing our roads are evolving much to
the charr grin of purists who
unfortunately have much to say but
welcomed by very little and don't worry
that's not just the pop at you I mean
one of them look at how much has changed
since the rose-tinted good old days of
for example the Ferrari 355 auto gear
boxes aren't CAC anymore in fact they're
faster of the man big engines don't have
to be ruinous the v10 in this r8 has a
cylinder shut off system so when you're
cruising only five cylinders are used so
that means in theory you can get a
little over 30 mpg in this and do more
than 200 miles an hour that sounds quite
good I
she actually works that way
but still disco has left me thinking
what's left for the naturally aspirated
engine I mean Aston Martin's gonna stick
with me 12 for as long as humanly
possible but then that just leaves the
r8 and the hurricane and their runs
going to be won best part of a decade
and then they'll be replaced and then I
suppose whoa what do we get big boost e
power and more mpg for all that's no bad
thing
in reality it's better for the
environment and all that it also means
there's more oil for longer but is this
one of the last guardians of the
naturally aspirated supercar Castle I
fear it may be and what a thing to go
out with a screaming v10 with more power
and performance than you really know
what to do with and the car that not
only looks good
but more importantly feels good can my
brief time with it the old r8 was good
but the new ones better
