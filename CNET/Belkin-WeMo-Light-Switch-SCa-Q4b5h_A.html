is the Belkin Wemo light switch this
light switch joins belkin's line of home
automation products designed to make
your life so much easier it connects to
your Wi-Fi so it's really easy to hook
up and you can then control everything
remotely from your smartphone or tablet
let's talk a little bit about
installation and safety Belkin has a
great video on their website that I'll
link to in the review below but it'll
really take you through everything you
need to get this thing installed the one
thing that you may not have that could
be a problem is the neutral wire it's
the white wire and you're gonna have to
try a different switch if you don't have
that if you've never worked with
electrical wiring before this will be a
bit of a challenge there are a lot of
wires and they're all coloured and you
don't really know what's what so you
really should work with a friend who's
done it before or at least have a
voltage tester handy to make sure that
you don't electrocute yourself this
light switch won't work on a dimmer
setting so if you want to change the
level of lighting you're gonna have to
find something else it also won't work
if you have a couple different switches
on a single plate so that's another
problem that some people have with it
and another thing this light switch is
only available in white right now but if
you want to you can replace the plate
with one that you already have so if you
have a certain designer one or something
you want to do then you can exchange
this part this part will remain the same
but you can make this a different color
also using Lemos app is so easy you just
turn it on and off and you can set it
just like you set an alarm on your smart
phone you can also schedule rules which
is really really easy and it's so much
better than using those old clunky
plug-ins that you have the dial and have
to set everything just so this just lets
you scroll through you can select a time
so if you wanted your porch light to
come on at 6:00 p.m. for you to come
home it'll be there on waiting for you
or if you're going out of town and you
really want to set certain lights to
come on and off to deter theft or
burglaries or whatever
then you're good to go another thing we
really love about this is that it works
with if this than that
that's an app that allows you to really
customize your experience so I actually
had it send me tweets and emails and
text messages when I wanted to see that
the light was on so the light switch is
on boom I get a text it's kind of cool I
don't know why I would need to get a
text but if you want to it's there this
light switch is $49.99
so each switch is about 50 bucks and
it's great if you like to do presets but
don't want to work with one of those
old-fashioned dials otherwise it's kind
of a novelty you know it's kind of cool
that I can turn my light on and off from
anywhere but unless I have a really
specific use for it I don't think I
don't think I would really need this for
