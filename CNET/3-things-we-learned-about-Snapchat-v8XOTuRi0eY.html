billion dollar loss in its first
earnings report here are three things we
learned about snapchats parent company
snapchat vs. Facebook is like dog vs.
cat
although the app was the first to have
those puppy dog ears
Facebook's being copycatting a lot of
snapchats features ever since just take
a look at Instagram stories Facebook
stories and the Facebook camera with all
those face filters the imitation game is
hurting snapchat while daily active
users total 166 million Instagram
stories which was released in August
last year skyrocketed to 200 million one
investor on the call asked the CEO if he
was scared of Facebook Spiegel laughed
it off and said quote at the end of the
day just because Yahoo has a search box
it doesn't mean they're Google in quote
way to throw some shade speaking of
shades those spectacles are not so
spectacular for the company's bottom
line snap sold 12.5 million dollars
worth of the sunglasses with a camera
over two quarters if you do the math
that's only ninety six thousand units
given that they're sold for 130 dollars
each despite all the hype long lines at
the snap-loc vending machines and
exorbitant resale prices on ebay snap
still couldn't sell that many units and
we found out that snapchatters sent
three billion snaps every day but only
five million snaps overall have been
posted from spectacles so that's less
than 0.1% in its initial SEC filing the
company said developing for Android
wasn't a priority because most of its
users run iOS but most of the world's
phones run Android Spiegel acknowledged
that they've had a tough time with the
operating system
and it's quote still showing up in the
numbers the company is working on an
improved Android experience now bear in
mind that this was snaps first earning
report so it's still early days for the
company but as for that share price well
let's just say investors weren't rushing
to snap up any more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
