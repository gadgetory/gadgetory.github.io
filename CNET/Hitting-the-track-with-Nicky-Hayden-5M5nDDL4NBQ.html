fastest men on two wheels wearing the
number 69 the Kentucky kid is won
championships at nearly every level on
the way up
including the pinnacle of the sport
MotoGP this year he's moving on to World
Superbike where he's going to be racing
a production-based Honda cbr1000rr atern
to the beginning of his career where he
was racing real bikes real fast to take
a look at some of the iconic motorcycles
that have defined his career American
Honda's opened the door to their private
collection we've booked a little track
time with mr Hayden himself all right
we've got Nicky Hayden on the pit wall
and a couple of pretty good-looking
bikes back there behind us now you're
telling me earlier that's the hunt RC 45
you were riding that in high school is
that right yeah first ever super bike I
ever ridden I remember riding that for
the first time at Willow Springs
remember rolling out onto the track and
just feeling the power and how smooth it
went through the gear so a few few
things have changed since then but that
was a great experience for me this is a
1994 Honda RC 45 also known as the rvf
750 750 is the displacement of the
engine a 750 cc V for this bike was
meant to go racing and indeed Honda only
ever sold 200 of the things just enough
to qualify for production-based
Superbike competitions only 50 RC 45s
came to the US and this is one of them a
bike that spends most of his time locked
away in the American Honda Museum a bike
like this would make for Niki Hayden's
first entry into professional Superbike
racing yeah was a good period for me it
was my first year with Honda and that
was a good opportunity one American the
600 Super Sport title that year on 600
and was the beginning of something
special for me as sue looks fantastic I
love the twin headlights I think that is
such an iconic look I kind of miss it to
be honest with you
within the domestic AMA series it's not
unusual for riders to race in both the
Superbike and the slightly slower super
sports series meaning multiple races per
weekend on a CBR 600 Nicky Hayden won
his first AMA championship in 1999 and
this is the bike he rode in 2000 which
still bears his number 1 championship
winning plate Nicky would continue
racing in AMA through the new millennium
and this would be his new Superbike this
is a production version of Nicky's RC 51
a 999 CC v-twin bigger and more powerful
than RC 45 it replaced on a bike very
much like this one he would win the 2002
AMA Superbike Championship and be
propelled onto the international stage
with a MotoGP ride starting in 2003
Nikki would spend most of his MotoGP
career riding some variation of this
bike a honda rc211v a prototype machine
is custom-built for racing from the
ground up and is powered by 990 CC v5
the bike weighs just 326 pounds that's
100 less and a road-going Superbike it
makes somewhere around 250 horsepower
it's quite a ride a ride that would
carry Niki to his MotoGP championship in
2006
yeah did 13 years in MotoGP you know got
the title I really wanted and had a lot
of obstacles every buddy wants yeah some
good days very thankful for the
opportunity was an amazing experience to
ride those bikes on those tracks in
front of those crowds and you know I got
now an opportunity to move to World
Superbike I'm 34 now and I'm very happy
to keep racing and get this opportunity
and yeah it's you know after a while I
think a change is good and to be back
with this team and everything I got I
got a good fresh start so looking
forward to try to have some fun I always
have been a fan of super bikes ultimate
goal would be to try to win the World
Superbike Championship with Honda as
well and be the first rider to ever have
both grounds as Niki moves on to World
Superbike racing he'll be riding a
machine much like this it's a box fresh
cbr1000rr showing two decades worth of
advancement over that earlier RC 45
despite only having a 250 cc advantage
over that older bike who makes around
175 horsepower that's nearly twice as
much as an early 90s super low but it
also adds modern suspension and lots of
other niceties you didn't get back in
the 90s but you can't deny the RC 45 had
a better paint job and those twin
headlights are nothing short of iconic
so we got 20 years worth of Superbike
progress sitting behind us obviously a
lot of change between the two v4 versus
an inline 4 a lot more horsepower to
move back I think silly 500 horsepower
something like that how did won't tell
us for sure but I think it's something
like that what do you think is a big
change other than the engine between
these two suspension is a setup well I
mean just sitting on it you already feel
the position is more racy a little bit
more like full race bike where that one
kind of feels like a street bike where
that one feel I mean the ride position
is very similar to my CBR on the new
book yeah on the new one I would say
that and the weight you know is a big
thing and how narrow it is but it's cool
to see I mean you know you can just sit
there and step back and see how far the
technologies came and all the little
refinements climbing on the back of a
bike like this especially after watching
some
nici flying around the track you really
appreciate just how good these guys are
it's a bike that wants to throw its
front wheel in the sky with every twist
of the throttle and spin the rear tire
up coming out of every turn getting the
most out of the bike like this takes
incredible skill and competence
what's the difference between that guy
and the bike that you're gonna be racing
on the season well I mean my bike that's
the base
you know they as you say they take a
production bike and a lot of the rules
have to stay the same obviously with the
frames and different things but they can
modify obviously the suspension can be
modified but you know you can't change a
lot of stuff yeah the engine can be
hopped up with different nothing believe
it's Pistons and different things and
electronics you know we can work a lot
with those and adjustment but the bike
must be as you say production and any
part we use paint the prototype you have
to be able to PI buy it and there's even
a price cap on it so keeps it fair for
some of the teams that they can't go out
and buy it you know $200,000 suspension
setting that you know nobody else in the
paddock can afford so I kind of like
that part of it you know in MotoGP in
the last year's the difference between
the factories and the supportive teams
got so big that was took a little fun
out of it
so in Superbike they're closing that gap
well they keep a great privilege hanging
out with you the track I wish you the
best of luck
this year I hope you have a lot of great
success and I hope you have a lot of fun
out there other tracks all right well
thanks for having me out here and yeah
I'm looking forward to a new season you
know like I say very fortunately to keep
going on right now you know still like
racing I still have a lot of support
especially here in America and yeah
let's go have some fun in a lot of ways
World Superbikes is a pure form of
motorsport it's certainly a lot closer
the bikes that you and I can buy anyway
and if Nikki plays his cards right this
season he could become the first man to
win both the MotoGP and the World
Superbike championships I for one
wouldn't bet against him
