Google watch needs to be a success a
report says Google is working with LG to
introduce a couple of new Android wear
watches for the sake of clarity I'm just
gonna call these things Google watches
or just Google watch also number one is
obviously awesome battery life so we're
not going to include that on this list
let's get to it
and number five LTE having the Google
watch function as a standalone device
that is not reliant on a phone what set
apart this watch from Apple there are
other Android wear watches with LTE
which is a good thing Google would be
foolish to leave out LTE and number four
fitness features a Google watch would
need to appeal to lots of different
kinds of people crammed in Fitness
features like GPS and a heart rate
sensor for fitness tracking these
features could get people who want some
casual tracking onboard with Google and
number three assistant the good one
Google assistant is built into developer
felt of Android wear 2.0 that's the
operating system that these Google
watches should run however there are
different versions of Google assistant
the Google home version is currently
dumber than the pixel version if Google
is giving its blessing to a watch it
should function much more like the pixel
phone and number two waterproofing this
one is a no-brainer though more
occasions you can wear a watch the
better enough set at number one an
awesome design LG sit down if you want
human beings to wear your watch please
design a watch that people actually want
to be seen with Google's pixel phone is
a dull uninspired design whatever a
Google watch looks like it should be a
design that is immediately identifiable
as a Google watch make it happen
