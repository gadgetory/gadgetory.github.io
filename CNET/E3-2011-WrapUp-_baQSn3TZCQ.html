we're all eyes are fixed on the video
game world we've got hot hardware
announcements from Nintendo and Sony
we've got a lot of booth babes and you
always see a few curious suspect things
here but you know what it's all about
the games there front and center so
let's check out the floor in my hands I
have the new controller that's part of
the entire we use system now when you
look at this right of the bat this is
unlike any controller we've seen some of
the games for example shield post we're
going to show you offers you an
additional window into the world so you
can move it around and give you
different views within the game that
you're playing another cool example of
how this can be used in different ways
is with chase me we can kind of see a
bird's-eye view of a map while other
people see a completely different
experience with what they're playing be
coming out sometime in 2012 but there
you have it really a nice feeling a nice
hold and free sleek design alright guys
we're inside of Microsoft's booth in
their connect pod and this is your 24
connect so we're looking at a lot of new
software titles and apps and functions
one of the features here is inside
connect fun labs I'm going to be able to
make an avatar of what you see here and
connect me so let's just see how good
this thing is all right
haha see all this you see all that up
there check it out the Bruce Lee face
right there right so you can see this

big nose there's a big nose the hair
looking for the blondes right but up

thing that's big here are the girls 83

don't know what it's about it's crazy oh
it's so glorious all the Sam feels so
good oh my gosh diamond in the rough a
beautiful looking lady in a line waiting
for a game sometimes gamer guys are a
little socially awkward sometimes so if
you had a tip for like a guy of really
like how to get a gamer girls attention
well what do you think don't be scared
of women in my hand we have Sony's
PlayStation Vita now the first thing
you're going to notice right off the bat
this gorgeous 5-inch OLED display also
the power of the graphics in this
handheld unlike anything we've seen
before they really touted that it was on
or almost on the level of ps3 graphics
I'm going to tell you when I look at
this it's made me a believer now this
screen on the front is a touchscreen it
also has a touch panel on the back side
that is incorporated in the gameplay for
a variety of titles one of the most
anticipated handled that I can remember
and it feels really light and I can't
wait to get my hands on this more a
