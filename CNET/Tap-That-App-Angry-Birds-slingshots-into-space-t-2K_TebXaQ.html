jason parker and this is the show we
talk about the hottest apps in the
mobile space just about everyone who has
a smartphone knows about Rovio's Angry
Birds the game where you slingshot birds
to destroy structures and try to take
out the mean old pigs the game has
enjoyed huge success at the iTunes App
Store sitting in the top 10 of the paid
apps category ever since its launch in
two thousand nine today rovio released
Angry Birds Space a game that takes the
same winning concept but adds
interesting twists with gravity fields
asteroids and new birds to experiment
with in an entirely outer space
environment the game starts you off easy
so you can get used to the new concept
of gravity fields now when you fire a
bird towards a planet or asteroid the
bird will go into orbit around the
object within the gravity field
sometimes giving you several chances to
hit your targets as you progress through
the game the levels get significantly
more difficult with multiple gravity
fields asteroids that block your path
and other interesting objects and
obstacles that require some thought
before you fling your bird there are 60
levels to play through and some will
definitely have you hitting the reset
button numerous times to get that
perfect shot fortunately on particularly
difficult levels you have the option to
use the new space eagle the ultra
powerful eagle in the original angry
birds game is pretty much meant you
could beat any level but this new space
eagle creates a black hole once you tap
the screen and has the explosive power
to take out a large area of the level
it's still possible to miss some pigs
though depending on where you place the
space eagle just like the original Angry
Birds you can get up to 3 stars based on
how efficiently you can take out all the
pigs so it's still important to try to
get them all in one shot another new
addition comes in the form of bonus
levels that are nod to classic video
games hitting a randomly placed hidden
golden egg steroid causes a wormhole
that sends you to a special level the
level I encountered seemed to resemble
classic super mario games once cleared
you'll take the wormhole right back to
where you left off it's important to
note that unlike spin-offs angry birds
rio and angry birds seasons well fun
we're mostly about putting a new theme
in some extra levels on the original
angry birds space is a completely
new game with new birds new levels to
figure out and some secret levels you
can warp 2 it's easy to recommend
everyone tap this app immediately angry
birds space goes for 99 cents for the
phone versions on both iOS and Android
and 299 for the HD version on both as
well that's it for today's show we have
any suggestions you would like me to try
send them to my Twitter account at Jay
