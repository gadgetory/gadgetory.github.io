help you control your tablet or phone
usually caused somewhere from 10 to 30
bucks but that's way too expensive when
you can make it on your own with just a
few supplies around your house or in the
office I'm Sharon Vaknin for cnet.com
and today I'll show you how to make the
2-minute stylus we've shown you how to
do this before with a sponge a paper
clip and a pen but here's an even easier
way to do it all you need to make your
stylus is a pen a q-tip scissors some
tape and aluminum foil let's get started
first remove the ink from the pen now
take a q-tip and cut it in half I'm
going to cut this one at a slant because
the mouth of this pen is a little small
so go ahead and insert it into the mouth
of the pen and take a small piece of
tape to secure it just wrap the tape
around the q-tip and the mouth of the
pen now take a small piece of aluminum
foil I'm just going to cut out a square
or rectangle and wrap that around the
q-tip and the neck of the pen make sure
it's secure so that the foil is pretty
tight around the q-tip take another
piece of tape and secure the foil to the
pen make sure the foil is touching the
cotton of the q-tip because in order for
this to work the static electricity from
your finger it needs to go through the
foil and onto the q-tip then onto the
screen of your phone or tablet now with
that in place your stylus is almost done
I'm going to put it back together so
I'll take the top of the pen
here it and the last thing you need to
do is add a drop of water to the q-tip
that's what keeps it conductive so with
your finger just add a drop of water so
that the entire q-tip is just a little
moist you don't want it to be dripping
what with that set you can start using
your stylus just be sure that your
finger is always touching the foil
otherwise it won't work so you can tap
icons open apps surf the web it's not
really great for typing but it is really
awesome for drawing apps like my
favorite draw something if the stylus
stops working all you have to do is
apply a little bit more water and you're
good to go
this isn't the fanciest of styluses but
it'll get the job done once you make
your stylus tweet me a picture of it on
