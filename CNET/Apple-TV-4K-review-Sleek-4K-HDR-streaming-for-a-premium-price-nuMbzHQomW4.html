the outside it looks exactly like the
older non 4k version released a couple
of years ago but there's one big
difference only this one can stream the
highest quality video available today
let's take a look the first thing to
know about the Apple TV 4k is it only
delivers that top quality video to
compatible TVs if you have a 4k TV
especially one with high dynamic range
aka HDR you're set this little box and
also stream in Dolby vision another HDR
format used by some TVs as well as
Netflix Amazon and others I tested it
with a bunch of 4k HDR video on a
variety of televisions including this
excellent LG OLED the Apple TV's
performance was top-notch
but as with any other 4k HDR source
don't expect miracles the difference
between 4k and lower resolution video is
often tough to spot HDR provides a more
visible improvement boosting highlights
for additional pop and improving color
but its impact varies different movies
and TV shows take more advantage of HDR
than others and even the best won't give
you the same boost you saw and going
from standard def to high def all those
years ago in an unusual move the new
Apple TV 4k also converts everything to
4k and HDR from the menus to games to
youtube videos it doesn't improve their
image quality much but it does mean you
might get indicators from your TV that's
receiving HDR or gold vision content
even when it's not for an Apple product
I think that's unnecessarily confusing
and hopefully it gets fixed one real
improvement compared to the non 4k Apple
TV is this little raised white ring on
the remote which allowed me to easily
tell which end was up and locate the
crucial Menu key by feel the remote
sleek touchpad is still one of my
favorites and make zipping around
responsive menus quick and a lot more
fun some dumb buttons talking into the
remote also invoke Siri on Apple TV she
still doesn't talk back as she does in
your phone but you can make finding for
cake hunting easier just ask show me TV
shows in 4k the results draw heavily
from iTunes and Netflix but that's
changing soon Amazon with its large or K
HDR library be coming before the end of
the year in the meantime iTunes as a
solid selection of 4k HDR stuff if you
bought a TV show or movie there it will
be automatically converted to 4k when
the iTunes version is available iTunes
also has lower prices than competitors
like Vudu and Google Play for a lot of
its 4k knee
movies they can get a very good choice
for renting or buying new releases in
the highest quality format the new Apple
TV 4k has a faster processor than the
original and in practice both seem
equally zippy loading apps images and
videos with aplomb but the price
difference is just 30 bucks so I
recommend getting the 4k version even if
you don't yet on a 4k TV that way you'll
be ready for tomorrow the Apple TV 4k
costs a lot more than competing 4k
streamers from Amazon and Roku
but it's polished interface excellent
romona voice control and of course its
massive selection of apps and games
could make it worth the difference for
you even if you're not already a heavy
