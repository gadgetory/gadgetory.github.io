actor nerds these days everyone is
becoming one because technology is
everywhere but what tools should any
self-respecting nerd own well I
contacted a familiar face of top five
fans to collaborate on this list that's
right
I contacted maker extraordinaire Donald
Bell and we've figured out what should
be in your nerd toolbox number five a
coax cable kit there's a chance you've
got a cable modem in the house because
you like internet you might even have a
cable TV because you like watching lots
of lots of television maybe you have an
over-the-air antenna well you should
have a coax cable kit complete with coax
cable a cable cutter compression
connectors and a compression connector
tool why did you have this fit in the
case you want to move your cable modem
or you can move an antenna should be
able to make your own coax cable I got a
kit from a big box hardware store and
it's invaluable number four is a
soldering iron a typical nerdy tool
right when do you ever need these things
when you want to solder something of
course a long time ago I went hack a
microphone jack into a pretty cheap HD
camcorder then I would solder to mess
around with Arduino recently I've been
meeting to solder the wires on the front
door of my apartment building because
some of Yahoo keeps messing with them if
you're looking for a good iron check out
weller number three a multimeter
multimeters aren't valuable when you
want to avoid getting shocked by
electricity where you want to check if
your circuits on a breadboard are all in
working order upset a quick honorable
mention to the IR temperature guns
Donald Bell says honestly I don't know
why I have one of these but it seems
nerdy and a kicks butt number two an
Ethernet kit I feel like my ipod stuck
on replayed at this point if you're a
human being you should have an Ethernet
crimper and kit wireless networking is
great but a wired network is excellent
you got an Apple TV or an Xbox one or
whatever wiring them up will ensure
great speeds making
Ethernet cables also pretty
straightforward don't be afraid and the
number one tool any nerd or actually
regular human being for that precision
screwdrivers this one's a no-brainer
you've got to have a good set of
precision screwdrivers Donald Bell says
you should opt for screwdrivers with
good chunky handles instead of those
little thin metal versions I have
survived without the chunky handles but
it's a great point when you have to get
some leverage to take apart a stubborn
gadget on top of that if you're taking
apart Apple things get a pentalobe
screwdriver if you have no idea what
that is Apple uses pentalobe screws in
many of its products not a standard
Phillips or slotted screw that means you
need a special screwdriver
it's a pentalobe screwdriver what other
tools should we have included in this
top five if you've got ideas let me know
i'm at is on twitter for more top fives
