Los Angeles Auto Show foreseen it and
behind me is the 2017 Evoque convertible
that's right then Nissan cross Cabriolet
is buried in the grave and Range Rover
has decided to give us their take on the
convertible SUV a mere 18 seconds
separates you from the sunshine and that
truck can be operated at speeds of up to
29 miles an hour
a quick rainstorm will bring that top
down in 21 seconds it does add 150
pounds to the evokes already hefty
weight and it will reduce your trunk
space to 18 point 9 cubic feet of space
visually the Evoque convertible is the
same as the hardtop over there are a few
changes the doors are now frameless i've
got an integrated brake light into the
spoiler and to provide rollover
protection to aluminum bars will pop up
behind the rear seat of this Range Rover
is the first to use the in-control touch
pro infotainment interface now that has
a 10.2 inch screen it does have a route
planning guide which takes into account
public transportation as well as a
commute mode which will learn your daily
commute and then offer you suggestions
based on historical traffic data as well
as real-time traffic data make no mind
the via vogue is a very capable off-road
I've got very good approach departure
and break over angles and I do have a
terrain select system it's been designed
to wade up to 19 point 7 inches of water
and it can climb hills of up to 45
degrees although with these continental
all season tires on it I might take that
down just a little bit really at one
engine here in the United States it's a
2 liter 4-cylinder which is good for 240
horsepower of course if you live in
Europe you do get a diesel option the
2017 Evoque convertible will be
available for just around $50,000 in
winter of next year
