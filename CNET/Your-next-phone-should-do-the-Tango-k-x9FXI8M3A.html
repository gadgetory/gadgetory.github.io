out why you would care tango is a
technology platform developed by google
now showing up in smartphones that
allows the phone to do more than just
see with a camera which they've had for
years to now sense the physical world
around it that means it can detect the
shape of an object the dimensions are
size of that object and the relationship
in space between objects in the world
around you what it's good for in the
real world is just being hammered out
because the first smartphone to have
this technology is now on the markets
from Lenovo it's called the fab pro 2
it's a niche device it's not even
posited by them as being their main line
flagship phone but it's fascinating in
terms of what it could do in the future
some of the earliest apps you'll find on
it allow it to measure things without
you being at the object non-contact
measurement as well as spaces between
other items it can do augmented reality
to visualize let's say new furnishings
in a room you're standing in a our
gaming becomes very realistic when the
augmentation of the reality is the
reality you're actually standing in
right now and of course it can place
dinosaurs on specific spots in the room
a trick that seemingly every AR device
has to do for some reason and then
there's a whole lot of collaborative or
crowd-sourced benefits of having these
devices out there for all of us who have
a phone that does this it can be mapping
shared public spaces to be used by other
people whether it's a mall a stadium a
large office building you can also see
where retailers get excited about this
to try and bring a large unfamiliar
store to life to a person who maybe has
never been there or not been there since
the layout change the flow changed the
placement of products changed and this
could be an exceptional way to make that
clear the minute you walk in the door
now since Lenovo is fab pro 2 arrived
it's been followed by asus zenfone which
also has the tango spatial technology
but is also certified to work with
Google's daydream head mount to create a
substantial VR device it's an
interesting crossover another note about
both these phones it is doing augmented
reality but it's not using glasses I
believe that gives it a very good leg up
we've continued to see consumer
resistance to augmented and virtual
reality once you get down to the head
gear and having to wear something on
your face being able to message the
AR is possible through a handheld screen
of a device you already own I think is
an important benefit know what's next at
