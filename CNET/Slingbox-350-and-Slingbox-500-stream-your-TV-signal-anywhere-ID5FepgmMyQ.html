cnet.com and I'm here with the two news
sling box models
there's the sling box 500 which lists
for $300 and the sling box 350 which
lists for $179 they look very different
the sling box 350 looks like it could
almost be related to the jawbone jam box
while the 500 has kind of this little
wave design in case you don't know what
sling box does it allows you to stream
video from a video source such as a
cable box or a satellite box or any
video source and stream that remotely to
a tablet smartphone laptop
of course how well these stream depends
on your internet connection at the
source as well as where you're streaming
from but these do work very well as long
as you have a decent internet connection
these do stream 1080p signals the major
difference between the two boxes is that
the higher-end 500 has built-in Wi-Fi it
also has an HDMI pass-through port that
allows you to connect this to your cable
or satellite box via HDMI one of the
problems however is those boxes often
output a signal that is copy-protected
which prevents you from actually seeing
the video so Slingbox recommends that
you also connect this via component
video because the 500 does have that
HDMI out and can do the sling projector
it does come with a remote that allows
you to control that feature and to
control the on-screen menus both these
boxes have built-in IR blasters so if
you set them on top of your cable box
they should change the channels remotely
so the big question is which box should
you get and is it worth it to step up to
the 500 model I would say for some
people it won't be we are recommending
300 does everything that the fiber does
however the one scenario where I think
it'd be very important to step up to the
500 is if you do need that Wi-Fi
connection one other small thing worth
mentioning there is a USB port on the
back of both of these devices for the
moment anyway Slingbox hasn't said what
that you
speed port is going to be used for but
it is reserved for future features in
closing
we've been big fans of Slingbox since
the beginning and both these boxes take
it up a notch particularly with the
built-in Wi-Fi on the Slingbox 500
they're both good devices and they both
worked well in our test those are the
Slingbox
500 and the Slingbox 350 I'm David Carr
