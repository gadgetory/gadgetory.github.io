cnet.com and I'm here with the SOL
Republic master tracks headphones this
is the successor to the tracks and
tracks HD headphones which soul Republic
did a great job marketing and
popularizing if you remember those are
the headphones that Michael Phelps or
during the Olympics these are the new
step-up model these are more of a over
the year than on your model and I
personally think they're more
comfortable than the original tracks
which had an on-air design of these guys
have nicely padded ear cups they also
have the same headband which you can
bend all different which ways and the
company says is virtually indestructible
you can't swap out that headband for
different colors they do cost around $30
for the headband but you can't customize
the look of these headphones and the
earpieces themselves which company calls
sound engines are removable as is the
cord it does have a split core design I
personally do like a single core design
but this has a split core design that
core does have an inline remote and
microphone that's geared towards Apple
iOS devices and the headphones do come
with a simple carrying pouch as far as
the sound goes the SOL Republic
headphones at least the tracks were
known for their big heavy bass these
guys are a little bit more well balanced
I like the sound better what's
interesting about them is that they
actually sound better when you play them
loud but when we ask the company about
it they did say that they are designed
to play louder and sound better at
higher volumes so we weren't mistaken
about that now a lot of you probably
asking are these worth $199 that's a
hard question to answer for a lot of
people who do like the SOL Republic
brand they will be worth $199 but there
are certainly other headphones that cost
the same or less that do sound better
than these headphones like the audio
technica ath m50 for example but these
are really a lifestyle brand of
headphone they're designed to be worn
kind of wherever you are at all times so
if you want that type of headphone
that's really kind of almost a fashion
accessory then that's what Sol Republic
is going for with the master tracks
I'm David Carr noise and those are solar
public master tracks headphones thanks
