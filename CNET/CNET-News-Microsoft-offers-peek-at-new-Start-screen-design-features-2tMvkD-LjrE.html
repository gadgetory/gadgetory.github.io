windows 10 for the PC and I'm going to
begin on the Start menu I want to show
you some of the work we've been doing to
continue to tweak the design and improve
the visuals and the interaction so
you'll see what I've got here we think
is pretty close to what we expect to
have when we're done although of course
we're going to continue to take feedback
from our insiders you'll notice there's
new beautiful live tile animations that
help draw people's attention to the apps
and the app data for the things that
they've pinned um you'll notice we've
cleaned the layout up a bit for those of
you insiders who kind of surprised us
with your enthusiasm for windows 7s
arrow glass you'll notice the
translucency here is the blur effect
that you saw in Windows 7 so we're
trying to bring some of that feel back
we've got the most used apps here we're
putting file explorer settings power all
apps at the bottom we're bringing jump
lists back in so you can see here's file
explorer with jump lists and this will
work for other apps as well thank you
but the thing I want to sort of focus on
a little bit is this space right here
where in this case I haven't installed
an app for a little while so the system
is going to give us a smart suggestion
for an app in the store that is going to
be one that's suitable for me as i'm
using my pc on the client we know which
apps you're launching and which apps
you're installing and so we're able to
communicate with the store and bring
down suggestions that are personalized
for you to help users learn about great
new apps that are available for them to
try out on their PC and as time goes by
we reuse that space in a smart way to
help script the users discovery of apps
first but then their engagement later so
if I've installed an app as you see here
for a little while that space becomes
the recently installed app the user can
find the app they can revisit it and if
they use it enough it'll move its way up
into the most used section automatically
and of course at any time the user can
drag from left to right to take any of
those apps and pin them as full live
tiles so think of this as the users
lifecycle of discovery and engagement
and
use which we're trying to script right
into the start menu</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
