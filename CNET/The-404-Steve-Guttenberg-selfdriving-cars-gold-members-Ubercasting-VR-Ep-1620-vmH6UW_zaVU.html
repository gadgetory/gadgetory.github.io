you're doing this so wait move up to the
microphone it's like they're they're um
they're prematurely old or something in
there they're out of it they're just
they're just distracted it's you think
it's not fully present yeah they're
they're zombies I mean it's a problem
you know it's a problem it's freaky and
it's only gonna get worse that's that's
gonna get way worse with uh with the VR
stuff but I don't think it doesn't make
sense that people would walk around New
York with a VR head like headset well no
but with that you wouldn't have google
club were called version google glass
you said it man um but what about their
phones that people do that as they're
walking is that happening you mean their
watches where they want to watch us yeah
people they don't stare their watches
like they stare at their phone right you
just a watch is only going to give you
very minimal service level information
oh right just the time the date I'm not
missing out right you don't wear a watch
either I don't wear a while and you have
a flip phone I don't wear a ring either
that's a half a foot how's your wife
feel about that you guys dig mentioned
it recently yeah what she said I've been
together 35 years and she did say
something about not very memory so have
you ever wondering I did when I first
got married and then what was the day
that you took the ring off and your
light was it a special day really likes
you done with this it was uh it was it
was you know august 3rd 1980 another but
but what but you don't remember the
circumstances like I just said I don't
lie cuz I kept taking it off and like
putting it on the you know in the
bathroom on the sink cuz i said i guess
i just don't like wearing rings you know
i don't like wearing watches i don't
like wearing rings I kept putting in
there and so he's a conscious decision
that I just said you know I'm not gonna
just not gonna wear it but it was a
conscious decision I'm about there was a
decision you made to say hey I'm just
not gonna wear this here is the deep
dark secret ya don't know where the ring
is is so so if she ever says you know
you should just put on the ring for this
thin asian battle
a bad day should just buy like a 12 pack
or something yeah get-get yourself yeah
she does a variety pack I know what the
ring works like it but you just don't
know it's okay just don't know where it
is not so it's safe whatever it ever
wherever it is it's very safe going back
to the phone thing though what has you
upset about I mean I I can I walk in I
delicately fast and they're always in
the way cuz they're you're walking like
zombies no they're not they're not stare
they don't stay on one side either
because it kind of just waddle they were
I don't and you're like you're trying to
get around them and I just kind of still
you can tell either that they're looking
on the phone your texting right or if
they're messing around with music music
she's usually much faster i sampled yeah
yeah it's a it's a problem it's a huge
problem yeah I mean you know I don't
after I III I was just out there coming
back and seeing all the VR stuff mm-hmm
it makes those problems seem real small
because I think we're headed for a very
different way of life in the next 20
years anything good I mean if you like
escaping the I know either shackles our
reality we have heinous theme today okay
good to know so when we have the
streaming when we have the strap on for
the games yeah i'll give you a call and
up you know i don't want to be involved
with that no you know for watching porn
and stuff with the attachments yeah
that'll be good are you gonna be able to
handle that yeah chorus alright want
that well i just i guess i guess this is
the start of the show because where else
can you don't wear these enough you
don't have to but a good podcast guest
wears them so they know Jewish guilt
there's no no big Jewish it has to do
everything with being you know simplier
on my bed and podcast guest I don't wear
them well no it would just be your first
time not having worn them uh and they're
the reason people wear headphones when
they do podcasts so they can hear their
own level and know if and when they they
drop out that's why of course you're you
called yoga you could just tell me that
I could but it's much easier speak up
Dave speak up exactly who wants to hear
that
it's fine put a mark on it you're
looking well Oh God lower and more as
that's the okay god it's like it's
basically off okay i just went from 12
to like five o'clock for you you really
hear the sound coming out of like those
high frequency things i do you do yeah i
still hear that won't last yeah you say
that you gave me that hearing test when
i first met you and I stand I had the
hearing of like a nine-year-old good and
I can still hear weird buzzing
everywhere I go it's a curse it is it's
a curse it is the world is not sonically
appropriate for me no um so if you if
you want to know just what the hell's
going on this programs you've gotten
berg on the program is here how are you
sir I'm good thanks for being here love
it here I as akhtar how how was it hold
it down while I was gone it was a good
time bridgette was in and we were
talking about some really stupid stuff
well that's okay oh yeah it was
completely appropriate was stupid or
good it was a good was I talked about
the top of his red hamburger from from
Burger King Japan okay the bun is is as
red as Steve shirt and it's got a red
cheese on it and Bridget posited because
it's a color in nature it's not
disgusting I'm like you know what she's
right it didn't look as disgusting when
she explained that but why would a
completely red hamburger that to me
sounds disgusting well the burgers tell
self is still Brown yeah okay it's like
blood yeah we get it so yeah you could
listen to that spin like 90 minutes on a
red it was full-on idea down about 10
minutes Wow so whenever Steve comes down
he's always got like you know this is no
secrets got that chicken scratch little
list of stuff he wants to talk about
there's just no video right there's
there's your Foley artistry work for the
for the for the week I i get these
emails from him and he senses email let
me go he goes glow-in-the-dark condoms
is the subject yeah glow-in-the-dark on
it is indigo to spam immediately that
was not that was not lead though the
lead was the gold-plated penis the
gold-plated penis and what did you say
you're like no I'm starved
and the gold plated I can open the stuff
incognito because i don't want google
giving me suggestions on the phone later
on oh by the way you did look at gold
plated penis do you want more new
stories on this so i saw that from from
Steven I was like all right I'm loving
where friday so go so there's this this
17 year old man nazario conscious ooh
kinshasa gonzalez yeah he's a gang
member in LA where he was he's got a few
face tattoos if that helps ya three
books apart yeah and he got it into his
head he needed a gold-plated penis so
how do you do that you'd wonder like how
do you do that guess I want to have a
gold-plated penis well thanks to the
Internet and I guess you can figure it
out but anyway it first involves before
you get to put the gold on you have to
plate your penis with lead you do what
first led you first he played it with
LED played it yeah okay there's
electrodes involved so wait a second so
there's there's someone out there who
who's done the process he did it he's
he's God's got a gold leaf he killed him
it killed him yeah oh yeah I guess said
take the air out of there alone well I
mean he's a gang member i'm not saying
all gang where we should don't know
personally you know yeah it's a shame
yeah it is a shame it's a sheets but you
know I I actually achieved the same
effect with aluminum foil oh you
yourself yes you go colors and with him
for was that and I thought before or
after you saw the story after okay so
you wanted to see if you sick you know I
want to try the safeway you're like oh
this guy died yeah he did it the wrong
way he did it the wrong way I'm crafty
yeah I can figure out a way to do this
I'm like man why didn't you call me so
what nazario please a little aluminum
foil wrap it around the same effect it's
funny cuz you what it's like it's like
walking around with an Oscar strapped up
same thing wait you were walking around
where and were you wearing there was I'm
walking around you I was admiring I was
just admiring okay would your wife think
she wasn't around oh yeah what you
couldn't do this without there would be
too much laughing right and then she'd
be like wait a second where's where's
your wedding ring right
what's called its 0 be a matching set
yeah this is a weird one man i can
appreciate it do you recommend people do
this or not at all I'm said well I way
this guy the aluminum foil absolutely
it's definitely definitely a
conversation starter at least if you're
single I'm also think if you're married
it's just it's going to have the
opposite make noise with it seems very
uncomfortable like when I think of a
little aluminum foil I think of like a
weird sharpness yeah so how'd ya I don't
think it's for actual you know
intercourse or anything clearly just I
think it just has aesthetic value it
seems like the only reason you use tin
foil is to preserve right keep it fresh
you get fresh yeah I don't know man keep
that out of the interns I want to know
my under pleasure or something like that
I guess oh you're weird you're weird man
you're not weird I'm weird nazario did
it with led to star so it killed him
like right during the procedure either
the details are elude me I want to say
this didn't happen it did how do you
comes from it's all over the internet
website clear how could it be wrong the
hell's that I feel like pop that that
doesn't see no it was it was echoed
every and their core they're there
they're uh they're citing the world news
daily report let's just see you think
that's questionable I don't know that an
authority it's not CNN yeah I don't know
I don't know it's a wee nights on
tonight's news what do you have like
Wolf Blitzer come and breaking into yeah
yeah a golden penis he just talks about
killing a man yeah I don't know we're
kid kid but you know when you're when
you start to worry about the youth then
these kids I don't know their name in in
England who have come up with um condoms
that glow in the dark but not just any
old glow they glow in response to STDs
oh that's that's embarrassing so it
could be like you know pink for syphilis
oh it are and you could make your own
color-coded disease chart at home i
right yeah but they're actually going to
sell this thing it's called and the
tight and the nate has a product name so
you know the name no of these condoms
this very special come
they're called the UM st i ey e all
right here it's got an eye yeah I get it
here's the deal right here's my magic
car here's why this is stupid though oh
because when you've got the condom on
right it's a little too late to find out
about this stuff now low no no no no I
get it the condom is gonna actually
protect you for next time for right and
what if you're young you want to take
off the these these kids that did
this or 14 years old what yeah they're
thinking ahead or their early you know
so if so if so the condom tells me my
partner has syphilis yes right that kind
of breaks out in the afternoon away in
the afterglow you say you're like hold
on hold on look at the color Adams
glowing pink right now right I think you
and I maybe should lose each other
numbers right oh no no you're doing the
gentlemanly thing right you're saying
work out as you can tell but I don't
know no I think you're too fast I think
you got it say you know let's let's have
a timeout and reconvene after you take
care of it it's green for chlamydia
yellow for herpes purple for HPV and
blue for syphilis so we come there you
go that's your code you gotta keep what
if all the colors like it's a come with
like a wrist bands you know which one
you're getting under my wife because you
Apple watch any whopper one smart condom
and then Apple watch turns pink and
after you take it out you can put back
your loom and foil it's perfect crazy I
like it though it's a good story it is a
good story is it you know kind of
counter balances the goal penis thing
yeah for sure cuz when that kids dead
but these two 13 or 14 year-old Zuri
they're off the fame and fortune that's
the last penis story though right um
ataque check your notes I think that's
the last one you have a lot of stuff
today I actually brought some self to
the table as well I know I wanted to get
to let's do it so the first thing I
wanted to talk about is like some uber
stuff and some robotic self-driving car
on my list yeah alright great
synchronicity you can chime in ok so uh
two things one there's a big
story um that's really I guess it's more
like a non-story that came out earlier
today I think or maybe late last night
about two self-driving cards and almost
collided you heard about that this guy
was like a delphi car at Delfy or Delphi
Delphi Delphi car and a Google car out
west they almost collided and like
that's the story was any human or any
human so the the way in which the
self-driving cars have been approved to
operate on public roads is along with
the prerequisite that there's a human
driver behind the wheel who can
intervene if things get hairy so that so
the car apparently uh got cut off by
another self driverless car self
driverless car and uh uh there was no
accident it was just like a close call
because the humans intervene no they
didn't this but so that's the thing like
they're all so what I do they were
sleeping right so newspaper well
whatever it is like why is that a story
no one got hurt it's just 22
self-driving cars that didn't collide
fine so I was digging a little deeper on
this story uh and it turns out like we
have not really thought a lot of this
through and i don't mean the technology
because this is gonna happen in the next
five to 10 years it's going to be me
it's going to be a mainstream thing i
believe but you really got to think
about like some of the more creepier
upsetting things that will wind up
happening we're in certain circumstances
where an accident is inevitable and you
just can't avoid it and the computer
driving the car just will not be able to
get a result where everyone avoids
accident mmm so then computers are then
going to be making decisions that
perhaps a human driver would never make
like for example if you're in a
self-driving car and you're about to
maybe you're in a situation where you're
going to like collide with a school bus
full of kids mmm or does the computer
say oh I don't want 20 people to die I'd
rather just have my guy died
and drive you into like an embankment
like a greater good protocols like well
we could kill a hundred are you right
and on a what a human driver do the same
I don't think so I've not human drama
because you are right into that bus well
I don't know I don't through those kids
these are these are these are decisions
that are made in milliseconds right
right so a computer can handle that
right yeah so what happens though like
this is going to be a thing right where
a computer can detect everything else on
the road can assess what the you know oh
well the probability of a fatal accident
with this other mini cooper is super low
but with that school bus it's super high
so i'm going to hit the Cooper so why is
that it's not bad Justin of it but it's
another but what if you're in that car
like what if you're in the car that
decides to go kamikaze I guess kamikazes
the wrong turn what if you're in the car
that decides to take itself out right
that's bad for Steve you're right so how
do you feel about that that is a cyber
punk future but if but if I had to
intervene and then like now and kill not
coconut but if if we do it the
old-fashioned way and then you just plow
into the bus and kill the 20 kids then
you feel really really bad and then yeah
but I guess I mean when you hear where
I'm getting that I kind of see what
you're saying but I would imagine that
the protocols would set it where the car
learns how to crash the safest way
possible so that way you're not taking
all the crumple zones actually crumpled
and you survived so it's not gonna send
it in a bank make embankment that's
gonna make you die right it's gonna set
you up where you're gonna get injured
but not as badly but how could you know
that for sure when we have would you
know that I'm saying how would you know
how could the computer I guess you could
always suck it you know err on the side
of like probabilities and and and
whatnot in and the computer would always
make the right choice let's not figure
out what what angle do I have to hit
this this Boulder right such that this
person in the car won't be killed and
you can even make the argument like even
in a world where every car is automated
and every car is self-driving there are
still other acts of foreign forces of
nature that will intervene like
tree will fall you know like a deer will
come out there are things that will
happen that a computer is just going to
have to make a split-second decision on
and it's it's kind of crazy I feel like
we jumped right into this self-driving
car thing we're like oh that's cool
it'll be fine you know that they'll
figure it out which I still am very
confident they will yeah but there's a
lot of other elements we maybe haven't
the public taken into considerable with
you know sacrificing my life to save the
20 children you would I would it's for
the greater good i believe is a greater
there should be an option when you get
into the car like organ or or you know
i'm willing to take my chances I let
science decide whether the car should a
car like look at you linking linkedin
profiles like are you valuable to
humanity like how much are you worth
what it's it's it's a a prison bus you
like maybe we should slam into that yeah
I think you're given with a desert think
you're talking about the one of the end
plots of dark knight rises what is it
the Dark Knight isn't that what the boat
full of criminals now hopefully I guess
I am Sicilian with a man influenced by
what a MIDI are recognizes it's the kid
that invented the STI then they go we
gotta protect this uses a valuable asset
if what if it's what if it's the
president yes in the car right next to
you yeah right there you go you gotta go
we're painting a pretty bleak picture of
the future I think this is the future
that's what's always exist hey everyone

talked a lot about a you know vr leading
up to III mmm and I do want to get to
the uber stuff too but this plays better
in with the conversation we just had
okay I think be like I was not sold on
VR up until a week ago vr is it works
it's here and it works and it's going to
change the world wow it's going see I
feel but you know what you might not be
able to enjoy that I am for everyone but
you know what I understand it's it's
it's it's like drugs right it's like
it'll be so good that you won't get
anything else done you'll just be
addicted to it you know I was talking to
a guy hi-fi salesmen a you know a
middle-aged 40-something hifi salesman
who told me that he is addicted to game
mm-hmm you know on an internet game well
like war goes home and he's you know
he's up till three or four o'clock in
the morning playing game did he say what
games like screwing up his life now you
didn't say what they were free said I
don't remember there are people it's
like that's it's an addiction so the
better it gets it's like heroin it's
like the more and more addicting it will
be of course then you just have a shitty
VR experience to I mean they're not all
awesome are they they're not all awesome
i'll select though you'll leave a yoke
this is a crappy when i look for the
good right all the good stuffs gonna
float to the top I mean you know the
Sony's Morpheus is not on the same level
as oculus by far oculus for me right now
and I haven't played with the vive yet
the HTC vive but that oculus rift is
going to blow your freakin pants off
that's awesome to hear it is in same
like some of the demos they were doing
there and I and I people are gonna be
like whoa Jeff's way too pumped on this
you can't knock it till you tried it and
I know it's not accessible right now and
I know we're in a situation where we
have the luxury of getting to try this
stuff out early but this stuff is going
to change the world absolutely without a
doubt now I'll get me wrong like sure it
could flop and something happens where
you know people just don't take to it
for whatever reason from what I've seen
and the demos I've heard people tell me
about and everything all the evidence I
have in front of me this stuff I would
be very surprised if this stuff did not
explode and take off in the way I think
it will what about it being disorienting
though you know I'll say about it
watching 3d movies and stuff it gives
you a heavy it is and it takes your
brain a good 10 minutes to sort of
understand what you're seeing I did this
one thing where I was wearing a Morpheus
headset and I was peddling a bike but
the bike like you know when you're on a
bike you sort of lean and whatnot and I
was doing that on the stationary bike
because my brain my eyes were telling me
oh you're out in a field mm-hmm so
there's a little bit of give and take
that that you have to do but when it
comes to stuff when you move away from
the gimmicky stuff like the bikes and
whatnot and you're just in a
with someone and you're spawning things
with your hands and your sort I mean so
your hands are part of it yeah you can
see your head back yes so the oculus
rift has those go the the Halfmoon
controllers where it sort of maps your
fingers like you can see your hands in
this thing uh can you feel anything
three or not yet but you will be on
promise you you will be able to I mean
this stuff you talked about how much
this stuff is still in its infancy mmm
and where it could be in in five years
let alone 15 25 years forget it forget
it and it's not just games games is just
the tip of this iceberg I mean that's
just the first no-brainer and it's not
porno oh they'll be porn okay oh yeah
they'll be porn okay now now Steve's
interested sad Steve up can I bang this
yeah you can bang cool i'll take six of
them yeah yeah it's gonna be uh it's
gonna it's gonna knock your your your
your face and one you're gonna knock
your face in the face it's what those
things I see it thanks yeah so it's
great it's creating the right business I
it's a it's a good time for this
industry for sure where to go but up
definitely it was a great III over but
seriously I mean this this I can't get
up with this guy he's not like a kid
he's in his mid-forties how he was he's
proud he's probably but he's more
credits guy he sounds like a world of
warcraft guy yeah yeah it's me to screw
up his life it's like a serious thing
right so will this is the bed at three
o'clock L'Amour's got to be at work at
nine o'clock sure sure it's no different
than an alcoholic or someone who's got a
cocaine problem can't stop yeah it's a
pretty just one hour I gambling seems
like you yeah totally addicted to
anything there right if you could turn
pointing into me all the time or
whatever yeah but I mean this is more
intense apparently right it's more life
disrupted like TV is more intense
version of radio but I maybe I think
it'll balance out over time right you
can have people who never leave the
house again and they'll be happy to do
that sure and then they'll be people
like wait a minute I have to go out like
take care of my life every now right
yeah i mean like he needs to seek out
help this guy like if he like he came to
you he's a friend of your suspension it
that's all he mentioned it casually well
maybe those is mainly those a very quiet
call for help he sleep deprived
no one is telling you that what it is
like a baby all kidding aside tell this
guy say to be like you know Bob will
call him Bob they don't Bob you can talk
to somebody about this you can get help
okay cuz it's not a normal way live I I
sympathize like I would love to stay up
every night till five plan Batman but I
can't right now man you can't ruin your
life is gonna ruin your life and if you
operate on two hours of sleep every day
your life's gonna be ruined you're gonna
feel like you're gonna look like
 yeah you're probably smell like
 yeah so next thing you know
gold-plated penis and then it's it and
they're digging digging you a hole yeah
all right let's pick Boober a cleaver so
choose two quick anecdotal stories about
uber am out in LA by the way Ella in New
in LA uber is free for the most part
like it's what does that leave me like
it costs very little money are you gonna
ride it oh yeah ma I went I went six
miles 20 minutes like seven bucks and
how much is it here here that would
probably be like 30 there is a
difference in cost without isn't it like
gonna hear it goes up and down depending
on whatever after whatever it is amazing
that the scale is higher I am a firm
believer and I don't know the magic
behind the curtain but there's there's
no doubt in my mind that all that stuff
is just you know elevated proportionally
right but the but they're all go up and
down they're not static they do but the
the in terms of like time versus mileage
and distance okay I think those rates
here are higher than they are in LA okay
it's like if you were really has car I
guess if you were to take two of the
exact same trips mmm the LA one would be
cheaper anyway you open up the app in LA
and there's there's like 90 different
little ubers you can do you could do
over plus uber lu x uber lux all these
different new words i never heard of so
every night i was like trying a new I'm
like oh whatever what's playing a game
yeah I'm gonna do plus go I do plus one
night guy pulls up in a Mercedes I'm
like all right I hit the good guys I did
the good one I was like this is
plus i wonder what looks is right so I
he opens up the door for me you know
almost like the whole white gloves her
sike hello Jeff how are you I need you
to know I only pick up people with
ratings higher than 4.7 you're a 4.9 I
was like sick opens the door for me we
have a nice little conversation for 10
minutes and they're you and he's telling
me all times like i'll pick up anyone
below 47 can't be bothered with them I'm
like why what's oh he's like he's like
they eat in my car they these like I had
a he's like I had someone take a piss in
my car I was like never again under four
points that guy was to whom he must have
been so yeah I was kind of blown away
and then this week I had a driver who
told me again my rating so two people
within two weeks have told me the rating
that you're really never supposed to
hear I guess an uber customer you're not
supposed to hear that number but when
you call for a ride they see you and
they say I'm not gonna accept that yeah
you say I want that guy oh they can say
no shoes you can't accept it and then I
guess you could do that but you can't
just accept it and then decline it how
do they see your rating yeah when you
when you do that when you drop that pin
mm-hmm they know who you are and what
your rating is okay and they can have
their own personal sort of you know
screening process where they say Oh
Jeff's you know Oh Steve's of 3.2 yeah
I'm not picking that bum up rackley you
know uh so yeah so this more I have the
same thing and then I have some this
conversation and I feel like every time
the thing that's different about an uber
and a taxi and uber I have these amazing
conversations with these drivers I hate
those man why do you sound like I'm in
the car I'm trying to get somewhere I'm
not your friend i'm showing you to drive
me so why are we talking and that's your
prerogative if you don't want to talk
you don't have to work too oh you don't
have to do it that's how this you'll be
like hey dude I'm sorry I I gotta read
something I tell you the story where a
guy in uber picked me up and had the
Spotify connect thing working on there
we get spot if I hooked up with yet and
so I wanted a song playing when I got in
so I think that's kind of neat i want to
try the first time right and so I go
it's a little loud to turn it down he
goes new sound system like Oh newgen no
seriously can you turn it down he's like
new sound system he turns the volume way
the hell up oh that's so moved
one star for me right away it goes on
like this for about 20 minutes it's like
you know what I'm gonna listen to my
music I'm gonna start singing along
screw it like I'm gonna be really
obnoxious at this point I can't get this
guy to turn the damn thing that's a
magic took you to the hose I could do
that I was like you know what if this
guy's not after the first song I'm like
you know what I'm gonna go with it but
when I asked him twice I'm like least I
don't know what kind of argument get
into this with this guy if I turn this
off I don't know what's gonna happen cuz
I still got you know a good while to go
on this ride it was one of the strangest
trips have taken because I wanted to
sleep in the car just wanted to hear one
song but that was a mess wow that's
crazy yeah so maybe he rated me he's
like hey at the end he's like Bray
playlist I was like thanks thanks I'm
gonna go to sleep now well anyway that
was my last uber experience our most
recent feel like the majority of the
people I get are mostly friendly I've
had bad drivers and I've raided them
accordingly but on the whole they're
better than taxi driver as much as it
pains my father to say that he wasn't
he's a piece of it he's very involved in
the taxi business so perfect so those
people who are over drivers right it's
their car they pay for everything right
ah their insurance it's their cars their
everything honestly he's the better guy
to ask but I do believe a it is true
yeah so basically they're working for a
fraction of what they would get if they
driving a cab not the cab drivers are
doing so great right not there it's it's
it's it's basically pushing everything
down except for the billionaire guy that
started oh he's doing great yeah I mean
but everybody else like it's your car
it's your insurance it's your everything
it seems the layer basically sit paying
for the app to get customers it's sick
right again right right there basically
subscribing to that app right the so the
way I understand it and the the way it
was explained to me recently is that the
uber driver community is much is
overpopulated in a lot of areas and
where it used to be that you would get a
fair
her right away now it could take longer
and so some of those who guys about way
maybe I don't know I do know for a fact
to keep driving around for any money on
gas sure right so that's just sitting
there waiting right it's like this
hourglass this is like always emptying
there are more uber drivers in New York
City than there are cabs now okay which
I guess is not surprising yeah but uh
but yeah it's it's a weird time for uber
and that's all part of the race to the
bottom I mean it's a great service for
for consumers but it's just screw you
know screws everybody else who's the
seems to be professional driver it seems
like we can't have these new web-based
services without something eventually
like someone suffering at some point
more and more people suffer it seems
like we they'll the product is great on
the rich get richer everybody else gets
screwed but like ubers think for a while
was like you're gonna make 90 grand your
first year driving over and I don't know
I don't know if that's true or not I
don't know I can't imagine you would
have to drive a lot i'd imagine yeah i
mean i just all those things really
frighten me that it's like the whole
economy you know it's thing where rich
people get richer and richer and richer
than they've ever been before by a huge
margin and then everybody else the
middle class on down is living on less
and less and less in real dollars are
you gonna run for president again yeah
it's good baby I think you could fix it
I think I could I would love it just vr4
everybody nobody travels anymore that's
the position right that's it gold penis
is all around forever chicken in every
pot and read me but lead-free go penises
cuz I'm a health-conscious you have a
new method of plating land yes so okay
it's organic so you're so your micro
your micro manifesto right there you'd
probably really enjoy this new show
called mr. robot no no have you heard
about I've heard of it the big thing
that stands out to me is the fact that
they use the Sega font from yeah so
they're definitely ripping off the Sega
typeface for sure for the show's logo
that's a much that is an issue and I'm
trying to get the the producer and
creator of the show are you Justin so I
can talk
damn and that'll be the first thing I
grill him on he did the UH grill dragon
tattoo right no that's the director okay
yeah the director of the pilot directed
the swedish version of that for that
movie was freaking also i cannot sail
where is it so it's on it's on
peculiarly enough it's on USA Network
which is not going to work known for
cyber thrillers like mr. runoff I have
that you do its standard you have cable
yeah do you have yes and basic you ever
have a rabbit ear and I go like this but
aluminum foil on it right and then you
gold played it so mr. robot is the
probably the best attempt to tackle
cyber security and the quasi underground
world of hacking in the least cheesiest
corniest way I've seen in a while like
it's equal parts Fight Club there's a
little bit of like sneakers in it and
hackers I guess you could say hackers
being 20 years old now is pretty damn
cheesy for a film that covered cyber
punkin you know hacking whatnot but it's
pretty good and I'm and I didn't think I
was gonna like it and I wound up liking
it so if you haven't seen it i believe
the pilot is streaming online for free
it's called mr. robot okay Christian
Slater's in it oh right that's why I
thought the show was doomed because
every time is on TV if that show gets
canceled within like a seasoned well
he's been on Archer for a few seasons
and that's been great yes and no it's
animated is not I know he's just later
it's easy when Christian Slater is on a
show he's to be kryptonite my own worst
enemy which is it was a pretty good show
on NBC and that's survive the season
then he was on another Fox show I'm like
I'm not getting into that because I want
to see if it survived to season gone
yeah so this one I heard I hear you're
saying it's awesome but Christian Slater
he's these TVs not he's not a huge part
of the show it's not about him good at
least in the pilot like without him I
really got nothing wrong with him he was
in the wizard with Fred Savage and Beau
Bridges in the Nintendo movie in the 80s
you don't know that film Steve's like
one of my power glove right powerful so
go watch mr. robot I love a report from
you I well he
it is it up there with inside Amy
Schumer that show is totally different
she is amazed you like you like yourself
some Amy Schumer I did she's just so
funny and great weird and she's got
unlimited about being unattractive walk
you know yeah I mean I don't think she
was necessarily on a truck she's not i
mean when she can let herself be on our
track she has no uh what's the best way
to put this I it's fun and respectable
and to watch her sort of have fun with
herself yeah is is that I guess the most
appropriate way to say it yeah I'm just
good people surrounding Scott great
writers right right and I like that some
of the bits are really short you're
havin ya suffer through five minutes at
the same stupid thing over over right
get in she's very funny she's very funny
yeah and pacing is great I like broad
city better I like Brett city better
okay just want to get on it's not it's
not on right now right it'll be back
soon enough hey well well of course they
have thirties of course um okay we've
covered a lot what else do you have for
a Steve so you know by the way is just a
quick aside Saturday will be my 1300 uh
audio philly act block you don't get to
commemorate Lee I don't you did on this
show so what're you gonna go play for
that um I can't say I'm not at liberty
to say gold played a microphone yeah
anyway it's welcome sir miles that's
great 1300 1300 a lot why didn't you you
didn't do anything for your thing they
wouldn't let me so I said I couldn't do
it who's they this is Annette overlord
people above yeah so are you so but you
are doing something special for you no
no no I can't say Oh excitement you know
1300 right thousand or whatever right
all right just mentioning it was this
congrats man that's a big milestone so
you know I was thinking about you being
a new father oh good yeah I was the key
know I kind of knew who my grandparents
were but I never met my great
grandparents and people you know some
people know their great-grandparents who
were alive or maybe even your
great-great grandparents but unless
you're from like a very wealthy family
you don't know who your
great-great-great
great great great grandparents right
they could probably look it up you
probably could but no one knows unless
you're royalty who your ancestors were
from a thousand years ago sure or 10,000
years ago right or 50,000 years ago yeah
but you know backwards go back to
infinity right I guess eventually yeah
so what if the you know what if there
was a Jeff Bakalar 10,000 years ago and
you were an Eskimo this would make sense
right okay go on you know like not using
your ice skills this is how you got to
be this way it's like a recessive gene
like you like called and hitting things
with sticks that's a rich man it is yeah
Eskimo I don't look anything like an
Eskimo well now you know in 10,000 years
later there's lots of generations of
backers and sees it I mean I could take
a DNA test and maybe find out some more
of that yeah or maybe you were in Russia
okay I called the Siberia I think about
the had to have been somewhere you like
fish yeah that's more perfect there it
is proofs right yeah we think about
blubber you like whale blubber yeah yeah
do you were you clearly wrong vegetarian
right so but you know blub so anyway but
what if Woody Allen existed 10,000 years
ago or his you go back ex-general ins
ancestors right right his lose he the
same guy was he like the same vechi
cranky I don't know but annoying God
brave can't let me to continue the line
you'd think yeah because they would
survive he would like yeah but what
about me 10,000 years personality your
personal yeah hi person it's all
affected by environment I understand
that so it has to be some innate pneus
to it right left up is like a linear
inner core what I mean I probably
oversimplifying the whole thing yeah but
the way you're describing it makes me
like think to you know a caveman family
like one of them is like this
nebbish jus right like a Jew II want me
to eat all these days crazy oh I just
have a nice can we get a light in here
what it goes you know like some like
what fire you know what it's freezing in
here yeah like that yeah but you see
that there don't have you like one
annoying right guy in the care maybe
that's how there was progress somebody's
like why is it so cold like exactly when
the fire is everybody else was telling
the Jew ish person was fetching and
saying we got to do something about the
dark in here this is crazy this is no
way to live me bigger rocks what is it
so much to ask I don't know Steve out
you don't think this is it sound like a
mel brooks movie like a history of the
world I'm saying it in a funny way but i
think that there's some part of it it
has to be true it's / it's possible it's
definitely possible what about Martin
Scorsese 10,000 years ago yeah what he
couldn't do what's that thing that now
that we're not on video that so your
thing yeah were you making l with both
your hands you know frame-up something
right in frame yeah they doing that the
hip fingers then they could have been
doing is he like wait maybe he was
blocking out things you don't want to
see like oh there is a tiger if i just
look over here that tree if I just put
my hands up I can't see the tiger that
will be eating right I love that this is
this is what you brought us this is like
but wait yeah okay yeah go so we took
the trip back we did we went all the way
back but but but Dylan's children's
children's children's children's
children right like I said a thousand
years you're now yeah cool we think that
you were hit because we have i phone
sixes right wouldn't when there's the
iphone you know 712 okay they look back
at us and think we're like bugs yeah
that'll be your cavemen will be lower
than caveman at least there's certain
things that we have in common with
cavemen but a thousand years from now
human beings will be so there will be so
little human in them I guess but a
thousand years from now or ten thousand
where we would still ten thousand years
now be closer to that generation than we
were two cavemen right yeah we would be
well in time in a time there'll be so
much more
we've only had technology for in 200
years frankly being generous with the
200 years here right sure give it a
thousand years give it ten thousand
years who you think VR is a big big deal
of course no I know oh I love so so what
do you think what do you think the world
will look like in ten thousand I can't
imagine yeah i wanna i want you to think
about it will take a break i want to
hear what you are i think what i put my
thinking put on your thinking cap and
get back to us we will be right back

welcome back to the show Steve goes wait
that's it that's all the time I thinking
campuses I think you sound like say
tuned for Steve's vision of the future
is the future seems like you know I
can't see very oh man so I'm we're in
the future we're in the future now I
mean you know I love sci-fi stuff where
they shoot you five ten thousand years
in the future and it's all lights just
like it allow organisms like that with
bigger numbers yeah robot organisms or
whatever it is so yeah we always think
when you watch movies that the hair
styles of people in the future were just
like the hairstyles in 1965 everybody
should do it fashion as it has a
tendency to repeat it's a cyclical yeah
you see this mutton chops yeah cool
that's gonna be good twenty thousand
years now mutton chops are gonna be
again I mean look at most people's I
glasses right they are harkening back to
the 50s and 60s right now yeah well I
thought you're not the round ones i'm
waiting for those to come right I like
I'll come back don't worry because i
like those and i tried to the route like
John Lennon right Harry Potter and I
wanted those and then they said they
don't make those any right they'll come
back around okay I'm sure you find them
now if you want on you but maybe maybe
it's 10,000 years so what does that
future look like you've had a minute
what does that future look like it looks
very cool you think Cole do you think
the work you're worried about two cars
are about to hit each other that a
computer is going to make a decision hmm
there's gonna be very little human
decisions made in a thousand see I think
sometimes it well I think a lot of the
world would be I mean you know I've said
this before but I think a lot of it'll
be automated in robotic and virtual
right and virtual like do you think
we'll have bodies you think we'll just
be like yeah do you think we upload it
into some sort of like any tricks
that is definitely coming I don't think
that's a ten thousand euros in years
away like the hundreds of you think
they'll be this like this digital
transcendence where yeah we no longer
occupy like by my friend addicted to
games pretty much everyone will be in
that see live in a server racks on a
server right and then a certain class of
people like to extremes the workers have
to physically move stuff around the
drones the drones but they could be
where are these uploaded drones or these
are just the people moving the server
these are the worker bees are the worker
bees no I was just they have to get they
have to work in the real world I think
about like a class system within the
server's like there's the birthday of it
that the servers have virtual machines
and those like the poor they can't even
afford their own turn dial our parent
dialect is just one anyway you were
saying they're only allowed a certain
Pat a certain amount of packets and bits
and bytes every day right it's the
region yeah their data plan yeah yeah
but then there'll be a big people swatch
people in the middle we're in this
virtual thing but then the elite elite
elite like the Donald Trump's get to
obey yeah well relax I really will be
back in the physical world and they'll
have like everything to themselves
they'll have like entire estates and
making clay drive fast cars around and
you know so you think the ultimate in
freedom and privilege will be bad to
fist be the ability to live in the real
world yeah and eat the food that's
pretty dark mm-hmm taste the real is
real things yeah instead of like this
you can get anything you want virtually
for food and any taste you want right
but it's the stream end it'll be
actually eating yeah well I think the
best way is that for my fancy dark and i
like it i think the best way to sort of
predict the future seems like a
humanities purpose in life is to just
emulate sci-fi movies right like it
seems like all we really want to do is
get to the float the hover boards more
and the flying car or better easier
stuff you know think about walking
around like a zombie looking at your
phone yeah it's like the least amount of
effort to do anything is the human goal
right yeah if there's like two stairs
people will take the escalator sure it's
like they always opt for the simplest
easiest simplest way of getting
something
and you could make the argument and then
that it becomes more and more possible
they will just think that more and more
but you can make the argument that
that's the path of least resistance is
like ultimate efficiency right like you
could make the argument like the best
way to get to somewhere is to like
expend the least amount of energy right
I'm not saying that like a world and
where we're all can't we evolved that we
don't have to think that way maybe
because we used to have their like Club
animals and climb up trees to survive to
eat things all right well now when
people have to do the tiniest bit thing
like boil water or something they freak
out like oh my god is too much work
months that's how it's good there's a
lot of work tho you gotta get the water
and you got to put it on the stove you
got that the heat going then the
apartment gets warm and then I'm like
your nice air conditioned apartment is
now getting warmer team this is terrible
your glasses get steamed up you can't
see anything Bernier's I see yeah this
is hort you're right this is horrible no
one should ever boil anything right I
mean it's it's weird it's scary to think
about the think about what had the
ultimate like end goal is for Humanity
because what is it what is the goal of
humanity right now in 2015 the
day-to-day person who lives in a in a in
the United States get the most amount of
Instagram weeks that's the first that's
the first go it's like the imperative
yeah but basically my view is to just
try to fill your life with as many good
and interesting things as possible right
right not that's not relating things
then what people are like effectively
staring at their phones who they like
maybe something better here something
better here something better there right
yeah they need that constant thing right
my flip phone doesn't do that so I'm
safe from that for now for why I don't
don't see you upgrading anytime soon hmm
i think is that i think there's an
inevitability there that the flip phone
will have to go yeah my dad finally got
an iphone oh this is big the end is near
hated though he hated a can't can't how
long does he have it like four months
huh he just is he mellowing he's got to
be bellowing a little bit i just don't
think he wants to give it the time of
day like he just doesn't want to be by
he just doesn't want to be bothered with
it huh so why does he get a foot prod
after a while you just gotta you gotta
put away old habits you know you just
let it get it he just got it because it
was guided because it was time
and he wanted to like see photos of my
kid and he can't do that on his lip on
his flip phone and he wanted to enter
that next level I guess and all his
friends have iphones it's not like he
was going against the grain it wasn't
like he was you know alienating himself
he just he needed to do it they were you
know and the phone was gonna break one
day and you really can you get a flip
phone a new flip you know I guess I just
got we can I just got a new one but then
like people look at you weird yeah I
like that yeah so you know you don't
have a thing about Bluetooth speakers
and wireless speaker they sound terribly
sound bad yeah I had this idea you know
we just got in the sound room we have
this I think it's seventeen hundred
dollar French very high-end bluetooth
speaker okay so I had this idea you know
before there were bluetooth speakers
they were boom box right boom boxes were
like the original wireless speaker ahh
1968 we had wireless speakers we called
him radios and then we call them radios
so anyway so I I I put up a thing on
facebook to my friends and said can
anybody lend me a boombox someone has
stepped forward and is gonna give me
their boombox on Monday like the
cassette 12 yeah well cassette and CD
bro no it's like this big yeah maybe
like 15 which is why ok so I'm going to
bring that in and I'm going to compare
it to bluetooth speakers and wireless
speakers guess which one is going to
sound bad well what's the source a CD
I'll play a CD on both of them play an
elf how can you do CD with Bluetooth
well take a wire and really the same
thing off Spotify on them gotcha gotcha
that'll be odd I'll read that which one
do you thinks gonna sound better Jeff I
think that 1991 boombox will crush this
ridiculously no actually in fact i think
i think the blue bot i do think the boom
box will sound better just because it's
gonna have better speakers right right
right exactly okay good we have here
it'll be heavier and it's but it'll look
cooler
look cooler that's for sure so it's
gonna be a good face off all right
excellent gonna be fun so I have one
other quickie okay and then we'll get to
some reddit stuff I'm okay so speaking
of the past the sony walkman is going to
be 37 years old on july first okay he's
uh he's entering made adulthood eight
adults we just bought a Corvette yeah oh
yeah that's been life crises 947 he's 37
okay Anna for mini cooper yeah Mini
Cooper whatever so anyway I'm gonna do a
thing about my memories of the early
days yeah the Walkman the Walkman and
then the disc managed man I had that
first disc man he did and man John was
it was it a d5 he remembered you I was
like eleven remember but anyway I think
that's kind of it is cool you know
because that really that really changed
everything that's where music William
mobile yeah i mean but the discman and
wires plague from the start like that
thing skipped and yet a whole does that
pretty way the skin protection started
to work it was just I remember being
like men they really gotta figure out a
way to have you were very impatient I
was very mean everybody else was so
happy that you could play a CD like some
point I'm like you guys haven't
perfected as yet is wrong with my like
the guy in the cave with the yeah I'm
like hot is this the best we can do um
I've ever had that that Panasonic yellow
one those like the water lumber for SWA
yeah yeah yeah there's nice headphones
in 1-2 and gray was yellow and gray for
some reason I remember mine was yellow
black and orange okay yeah I love to
find and and had these very satisfying
claps clasps on either side that snapped
in give you that nice sort of firm hold
I was a big fan of that thing okay let's
jump into the reddit section of the show
what is that I don't know you've never
been you know redness we got a subreddit
I'm much and every week we post a little
thread for that Friday's show and people
throw and stuff okay at uber stuff
sucker would you would you listen like I
would I was having this conversation
with his uber driver and I was like I
want to broadcast my camera
same with you undo like an uber cast huh
but would you want to hear that yes you
would yeah well you do it I was like a
taxicab confessional sort of thing yeah
you can carry mics on you what are you
gonna do I gonna make you feel like I
could get away with the following right
phone yeah it'll sound like but it
is zoom for a little he has water I like
the zoom and just do like a periscope
when you're doing it live if you're like
hey dudes is cool if I record this
conversation and then what if he's like
no no there's nothing you can't do it I
don't like all you ruined room that's a
whole conversation episode set up so 1
i'm gonna start doing that uber yeah
yeah all right back to reddit Jay
Brussels wants to know and we've covered
this with you but I will entertain him
nevertheless not sure if this has been
covered previously but have you Steve
and actually met the other the second
Steve Guttenberg we've we have wait time
out time it says in parentheses as made
famous by the Stonecutters is that what
he was made famous by that's not a
Simpsons right police academy yeah the
other well they actually say in the song
who made Steve Guttenberg oh so we do
nice correctly i miss you don't know the
Stonecutters did with the simpsons no no
all right Homer the great have you ever
met him nope never met him but I know
people who know him and we keep almost
getting together we have met and he is
he aware of you yes he's aware of me
well first of all if you do a Google
search on Steve Guttenberg he's number
one and number two number three so if he
ever searches his own name too he's
number one and I'm number two I thought
you said your number three and there was
little bit I'm like the third one down
all right I gotcha any player he has to
be where he has to Google is there you
have any personal thoughts about him you
know I do because I was really
embarrassed when he started making
really awful movies yeah you know maybe
I shouldn't say severe but it's like he
made such all ate mostly made some okay
movies but then he made some really
embarrassing Lee bad one like what like
the men and the baby ones no as our bed
after that there was this one I was
still a movie theater projectionist and
I was thinking god this is really gonna
have to say something's gonna lower my
personals yeah
and then there was this thing you know I
you know it's so long ago i think i've
talked about this before right that my
father had another family yeah you know
i don't know if you've ever really heard
it my bad yeah so you know like maybe I
thought Steve Guttenberg could actually
be my brother I thought it'd been like
my father's thing that he would name his
children from both families in the same
names inconsistent you remember yeah
easy to remember yeah so I thought would
that be weird if he was my brother he
isn't like I think I know now enough
about he's not my brother but he said be
my brother and I'm sure we've just
opened up Pandora's box for single
listeners they're like wat steve has
another family no well i get i do a
step-sibling I step-siblings I dare yes
and you've met that I've never met if
you never met ever met you lay in this
dimension no parallel to 10,000 years
ago do you have the design you have the
desire to seek them out no I don't even
like a lot of my relatives or even
though you share i dunno but i have met
I don't like most of them but even
that's fine I don't understand this
whole family yeah I know it's kind of
confusing it is confusing I I'm supposed
to like you cuz I'm related to you right
is my questions I don't think so I mean
it does seem unable to love that because
it related to you it may use not to like
them that's what I've learned about fam
love them that's the thing almost
stronger than like I know it's a weird
thing race wasn't like you're supposed
to care about them if they get hurt
you're supposed to care but it's nice
when you actually like your family
though oh so here's the deal I think it
applies for your immediate family our
immediate fam parents yes Cora
specializing our siblings of course yes
but really beyond that cousins that I
felt like three times in my life no I
don't think so actually mad I met one of
my cousins I haven't split back 25 years
but that's the thing it's not good but
it was really bad but that's the thing
right like your dad's brother and your
uncle I'll call ya your dad has that
relationship uh-huh but you don't
because it's not your dad right so you
understand how complicated it's very
complicated oh don't know so no and you
have no desire to make these other
guttenberg my siblings yeah your steps
apply steps the links now it's not it's
a nutty story will read it in the book
when it comes out next year I am writing
a book I know very slowly
it's not about that that's that being a
projection us all right well you can
pepper in some of your personal stuff
guy from Trinidad loves that you're here
and wants to know your whole opinion on
the taylor swift apples stuff yay she
did the right thing right but I'm not so
sure about the photographer thing you
know that thing about the freelance
photographer it has to be like what
source of clearances and hoops you have
to jump through and then basically
Taylor Swift Inc owns the pictures that
are taken of her so she came out and be
you know sort of uh became the
spokesperson for independent artists
even though she's the least for this
there's a reason to hate Apple but she
had a shame them into do I should a
shame those two doing a company that's a
hundred billion dollars in the bank and
they're like what's gonna pay artists
for its but it's those micro payments of
right that's y 0 Z so what's the big
freakin deal you write the check for
twelve million dollars recover right
you're done for the three month yeah so
here's what I understand my socks right
does suck and clearly she's not someone
who needs the money she our seed into
herself herself he's not an independent
art of course she's not and that's cool
that she did it yeah but for the
independent artist they're still Tamia
okay now they're gonna get 30 bucks
instead of nothing right like what a
good day on a good day so so what do we
do i do have a solution to this vexing
problem now that the mechanics of how it
gets done this is trickier i'm not an
account button um you know the way the
pie is divided in the spotify title
world is the people at the top the
taylor swift's the top of the pyramid
people they get paid first now let's say
i love Miles Davis and I listen to
nothin but miles davis for 24 hours a
day on my spotify account Miles Davis
estate still gets a tiny tiny tiny
payment not like seventy percent of my
10 that my set seven dollars of my ten
dollar subscription doesn't go to him it
goes to Taylor Swift first she gets paid
and all the people at the top of the
pyramid get paid so so a more equitable
system would be that the people who you
listen to if you're really into LCD
Soundsystem and you only listen to LCD
Soundsystem and two other bands that
they would get the money they would get
seventy percent because they always say
they pay seventy percent of the things
back to the artists and labels right
that would be the right thing to do and
that would be you know the way it should
be really divided it shouldn't just be
divided among the people at the top and
then the trickle down to everybody else
because not everybody listens to
everything right yeah it's that that is
the solution and there are reasons why I
can't happen because record companies
have a lot to say so of how that happens
and they don't necessarily give a
about those people at the bottom so
that's why it's not happening but if
there was a if the fans sort of rally
together and in thinking about that I
think that would have a shot and i'm
going to try to use my massive influence
all right just don't start another title
just don't do that I like title you like
the technology it sounds good you don't
like what you don't like their business
model no and I've told him yeah uh I
hope that answered the quest it sort of
did that was good enough for me four for
friday jdl are 28 says this I like Steve
give some recommendations on custom
in-ear headphones let's do like a low
medium and high or customs start at
around four hundred ah ok so that would
be low ma and there's this company with
with a great name called 1964 ears
perfect they didn't start at 1964 right
then just they just like the number sure
I just like that ever and they're really
nice people I think they're in Florida
and that's that's the entry-level medium
medium gives us these guys I've been
writing about in California called Noble
and 0 ple they do custom and universals
of all their miles which is most custom
headphone companies only do custom but
this company noble does
all of their models they do universal
fit and custom cool and they're terrific
I just reviewed when you google that
okay and then at the extreme high end
there's Gerry Harvey audio JH audio
Gerry Harvey invented the custom in-ear
my head every band the freakin universe
has those tears he he straight he was
working for Van Halen and they were
complaining about their stage manager
the wedges and stuff maybe I figure out
another way to do mama he's a guy an
idea would put that in your ear yeah it
really did he really did and how much
can those be those can be at the at the
top and twenty five hundred dollars damn
I I said they are have made by hand or
custom headphones or I could have to be
made by human being right not robots no
Nova and everyone is unique awesome
they're bespoke I like that finally pham
van Lowe says what are your thoughts on
the next waves of Dolby Atmos and the
DTS x80 worse either and how those
speakers fire up what do you think about
that it's going down you don't like it I
think it's a really stupid idea it's
okay for movie theaters but you know i'm
reviewing one today so this damos is the
dolby technologies bigger where they aim
sound up and bounce it off the ceiling
yeah i mean that the cool part of the
technology is that instead of being like
5.1 or 7.1 it's called object enabled so
it's not in a specific channel it's
moving sound between speakers so we cool
five speakers or eight speakers or 12
speakers it kind of moves things front
to back up and down in in space in your
room so that's good but most people want
you know what the magic number is four
speakers 11 they don't even want to
speak they don't 12 speakers are one too
many do you think we're there we're
getting close to one where you're happy
with it no so you always want 5.1 off
for mood for movies now i'd be happy
with to me personally but right now i
think one is 12 min is this is one so so
here's my thing right like i love having
5.1 in my my living room on gratulations
your rare i know i love i have an onkyo
you know anybody else
has one I do yes okay people who are in
them is if people don't want for seeing
that um yeah I'm it maybe like ten
percent ten to fifty percent of my
friend really yeah which is not a lot
it's still way more than it was like you
know a lot of people but yeah they have
it and a lot of them have like HT i beez
but i think there's some good HTI bees
out there I think onkyo makes a good
energy idea they're almost gone onkyo
the home tara boxes are almost right
there on their way out right because
they people have found bars right so
mile thing is i had a recently replaced
my onkyo receiver just wouldn't power up
just one turn on i guess the fuse blew
or whatever there doesn't seem to be a
solution you can mix and match and
that's not a problem your place deceiver
receiver doesn't seem to be a solution
yet where it's like you don't have to
worry about five speakers and you don't
think we'll ever get to the point where
one sound bar is just gonna really
deliver unbelievable thousand-year see
that to the answer that's your answer
what's up what's 10,000 years gonna look
like one speaker just gonna look like
all right that's gonna do it for us
Steve here always a pleasure sir this
