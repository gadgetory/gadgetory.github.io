small cars all right
let's drive one of their biggest the
2014 Infiniti qx80 all-wheel drive and
check the 10 now let's be honest the
qx80 is a great big blunderbuss of a
thing and its lines make no attempt to
hide that I mean look at this face what
is this fudgie the whale and it's cut
off like a blunt piece of lumber out the
back you got this pouty jutting rear
bumper nothing about this vehicle makes
apologies for its presence as you can
see obviously why would you have
something this big if you didn't you can
also get that second row as a bitch that
lifts your passenger capacity in this
thing to eight people members of
Congress now inside this big boy it's
kind of an ersatz luxury I don't think
Infiniti on this vehicle does the best
job with plaster wood and plastic Rome
but it does say fancy we've seen this
head unit before and generally liked it
when we see it this is your 8 inch
touchscreen with pretty good response
you see I'm bouncing around the map here
pretty easily you've also got the
Infinity controller which turns kicks
and clicks they got rid of the buttons
around it which makes good sense
voice command is also available so a lot
of ways to run this guy the voice
command is actually quite tight check it
out please say a command
navigational navigation please take
address address what state please
California
California now as you can see it picks
up what I say really quickly
the downside is when you get into the
address you've got to do state city
street number as independent little
buckets that's kind of old feeling at
this point in history but all in all
quite functional still a little bit
childish looking display good 3d flyby
mode and they do a nice job showing you
what lane to be in when you get to one
of those desi freeway interchanges so
not a whole lot new there and I will say
this this vehicle has about the best
streaming Bluetooth I've heard which is
kind of saying something because
streaming Bluetooth doesn't sound real
good but this one does a great job of
bringing it together making good sense
of the sound and even bringing out
things I don't hear in some other cars
that's impressive let's talk about some
drive controls you don't have it every
vehicle first of all this all-wheel
drive controller right here with an
automatic mode that you leave it in
typically four-wheel high or push and
turn to for low you need to know about
exactly nothing about off-roading
to use this guy our shifter goes to a
7-speed automatic the only choice you
have a sip double gate over here that
also gives you a little more of a sporty
behavior and notice when I go to reverse
you find a whole bunch of cameras go up
here this can also work for front view
as well which will do when you're
creeping at low speeds if you hit
something in this car you weren't
looking in fact you can apply in full
done along with those cameras goes a ton
of available driver-assistance tap let's
run down the list there's adaptive
cruise control lane departure warning
and prevention distance control alerts
independent braking and front collision
warning and prevention blind spot
warning and intervention backup
collision intervention and steerable
front headlights you almost can't crash
this thing and power stuff galore in
this vehicle you got your power liftgate
button over here
you've got power buttons here to drop
the back seat almost violently and there
are power switches in the very back to
raise and lower the seats in the third
row oddly enough though you get this
little dinky mail slot of a sunroof and
no option to make it bigger this is way
behind the times okay under the not
insignificant prowl of this thing is a
five point six liter v8 direct-injected
variable valve timing beyond that though
nothing terribly tricky about it's just
big
400 horsepower 413 foot-pounds of torque
that's enough to get this nearly free
tunnel up to 60 in the high six-second
range through a 7-speed automatic and
all-wheel drive in our configuration as
I mentioned you get about 14 20 mpg
we're doing about 15 average all in 26
gallon tank at current California prices
it's 108 bucks of fill-up
let's go find out what it gets us now a
lot of things about this qx2 Drive are
clearly not a driver's car set of
influence I mean from the pedal actuate
an emergency brake to the big doughy
ride we have the adaptive suspension in
this car but it still is a big kind of a
wallah we experience much better than
I'm sure it would be without it the
power is plentiful but you've got kind
of a numb accelerator as you'd expect on
a vehicle in this category that will
modulate out any kind of jerkiness and
the power delivery and it's all sort of
disconnected from the road the steering
gives you almost no feedback on what's
going on in other words this car is
perfect for the kind of person who is
shopping for it you're not buying this
and cross shopping it with a Cayenne for
crying out loud it's a whole different
animal it's kind of in the Escalade
class you have no idea what kind of road
you're driving on when you're in the
qx80 you're just kind of floating above
it all once you do get in it though
especially if you get over here on the
shifting gate you get a nice snarl out
of that v8 and a ton of power which is
actually kind of amazing that's
something that's heavy can ever move
that fast so I got a hand that - that's
not okay let's price this giant thing
starts off about sixty-five five for a
qx80 remember that's the v8 and I'm
talking about the all-wheel drive model
here and that price does include
delivering now the options they all
basically come in big packages the first
one is the rear seat entertainment
system which I'm gonna pass on all day
it's DVD based if your kids are
intrigued by DVD they need tutoring not
rear seat entertainment I am intrigued
though more by the technology package
which includes all the driver assistance
technologies an amazing amount of them
for 30 to 50 and the last thing I'm on
the fence on is this whole package its
deluxe touring they call it like 4,600
bucks
it gets you the adaptive suspension
which I think this vehicle needs also
cooled seats a bunch of interior trim
upgrades oh and surround sound on your
Bose audio system probably worth it but
there's an awful lot in there you're
looking at about 73 five for one of
these guys then I've seen that style not
a cheap ride but you're getting a lot of
tonnage for your money if that helps and
once you're in there you're so isolated
from the real world you won't even
remember what your payment is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
