I'm Joseph Kaminski we're here to unbox
a 55 inch OLED TV this is the OLED c8
series the least expensive still very
expensive TV for LG's OLED series for
2018 a highly anticipated product Joe
what's the first thing you notice about
this the very generic box that it
shipped in yeah what's going on here so
LG sends us these things to you know
review which is great of them but this
one is a little banged up looking yeah
it also could have been a 65 inch II I
don't know why we got a 55 I think yeah
yeah I don't know well so I did ask for
65 so they say it's gonna come so that
this might not be the one we actually
review but it is the first one I've seen
so we're gonna unbox it what do you say
I say let's get the box letters alright
let's do this so we got to chop the top
here we're gonna get out our little
styrofoam duct tape is not a normal part
of the boxes this is a new addition
thanks to LG move it over there yep got
it so what do I have over here on the
top I believe this is the base Stan ooh
the stand one of the few things that
differentiate the words it's not the
duck feet at least it's got the little
is that kind of like a plastic going
here
yeah those sound plazi with little I do
like that better than the feet on the
edge though especially when we got this
table here we're gonna put it on defin
is we're gonna horde minder you plug
into the back of its gonna place this
over here for right now this is a little
bag of stuff here host we got some
accessories here you know we'll get to
that in a minute let's let's crank out
the TV it's alright wanders little box
over yeah let's get this up styrofoam
standard for all TV's very thin for OLED
alright you ready buddy we're gonna pull
it up here be very careful okay good lot
of styrofoam here we got this protector
on the front here side so this seems to
be another part to the stand
we got oh nice okay this is new so this
looks like yeah it's an additional kind
of part of the stance looks like we've
got a double stand a semi going here
this leaf underfoot together it looks
like it goes right in that's new yeah
last year had just a single leg stance
so we'll see what this looks like seen
the pictures but it never does just
until you see a person get this little
protective we already got a break here
in the styrofoam I think we're still
good this happens all the time with
these things all right so what do you
think you want to I'm gonna lift out
with you and I'm gonna swing it around
and put it on this face over here yeah
let's put it face down first we're gonna
keep you guys in suspense of what this
actually looks like it looks like
plastic we got some chairs back here
we're gonna put it face down it is the
recommended way to put on stand legs
here nice padded leather chair to be
specific all right and you can see right
here's where the mount goes okay what do
we got here seems like the remote
batteries in manual and hopefully some
screws screws this all right good we got
screws here so I'm gonna actually
consult the manual because I have no
idea how this fan gets in it appears to
go something like this there's some
screws at the bottom all right so it's
yes I see a pack of three screws here so
let's get those ready are those lined up
they don't appear to be I think this
goes in a little tighter
yeah OLG I see so you gotta actually
somehow lever it in yeah it's got a felt
it move this is where it breaks alright
so maybe straight in like that down well
the two tabs right here they're
definitely going yeah well the
instructions as helpful as they are tell
me to look at those
and get it in so we're in the right
ballpark all we gotta do is figure out a
way to yeah nice that was awesome all
right origami Jim okay so let's flip
this over and we'll get a keys put it
straight down we got this screwed in and
so this is a different stand for sure
than we had before
it's nice nice piece of metal here on
the back what I really know what that's
for
well you just knew this was the front
piece because it has the big LG OLED
neighbour that's right so what we were
looking at before is actually the back
end of it so this front is gonna be
completely new and give you kind of I
don't know a swept back look when the
TV's up so what's the next step here
like us have to dissolute in we place it
on the base of the TV all right let's
drop it on here we got four more screws
these look like they're ready to go so
we place this okay we started here
tool time with Joe and cats that's right
oh this is good we are so close what
about that other piece Joe does that um
there should be a back panel piece with
a bag of stuff he gets right here that
guy's gonna go on here and am a nice
cable management that's right cuz wrap
that excessive cable around there bad
boys and finally
all right so get this clear down here
nice neat boom beautiful all right let's
get them up let's hold up we can see
everybody before we turn it around you
know what though did we meet oh ha we
caught our cable okay don't try that at
home you guys and you know what there's
actually screws here we won't worry
about those but it looks like there's a
pair of screws that go in here as well
may not be a big deal to some but for
those who like their TVs and their
entertainment centers plus to the wall
that is actually very thoughtful yet no
elbow cable there all right so let's
flip it up let's not turn it around yet
show everybody what it looks like on the
assembled back here nice so we got what
we got HDMI one two three got a fourth
HDMI right here which is nice that's one
more than we had last year a couple of
USB anything over there Joe just a power
cable here and the little back that you
could snap on excessive cord around that
looks good a couple other things input
for AV this is gonna be a breakout cable
for your analog connection Ethernet
optical digital out which is important
on this TV because it does pass at most
which is nice you've got a receiver that
can handle that so let's flip it around
do a little reveal here when you say
here we go everybody oh yeah once it
flips around you see we nice beautiful
we're pretty good here so I like the
look of this on the front it's got a
little bit of almost like rib look on
the front this is not a speaker although
it kind of wants to be a speaker the way
it looks what do you think Joe it is
really thin it is very sexy yeah and
this is super thin you guys I would love
to check out the 65 inch version I know
I keep harping on that but 55 I know I
sound spoiled just seems really small it
does yeah you're right let's let's turn
it a little bit here you guys can see
what we're talking about how thin it is
you guys get that what is this like I
don't even know it's less than an inch
like definitely definitely half an inch
less than an eighth of an inch somewhere
in there now that we've got this bad boy
set up it's time to power it up keep
your fingers crossed everybody make sure
it works here right let's see we got our
remote power up oh it's somehow new
all right let's see I'm pressing the
okay button right here all right so this
is pretty standard so far from LG listen
to that dulcet sounds of miss LG I love
you miss LG but sorry no hmm my TV's
been located where are we
I'm just gonna skip through this for now
we can enter that later oh that was on
HDMI three all right give me a second
here should be oh there we go that looks
familiar
tada
so this is the 55 inch LG c8 2018 model
2,500 bucks 55 inch 3500 for the 65
review coming soon on CNET but there she
is out of the box looks nice yeah looks
pretty darn good off angles are great
for Olin I need to get some gaming done
on this bad boy
all right that'll be the next step all
right guys thanks a lot
thank you Joe thank you take care all
