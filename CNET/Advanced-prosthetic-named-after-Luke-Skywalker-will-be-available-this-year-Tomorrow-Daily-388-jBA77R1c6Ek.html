geek talk show in the known universe I'm
ashley Esqueda and i'm jeff cannata did
you miss us we took a week off if you
weren't paying attention oh we got you
we got you with headlines and advanced
prosthetic arm oh man this is so cool
check this out this is the luke arm
which used to be the dekhe arm but was
renamed after luke skywalker it was
designed by the creator of segue further
developed by DARPA and it's the first of
its kind heading to market later this
year it translates signals from a
patient's muscles into a wide variety of
movements more than any arm like it has
done before there are modules for
different levels of amputation too it's
powered shoulder joint can reach
overhead the elbow can lift a bag of
groceries and its hand can grasp both
heavier and more delicate objects with
ease over 10,000 hours of testing has
gone into developing luke and now
manufacturer Mobius bionics is taking
submissions from anyone interested in
buying one of the first commercial
models although it costs about 100 grand
so this is not cheap but that is an
amazing thing I mean we really at the
point now where amputees have the
ability to do very fine detail work with
their Bionic arms and I think this is
going to open up a whole range of
activities for people like that yeah we
just got to bring the price down over
time personal get cheaper it'll be even
better uh just in case hamsters weren't
enough we put some hamster new hamsters
he could hamster why you hamster take a
look at this hamster powered hamster
drying machine this is from the self
dubbed maker of stuff neil mendoza he
has a hilarious new project this machine
draws hamsters and the machine is
actually powered by live hamsters
mendoza tends to combine digital and
mechanical technology in his art and
this machine is no different he made a
simulation of the final product in
openframeworks and box2d adjusted the
design accordingly and then had the
final concept CNC milled out of plywood
now that it's assembled you can see
exactly what it does here
as the hamster runs in its wheel the
machine draws a selfie of the furry
friend and powers down when the hamster
gets tired aboard and steps off um
producer Logan can we please have Neal
Mendoza on the show we should try he
