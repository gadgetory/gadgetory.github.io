the cnet mailbag the show where we take
your feedback and answer your questions
about the stuff we do here at cnet let's
jump right in first up Psylocke Holmes
has a request you should have a list of
all live show time somewhere on your
cnet TV page Psylocke homes you're right
we don't have it on scene at tv.com yet
but we do have a page called watch bol
calm where you can tune in to live
streams of our podcasts including buzz
out loud the bol and watch bol gadgets
the real deal the 404 dialed in and mp3
insider and you can chat with other
people while you watch there is a
schedule their of those shows other than
that cnet live is every thursday at 1pm
Pacific 4 p.m. eastern so that's pretty
easy to remember oh but there is one
more our new show office hours every
weekday at 1130am Pacific escena editor
gets locked in an office for half an
hour to answer your questions live and
Jimmy has been watching and sent some
feedback I like to ask the editors sick
show with brian Tong I appreciate the
editors opinions good audio please add
hd-quality please change the background
to something similar to cnet live San
Francisco is beautiful and I like the
feel so maybe more city landscapes it
gives me something else to look at I
think you need a host for the show brian
Tong is good I think you need to
continue with a different guest editor
like you do now in addition to the host
this would create a feeling of
conversation like cnet live Thank You
Jimmy for that really great feedback and
here are your answers HD quality I think
we're working on it stay tuned the
backgrounds um that one doesn't have any
windows so you're not getting any
cityscapes but we might start putting up
some posters or something and as for
brian Tong he is now the permanent
co-host for office hours so he'll be
helping our editors out as they try to
chat with you research answers for you
and just generally keep chatting it's a
work in progress but it's a really cool
way to talk to Cena editors so I hope
you check it out just go to cnet or seen
at tv.com at eleven-thirty pacific to 30
eastern and look for the office hours
link next up did you also know we have a
show on tivo it's true it's hosted by me
and you can download it if you have
stand-alone tivo just go to find
programs and downloads on your menu
choose download TV movies and web video
choose browse other videos and then
scroll down to see net TV tech weekly
it's a little round up of cool gadgets
and cars and stuff but will you messed
it up recently and mr. Prius kotik he
says your HD tivo cast is not formatting
properly on my tivo HD series 3 machine
it is apparently intended to be
widescreen but instead of showing as 43
format there's black space to the left
and right sides of the image in which
everything is horizontally scrunched
together Molly would never looked so
anorexic please fix this I really enjoy
seeing your show on the big TV screen
thanks mr. Prius we tried to deliver a
16-9 version of the show but apparently
we crossed the streams with the tivo
people and it showed up all smushed
we're sending a new version should be
normal soon and in future episodes
thanks for watching and another gadget
news Brad see asked just wondering if
anyone had seen it had the chance to
play with the new canon eos 5d mark two
digital SLR it was slowly revealed by
moonlight on the canon USA website about
three weeks ago I would like to see /
read a review about the new camera if
possible see that's funny because
someone else wrote in and asked why we
haven't reviewed the blackberry storm
yet here's the thing those products
aren't actually out yet the cannon
should be shipping around the end of
november hopefully we'll get an early
review unit but we haven't yet there's
no release date for the blackberry storm
although we're hoping it'll show up
around October we can't give something
an official review until we actually
have it but we do have lots of great
coverage of those products and many more
even though they aren't full reviews yet
at our gadget blog crave and finally
bishop jackeline has a request for us
here at cnet TV put the soaps back
online oh okay and that will do it for
this week everyone keep that feedback
coming mailbag at cnet com or send me a
postcard to 35 second street san
francisco california 94 105 see you next
time
