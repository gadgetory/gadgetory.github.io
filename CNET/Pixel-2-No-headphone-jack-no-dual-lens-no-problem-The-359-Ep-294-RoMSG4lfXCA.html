functioning microphone it's time for the
359 podcast it's episode what are we on
now 294 294 and hold dream team is here
Ben Fox driven Roger Chang Alfre ding
you had your hot mic moment today did it
I screwed up my microphone I'm talking
about trying to get some overtime in
here hey would you surely desert you
totally deserved by the way you deserve
oh yeah look I'm totally on the record
with you deserving overtime I think I
might have said that nobody cares about
what we were just saying what everyone
cares about obviously is Google and the
big event unloaded a whole lot of
announcements man they are going
no seriously in on Hardware what they're
going all in on Hardware so what are
they announcing I mean where do I even
start so obviously we're gonna get
started with the pixel 2 and the pixel 2
large right the XL sorry we'll talk
about clips yes they're a little
lifelogging kicks or buds we got got the
head pixel pixel book the pixel book pen
brand new daydream VR home mini home max
these are all devices we're not even we
haven't even gotten to the ones that
we're gonna try to make up like the
pixel dragon too but all right as always
if you have any questions about any of
these topics leave in the comments
section Brian we'll get to them we will
do a podcast now so look after the
questions in three minutes 59 seconds
little rusty there I forgot what I was
talking about I'm a little sick of sorry
guys you're always sick it's true we'll
get you some o2 am i doing the intro
today for the show by the way it's you
all right cool all right let's do it all
right here we go for the recording of
the podcast be back to take your
comments and questions in the chat in 3
minutes and 59 seconds from 3 to
welcome to the 359 I'm Alfred Inge I'm
Roger Tsien I'm Ben Fox ribbon where do
we even start with Google's event today
well let's get started with the pixel -
you know they announced their follow up
to the first Hardware phone that they
had what were your thoughts on it
I was I was disappoint by a couple
things right though no headphone jack
which sadly Apple's already killed and
then no Doolin's camera which I was okay
with I feel like it's become the
de-facto for any kind of high-end
premium phone you got to have two lenses
you know I think Google did a good job
of explaining away why they didn't need
it
you know we've got AI and machine
learning we could do bouquet effects we
don't need two lenses for that first of
all I'm so sick of hearing the word
bouquet if every single announcement
it's awesome all right fine I mean if
you won six y-you can just call it
portrait mode but yeah they basically
said you know we don't really need the
the hardware for this we don't need two
cameras when our software is able to
kind of detect the background and you so
we have this portrait mode shot without
really needing to spend more money on
two camera lenses for it right so I mean
what do you guys think I think that the
the big hesitation that I would have
about this phone is that it's missing
the headphone jack other than that I
think that it really hits all the major
elements it does a lot of really
impressive stuff also if you're at all
interested in google lens which is there
are mented realities slash image
recognition concept the only place you
can get it at least initially is going
to be through the pixel phones so yeah
they're really trying to sell this thing
and try to get it moving in the market
ahead of you know and for all trying to
get it some all criticism of not having
dual lens like their their single lens
camera scored the highest DxO mark which
is sort of like this industry benchmark
as the highest score ever
beating out iphone 8 plus which itself
just got the highest score ever a few
weeks ago
and to be fair to google like looking at
the iphone aid which is which was the
newest flagship phone available up until
now this phone is different looking it
does provide a lot of new technology
into it
and it does give people a good reason to
upgrade I would think so yeah you
brought up the headphone jacks earlier
where she said was a problem that it
didn't have but I you know after seeing
what they had with the pixel buds oh
yeah I don't really think that's an
issue for them I mean the pixel bugs are
an expensive accessory they're like 150
bucks but I mean the the real-time
translations that way seem to work
it's kind of awesome that's easily worth
a hundred and fifty dollars on it is
incredible I hope the UN starts using
these things because I am interested to
see how it actually works one of our
colleagues Sean Hollister was able to
speak Japanese to it and he said that it
worked perfectly fine there's like I saw
the video there's a second delay as its
processing the language but then it just
spits it back out it works pretty well
like if you can imagine two people
wearing these buds and actually having a
conversation with each other I am
interested to see if it works on any
device with Google assistant and not
just the pixel two though so we did
confirm that the but the translation
feature only works with the pixels that
is unfortunate because I would have
loved to buy that just to use that you
know and lastly what we do have to talk
about the Google home family get a
little bit bigger the Google home Mini
and the mass the mini to compete with
the echo dot you know it's around the
same price around the same size except
Google obviously threw some shade at
Amazon here you don't have any weird
lights or ugly buttons all right this is
cool fabric to go up against the home
pod you know to show off the quality of
their speakers it's it's still cheaper
than the home part though right I I know
that these no no it's more expensive
it's three it's $399 for this one isn't
it right and the main pot it's 340
million that does not usually happen all
right that's all the time we had for
today's show for the rest check us out
on cnn.com I'm Alfred Inge I'm Ron Chang
I'm Ben talks Riven
thanks for listening know
okay you can't you can't here not
because Roger wasn't here for that
Roger what row of the show because Meyer
what had happened was he's like wait for
the ED where I like whisper a swear word
he was trying to outro it and you know
saying like thanks for joining us David
or whatever but he just he would get to
actually say goodbye on his own terms
they crossed White's okay so you know as
its wrapping up David it was pretty
awesome so yes we will try to end with
the damn it as often as possible I'm
like you Bob like what is going on here
it's okay you missed you many fun this
is a Late Show our late shows are always
a little punchy 3:59 after our day wait
we didn't even get to like some of the
products the clips by the way I don't I
really don't know that those are gonna
sell I was gonna say harder like I am
sure with that to say like I really
don't think these are gonna sell but
look you never know so I don't know
things cost well 250 150 oh what's it
like why you're right it is - I remember
when I heard the prices like what the
idea of like ambien picture-taking for
your kids or yeah that's or whatever at
the same time the price seems too high
and I think people have gotten pretty
freaked out about just like privacy
privacy issues with some of this I can
see like big-name vloggers like buying
it so that they don't have like carrier
yeah yeah total right for certain people
in certain usages definitely no no no
they said they were specifically
targeting parents and as a parent
yourself would you
no no no I also don't have $250 Paris
you don't have that kind of puzzle
income you're right like I already
my cell phone camera and at the same
time like yeah taking out your phone and
taking a picture it does take you out of
the moment
a little I do want really worth the
extra expense I would argue against it
for myself personally so I would note
that this feels a bit like a rehash of
the HTC re which was this very little I
guess little-known camera look kind of
like a like circle which sounds like a
screech all right yeah he kind of held
it there's a little bun there like a
periscope and it was like the whole idea
was like this will this will keep you
from being out of the moment right you
just click on this and you'll just have
these photos or videos or whatever and
then sell well at all and there was no
remember right there was only a few
years ago it was even that long I don't
think that Clips has a viewfinder on it
either which means that you might end up
just getting pictures of people's feet
sometimes which is a problem I guess it
depends on where you put it yeah that's
weird also they're saying that the AI on
it like helps it like find faces and
photos and shots like it won't really
take a photo of like somebody's foot
yeah I don't know I mean like saying AI
is gonna solve everything yeah in these
president notice that there was a lot of
like machine learning this AI buzzword
buzzword yeah buzzard machine okay okay
hey bouquets also they actually they
didn't say bouquet garnet know they
support remote data they say they
support remote they said neural beam for
me yes Noro be like oh you guys can't
stop yourselves from just these buzz
words I mean it sounds cool no one knows
what they mean but yeah I spent the
entire thing just trying to account for
who was the most uncomfortably nervous
on stage they are stickers yes they are
sticker stuff because you have to you
can't tell you can't tell where they are
on telescreen
I feel like that's very endearing these
are this is like a very big stage for
some of these folks and I think a lot of
them are our engineers that are working
this feeling bored but
one dude who is comprised of 90%
flopsweat I'm sorry but like yeah I know
these are professional presenters no I
get it I guess SuperDuper mean but
that's that that's how I got through the
event was being distracted by like oh
this poor soul and to be fair I don't
I'm not a professional presenter yeah I
don't think I would do any what that's
why they gave you a podcast yeah yeah I
would go up on stage and like just puke
and he just gave a podcast cuz there's
no one left
yeah my mom always told me a face for
podcasts we've got we've got questions
I'm hoping we do have some questions so
let's start off with with an ongoing
conversation that gets kicked off by
several people and he'll being the most
notable can someone please explain the
love affair with a headphone jack I have
an iPad with what if I want to do high
fidelity listening I'm not going to be
using a phone Dane Thorman goes on to
expand with seven-plus for a whole year
not cared about the headphone jack and
once that's it just I will say this that
the headphone jacks originally were like
I got a stick with this you know I need
my headphone jacks kind of thing well
you know the product for iPhone users it
has kind of gone away yeah like I I have
an iPhone 7 I've managed fine I actually
forced me to switch to Bluetooth
headphones I feel like Scott when Scott
Stein's in here talking about it he says
that it's a bigger pain in the ass then
I think it's a lot of people readily
it's a bigger pain the but if you have
invested in nicer headphones like I had
a pair of Bose headphones they're kind
of nice to use on my phone but but with
the dongle room how often does this
happen to you though where you know you
get on the train or whatever and then
you put on your headphones like oh your
your headphone batteries are dead
that is absurd to me and I should never
happen or you forgot your Bluetooth
headphones yes yeah I like that's the
worse that to me is like the I hate I
mean I don't have Bluetooth headphones
but I would hate for that to happen and
that's my biggest reason why I've stuck
with like traditional headphones right
and going going back to the question I
think primarily what bothers a lot of
people is is that that headphone jack
has been a universal input for so long
and now
there are three different inputs you
either have lightning or USBC or the
regular headphones yeah and I think that
does does get kind of gets confusing for
me because I carry a pixel and and an
iPhone so I've got you of lightning USB
I won't say that an audio jack sorry
you're forced to carry two phones at all
like the pixel buds to me though is like
kind of a good glimpse into like what
the future of headphones could you know
because before I had always been this
kind of like they're just headphones you
plug them in you use them to listen to
stuff that's it but now it's kind of
okay well if we're gonna make them
Wireless and we're gonna put all this
wireless capability in it anyway what
else can we add to it right you know you
can control it they were like swiping it
and things like that it translate rings
languages yeah that's kind of Awesome I
think I think this is just a lobby from
the Bluetooth people this is all
conspiracy I like that idea I agree with
you Alfred however I do like the idea of
getting headphones packaged with your
phone you already spent $600 which by
the way last year the pixel did not come
with the headphone and I don't think it
does and it doesn't come it just comes
the dongle I'm glad you were saying that
because James was just asking about that
yeah no headphones sorry yeah we means
that I mean the idea is who's gonna give
a word it's like you have the headphones
already you can just plug into the
dongle but it's kind of weird that they
didn't supply a USB see one just the
standard once you have a deal with
dongle this Apple gave you the option of
going dongle lists you know the first
Android phone also didn't have a
headphone jack and came with a dongle to
the first yeah that the G why would you
not have a headphone jack Wow yeah you
know what standards are a lot lower oh
my god it's a phone that has like oh
wait yeah the headphone thing was not
also I'm sure I'm pretty confident that
if you even tried playing music on that
phone and like just died like I mean how
how did you yeah did you phone did you
use it to listen to music not really
yeah yeah more questions more questions
all right going back into the chat
James favor again he's become one of our
best contributors
they say anything about iMessage working
on the pixel nope no they said you can
transfer it over me like James may have
asked that question yesterday about
iMessage no no I messages it's not for
you it's not something that would be
announced at a Google event be announced
at an Apple thing say hey we're opening
up iMessage Apple would never ever like
a little make down announcement
that's a good point too I'm tired out
all these green bubbles I know I'll put
up with my Tech's mess with my blue
lights the tyranny of the blue bubble
man Green has sometimes it's really hard
to stay balanced between your
conversation and like this is my message
rolling the pod yeah there was some
relevancy to the bubbles all right I get
it this is your a green bubbler don't
don't come in all right all right dude
he's running the show
yeah all right let's get a couple more
questions in here yeah how many for
hanging out it's been great having you I
know it's been a long day most you
already probably watched the entire
keynote so it's cool that you're
chilling with us yeah totally as we just
laugh about stupid crap
Vince Nicolas does this come with
honeycomb or gingerbread
oh no it's Oreo yeah it's coming up with
the new version is he is he talking
about like the the pixel book like
what's this question yeah wasn't last
year what was last year no getting
nougat there's Android n right yeah yeah
oh yeah jelly bean was a while ago yeah
all right let's talk about translation
for a second some people are wondering
what the value of it being built in on
the phones through the phone from the
buds to the phone when there are apps
elsewhere that probably work just as
well that you could access that's what
I'm saying
you died through a home assistant it's
not as I guess it's not a seamless
system that is like the idea is like
you're just you know you're tapping a
button on your ear you're saying some
words and almost and it pops up on your
phone I think the idea would be
especially if yeah I've been that it's a
little bit more seamless than just
having to open an app do you think that
they're gonna open it up to like
third-party like apps though where you
know that would be it seems like from
you know the kind of limited use that
the program's just miss being just for
pixeled and I think they're gonna keep
this kind of contained it's kind of
disappointing I hope that would at least
open her up till like the pixel one it
made and maybe a hardware thing yeah you
guys have the specs handy here I don't I
won't pull them up please do on laptop
in the meantime let's talk about the
colors is the blue going to be exclusive
to Verizon from what we understand
please oh right the kind of blue kind of
blue I love their color names like red
blue they love their color dame's by oh
they really love me they really great
because like you get all these like BS
names is like Cobalt
yeah but I feel a steel blue I feel like
Google definitely packs itself aback a
little bit too much for like clever we
are with our now free can you give us
your best shot I want to do that some
bets Abebe just willing to happen so
throwing this out there what do you
think of Verizon continuing to get the
exclusive deal I mean it's funny that
t-mobile I should put out their
announcement before I got my Verizon
announcement that like you can get
basically half off on your I think if
you like trading your phone you get like
half off the pixel pixel to which is the
same deal they had last year wait I
don't get it do you have to bring the
pixel to if you I'm sorry you don't you
I think you bring your you could bring
your Verizon pixel to t-mobile and like
they'll take your phone and like swap it
out or whatever I filled the deal was
but either way they're like they're
trying to get in on it
oh absolutely like ship phones yeah all
right pixel pixel to specs courtesy of
cnet.com all right display size 5 inches
for the pixel to 6 inches for pixel 2 X
441 PPI that's a pixel density per inch
yes
versus 538 16 by 9 aspect ratio 18 by 9
X aspect ratio on the XL let's look at
their like why do we not have their like
I'm assuming it uses the Qualcomm yeah
it should the processor yeah it's not
like listing that on our spec site for
some reason well at least you got the
display size that's probably the most
important no Thank You Alfred yeah let's
get to a couple more quick questions
before we call it a day
Jarett topping Hey oh no I'm sorry
that's what we just covered he was
asking about the about the specs Nick
Hill aye
Nigel I'm not sure if I'm pronouncing
that right and I apologize do you think
the LGV 30 problem could take place on
the pixel 2 and is the problem the the
band problem on less brightness well
sure I don't even know that questions
about not really sure what yeah it's a
snapdragon 835 okay I'm sorry the LGV 30
problem yeah what of us more info yes
you please give us more what problem are
you referring to because it sounds like
a good talking point but I'm not really
sure where you coming from
IP 67 from James again is that the same
as the new iPhone at least the water
let's see I believe it is actually think
it's yeah and thank God they finally got
to like water resistance on this one
because the original pixel didn't have
it yeah but it was kind of disappointing
although this one doesn't have wireless
charging Joe's a little disappointed
about I hate to use the word table
stakes but I don't think wireless
charging is table stakes quite you know
I feel like when Apple talking about
table stakes what does that supposed to
mean he's just the baseline it looks
like it's a gambling term you need to
have this even play the game
okay I've never been to sea yes before
poor guy I rather know what gambling is
Nike trying the back in the v30 band
problem where the brightness is less I'm
still not sure what that's referring to
I'm sorry I don't I don't I know I'm a
band is in radio band or bright band is
in I don't know I I admittedly don't
know a ton about the V 3030 band isn't
like maybe the upper screened like the
separate display uh it's a screen
problem as LG is supplying the screens
for XL - OH
LG's providing the OLED screens I get it
I I was even a web sorry I'm well aware
of the V 30 have a problem I may have
read a little bit about this like
randomly brightness and dark rooms
Irina's grainy and dirty and as hard as
a horizontal brandt banding all over it
that's what he's referring to so
hopefully we're gonna ban okay hopefully
they fixed some of that because the V 30
is not a new phone like not a super new
phone a few months old right it gave
like if this was a software issue at
least gave Google a little bit of time
to like smooth it out before they
announced the pixel yeah I wouldn't be
as worried because the V 30 I mean
that's made by LG's mobile division so
I'm sure there was some issues there
that Google is basically just using LG
is a supplier of one component so yes I
think it's less likely where you got
surprised at all that the pixel to
dinner and try to do the whole like
fullscreen thing that everyone's trying
to do now no I wasn't surprised because
of all the leaks but yeah at least it
doesn't have an arch and at least it
like costs a reasonable amount of money
yeah like $1,000 for a notch phone I
don't know people people are still gonna
like show off the iPhone X as pads day
one no I'm gonna go with ax whoa you
know Brian Brian yelled at me I can't
win with you guys I said ten yesterday
and Brian and say yes I mean he also
says Mary oh so
Michael Browns got my back on that one
though no iPhone tax it sounds 90s I
feel like I should be drinking a man
it's extremely is extreme Here I am on
my scooter my ex all right we got one
more question from John Constantine
great name but oh hey ah do not kill me
this is a great kind of jump off point
cuz we haven't really talked much about
the pixel book yeah sorry we totally
know what that thing well here's here's
a great way to kind of bring it all home
John Constantine would any of you
referring to everyone here at the table
be willing to use a pixel book
Chromebook on the podcast I certainly
would on the podcast browsing for stuff
and occasionally like sending an email
to Ben yeah I would use it I don't think
I'd shell out like $1,000 for it that's
the only issue that is I mean
Chromebooks are popular because they're
cheap yeah so a high-end Chromebook
seems like I think I know I don't get my
money somewhere like a high-end Amazon
tablet like that force themselves into
that market was by being the lower-end -
and like currently like four if you
wanted like a really good you know
Chromebook anyway that's only about like
$600 and that's still even like pricey I
mean I did used a Samsung Chromebook
like nine while I was out at Def Con and
I used it for like a full week and it
was great but I'd maybe maybe app sorry
maybe Google is looking at this as kind
of like how Microsoft is doing a lot of
their surface yeah halo product yeah so
but it's it's yeah but being a
Chromebook I agree that Chromebook
usually means it's supposed to be lower
you're like the partners have done a
pretty good job of making Chromebooks up
here I want to buy like that was the
issue with Microsoft they decide to make
these surface books because they want to
sort of set the agenda for what these
should be yeah but I think you know this
is exactly they're like point they're
trying to compete with the iPad pro and
the
um like surface books not you know other
laptops out there I think it's trying to
directly compete with like the
convertible like hybrid market and if
I'm comparing this Chromebook versus a
surface book and iPad pro a surface pro
yeah surface Prytania I would probably
go with the the pixel book mm okay
because I miss access to like Android
apps as well right right yeah okay and
that's about all the questions we got
for the day at least that's all we can
cover for right now I do have one
question for Roger that has percolated
since you've been out sure
so Apple has the OLED screen so that
they're getting from Samsung yeah do you
think that there could be a second
supplier out on the wings at some point
whether it be LG or somebody else yes
definitely yeah I in fact I mean I was
surprised LG wasn't involved this time
around right
especially because like Samsung like
they're like blood enemies I mean well I
mean there's still some pending
litigation but like they've really kind
of ratcheted down the hostilities like
Apple really is pissing on Qualcomm now
like that's their that's their big enemy
he has two things at the same time
exactly I've tried for you guys if you
liked what you heard today anything P
