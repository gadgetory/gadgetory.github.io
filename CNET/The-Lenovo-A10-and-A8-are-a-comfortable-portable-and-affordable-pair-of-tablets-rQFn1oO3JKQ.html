slates that are both portable smooth
performing and affordable for cnet I'm
xiomara Blanco and these are the Lenovo
8 8 and 8 10 tablets aside from size and
color options both models are similarly
SPECT the pair ship with Android 4.4
point2 and how's one point three
gigahertz quad-core processors the eight
inter offers up to 16 gigabytes of
internal storage while the tenant ER
offers 32 gigabytes however both offer
micro SD card slots they have a smooth
and soft matte finish that wrapped
around the rounded corners making them
comfortable to hold in landscape mode
the left and right edges are straight so
your thumbs effortlessly rest on them
and set them on top of the nearby
speakers there's no app tray so all of
your app icons are scattered amongst a
variety of menu screens the menu screens
are easily customizable however if you
don't organize them into folders or
additional menu pages it can get
disorganized quickly you also can't
easily uninstall all of the included
software both tablets also have 1280 x
800 pixel resolution screens but with
188 pixels per inch the 88 looks sharper
than 10 enter at 149 HD video is still
decently sharp on the a-10 but the large
app shortcuts on the home screen are
obviously pixelated the IPS screens do
have good contrast and respond quickly
to touch performance was surprisingly
smooth with few hiccups large apps
download quickly with a high-speed
connection and though they don't load
immediately it's only a couple seconds
before the app opens lenovo packs a few
different camera modes and even more
customization options to make the best
out of the modest 5-megapixel rear
shooters the photos are most impressive
on the slates themselves with animated
options like panoramic in multi angle
settings coming to life on the vivid ipf
screams the a series feature
front-facing dolby audio speakers
are actually pretty impressive most
tablet speakers are weak and tinny but
in comparison these boasts rich full
sound but toying with the Dolby audio
app is necessary to fine tune your media
the 8 inch model starts at 179 and the
10 incher starts at 249 they don't rock
the sleekest aesthetic or super HD
screens but with their smooth
performance rock and speakers
comfortable design and affordable price
the Lenovo 88 and 8-10 are one heck of a
deal for more information check out my
full review on cnet once again I'm
xiomara Blanco and this is going to
first look at the Lenovo a eight and
eight 10 tablets</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
