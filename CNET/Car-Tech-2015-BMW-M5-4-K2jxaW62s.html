because I can't wait to get behind the
wheel and frankly this car needs no
introduction this is 2015 BMW m5 hop in
it and take a quick spin now here in the
cabin we've got what's BMW standard fare
now next-generation iDrive infotainment
system you've got this big 10.2 inch
really wide screen in the dashboard that
we control with their iDrive controller
now some people really like this
interface some people don't it has a bit
of a learning curve but largely the
interface is pretty well organized and
things are about where you expect them
to be especially elected we've got these
sort cuts on the controller that allow
us to very quickly jump to what we're
looking for we don't spend a lot of time
poking around the interface now one
really cool feature about this
generation of iDrive is that when you
get into the addressing tree you've got
a bunch of options for entering an
address you can use voice commands you
can use the knob based interface or
right here on the iDrive controller you
can actually write with your finger to
get a little bit of handwriting
recognition of course voice command is
very good you can enter that dress in
one go it's a really good setup here now
down here you've got the controller for
BMW shift by wire controller for the
7-speed DCT now it's one of those
electronic shifters that returns to
centre and I believe there's no park
setting on here so in order to put the
car into park you've actually got to
pull up the ebrake and then just put the
car in neutral and turn it off it'll
automatically engage the parking brake
itself it's a little bit confusing the
first time you get in the car but trust
me it won't roll away I'm flanking the
controller here we've got the various
different buttons for toggling the
performance of the engine the suspension
and the steering all of these are
adaptable on the m5 and we've also got a
little toggle right here that allows us
to adjust the firmness of the shifts of
the dual clutch transmission now up here
in BMWs instrument cluster we've got a
very simple buy gauge set up that very
cleverly integrates the low profile LCD
that's going to have readouts for which
setting your engine your suspension and
your steering are in as well as your
current fuel economy and rain
so what are we working with here under
the hood we've got BMWs 4.4 liter v8
engine that's gonna have a twin scroll
twin turbo charge system the upshoot of
that is 560 horsepower and about 500
pound feet of torque but we haven't
stopped there we've also got the
optional competition pack which is going
to further sharpen up this already
ultimate driving machine it's gonna make
the steering a little bit stiffer in the
sport plus mode the suspension a little
bit more refined and also give us about
15 more horsepower this particular
vehicle puts out 575 horsepower when
it's at full bore now earlier today I
got to chuck this car around a twisty
bit of road and well it's amazing how it
transforms at the touch of a button
now back we've got BMWs active
differential which is going to do a
little bit of torque vectoring which
helps tuck the vehicle into corners when
you're pushing it really hard and
underneath us we've got BMWs adaptive
suspension which is gonna do a lot of
physics-defying things adding grip to a
vehicle this big as annoying as it is
around town it's just that awesome when
you're really pushing it so the moral of
the story is always Drive your BMW m5
like a madman
now to get behind the ultimate driving
machine you got to pay to play we're
looking at ninety three thousand six
hundred bucks just to get into the door
but we've also got a $7,300 competition
package that's gonna sharpen things up
give you a little bit more power and of
course we've got almost ten thousand
dollars into these carbon ceramic brakes
though there's some expensive Stoppers
all in with destination charges a few
more options and a big gas guzzler fee
you're looking at a hundred and fourteen
thousand seven hundred bucks for this as
tested example
