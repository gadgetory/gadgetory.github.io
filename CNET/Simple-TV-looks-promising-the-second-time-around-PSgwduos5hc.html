the new simple TV a year ago simple TV
debuted with the ability to take over
the air broadcasting and deliver it for
watching on the go on your browser
well now the latest version of simple TV
software allows you to do it on tablets
iOS and Android and be able to not only
watch live streams of what you have on
your box but to also watch reported
episodes on the go and download them on
that specific device for offline viewing
pretty snazzy package simple TV also has
a 2 tuner model available for 249
starting in December that allows you to
not just record two shows but to serve
up two streams of those shows at once
and five users can log in they can watch
a sports show or they could watch a TV
episode and you could do that on a TV
you could do that on a browser you could
do that on a tablet simple TV is a kind
of a great tool for out of the box come
to cord thinking people who don't have
cable it doesn't work with encrypted
cable but it works with over-the-air
very very well and we'll have to take a
look at this further down the line when
we review one
I'm Scott Stein and that's a look at the
new simple TV and its software which is
backwards compatible to older simple TV
users who have the first version</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
