2014 we're working a bit of a cleaning
demo from a brand-new scuba from iRobot
the company that makes the Roomba this
is the scuba 450 here on this
demonstration it's clean up a floor that
had a bunch of gook on it some old
coffee some Cheerios some ketchup and
what's different about this scuba is
that it's completely redesigned from the
last model that came out three years ago
this time around there's a three cycle
cleaning process because let's be honest
sometimes things on the kitchen are kind
of stuck on the tile so on the first
cycle it'll go around clean up all the
dry debris like the Cheerios and it'll
also lay down a thin sheen of water or
if you have the I Robot scuba solution
it'll also lay that down and then the
second time around the scrub brush kicks
in and finally it'll go through once
again with a squeegee to make sure
picked up anything that it left behind
the toilet process should take about 20
minutes for about a hundred and fifty
square feet it's really easy to pop off
the tank you just press the button it
comes off and you can access the clean
water compartment and empty out the
dirty Bardo compartment if you need to
clean the scrub brush you can also pop
that out easily too underneath you'll
find a brush that cleans up dry debris
there's also a scrub brush for really
getting it clean it spins at 600 rpm and
there's also a squeegee there for taking
up all the rest of the dirty water on
the front of the scuba you'll see a
clean button that will light up to show
you the cycle progress there's also an
information button that you can press
where the scuba will talk to you it'll
let you know if something needs to be
changed or if the waters low and there's
also a button that can set the size of
the room so it knows to cover a large
area or a small area when the scoop is
done and you dumped out the dirty water
you can put it on the dry dock charging
and drying stand where it'll give it an
air dry cycle to keep things
fresh the Scooba 450 makes its debut
here at the show it goes on sale this
week for $600 here at the sea net stage
at CES 2014 I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
