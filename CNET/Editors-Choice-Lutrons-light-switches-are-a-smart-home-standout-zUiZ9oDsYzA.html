show you what I think is some of the
best connected home tech that money can
currently buy it's the Lutron casada in
wall dimming switch over the course of a
couple months of testing here at the
smart home the Lutron switches have been
exceptional they've worked with
everything we've tested them with
they've always been reliable the light
that come on we've one of them the
integrations of all work we can control
them using voice commands they're just
very very smooth reliable nice smart
home gadget now unlike some other smart
switches the Lutron casada switches
don't use Wi-Fi radios instead they
communicate using the Lutron clear
connect signal it's a proprietary
language that they use for that reason
you'll need to have a Lutron bridge
plugged into your router to act as
translator but it's easy to set up and
everything works really well aside from
turning things on and off at the switch
you can use Siri voice commands because
these are apple homekit compatible
lights you can say Siri turn the kitchen
lights off or turn the pantry light off
here you can say turn all the downstairs
lights off all of that will work if you
program it in the app Lutron switches
work with Alexa too so if you enabled
that skill you can tell Alexa to turn
the lights on and off in just the same
way other useful integrations include
wink and if and also the Nest Learning
Thermostat which you can control right
from the Lutron app the same is true for
popular smart thermostats from Honeywell
and ecobee compatibility is a huge
strong point with Lutron all in all
Lutron's
involve Demming switches really check
off all the boxes that I look for in a
good smart lighting product they work
reliably well they work with a wide
variety of different products and
services and they have a very good set
of features available right out of the
box with to switch starter kits that
come with the bridge starting for about
190 dollars and additional switches
selling for about 60 they definitely
don't come cheap but there's still a
worthy winner of CNET's editor's choice
distinction and while we're saving up
for if smart lighting is something that
