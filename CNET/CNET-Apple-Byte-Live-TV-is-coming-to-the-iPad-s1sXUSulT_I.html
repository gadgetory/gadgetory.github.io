the apple pie for all the good and bad
stuff inside the world of Apple so let's
get to the show now the iPad has been a
success and more media companies are
jumping on board to the evolving device
according to Bloomberg HBO will make
their HBO Go streaming service available
on the iPad and other mobile devices in
about six months for free for pain HBO
subscribers you know people have been
waiting for HBO shows like entourage and
true blood and HBO is not the only one
who wants in verizon also announced they
will release an iPad app that will allow
FiOS TV subscribers to stream live TV to
their iPads over their local Wi-Fi in
their home the iPad would be treated
like another TV screen since it has to
be used locally so verizon doesn't
expect any problems with content
providers now the iphone 4 is still
awaiting that's launched in other
countries there's still no verizon
iphone but of course we're already
talking about the next-gen iphone
TechCrunch is reporting that Apple has
already built prototype phones with Near
Field Communication chips for testing
it's a short-range wireless technology
that's used for many things including
mobile payments and I was able to check
out the tech in Japan as far back as
2004 now apple recently hired an NFC
expert for their mobile commerce
division and we've also shown you a peek
at their future app ideas for shopping
and use me iphone for travel now we're
playing catch-up to other countries but
this is the future so it's something to
look forward to now in slightly
disturbing news Wired magazine
discovered that the man who runs Apple's
App Store process is quite the developer
himself Phillip shoemaker also happens
to sell iphone apps under the company
name grey noodle apps like I whizzed are
described as simulating the experience
of urinating for a long time and the
life-changing animal parts can let you
make an animal but facing forward Bart
root drop or whiz now it's pretty
obvious we are throwing out the bad
apple on this guy
and I'm just really glad that these are
the people approving apps that could
potentially change our lives all right
let's check out a quick tip for getting
PDFs on your iPad step one and maybe the
most challenging step is actually saving
your document as a PDF now if you
haven't done it before you may be
confused as to how exactly to do it on a
Mac instead simple you actually go from
the print menu and you can actually save
as a PDF from there we find that the
easiest way to do it is just email the
document to yourself we just downloaded
a free epub there are a lot out there
this is David Copperfield by Charles
Dickens a 3.9 megabyte file once it's
downloaded you can click on it and it
opens up a preview within email now at
the top there's an open end button you
just tap that and it actually shows you
all of the apps that can read that will
pick I books and it imports it really
quickly and then it adds it to a library
that's a parallel library to what's on
your book collection on your iBooks app
now the difference here is that you
can't really change the font sizes and
as you notice there's no pretty
page-turning you're going to have to
deal with just side by side scrolling
another nice thing about PDF files
they'll retain all of their color and
graphics as well so if you have big
brochures or digital magazines those
work great too now if you don't want to
email it to yourself you can always
simply do it from itunes the same way
you would with epub or other files when
you connect it within iTunes you can
choose to add it within iTunes under the
documents area you can add the files
that you want so that's it it's a more
diversity reader than you think and it's
really easy to get files from your email
if you're using PDFs I'm Scott's dinan
us how to read PDF ebooks on your iPad

other news we've covered the battle
