until now and the pixel slate is the
first that's a convertible tablet in the
Chrome family that Google announced
today and it's hardware that in New York
the pixel slate starts at $5.99 and it's
a 12 point 4-inch screen with a really
nice 3,000 by 2,000 display now attached
to it is this separately sold $200
keyboard that has all the features that
you'd look for in a convertible keyboard
in that the back angles are adjustable
which is a really nice touch a magnetic
it automatically attaches it and is
powered through the slate so you have to
worry about any separate charging and
it's got a full backlit keyboard and
it's got a very large trackpad connected
to it slight kind of feels like a
Microsoft Surface and I think that's the
idea is to create a footprint that you
can do work on easily detach and you'll
feel comfortable enough on this that you
have I mean it's a really generous
keyboard this doesn't this is a pretty
large footprint here on a table so
similar to surface you got to leave
yourself some room but the slate only
comes in one 12 24 inch size the price
however varies over a spectrum $5.99 to
start but it goes all the way up to
$15.99 at the top-end that's a lot
depending on what processor and what
storage you get at the baseline say
Celeron processor 32 gigs of storage the
pen is also separately sold this is $99
so you're gonna want the keyboard you
probably would want the pen if you like
drawing pressure sensitive and it feels
really comfortable it's kind of like
what Microsoft is doing with surface and
what Apple is doing with its pencil the
features on Slate are pushing forward
what chrome is going to be doing on
tablets more split-screen assistant
features that are baked in to provide
suggestions of what to launch the next
and the whole thing feels kind of like a
pixel phone or Android meets Chrome and
again that's the idea now the price of
this is going to push it into a
territory where you're looking at laptop
price with all the accessories or an
iPad pro for all that it does it
ye'll promising but if you're paying all
of that money for all the things that it
brings to the table would you want
something else there are a lot of
affordable Chromebooks that are out
there and slate much like last year's
pixel book is perching itself at the top
end I can tell you that the keyboard
with a circular keys
feels great to type on the trackpad
feels great and the machine feels really
solid as you can see here the angles go
all the way back or they go all the way
from third or this flips around and can
become a case for it as well where you
can travel with it in a folio mode also
take note that front power button or the
power button on the side is also a
fingerprint sensor pretty cool and the
front facing speakers are on either side
providing enhanced audio pixel slate
seems like it's the beginning of a
really good trend for where Chrome
laptops are going to go and from tablets
will this be the one for you stay tuned
