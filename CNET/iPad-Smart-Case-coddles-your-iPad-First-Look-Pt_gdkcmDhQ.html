ipad 2 about a year and a half ago the
accessory they announced right along
with it was the smart cover this very
simple $40 flap with magnets on the end
that attached pretty magically to the
end of the ipad 2 and became a must-have
purchase for a lot of people it's
versatile but it never protected the
back and they used to make a folio case
for the original iPad that did totally
ensconce the original iPad device now
apple has released a smart case and what
is it well you'd like to think that it's
like a smart cover with a back and in
fact you could take your smart cover and
attach it back to it a third party one
that'll cost you anywhere from ten to
thirty or forty dollars Apple makes a
case that does seemingly what that
advertises but really it's just a folio
case that's not bad but it's kind of a
throwback case the cover here although
it looks like the smart cover doesn't
detach it's all made of polyurethane and
it's very sturdy as a nice secure feel
all around nice comfortable grip and a
suede like microfiber interior it comes
in those six mostly pastel colors that
you've come to know out of the
polyurethane Smart Cover green blue pink
red also dark gray and light grey this
is the dark gray model and a forty nine
dollars it's ten bucks more than the
cost of a smart cover you just pop it
right in here and you're good to go and
it's really I think best used for
regular reading for a folio mode it's a
folio case and when you pull it back and
use it like this and hold it has a nice
comfortable feel but it does add some
extra bezel to the edges which if you're
going to get a little critical in terms
of look and feel makes it a little bit
different in terms of the weight rests
and when it's in keyboard mode and going
to that it rests a little bit
differently and if you're used to typing
a lot on the virtual keyboard on the
iPad that might throw you off this also
stands up in landscape mode just like
the Smart Cover but it rests pretty
wobbly in a way that I really couldn't
recommend for most people what would I
use this for I've use it as a go-to
folio case and if you loved the original
iPad case that black microfiber one that
is kind of a dust magnet well you're
going to love this because it
heels around the edges in terms of the
way that cover Nestle's in and the the
total package is like the return of that
unlike the smart cover there are no
magnets here in the hinge though there
are magnets inside the top lid like it
is the case with a lot of ipad cases
which wakes it up from sleep when you
open it on an iPad 2 or 3rd gen ipad but
polyurethane covers everything on this
iPad except for the dock connector the
silent mode switch and the camera lens
on the back even the volume buttons are
covered up here which is actually kind
of nice because if you're looking for
protection maybe even a little bit of
splash resistance this does feel like a
pretty nice overall seal there are a lot
of other solutions out there in ipad
cases at forty nine dollars this is
really not a bad one at all I'm Scott
Stein and that's a look at the new smart
case for the ipad 2 and third gen ipad</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
