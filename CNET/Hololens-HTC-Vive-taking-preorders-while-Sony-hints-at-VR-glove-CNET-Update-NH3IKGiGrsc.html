put on your face I'm Bridget Carey this
is your see not update the next wave of
virtual and augmented reality headsets
are moving from the fantasy hype
dreamworld into the real world
microsoft's hololens is now available
for pre-order if you happen to be a
computer program developer with three
thousand dollars to spare microsoft is
only offering the preorder sales by
invitation and even then it will not
arrive until march 30th in the US and
canada microsoft wants to limit these
early models in order for programmers to
create a library of apps now remember
hololens is not virtual reality you can
see through the screen images just sort
of float around your field of vision
that's augmented reality you could think
of it as mixed reality we also know a
little more about the unit itself it has
two gigs of ram 64 gigs of storage and
it weighs about 1.2 pounds it's wireless
and the battery should last for two to
three hours packed into the visor are
multiple sensors to know your movement
along with cameras microphones and a
light sensor to detect the environment
around you and that's not the only
headset getting attention now anyone can
pre-order the virtual reality gaming
headset by HTC it's called the HTC vive
and it costs eight hundred dollars the
first batch is arriving to customers on
april fifth if 800 bucks sounds a bit
pricey that's because it's much more
powerful than other headsets it has a
motion tracking system to let you walk
around a room there are the sensors you
put in the room so it knows how you're
moving your whole body and it also comes
with this own wireless motion controller
sticks but you won't be walking around
too far in the room it needs a cord to
be connected to a powerful gaming PC and
virtual reality gaming will also get a
big push from Sony this year with
PlayStation VR there have been a few
early game demos of the PlayStation VR
which may be out this summer and it's
going to use move hand controllers but
perhaps the next generation will not
need you to hold anything to navigate
the world
maybe you just wear a glove sony has
filed a patent application for a glove
controller that would detect how your
fingers are positioned and a pressure
sensor to know how much force you're
applying and you can even get some
pulsing feedback on your hand to know
what you're interacting with the patent
was filed back in 2014 but it's only
coming out now the Nintendo Power glove
was ahead of its time but maybe this is
what the power glove should have been
that's it for this tech news update you
can head to cnet.com for more from our
studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
