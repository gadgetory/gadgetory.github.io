but I will finish it
the technical challenge is just that the
eight shots are very complex and so
there are more of them so you know the
the harder thing about this movie was
more grander scale grander action the
greatest thing on this movie is is the
level of detail in the rendering the
skin textures the fur textures the the
the eyes
it was difficult at first because I
never worked with it before I had to do
the scenes with the Apes and then
without so I had little pieces of tape
to represent the Apes and so I had to
look a certain way and stuff like that I
was just reacting to how I would
normally react if I was in that
situation
it's like shooting any other movie other
than the fact that you have dots on you
right it's different for her because we
do a scene together all of us right and
then we leave the scene and she has to
do it by herself in the same way as if
we're there so it's a harder gig for you
know a human but that performance is
better when we're together they'll use
that it's just harder and posted to
render it
you take the performance that's shot on
the day and then you live with that in
the cut for months and months and months
and you create the drama all around that
so it has to work in its own right and
then or in the background then the
visual effects team get to work and then
you know the shots get replaced one by
one this one is a purely wetter
operation and you know they're my old
team from that from back in the day on
Lord of the Rings and you know the guys
there know my face and facial muscles
and air practically every single single
expression I'm ever capable of making
more than anyone else on the planet I
think
it's like a master class with a great
actor well he didn't give me technical
advice he gave me acting advice I mean
he gave me you know those guys I had to
jump into this world that they had been
in for a long time playing a chimpanzee
and yet at the same time letting that go
and play this little guy who's just so
excited to be around new friends you
know that was the character that's
that's what you play the physical part
that you drill over and over again and
try to embody has to be second nature
once you get to that point so that's
where that help came in it's the closest
thing I've done to theater in film which
is if you would have told me that before
I knew I would have been I would have
