exploding hoverboards I'm Bridget Carey
this is your scene that update this
year's hot holiday gift is just way too
hot for some companies to touch and buy
hot I mean fire and explosion go boom
hot you may know it as a hoverboard or a
balance board but there are now some
safety concerns with these mixes between
a skateboard and a Segway in some models
the lithium-ion batteries are Catching
Fire and it could be because some are
poorly made overstock is no longer
selling hoverboards and it appears that
amazon is pulling some of these
hoverboard products until the sellers
can provide documents that prove they
meet safety standards one popular brand
called swagway shared a statement with a
few media outlets about this now swagway
is cost around four hundred dollars and
they're cheaper than most high-end
brands that can go for around fifteen
hundred dollars but there are knockoffs
being sold for three hundred or two
hundred dollars and you need to stay
away from those the government is now
getting involved the United States
Consumer Product Safety Commission is
currently investigating these products
after reports of hoverboard fires and
several major US airlines are now also
banning it from carry-on or checked
baggage in fear of them Catching Fire if
you want to be safe remember that a
price that's too good to be true
usually is and you may want to buy
directly from the manufacturers website
to check that it means safety standards
and if there's a warranty because the
higher quality brands that go through
safety checks do offer warranties now
also watch the weight limits and don't
write if you weigh more than the limit
and if you do get one for a gift please
take it slow he needs more practice and
there's another big tech gift expected
to cost some drama this year drones if
you get a drone as a gift you're gonna
need to register it with the government
and this is not just for new drones it
applies to anyone who already owns one
the Federal Aviation Administration said
that US residents must register drones
online and you can start as early as
next week Monday it's free if you
register by January 20th but after that
there's a $5 fee failure to register a
drone can result in a fine
even if it's a small quadcopter you only
fly in the backyard it applies to
anything weighing about half a pound 255
pounds
there are fines if you don't register a
civil penalty could be as high as twenty
seven thousand five hundred dollars and
there's a time limit for anything
purchased this week or earlier you're
gonna have until February 19th and you
have to renew the registration every
three years yeah that's another $5 fee
each time the FAA is doing this to keep
a tighter watch on how people are using
the airspace because this year the FAA
had more than 1100 reports of
potentially unsafe drone use that's it
