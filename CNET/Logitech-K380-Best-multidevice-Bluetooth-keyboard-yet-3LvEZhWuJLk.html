laptop tablet and phone for starters
which is why logitech keeps putting out
multi device wireless Bluetooth
keyboards the company's newest model the
K 380 cost $40 and comes in the blue you
see here and a dark grey and is one of
the best compact full-size keyboard
logitech's created to date the first
thing you notice about it is that it has
a little bit of heft to it which makes
it suitable for use with the desktop
computer though it's still light enough
to take with you on the go you can set
it up to pair with three different
devices and press one of the numbered
easy switch buttons in the top left
corner of the keyboard to toggle between
them the keyboard can distinguish
between Mac and Windows machines as well
as Android and iOS devices and map keys
to supported functions and shortcuts it
also sports connectivity with Chrome OS
devices and Apple TV I like the feel of
the keys and they're spread out enough
to keep miss types down to a minimum
this is a true desktop replacement
keyboard and I wouldn't hesitate to buy
it over Apple $69 Wireless Keyboard
which is only designed to be used with
Macs aside from the multi device support
the other selling point of the K 380 is
that Logitech says that the two included
triple-a batteries will power the
keyboard for two years I'm not sure how
much use that's based on but even if it
did have that it'd be good Logitech also
makes the $50 k 480 multi device
Bluetooth keyboard that model is
significantly larger and includes an
integrated slot that holds phones and
tablets I personally prefer this bottle
because the tablets I use tend to have
cases on them that convert into stands
so I don't need the slot I also like
typing better with a smaller K 380 the
keys have a smoother action to them and
are quieter it's just a better keyboard
I'm David Connelly for cnet.com and
that's logitech's k 380 multi device
Bluetooth keyboard thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
