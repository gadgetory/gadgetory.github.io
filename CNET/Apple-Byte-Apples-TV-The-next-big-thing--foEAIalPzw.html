the apple pie for all the good and bad
inside the world of Apple now the steve
jobs biography has had people flipping
through the pages to find out what's
next for Apple and if you guess designer
turtlenecks you're probably wrong but if
you guess Apple TV you might be right
now in the book SJ tells Walter Isaacson
I'd like to create an integrated
television set that's completely easy to
use it would be seamlessly sync with all
of your devices and with iCloud no
longer would users have to fiddle with
complex remotes for DVD players and
cable channels it will have the simplest
user interface you can imagine I finally
cracked it now you can bet this
reignited the apple TV rumors and the
New York Times claims the new interface
that will get rid of clunky remotes will
be Seri The Times reports that apple
officials knew as far back as 2007 that
they wanted to make a dedicated TV and
their sources also claimed a year ago
that there were large parts floating
around for Apple's prototype supply
chain that looked like they could be
parts of an Apple TV as well now doesn't
appear that a standalone Apple TV is
still coming anytime soon but analysts
are guessing by the end of 2012 for 2013
release now another way you might be
able to control your TV could be with
the use of hand gestures after a patent
application from Apple was made public
and specifically points to hands off
control on devices like the iPhone and
iPad without touching the device now the
goal is to minimize the need to
physically interact with these devices
because of their smaller size but we can
also see this being applied to larger
screens as well now in other future
Apple product news how could we not
mention the ipad 3 Cena reports from
sources that one of the biggest
challenges for manufacturers is making a
dense 10.1 inch screen with a retina
display like resolution now currently LG
and Samsung can get displays that are
twice the resolution of the ipad 2 but
the challenge is making large quantities
to meet apple's demands for a product
that's really a quantum leap in pixel
density and if they can't do it we can
all get excited with the ipad 2 s
alright let's take a quick break and
check out our iPhone app of the week
it's Halloween and everyone is carving
pumpkins so why not check out the carve
a pumpkin app it's free and you'll pick
a pumpkin choose to carve out a face and
send a picture your friends and trust me
it's a lot better than embarrassing
yourself shut the pipe and done my pump
wow that's really good look look at my
Egyptian pyramid Ryan that's a triangle
what no no in my textbook in them no
that's a big sloppy isosceles try what
see now do you want that happen to you
look just check out the app and is
something fun during the Halloween
season alright Apple delivered some
treats early this week with speed bumps
of the entire MacBook Pro Line graphics
card improvements for both the 15-inch
and 17-inch pros and larger hard drive
capacity options on all models now the
form factors remain the same and it's an
incremental bump so the only people
should be mad are the ones who bought
one within the past month or so also
apple released updates to its iPad Smart
Covers with interior colors that now
match the exterior colors for the
leather ones who and they replaced the
throw up orange cover with a dark grey
color all right onto the quick bite
Steve Jobs book is likely to be the top
selling book of 2011 according to amazon
and when a book sells this well usually
a movie follows earlier this month Sony
Pictures acquired the movie rights to
Walter Isaacson's biography and the
writer they're targeting is Aaron Sorkin
known for writing the West Wing TV
series a few good men the facebook movie
and most recently Moneyball now apples
expected to debut a new pilot program
that will let customers purchase
products from apple's online store and
pick them up in person at one of their
retail stores it'll be limited to select
stores and roll out two more locations
later so look out for that and finally
