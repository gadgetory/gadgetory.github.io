with a brand-new bunch of comic book
movies making waves the avengers age of
ultron Batman vs Superman ant-man and
all the sequels that will follow we
wanted to figure out what are the top 5
best comic book movies of all time this
list is sure to be controversial so
shall we get started at number 5 is Iron
Man this is the movie that kicked off an
incredible connected Marvel Cinematic
Universe if iron man was a dud there
might not be an Avengers or Avengers 2
brilliant casting with Robert Downey jr.
as the jerky yet incredibly likeable
Tony Stark directed by Jon Favreau it
had the right mix of action and humor
that Marvel Comics has at its best and
number four is the 1989 Batman a movie
that should not have worked at all
beetlejuice the guy who directed
Beetlejuice and Jack Nicholson really
like that's gonna work Batman said its
own for what a grim and gritty comic
book movie could be sure Batman couldn't
turn his head but did you care Batman
had such cool gadgets and their Joker
was off kilter as he should be number 3
Marvel's Avengers this movie pulled off
the impossible it balanced a large cast
of heroes and a large cast of villains
this movie took years to set up and each
character in this movie acted in line
with the way they did in their own solo
movies add to that this is the first
really good theatrical Hulk don't get me
started on angley's Hulk or the
Incredible Hulk it gets me angry before
we continue let's quickly talk about
some honorable mentions Hellboy for
successfully adapting Mike Mignola indie
comic book in spectacular fashion then
there's blade I saw the trailer for this
movie after the stink of Batman and
Robin was released and people got
excited by a comic book movie again
that's impressive number two Superman
from 1978 you ever noticed how the Man
of Steel Superman Returns didn't really
get the tone of Superman right well
Superman 78 did it featured an amazing
performance by Christopher Reeve who
actually made Clark Kent and Superman
appear to be different people Clark Kent
stamford and had bad posture Superman
was all confident projected his supernus
don't think too hard about the plot
though since it boils down to Lex Luthor
running a real estate scam with nuclear
missiles and the number-one comic book
movie
ever is dark night this is like the got
by the park to of comic book movies
Katie Holmes got the boot for Maggie
Gyllenhaal whose character is then
killed by a version of the Joker that is
wholly original this joke is an
anarchist who drove Batman crazy because
his patterns defied the logical rules
that Batman lives by Heath Ledger just
steals the show as a joker Christian
Bale Michael Caine are terrific together
and Chris Nolan put together a fantastic
story not even get to mention to face I
could probably keep on you hammering
about comic book movies forever so go
ahead hit me up on Twitter if you want
to talk i'm at is for more top 5s like
