reporters roundtable thanks for
listening to that show listen one of the
things that we didn't talk about in the
interview we just did with Mike Daisey
and Charles Duhigg was a memo that Tim
Cook the CEO of Apple put out about
working conditions at their overseas
plants that memo is being reported on
widely including on cnet we have a full
story on it I wanted to get Charles's
response to that memo since what Tim
Cook is talking about although he
doesn't use the word New York Times in
the story is the reporting including the
reporting from the New York Times that
is being done on working conditions so
before Charles left to skype I dialed
him back up and we had a very brief
discussion about Tim Cook's response to
the reporting on Apple's working
conditions well the story obviously has
been developing quite a lot and just a
day after one of the New York Times
stories came out about the harsh working
conditions at the foxconn plant and
others CEO Tim Cook who is the
operations guy at Apple until he became
CEO and who in fact is the guy who moved
apples manufacturing to the state where
it is now or the country where it is now
wrote a memo to employees and also said
that anything that says that Apple does
not care about every worker and supply
chain was patently false and offensive
Charles Duhigg is still with us here and
I understand you've seen this memo you
any response based on what Tim Cook said
here they have seen the memo and in you
know our response to anything as always
that we stand by our reporting we worked
we worked quite a long time on the story
and feel very comfortable and secure in
our sources and I haven't gotten a
chance to speak with mr. Coker with
others about what specifically he
mentioned he doesn't mention the New
York Times story in the piece in his
letter except to say that we stand by
our story and and feel comfortable with
it ok it's a I think it's an interesting
response that he has an
you know to go to what we said at the
end of the show here where you and Mike
were talking about the constant drumbeat
of criticism and attention this may be
wouldn't you say a step in the right
direction if the reporting that you did
in the reports that other people have
done there are accurate so to have the
CEO of Apple say we are focused on
educating working on quoting from his
memo we are focused on educating workers
about the right so they empower to speak
up when they see unsafe conditions etc
do you think you're having an effect hey
I really can't say I mean the without
doing reporting it's unclear how to me
how people inside Apple saw our story
and whether they even saw in the first
place except to say that you know I know
based on the reporting that I have done
that there are numerous people within
the Apple including I believe from what
I've been told Mr Cook who take issues
overseas seriously on and and I think
that this reflects the the fact that it
has been a priority for the company okay
all right well thanks for that response
again the story keeps developing Apple
CEO Tim Cook on the record saying we
take working conditions extremely
seriously and we will continue to report
on this that's seen it as of course New
York Times will as well thanks again
Charles it was a great to have you on
the round table thank you take care you
