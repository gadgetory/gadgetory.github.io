headlines around it first of all dual
motors which predicates all wheel drive
and secondly you've got some autonomy or
auto pilot technology let's run them
down quickly now a Model S traditionally
had a single motor at the rear driving
those wheels these new d cars at a
second motor at the front to drive those
wheels to the tune of 188 horsepower at
each end if you get a P or performance
model like we have the rear motor gets
bumped way up to 470 horsepower and the
front a bit higher to 221 for a massive
691 total that gets this nearly 5000
pound car to 60 in just 3.2 seconds
range is down but only slightly from a
standard rear wheel drive model s that
means adaptive cruise that maintains
speed and distance to other cars along
with the ability to come all the way to
a full stop and resume to be honest
nothing other cars didn't have a couple
years ago ditto this cars new ability to
read speed limit science and alerts you
to the correct speed now highway Lane
changing is interesting you can do it by
just signaling our car currently just
does the acceleration part for you but
automatically a change steering is
coming as well self parking in a Tesla
means the car not only parks in a spot
that you pull alongside of but
eventually will bring itself out of that
spot and to you at least on private
property now autopilot is Tesla's name
for what will eventually become full
self-driving but which is coming now in
phases of driver assist is p85 D which
are top of the stack performance dual
motor models are coming in at around a
hundred and six thousand base and then
we would add about another eight
thousand dollars in options but due to
the almost ten thousand dollars in tax
credits available at least here in
California we end up actually below the
MSRP but still not a cheap car this
technology will also be very interesting
as we see the all-wheel drive get much
more accessible in the coming model x</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
