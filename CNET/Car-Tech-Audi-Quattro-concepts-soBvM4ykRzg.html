com we're on the floor of the 2013
frankfurt motor show taking a look at
two very different audi quattro concepts
the first behind me of the sport quattro
which celebrates 30 years of the quattro
name which belong to a historic rally
car as opposed to a bare-bones
four-wheel-drive rally car we've got
very sophisticated all-wheel drive
gas-electric hybrid now you can get
about 31 miles of electric only rains
from its 110 kilowatt electric engine or
if you really put your foot down you can
take advantage of a full system total of
700 horsepower and 590 pound-feet of
torque by getting that twin-turbocharged
v8 engine into the mix the v8 engine
also has variable displacement
technology so it can also drop down to
just four cylinders when you don't need
all of the power for cruising about and
all of that is going to be up underneath
a very kind of cool-looking design it's
got some very muscular shoulders really
big thick pillars in the back that are
meant to evoke the original earth
Quattro and inside we've got a lot of
technology including a head-up display
and the full LED instrument cluster of
course Audi's full array of dashboard
technology that we've seen their current
line of vehicles now let's take a look
at the other audi quattro concept the
nut quattro now we're the sport quattro
that we just looked at is very German
this Luna Quattro is very Italian it's
actually designed by the italian company
that designed the a child is on parkour
that we saw at geneva earlier this year
it's actually got some very flowing
curves a lot of hints in here what I
think the next all rates going to start
looking like particularly in this sort
of headlight and in the smaller sort of
side blades that you get on the side now
not under the hood because this is a mid
aged and vehicle but sitting over the
rear wheels you'll find a v10 TDI engine
that's going to output well over 700
horsepower and well over 500 pound feet
of torque so it's actually designed to
be as
on road as it is off road and as fast in
both conditions so you've got the
Quattro all-wheel drive system putting
power down to all four corners you've
got an active air suspension that's
actually going to allow you to raise and
lower the vehicle by about an inch and a
half from the static ride height and
that's actually tied to the GPS system
so if you're on the highway it'll sit
lower but if you turn off onto a gravel
road it'll raise itself automatically
you don't have to do anything there now
all that power and torque is going to
flow to the wheels by way of a 7-speed
automatic that s tronic DSG transmission
now both of the concepts that we looked
at our two seater coops this one's a
little bit more crazy you've got things
like the vertically hinged doors the
audi sport concept actually only have
the regular doors or whatever but
there's two very different ways of
looking at where out he's going to take
their quattro technology in the future
something we're going to be seeing like
hints of the sport quattro in the next
s5 and maybe hints of this new nut
quattro in the next out er eight of
course without the variable suspension

the 2013 frankfurt motor show taking a
