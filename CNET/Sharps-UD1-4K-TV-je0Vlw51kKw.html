here with the new sharp you d-1 4k
television this is sharps first 4k
television on the market obviously 4k is
the new buzzword essentially what it is
four times the resolution of 1080p so
you're getting 3840 x 2160 pixels not
much content to cover that at the moment
so what we're really looking at is an
upscaling television which can accept
1080p and some 4k content at the moment
they have their own revelation 4k
upscaling which they say looks better
than most competitors what we have is a
smart TV suite as well the television
comes with most of the features you'll
see on the other sharp televisions
including a smart central smart TV suite
with a dual core processor also this is
a edge-lit television with no local
dimming unfortunately it's not quite Ron
its standard LCD and also it comes with
a 240 hertz processing engine the design
is new there's a new stand for the
television as well as front mounted
speakers and two subwoofers at the back
with a 35 watt sound system what we're
looking here is a very thin bezel which
is made of aluminum and it gives a very
stylish look to town of course which
sharp is done for a few years this
television is now available on the
market you're looking at about seven
thousand five hundred dollars but you
can see it from retailers such as Amazon
and best buy for around six at the
moment we're going to try and get our
hands on this TV as soon as possible so
check out cnet com for updates on the
sharp you d-1 television</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
