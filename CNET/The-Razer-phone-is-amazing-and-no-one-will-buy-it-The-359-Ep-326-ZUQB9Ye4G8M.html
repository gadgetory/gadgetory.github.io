Ben Fox urban I wanted to kick things
off with CNS review of the razor phone
no not the old Motorola RAZR this
Android phone is built by the laptop
maker razor and features a bunch of
high-end specs it's also big and built
like a tank
but the marquee feature is a display
that refreshes a hundred twenty times a
second or twice as fast as most phones
which gives it this illusion that it's
buttery smooth and faster than anything
else out of the competition
I mean you've looked at the review what
do you think hey China Hollister does a
good job of really saying the good and
the bad about this phone apparently the
camera is matte the battery is met but
if you are going to use it for gaming
right then maybe there they're gonna
find their their interested customers
which is I think why I'm a little
skeptical about this this phone one I
mean Razer is a known brand among video
game makers it is not a mass consumer
brand so I don't know how many people
are really clamoring for a phone made by
a video game laptop maker okay
that's I mean you're you're right about
that the only the other thing is okay
what do you what do you think about the
fact that it's bringing back the next
bit Robin yeah so next bit was purchased
by Razer I think earlier this year just
for additional background next bit its
claim to fame was it tapped Tom Tomas
one of the original Android guys
mai-chan also another Android guy as
well Scott Croyle
who was the HTC design engineer who
created the HTC One so a lot there was a
lot of hype behind that company it got
bought by Razer and this is the sort of
the first product that's come out of
that cooperation hmm you know it's kind
of cool I think I like the fact that
next bit is kind of living on in this
phone but at least this particular first
actually like like you mentioned Sean
sort of has some issues with this right
the cameras not as great barely it's not
as great right they make it interesting
for gamers again so the the screen is
supposed to be really good and it's also
got Dolby powered speakers yeah front
face is going back to just my general
view
on phones is that this is a different
phone you know kind of like the moto
phones or different phones that doesn't
mean that like the Moto is for everybody
it obviously isn't but at least we're
getting to a point to a certain extent
with phones where it's not all the same
black slabs although this is a ok giant
black slab with a few features that are
different than the other giant but the
fact that it's marketed as a gaming
phone
I don't even razor what would really
push that too hard because truthfully
how many out there yeah I really need
all this all these high-end specs on
that royal alright my Play constantly
Korean so plays simpson's tap dad that
does not be a special price I know I
know
oh man that takes me back yeah I mean
I've got I've got an old PC version of
the civilization game loaded up on my
phone nice not PC but and it'll be
amazing no razor phone works just fine
on my iPhone and on an Android phone so
ok oh it's it's $700 by the way so
they're definitely pricing it as a
flagship oh yeah alright next up we
wanted to wish a happy birthday to the
text message which turned 25 on Sunday
yep yeah the first text message was set
on December 3rd 1992 by a British
engineer basically sent it via computer
to a mobile device and you have to
imagine how clunky that mobile device
was back in 1992 what was the first text
message you want me to say it's Merry
Christmas which granted people still say
today as opposed to a highboy which was
the first thing that was said on a
telephone from Alexander Graham Bell so
memorable
yes yeah so ahoy to everybody it's just
that we've gotten to the point I know
there are a lot of studies about how we
rather text and call people now I
thought actually I've used text messages
less because I tend to use either
iMessage or facebook Messenger line
what's that there's so many more
messaging app yeah but like and I would
say the text message is you know the
forefather of all of those things for
sure those things like stand on the
shoulders of the original text messages
fact I like I'm one of those folks who's
annoyed now when I have my iMessage blue
bubble burst in the green when when one
on
person comes like oh you broke the chain
you broke the chain unbelievable I don't
really annoy alright for those stories
and more chickens on a scene at a murder
chain I'm Ben Fox driven thanks for
listening all right welcome back
everybody that's the end of the
recording of the podcast I'm gonna go
ahead and start filtering through the
chat to see if we got any good questions
or comments for the guys in the meantime
let's start right off we got a comma
here from Jorge he says razor was the
first phablet okay I have to I am always
impressed with our viewership wait that
they might know they met his current
razor phone there's a first phablet no
no that razor made the first phablet I
think that was you might have to check
the archives for the actual historical
records on that one right now we
generally Samsung is the first to
popularize the idea of a phablet with
their Galaxy Note line I think Dell had
a 5 inch phone that like nobody bought
which I think for me at least my memory
was the first jumbo phone that came out
there it was actually he might not even
marketed a phone I might add marketed as
a tablet okay
there's maybe the viewer is talking
about the razor edge which is a Swiss
Army gaming tablet back in 2013
yeah which which I think Samsung
probably predates that yeah anyway but
this is definitely a whacky looking
tablet because it's got like controller
handles on the side good lord is well at
least yeah but like that's that's Razer
for you is that if it's optimized for
gaming you're gonna do it even if it
physically looks weird or clunky and it
goes back to their phone to their phone
is like a big chunky heavy phone but if
you want to use it for gaming or maybe
for like a lot of other laptops and
computers are like that too and I mean
look at the Nintendo switch now I would
just say that just for the record the
original Samsung Galaxy Note came out
October 29th 2011 mm-hmm all right okay
I'm curious as to if anyone out there
has actually tried the razor edge and
what your experience with it
and maybe how it stacks up to like uh
Nintendo switch to nowadays right right
yeah I I don't think I've ever seen a
razor edge out in the wild which which I
don't think that something you take in
the public I feel like you're just
asking about it but you're asking it
mugs if you're playing that thing I
don't know what that is but it's clearly
liable and I'm gonna steal it now you
don't little wet willy is no no edge no
no the edge is gonna if I'm like I'm the
mugger and I'm looking at someone with
an edge I don't know what that thing is
but it's clearly expensive and I'm gonna
take it all right William jolly and the
chat is actually looking forward to this
razor phone as I'm sure a lot of people
are if you are going to pursue it we'll
have more on the review throughout the
day if you do actually pick one up we'd
love to hear your like direct feedback
feedback feedback feedback feedback like
for a horse we'd love to hear your
direct feedback as hands-on as users
because you know we have our
stipulations that's what we have to
follow for the reviews and Sean did a
really fun review I actually found
witches in say who's in San Francisco so
no we didn't touch the phone we did not
hear okay we're regurgitating his words
to you yes and he's the one that spent
all the time with it so yeah and he's
also I mean he's a gamer so he
appreciates the Razr like that's a thing
like I'm not all phone reviewers I think
are necessarily fans of the company ya
know about Razer gaming laptop so he had
a really good perspective on that yeah
and I I think that you would probably
have to be a pretty big Razer fan to go
for this thing because it's a camera is
a big reason why a lot of people get a
phone and the fact that it's not that
good in low light but it's still a $700
phone maybe if it was a little bit
cheaper the expectations would be a
little bit lower so I mean I think
there's that kind of false assumption
that if you've got a super strong brand
with really loyal following they'll
follow you to whatever product you make
and that's another sort of the case
right a lot of these folks are there
already wedded to their iPhones or their
Samsung Galaxy S or their pixel phones
right like it's and it's hard to change
that out right so you know just because
you're you're a loyal razor laptop gamer
doesn't necessarily
gonna make that job right and there's
also no headphone jack I'd like watch
and then a phone this large doesn't have
a headphone jack this is just like they
hate they make a freaking cup of coffee
have two headphone jacks a headphone
jack they just don't care anymore
there's just like the technology
industry in general is so much check at
this giant phone except a headphones
yeah listen we live in a courageous
world I know I just like it's very
frustrating to me just put a headphone
jack in your phones or the water
resistance right
water resistance it's not water
resistant oh that's a problem yeah but
that's also why it's not stupid
expensive oh can I share something it's
pretty but not stupid expensive that's
all next tier measurements listen I'm
going on official business jargon here
about how we categorize right the phone
prices so I so I got a Galaxy s8 like a
week ago and that's supposed to be
waterproof water resistant water
resistant for 30 minutes and 1.5 meters
of water right so I dunked it in water
yesterday just to try it out yeah no it
was fine it was amazing but then it
wouldn't charge so I had to restart it
so so do not mess with your phone's I
mean it's really more of like you drop
your phone I don't think you look in the
toilet or something yes I purposely go
dunk in your phone that's not what it's
really intended for okay I'll remember
that next time my phone is okay I scoop
ice cream with mine do we know if it's
going to be sold unlocked I'll check it
out I'll see if I can find it to be sold
unlock yeah most of them are any yeah I
mean the next bit Robin was remember
that in the meantime let's take it one
from Scott Myatt all right no let's jump
to sir enjoy first actually because we
were talking about Sean's direct review
and that's something that caught my
attention as he said how how loud the
stereo speakers are on that mm-hmm and
he demonstrated yes with a little piece
of paper
bouncing on yeah that was really kind of
nice as they're arguably better than
most laptops speakers he experiences
these days and serene joy says I don't
mind bezels when there are packed with
quality stereos totally yeah that
private goes back to the HTC
that scott coil worked on it was known
for having he's boom there they brenda
did boom sound speakers and they were
basically the the top and front dozens
were or chin were basically speakers yes
it's nice to see that that's I should
have brought that because yeah there's a
utilitarian function to having a space I
think a lot of people are I wanted to
give it a pass yeah it's cool as that is
and yes I'm kind of on board of that I'm
not listening to the speakers on the
phone yeah never for no reason I mean I
might have interesting because I have
when I was single and I was just by
myself like I've got a kid the with the
iPhone 7 they even did advertising
around the speaker yeah you remember
they had it like in a little bit of
water because they added the water
resistance and then they had two sets of
speakers so I don't know like full-blown
speakers like the ones you see here
mm-hmm they just add a second set of a
bad speaker bad but just just just sort
of like average speakers yeah that's
fine and I mean there's a time and a
place for that whether you're out with
somebody I hate real quick check this
out check this out right I get that but
there's no point in my life when I'm
going to actually depend on or care that
much about the fidelity of the speakers
because I'm not using this primary
entertainment device right so going back
to the previous question the razor phone
is available unlocked it appears on
razor zone.com which is razors specific
websites I don't believe it's being sold
by any of the carriers right this is
sold directly they're using me I don't
think anyone's like come to ATT will saw
your phone which is better than having
an exclusive I would imagine yeah except
sort of part of the problem is like
there's a whole chicken a problem with
that rather you don't have any carrier
relationships that means you're
basically shut out of a vast majority of
Americans because most Americans buy
their phones through their carriers
mm-hm
so they're really going after bet this
is a niche audience phone right do you
really have to go out of your way to
like get this phone and then set it up
to your point and I really hate to say
you're right about things
ya know the idea that like companies are
doing things differently we saw a
central order this year now we're seeing
razor-like it's kind of nice to see
these other companies come out with
different phones even even if there are
a lot of challenges and struggles and I
don't think it'll sell that well like
it's kind of cool to see other companies
yeah and then with different devices and
their best ideas will get implemented by
you know the top dogs that right that's
what and yeah I would love to see so
these other companies adopt the 120
refresh rate I don't know what's the
benefit of that we're just say that I
kind of like 20 refresh rate 20 refresh
I guess that's like a new feed-in speed
that you can mention you know and you're
getting through like the processor so
it's 60 again it makes everything seem
like it's moving faster because the
screens refreshing so much faster - okay
I don't I'm not that impressed but okay
it's great for gaming
speaking of gaming and niche audiences
do you think people watching internet
streaming broadcast will also get
interested in the razor phone and not
only gamers I think this is not exactly
that it is a big pretty screen and the
speakers itself comes into play as an
entertainment device as a pseudo fact I
would agree in general any sort of like
multimedia video would probably be value
useful for this phone that being said I
don't think that any of the top phones
available like the iPhone 10 or the
Samsung Galaxy Note 8 are really lacking
you know in those areas you know like
maybe the speaker because they did a
really good job amping up the the Dolby
speakers but otherwise you're you're
gonna get a really good screen on those
evens like what the screen size this
small generally like handheld device is
like as much as I was just talking up
the 120 refresher like doesn't make that
big of a difference on a small screen as
opposed to like a giant it's not gonna
be like a mind-blowing like a like on a
huge team yeah for folks who are just
looking at this as an entertainment
device I don't think they'll even know
about it because it's unless they go and
seen it but you know they're not they
don't know what Razer is they don't they
don't know but its legacy is a gaming
company and so I don't know if they'd
want to take a chance on the $700 phone
from a company they've never really so
going back to a
seneschal by the way do they have an
exclusive with Sprint they do okay so
that's that's the thing is though like I
walked by one or two Sprint's doors and
yeah if essential plastered all
over the place so I guess to a certain
extent razor could have benefitted from
one of the four major carriers going out
of their way be noted well maybe not
sprint but you know what was it the
Google pixel - yeah totally better
solutions with Verizon and variety
pitching that phone yeah I see those
commercials everywhere yeah so yeah
there's definitely a benefit to
partnering most consumers hate
exclusives because it shuts them out of
options but handset makers like because
they get that extra boost and if you get
the right partner like Verizon is just
basically blanketing the airwaves with
commercials about pixel phones
that's that gives you awareness that
gives you a lot of a lot of interest
yeah and you can still buy a pixel - if
you want to unlock yes
directly through Google alright we're
just about out of time but imagine soggy
says so true that no one will buy it
it's really just for gamers and I think
we are an era of niche phones like the
upcoming red phone tell me about the red
phone that's the one with the like super
mega camera yeah it's from like red like
the they make the high-end cameras for
films they were like their major
innovators for 4k and yep you see them
in a lot of film processes that supposed
to be like crazy like you talk about
super expensive
I mean camera with a phone on it nobody
much yeah
yeah yeah I I find it interesting that
you know despite the the phone market
being as mature as it is you know like
cell phones have been around for a long
time now there's still these niches that
different smaller players are trying to
find to get it I think that's because it
is such a valuable industry it is if you
can even get a small piece then it's
it's a while yeah yeah that's true all
these like purpose-built phones are
reminding me of the Garmin Garmin
actually made a phone one no yeah it was
like through the like the the dying days
yes yeah but like they've totally
pivoted to
siddhart yeah they've switched to their
company completely doing wearable so
yeah I mean like they did that success
no that was back when like their you
know the car GPS was a record business
and they saw the right in the wall that
like smartphones were gonna just destroy
that business like they came out with
the phone it was just like a terrible
phone with GPS honey that wasn't novelty
that was back before like Google Maps
apparently it was a it was like a GPS
like it was just a different form factor
really it was yes yeah exactly like what
other companies try to get into making
phones it doesn't always come I did I I
don't know like that definitely piqued
my interest about the red phone I'm
certainly curious to learn more about
that one all right
I've been sitting on this one as I think
it's a perfect note to go out on
specifically then this one's all up your
alley Scott Maya now people are heavily
investing in Amazon hardware tablets
fire TV echo do you feel this is the
right time for Amazon or smartphone
we have discussed this a lot between
there's been a lot of debate there's
been a lot of debate as to whether they
would do it is it too late I mean to a
certain extent they don't have to
anymore Alexa is the big product right
for Amazon hardware and they've already
started integrating Alexa into other
phones yes so do they need to make their
own phone at this point maybe maybe not
there is a rumor from India from months
ago about them developing the ice phone
there was no like there was like bounds
Fame it does sound fake and it came out
and then there was absolutely no
follow-through afterwards everybody
picked up the story this is supposed to
be like a cheap really really cheap
phone yeah for the emerging market
theoretically but I don't which I had
been saying for a long time makes a lot
of sense for Amazon like a super stiff
they did if they did in the emerging
market the problem is if they did
something for like the US Canada Europe
and did a big splashy phone again it
might be too embarrassing or too much of
a risk even for Amazon oh yeah I don't
know if they'd even risk the headlines
of like you know the rest
of the fire phone I just want they don't
want any mention like Q Phoenix Rising
headlines unlike a bunch of other mad
Pines I mean like if it was successful
then it would be like a good Phoenix
that also a bad Phoenix I don't know but
either way that's a question that's a
great question and it's very many hit on
something that we've been talking about
for a long time here yeah and I think he
goes along the trend of like the phone
is still the most important device in
our hands like these companies want to
have that presence and Wow Amazon's
Brees been pretty successful at getting
Alexa into other phones it's not like
the core part of any of these phones and
so they are kind of missing that like it
they've got they got a lock on the home
well this with the smart speaker market
but they don't quite have that with the
the phone market and they sort of see
Google coming out there pushing Google
assistance so hard that you know that I
have to imagine some of them have to be
worried a little bit about losing out on
the phone market yeah and the problem
one of the many problems with the fire
phone was is that I think that it was a
little too obvious that they were
basically just trying to show you stuff
yeah they were trying to create
amazon.com as a phone right and there
was just too much of that was was pushed
and forwarded into the device and they
did a much better job with Alexa of
being like this is something here to
help you and we're not just gonna try to
keep selling you stuff with this I mean
every feature on that phone was designed
to make you buy mores right it was like
pushing you into the amazon.com funnel
so I would expect that they if they ever
did come out with another phone that
they wouldn't do so on a brief dovetail
I think that Amazon's going to bring
back the wall phone the actual corded
phone in your house not the dot phone
and it's gonna work like the buttons
that you have for like Tide detergent
and stuff where it's just kind of
omnipresent in your home
oh would you pick up the phone and like
yeah like Jeff I need more paper towels
yeah exactly
I would I would buy the shoes for the
retro video throw a wrench into things
hold on can it be read can it be like an
emergency red phone like I'm the
president at phone no like I'm the
president I have a magnet in touch with
my general Batman's better than the
president okay fine well but technically
it was a phone for Commissioner Gordon
it wasn't
Batman's though Batman's phone is read
also okay either way I went I an Amazon
red phone I really hope they're watching
this pick a red phone that you just call
up Amazon customer service and they may
leave stuff hopefully via drone all
right last but not least Josh Boyd I had
a really great question that we can't
let go ignored do you think Amazon would
ever develop a wearable mmm there's
rumors of that already
there would be an Alexa wearable pair of
glasses oh yeah where it's like the same
feel though like you just sort of look
at products and like you want to buy
that thing this is like the bone
induction thing or whatever again
agency's weak to buy
well bone abductions that's just for
like first really right but like you
would say Alexa and it's like on your
face and you could just ping it all the
time I don't see a value to that product
because it's a little too weird and to
be fair they're rumors of pretty much
every company developing a pair of smart
glasses now right it's an Apple Apple
one of the Google's already tried and
then Amazon yeah yeah so dad that's one
that came out a couple months ago so
we'll see if that one happens okay I
don't know if it will I don't know if
people want to LexA on their face that
would definitely be interesting what if
it just got built into a pair of
headphones oh yeah a little more sense
yeah
don't know why you want to automatically
insert it into your eye but Alexa
contact lenses saves me I made contact
lenses are expensive it saves me money
on contact lenses yeah yeah do it if you
can fight us off of my contacts is
embedded in there you have to talk to
her all the time and apologies to
everybody smart home that we're
triggering right now her always yeah
yeah alright we are out of time though
yeah all right so our 3:59 podcast is
available on itunes tune in stitcher not
soundcloud Feedburner Google Wave music
the Amazon echo and of course cnet.com
cnet.com thanks everybody see you
