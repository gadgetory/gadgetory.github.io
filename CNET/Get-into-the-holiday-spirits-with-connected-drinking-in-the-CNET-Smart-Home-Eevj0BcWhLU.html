smart home bar it's the holidays a time
for merriment and togetherness with
family and friends maybe some you
haven't seen all year maybe some for
good reason but regardless hosting a
holiday party usually involves drinks so
we're smartening up the smart home bar
to see how tech can help you keep
everyone in good spirits
let's start with beer Uncle Phil is
always particular about his beer and you
know if you don't pour it right he's
gonna put you in that headlock and you
know now that you're 30 years old that
that's going to be really awkward so you
have to get it right enter physics this
one hundred and seventy dollar gadget is
portable lightweight and doesn't use any
gas canisters or caves put a bottle of
beer in and you can make it taste more
like draft beer physics actually uses
sound waves to mix things up and top off
your beer with a foamy head that should
make Uncle Phil pleasantly surprised and
maybe you'll be happy enough that he
won't go on and on about the folly of
your career choices at the dinner table
then there's liquor we all know cousin
sandy needs the perfect Manhattan to
keep her from yelling at your brother
mark about the way he cooks the turkey
unfortunately you're a lousy mixologist
perfect drink to the rescue
enter the cocktail of your choice and
this connected seventy dollar scale walk
you through making it step-by-step you
can search the app by name of the drink
you can search it by the ingredients you
have in your liquor cabinet and then
you'll just put your glass on the scale
add the ingredients and it'll walk you
through how much to add of each so you
can easily turn out a Manhattan and
old-fashioned so maybe grandma won't ask
you why you don't call more often or
even a whiskey sour so aunt Christie
doesn't go off on one of her tirades
about young people ruining the world you
can also repurpose other smart home
gadgets for example stick a smartthings
door sensor on your liquor cabinet not
only will it monitor the temperature for
you but you'll get a notification if it
opens so you'll know when you're younger
cousin Brandon tries to sneak some
peppermint schnapps and then lie to
everyone and say you gave it to him
it's smarter with your drinking and
happily host the holidays with connected
tech to bring liquid goodwill to the
party be sure to check back in the
coming weeks and months to see all of
our plans for the cnet smart home we'll
see you next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
