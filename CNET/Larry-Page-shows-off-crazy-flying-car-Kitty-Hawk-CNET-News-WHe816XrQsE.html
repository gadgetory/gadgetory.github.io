interview it's called the Kitty Hawk
flyer and the company is backed by
Google co-founder Larry Page but calling
it a car is a bit of a stretch it's more
like a flying boat or even a hovercraft
I guess
Kitty Hawk pontoon doesn't sound as
catchy the company hasn't yet revealed
safety features for the 220 pounds eight
rotorcraft
but one of the first test pilots wrote
of her experiences in a blog post saying
that it took just a few hours training
on a flight simulator to learn how to
fly controls are in the handlebars and
work like buttons and joysticks on a
game controller but the craziest part
about all this you don't need a pilot's
license to fly one that's because it
falls under the FAA s ultralight
category let's put that in perspective
for just a second you need a pilot's
license to fly in most drones but you
don't need a license for one of these if
you want to get yourself some air time
you'll need to sign up as a member and
that's $100 for three years membership
gets you two thousand dollars off the
retail price but we don't yet know how
much it will cost the flyer goes on sale
at the end of 2017 and will look
different to the prototype you're seeing
now unfortunately the flyer won't be
available for sale outside the US the
website says it's more jia block
purchases from other countries but
you'll need to make your own
arrangements to get it home and that
doesn't mean flying at home either it's
only designed to fly over fresh water
not salt and not fly over land
Kitty Hawk is one of several companies
working on fly cars
uber elevat is developing a vertical
takeoff and landing aircraft while
Airbus has a car / drone concept called
hop up let's hope the Kitty Hawk passes
safety checks with flying colors</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
