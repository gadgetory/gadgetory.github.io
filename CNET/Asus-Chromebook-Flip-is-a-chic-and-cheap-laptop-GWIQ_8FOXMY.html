versatile laptop that cost $300
it's a refresh of the 2015 model and
looks similar to the bigger 12-inch Asus
Chromebook flip
this tiny 10-inch version is also a
convertible so it can be propped up as a
tent fold it over as a stand lay
completely flat or simply use as a
tablet or laptop it's so compact it's a
breeze to travel with it easily slipped
into one of my smallest purses and
barely took up any space in my backpack
in beta mode the Chromebook can access
the Google Play Store and download apps
the laptop features a new processor with
the coprocessor that's dedicated to
running apps and it pays off with its
performance apps ran smoothly and
launched relatively fast as long as
there weren't many apps or windows open
in the background
unfortunately it's uncomfortable to hold
in tablet mode when the screen and
keyboard fold over the edges flare out
and uncomfortably dig into your palms
it's fine if set on your lap or on a
table but I wasn't able to hold it as a
tablet for more than a few minutes
before switching to a different
configuration even though it's screen is
on the small side and as the resolution
is rather low HD video still looks sharp
with lifelike colors I wasn't a big fan
of the ACC small keyboard though the
Black Keys give it a Macbook like look
and travel well but the spacing feels
cramped
I eventually adjusted but I have small
hands if my hands were any bigger I
don't think I'd enjoy using it on a
day-to-day basis if you're interested in
a decent small laptop for you or your
kids the tenant's Asus Chromebook flip
is a good pick however if you're not on
a tight budget
I recommend upgrading to the 12-inch
model it's got a better design faster
performance for just a small jump in
price
