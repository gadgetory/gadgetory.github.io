with traditional dimmer switches but
they also don't need traditional dimmer
switches you can change brightness
settings just by turning the bulb off
back on they're a bit like common
three-way bulbs except you don't need a
3-way compatible lamp in order to use
them they'll work with any old lamp or
light switch you've got three options in
the C and switch family the first is a
yellowy soft white bulb that offers
settings comparable to a 60 watt bulb a
40 watt bulb and the nightlight
up next is a daylight tinted bulb that
offers the same three settings just at a
more bluish white color temperature your
final option is a combo bulb that puts
out your choice a 60 watt equivalent
soft white or daylight settings plus
that soft white nightlight setting all
three of them nailed my lighting tests
to at the brightest setting each one
exceeds the state at 800 lumens so they
offer plenty of light the scene switch
LEDs promised to last thirteen point
seven years and come with a five-year
warranty that you can double the ten
years by registering the bulb online
within sixty days of purchase you use
one to replace a 60 watt incandescent
and it'll pay for itself in energy
savings in just over a year then
continue saving you money for years to
come in some these are outstanding bulbs
and an absolute no-brainer if you want
to dim the lights down low but you don't
want to rewire your switches or splurge
on smart bulbs standard nan de Mille
LEDs can be had for a few dollars less
and if you don't care about the seen
switch feature then they're probably the
better buy but I think the scenes which
bulbs are worth it and deserving winners
