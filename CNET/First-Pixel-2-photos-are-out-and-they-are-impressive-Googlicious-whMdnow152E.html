welcome to Google issues for everything
Google you can think of there's plenty
of pixel to stuff that we'll talk about
shortly but with the natural disasters
happening around the world we wanted to
showcase what Google is doing right now
now the US Federal Communications
Commission recently approved a request
for Google's Project loon to provide
their airborne balloon cell towers that
could help restore some of the cell
service in Puerto Rico now there are
obviously other critical needs like food
water and electricity but communications
is important moving forward where eighty
four point six percent of cell sites
were still not functioning according to
the FCC now the goal of Project loon has
always been to extend internet
connectivity to remote areas and this is
really an amazing way to use it for the
people puerto rico all right after
Google's keynote there's been a lot of
buzz around the Google pixel to
single-lens camera and it's rating as
the best camera ever by DxO mark so to
back up the hype the Google team posted
a gallery over the weekend of almost 40
completely unedited photos from the
pixel - and the results look pretty
amazing like these pics are backing up
that rating you can see how great some
of these portrait mode photos look but
the way it handles lighting and the fact
that these are unedited like how can you
not get juiced up about this on a phone
and we still have to see how the iPhone
tends camera stacks up now they also
showed an example of the optimal image
stabilization with this guy just running
down a sand dune the video on the right
is the stabilized one obviously now
there's so much detail and clarity here
and I would say just see this for
yourself at this link we're showing on
screen it's just really impressive
alright some new features like a do not
disturb mode weren't showcased at the
keynote with the new pixel 2 &amp;amp; 2 XL will
have the option to turn that on when it
detects that you're in a car we've also
seen it in iOS 11 where notifications
and phone calls will be muted so it's a
welcome addition also pixel 2 and 2
excels are already seen a big pre-order
response with shipping days for the
pixel to being pushed out for 6 to 7
weeks depending on the colors or just
completely out of stock and adding your
name to a wait list for the kind of blue
version or the Panda version of the 2 XL
and you know how I feel about the Panda
Panda but if you live in New York or Los
Angeles you might be in luck where there
will be a made by Google pop-up shops on
Fifth Ave in the NYC and on Melrose
Avenue in Southern California starting
October the 19th now there's no word if
any or all of the products will be on
sale or just for display also if you're
getting a new pixel two phone one of the
early benefits is getting a free Google
home Mini to go along with it and it
could come in pretty handy for you now
you can now ask Google home to ring my
phone or ask where's my phone and your
phone will notify you of its location it
even uses homes voice match feature to
send it to the correct phone of the
correct person this feature is live
right now for the Google home today if
you have an iPhone it just rings it as a
normal phone call so you won't hear
anything if your phone is on do not
disturb mode but it still works
and finally Google's way Moe is
launching a self-driving awareness ad
campaign titled let's talk self-driving
that will be rolling out to Arizona
first now waynebow is rumored to be
launching the first commercial
ride-sharing service powered by way most
self-driving cars with no human safety
drivers on board sometime this fall with
Phoenix being its testing ground it
partners with Mothers Against Drunk
Driving the foundation for blind
children and the National Safety Council
with a very positive messages but you
know what I think they need to speak to
the millennial generation a little more
so I came up with a few ads on my own
like how about this one for the young
professional I get Wei mo done on the
road you like that okay well what about
this one
when you want to slide into her DMS
after the club or whammo and chill see
I'd actually use the service with an ad
campaign like that all right that's
gonna do it for this week you can email
me at Google is just at cnet.com or
tweet me at brian tong thanks much for
watching we'll catch y'all next time for
some more of that google issues</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
