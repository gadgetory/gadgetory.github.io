human driving it is being updated though
gradually in 2014 the UN amended its 46
year old rule to allow self-driving cars
largely at the urging of Germany Italy
and France the homes of some big car
makers that are developing the machines
the new language states that a driver
must be behind the wheel and can take
control back at a moment's notice but
that they may legally pull back from
managing the wheel and pedals for some
extended periods notably this UN
Convention though has never covered
Japan China or the u.s. in America for
US states and the District of Columbia
have legalized autonomous cars on public
roads though for testing and with a
human standing by another eleven are
considering the idea 12 states have
already done so and said no this sets up
a problem in the huge and lucrative US
car market fragmentation insurance
companies or the other major rule maker
if you will so far they envision a world
where the driver is still fully
responsible though there's been a call
by California insurers to have car
makers shoulder some or all of the
liability around autonomous accidents a
2014 study by the RAND Corporation look
at that idea and theorized it could
quickly throw a lot of cold water on
self-driving cars or limit the
technology to high-priced flagships
where the volumes are low and the price
is high enough to fund the additional
liability but that puts the self-driving
cars benefits into a lot fewer people's
hands much more to come on this of
course one day it may pay the double
check who is liable in an accident due
