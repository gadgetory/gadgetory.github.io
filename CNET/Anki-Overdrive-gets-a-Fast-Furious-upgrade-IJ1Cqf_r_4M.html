the unki overdrive fast and furious
addition I've got the MXT international
I've got the ice charger I'm ready to
jump on board so let's have a crack
agree in this game it doesn't matter
what's under the hood the only thing
that matters is who's behind the wheel
or in this case who's got the phone on
key overdrive the app driven racing game
first unveiled in 2013 has had an
overhaul and this time it's all about
family with this new version that
modular track has returned and you're
still controlling your car through the
iOS or Android app pressing to
accelerate and moving your phone to
steer but now you can do it furious
style unti has upgraded the app giving
you cars and special items from the
movie franchise as well as different
character profiles to choose from the
cars on the track have also been given a
new paint job to match the ice charger
and MTX we see in fate of the Furious
and while you race you'll get enough
movie dialogue to make you feel like
you're riding shotgun with Dawn Treader
starting World War 3 the modular track
which snaps together with magnets also
has a new feel with a dedicated zone on
one track piece that lets you hack other
cars in a nod to fate of the Furious
Drive over it at speed and the other
players will temporarily lose control of
their cars the cars feature built-in
line detecting robots that use infrared
to detect line markings beneath the
track that means they can map the track
working out where the corners are and
even automatically line up before their
first race the starter pack will set you
back 170 dollars you'll get 10 track
pieces and two cars in the starter set
Don's ice charger and Hobbes's MXT and
you can expand to up to 64 pieces and
buy more cars if you're a die-hard fan
it's a fun nod to the series and a great
blend of old-school slot racing and one
yo games perfect if you live your life a
quarter inch at a time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
