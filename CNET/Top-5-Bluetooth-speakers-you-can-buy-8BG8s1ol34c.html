these are the top five Bluetooth
speakers available right now as compiled
by CNN editor David Carr annoyed at
number five is the Bose Soundlink mini 2
it comes in two colors carbon and pearl
what does normal people call black and
white it's pretty hefty at 1.5 pounds
but it's really slick the Bose Soundlink
mini 2 is a fine speaker for your
bedroom or kitchen at number four the
JBL charge 2 plus what makes this
speaker great sit down
let's talk it's called a charge because
you can use it to charge other devices
over USB now it's not waterproof but it
is splash proof so using in the shower
may not be the best idea
however this thing is loud for its size
and number three the UE boom - never
heard of UE now you have the UE boom -
is compact which makes it portable it's
waterproof and drop resistant up to 1.5
meters this speaker features gesture
controls you can double tap the top of
the speaker to skip a track or tap once
to pause the music when it comes to
casual listening the UE boom - will make
you happy at number 2 the UV mega boom
now that you've heard of UE
here's the mega boom obviously it's
larger than the boom since it's the mega
boom and it offers more bass than the
boom this thing is waterproof and has a
longer range Bluetooth so you can be up
to 100 feet away from the speaker and
still be connected you can even turn the
mega boom on or off using the free UE
app it's pretty expensive but the UE
mega boom is worth 2 mega bucks I'm
sorry or am i yes I am sorry and the
number one Bluetooth speaker you can get
is this JBL pulse - let's get the
obvious out of the way first this is one
cool looking speaker because it features
12 different light show options that
matches whatever music you're playing
you can also link to JBL pulse two
speakers wirelessly if you want its
splash proof but not waterproof how
about sound it's one of the best
sounding compact bluetooth speakers out
there put that all together and you can
see why it's number one for top 5 check
out top 5 - Netcom Amaya's and i'll see
you online
