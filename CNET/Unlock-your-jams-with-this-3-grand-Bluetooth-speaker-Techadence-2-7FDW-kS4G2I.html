disappointing bass never going to get
your party going but what if you drop
three grand on a Bluetooth speaker say
hello then to the DV let phantom Gold
and welcome to TECA dance there's no
question that three grand is a crazy
amount of cash to spend on a single
bluetooth speaker let's put that into
context three grand will buy you around
800 lattes it'll buy you a fairly decent
second-hand car or three iPhone tens or
18 of those ridiculous kanye west
t-shirts but you don't want any of that
no what you want is volume that can tear
down walls bass that can crack skulls
and object in your living room but looks
like an alien egg about to hatch and
destroy all of humanity the diva let
phantom Gold gives you all of that and
it's why this Bluetooth speaker is
unlike anything you've ever heard before
this thing checks out 4500 watts of
noise that's a total onslaught of sound
with sub levels so deep you can steer it
that movement is caused by a massive
amount of internal pressure and is
exactly that pressure that lets this
thing generate its pants filling base
whether you wanting to sink into the
low-end home of some hip-hop let's put
on some filthy filthy dubstep or enjoy
some crunchy meaty rock
the higher end sounds of whatever you
choose to listen to you are handled by
this small tweeter on the front now
given the high cost of the thing is no
surprise that that tweeter is made from
titanium definitely one of the more
baller metals and speaking of baller
metals that's actually 22 karat gold
here on the sides whether you like the
overall egg shape or not is entirely up
to you personally I quite like it
because it lures you into this false
sense of security you come up to it and
think oh it's small its sweet its round
isn't it cute and the BAM hits you in
the face harder than a haymaker from
Marley the only thing more badass than
having one of these things powering your
house party is having two of them
powering your house party you can link
them together using this Wi-Fi box which
lets to extend your party out from your
living room into the garden or instead
you can have them together in the one
room as a stereo pair to really test the
structural integrity of your house
all you need then is a nice bucket full
of Grey Goose a couple of Lambos parked
outside and one of the friendlier
Kardashian's on your sofa you've got
yourself one hell of a house party</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
