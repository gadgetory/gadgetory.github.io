lesson premium touches I'm dan ackerman
and this is the 2015 version of
toshiba's kirabook this is toshiba's
highest end consumer laptop it came out
a couple of years ago and it's had a
couple of updates since then each time
keeping essentially the same body in the
same shape same design upgrading the
processor and doing some better stuff on
the price and making sure that features
such as a touchscreen which we always
think is very important our standard
rather than something you'd have to add
on the original cure book we looked at
was a direct competitor apples retina
MacBook Pro in that it had a better than
HD resolution which it still does it was
in a very slim attractive well-designed
aluminum chassis with kind of me a
brushed metal accents our problem
originally was that the kirabook was
very expensive one of the two thousand
dollars and if you just got the like
$1,500 entry-level model it didn't even
have a touchscreen well a couple of
generations later now the single $1,500
configuration you can get has the touch
screen it's got a high-end core i7
processor it's got a big solid state
hard drive so a lot of premium stuff
going on there and of course you still
have that dough 2560 x 1440 not 4k but
better than HD screen is really becoming
the standard for a lot of higher and
laptops this guy has a feature they
pulled over from another high-end
toshiba system and that is the chroma
tomb software by technical and that lets
you set the color temperature on the
screen it's mostly for people doing
professional photo and video editing
although this system does not have a
discrete graphics card so it may not be
the best for super high-resolution video
editing so it has all these great
features packed in for a fairly
reasonable price what's not to like
about the kirabook two things that have
bothered me off and on over the last
couple of generations of the system that
I have reviewed never won the keyboard
keys are kind of small feel a little
plastic E and classy under the fingers
although there's no flex when you press
down hard so I appreciate that and
secondly the touchpad in different
generations at the system I've had
different responses from the touchpad
we're trying to use two finger gestures
so in 2015 we're back again to things
like two finger scroll feeling kind of
like
maggie and that really takes away from
the premium experience especially
compared to something like a macbook
where the touchpad really just gets top
priority in terms of responsiveness i'm
dan ackerman and that's the 2015 version
of the toshiba kirabook</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
