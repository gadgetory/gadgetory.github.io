nokia lumia 930 is the latest flagship
from nokia sporting a host of top end
specs for latest Windows Phone 8.1
software and a fun colorful design that
plastic back panel is surrounded by a
metal frame which makes it feel good to
hold and gives it a certain premium feel
the 5-inch display is not the most
compact of phones but that display does
have a full HD resolution which along
with his high brightness and bold colors
makes it a good choice for watching
netflix on your board running on the
latest Windows Phone 8.1 software which
brings tweaks like a notification bar to
the Familia colorful tiled interface
it's as simple to use as ever but it
still suffers from its poorly stocked
App Store sure there are a bunch of big
titles on the shelves now we're still
nearly always receives new apps long
after Android or iOS if it receives them
at all if you're keen on getting the
latest apps and games as soon as they're
out windows phones not for you it's
running on a 2.2 gigahertz quad-core
processor from Qualcomm which provide
plenty of power for anything you're
likely to want 2,000 420 milliamp an
hour battery is powering the phone which
nakia records will provide over 15 hours
of 3g talk time I reckon that's a little
on the ambitious side as in my own use I
wasn't hugely impressed we're fairly
demanding use I couldn't quite squeeze a
day out of it if you keep screen
brightness down and for video streaming
and gaming you should be able to get a
day but you'll definitely need to give
it a charge over night and the back is a
20 megapixel camera which I found
capable of taking some impressive shots
sometimes struggles an area of high
contrast and there's no auto HDR mode
but Nokia's camera software makes it
easy to take manual control of settings
to get better shots the Lumia 930 does a
lot of things right it looks fun has a
brilliant screen it's software is easy
to use and it has a great camera those
are your main concerns and you'll no
doubt have a great time with it it's
absolution still lets it down though and
battery really isn't anything to write
home about if you're after a good
all-around phone that's different from
your mates android phones is arguably
the best Windows Phone device to
consider the top Android side the galaxy
s5 or LG g3 offer similar specs and
there's no worries about apt choices I'm
