we're taking a first look at the meizu
mx3 smartphone this device is mainly
sold in China but you can find it
unlocked right here in the US for about
four hundred and sixty five dollars
through Amazon or other online retailers
it features a big 5.1 inch LCD screen
that's not quite full HD resolution but
sharp and colorful nonetheless it also
is powered by a homegrown eight-core
processor paired with two gigabytes of
RAM and can be had decked out with 16 or
32 gigabytes of internal storage what's
really wild about the MX three though is
it's heavily tweaked version of Android
jelly bean called fly me OS the custom
skin the MX three runs looks
suspiciously similar to Apple's iOS
complete with side scrolling home
screens which double as the app tray a
capacitive button under the screen also
helps the mx3 do some interesting you I
tricks you can long press it to put the
phone to sleep and hold then drag it
upwards to unlock sliding up from the
bottom of the screen on either side of
the button pulls up what apps are
running in the background sliding an app
icon upwards here closes its associated
application dragging an icon down closes
out of everything currently running also
touching the key then sliding up serves
as a back button the MX three is also
decked out with an eight megapixel
camera and LED flash the camera app
offers plenty of features and shooting
modes too including HDR filters and
panorama I'm not exactly a fan though of
the MX threes plastic chassis which
while thin is slippery to the touch the
phone doesn't support 4G LTE either and
is strictly a 3g gsm handset i'm brian
bennett for cnet and you've just taken a
first look at the meizu and x3
