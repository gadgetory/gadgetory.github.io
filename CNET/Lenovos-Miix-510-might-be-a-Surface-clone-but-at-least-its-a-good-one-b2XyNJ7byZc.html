you're going to get to Microsoft Surface
pro for tablet PC right down to its
hinged kickstand frankly there's not a
lot you can do different with a tablet
PC design and if you're going to copy
one the surface is certainly the best
pricing starts at around 600 dollars but
750 gets you this core i5 version with
256 gigs of storage which is good since
there's no SD or microsd card slot for
more room what you do get that the
surface doesn't have is a USB C port for
data and video output also unlike the
surface Lenovo includes its keyboard
cover that gives a generally excellent
typing experience with the exception of
its tiny right-hand shift key Lenovo
doesn't include its active pen for
drawing on the screen but add $40 it's
an affordable add-on with twice the
pressure sensitivity of Microsoft's pen
too bad its holder blocks all your ports
and power jack performance was solid for
office or school work and being able to
simply pull off the cover and start
drawing or watching videos is great it
got about five-and-a-half hours on our
battery test and that's a little better
than average for the category so no full
workday here but still pretty good
so yes lenovo made a bit of a clone here
of the surface pro 4 but at least it's a
good one and it comes in at a lower
price</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
