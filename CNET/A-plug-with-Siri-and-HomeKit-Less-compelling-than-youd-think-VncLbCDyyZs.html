command and low dining scene every time
I get a kick out of that this is the I
home is p5 SmartPlug is a home kit
compatible device that will turn any old
dumb thing into a smart device it's
compatible with Android barely but it's
very compatible with iOS again you saw
me control this thing with Siri and you
can give Siri commands based on the name
of the device based on the name of your
home based on the name of the zone okay
the outlet is turned off it's really fun
once you get this thing set up because I
homes app called I home control makes
organizing everything into those home
kit buckets easy so using the device I
was able to call this lamp the
bat-signal and give Syria command like
hey Siri turn on the bat-signal and she
actually listened to me and did
something it was cool
if you're not an iOS user and are trying
to use this thing on Android stop trying
to use this thing on Android it's barely
functional there were tons of setup
problems and even once it was up and
rolling its bare-bones and way behind
the competition for now it's one of the
few home kit compatible smart devices
out there
meaning it's actually a fine entry point
if that's what you're looking for but by
the end of the year you'll have a lot
more options to pick from and almost all
of those upcoming options will do more
than the eye home is p5 smart plug for
more check out my full review on
cnet.com for seen it
