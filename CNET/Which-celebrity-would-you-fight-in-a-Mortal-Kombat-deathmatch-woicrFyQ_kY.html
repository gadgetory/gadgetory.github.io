here with me Abby Russell from Giant
Bomb hello thank you for being here
thank you for having me let's answer
some questions will you say something no
not really
okay I'm excited to be here I watched
them the other ones for research I I
didn't Ben watch this well no I watched
some for pleasure and then some for
research okay John O'Hara you're forced
to fight any living adult in a mortal
combat scenario with the catch being
that the winner becomes the other person
who do you pick and John would pick Moby
because he's a pacifist and probably way
healthier who would you fight I would
fight Ellen DeGeneres
because she's a you'd win probably not I
feel like she probably is a team of
people who like teach her how to workout
very fit I felt like a martial artist
trainer I'm sure
I bet she's probably pretty strong but
she's also older so I feel like I have a
chance you could just run around run
circles around I feel like it's either
way it's a win-win because if I beat her
than I get to run the Ellen show and if
I lose then I get murdered by Ellen
right so some I would choose Wes
Anderson okay totally beat his ass but I
want to be him because I'm just so
pissed off like by how talented he is
huh do you get like all of their mind I
think so Veta labayda
says I'm on Amazon check out two items
in the bag Skyrim special edition and
Yakuza zero I can only proceed with one
which should I choose I have not played
either games Skyrim Skyrim is like a
classic it's in the zeitgeist like you
have to play this guy
yeah Skyrim you need to play just to be
a part of the conversation general
totally agree what video game would make
a great show or vice versa I always
wanted to play like a slow-paced like
Fargo kind of game that's like really
high drama well acted but like pepper
bits of action and like puzzle solving
and something like that so my answer is
Fargo the the video game do you have one
I I don't best Batman movie I always
liked the Tim Burton Batman's
the original I was going to say that the
original 1980 a line for me but the
print soundtrack I still listen to it
really just seals it I mean then Nolan
ones are excellent but like really
really hits a spot with me I like a fun
Batman at your Donen asks what's a pop
culture thing a movie a game or a book
that you love but most people seem to
dislike I think maybe the I feel like
the we talk to everybody in the industry
and they're like the first we yeah the
one that sold like a gajillion I don't
know talk to anybody that I work with
you gotta get some new friends okay it's
a controversial opinion I realize
everyone like I in college was like
super into all the Adult Swim cartoons
because it was like just starting out
and everyone thought I was just like
STONER loser who liked Aqua Teen Hunger
Force this is the one with like the
milkshake and the meatball and the
French fries I used to try to do it and
always make me gay it's very good thank
you I thought I was sitting next to
Meatwad Matty G what's your favorite fan
Theory from a movie or book this isn't
really like a movie or book one but I
like there's a lot of like weird lore
around the game Petey yes which I get
really into like the Petey love that
stuff just looking into like all these
weird like clues and hands and usually
there's like some substance to them like
there's this one thing about if you're
playing the game you can get possessed
by the ghost lady you can yes and
there's a whole thing about like you can
tell you're possessed because you can
hear three footsteps versus
just the two and i've actually went back
and watched you can totally hear the
three it's like nuts
young metro atlanta what's the first
video game you remember playing oh boy
Mario 64 no how dare you my dad had an
NES we played a lot of I remember my
sister now to play this game gauntlet I
think yeah sure yeah and I remember we
would both be Wizards because I could
heal each other so we could like get
pretty far when we were both wizards I
just remember would always do the line
where it was like wizard needs food
badly which is like what it would say
they're like hurt seat of power Abby if
you were gonna make a game what would it
be oh man I feel like I would make like
a game like Tomodachi life that's that
Japanese game for the 3ds where you like
make little me versions of yourself and
your friends okay
then you could like make them sing songs
and they're like all living this
apartment building together so I would
do it where I would make like me and all
my friends that I know and then I would
also make like Shaquille O'Neal and
Ellen DeGeneres of course like a lot of
America's Sweethearts I would make
that's it for quick question thank you
