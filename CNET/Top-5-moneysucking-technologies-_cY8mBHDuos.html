app a new Smart TV but if you're not
careful technology can also be a quick
way to go bankrupt and you're up to your
neck and credit card debt the idea of
selling it all and forsaking technology
for a life on a communal spinach farm
starts to sound like a logical idea but
before you change your name to moon
tiger and find a new life off the grid
let's see if we can do some damage
control macdonald bell and today's top 5
we're counting down the five ways your
high tech life is robbing you blind
starting off at number five antivirus
software any gig where you get to
exploit people's fear for cash is bound
to be pretty lucrative so how do these
guys get your money by pre-loading
security bloatware onto off-the-shelf
pcs and then swooping in like a
superhero when you're late night
browsing gets you into trouble I mean
when the family computer is hemorrhaging
pop-up windows of boobs and boners $80
sounds like a small price to pay to make
it all disappear the good news is that
there's some stellar free security
programs out there from companies like
Avast and AVG so go download those and
save yourself some money at number four
printers I really can't think of any
other technology that gets me more
worked up than inkjet printers not only
are they an eyesore and a huge pain to
set up but they need constant feeding
and attention you run out of blue ink
you have to replace the whole color
cartridge at 30 dollars a puck your
printer head gets clogged
have fun priming the pump and wasting
half your ink in the process you're
probably blowing $150 a year on ink just
so you can print out the occasional
family photo as a last-minute treat for
Grandma save the money and the hassle by
printing photos using those self-serve
machines they have with the pharmacy and
if you need to print documents a
low-cost black-and-white laser printer
will probably give you years of service
before it needs a new cartridge
coming in at number three digital
subscriptions in some ways these are the
worst it's like being covered in tiny
leeches you have to burn off one by one
Netflix Hulu iTunes Match Spotify Xbox
gold Amazon Prime it's gotten out of
hand now some of these you probably use
day-to-day but I'm willing to bet that
you have at least one digital
subscription that you've totally
forgotten about and she's getting fat
and happy sucking off the teat of your
credit card funding some corporate fat
cats payment on a midlife-crisis
convertible now if you're trying to stop
the bleeding digital subscriptions are
death by a thousand cuts at number two
cell phone service if you don't feel
screwed on your monthly cell phone bill
you're not paying attention Americans
are paying around $100 or more on their
monthly cell phone bill which let's
admit it is now a smart phone bill
because basic phones are only around for
drug dealers and grandparents we
literally need these things to
communicate now payphones have
disappeared no one has landlines anymore
and if you ever asked to try to borrow
someone else's cell phone to make a call
it's weird
I'd rather French kiss this guy than let
some stranger use my phone
we need phones but a hundred dollars a
month is basically it tax on humanity at
this point it's almost as ridiculous as
this next wallet vampire and number one
cable cable TV cable internet cable
telephone that you never really use but
you had to agree to it in order to get
the bundle price few corporations have
bent over the American people further
than cable companies which is why it's
no surprise that there's a growing
movement of people cutting the cord I
mean cell phone fees are criminal but at
least this for something to have on you
all day for the 24/7 glass the
high-speed Internet and hundreds of TV
channels you pay to get piped into your
home you probably use one percent of it
it's silly but what else are you gonna
do they've got you two ways if you can
find a convenient and legal way to shake
loose you let me know all right now you
know five ways the man is getting at
your money if you feel my pain let me
know over top-5 cnet.com Donald Bell
