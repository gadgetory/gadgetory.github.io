CES unveiled the night before the show
opens or two nights and we're here at
CES looking for the weird in the kooky
and we have found get this the coop it's
a linux-based tablet for the kitchen and
i'm here with Johnny who is the CEO yeah
really a Linux tablet yeah this is a
Linux tablet and incredibly it's working
very well well why not an Android tablet
because when we developed it we wanted
something very easy very accessible for
people very intuitive and Linux sim to
us the most easiest thing to use the one
generally does not consider Linux in the
kitchen as two things that naturally go
together i mean when we're thinking of a
kitchen interface we think but the ipad
or something simple like a kindle fire
how do you make this easy and and what
are you selling this for in fact we have
developed the hardware the software and
the content and we wanted to master the
total experience meaning it's a 10 inch
screen so it's not a 7-inch screen it's
the best thing to see the recipes in
video it's we master completely the
application so it means we know exactly
when we push a button how it's going to
happen and we master of course the the
content and the content it's more than
36 android recipes in videos with more
than 100 chef that explains you
step-by-step how to do the recipes and
itself or how much itself 399 US dollars
i can get to kindle fires for that yeah
that the kindle fire is a smaller it's
not dedicated to the kitchen you can
know this glass of wine throw it on the
on the screen with no danger you can
flow tomato sauce you can throw whatever
you want it will work you can use it on
an iPad you can use it on ever as
you want but this one is really
specified for the kitchen all right if
somebody wants this Linux power in
kitchen leappad or the core the kitchen
where and when can I get it for the
moment it's in France but it's going to
come in in the US for the next semester
okay good luck thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
