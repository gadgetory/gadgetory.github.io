adherence CTIA 2012 in New Orleans this
is the mammoth Toshiba Excite 13 it has
a 13 inch screen take a look this tablet
is so large I can barely demo it with my
two hands and really it's not meant to
be a portable tablet some of the use
cases are really going to be for using
it in your home playing games with the
family maybe keeping it in the kitchen
using it as sort of a reference device
for wherever you are in your house our
happen to be now it does run and Android
4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich here as the
operating system it's got a full
complement of apps on here it's pretty
stock Android but there are a couple of
different Toshiba offerings on here it
comes with a file manager and it comes
with a media player as well so now for
some of the externals we're going to
take a look at the back here the back
has sort of a texture on it to make a
little softer this is a demo device that
kind of got eaten up a little bit so the
finished product won't have any softness
around here or the back coming off there
is a five megapixel camera on the back
on the front there is a two megapixel
camera the volume rocker looks pretty
tiny considering how large the tablet is
here we've got some ports there's the
micro HDMI port the micro USB port and a
full SD card reader also the headset
jack the screen has a 1600 by 900 pixel
resolution and inside it runs Tegra 3
quad core processor the Toshiba Excite
13 is a Wi-Fi only device it comes out
June 24th in two different capacities
it'll cost $650 for the 32 gigabyte
version and $750 for the 64 gigabyte
version I'm Jessica's Alford Pristina
this is the Toshiba Excite 13 you're
watching the scene that dog bomb at CTIA
