consoles game consoles these are video
games they get played on TVs okay hmm
this week what are those what you'll
learn Ben Fox Rubin this week Sony
announced that PlayStation al which is a
well in ok service they offer on
playstation 4 and Vita and a few other
platforms I think they just announced at
that service which streams games to a
device and lets you play over the
internet offloads all the processing I
guess I'm like a mothership somewhere
where they have like render farms under
you've already lost me you understand
what I'm saying it's fine i knows our
spaceships and aliens of all very
awesome right you upload the virus to
the man yeah so you pay four dollars a
month it's sort of like netflix you pay
your pay 20 hours a month and you're
able to stream what feels like a four
hundred or so ton number of titles on
playstation 3 so that's how they sort of
solve the playstation 3 backwards
compatibility void that was there they
said okay we're gonna not let you put
the discs in the thing in the console
we're gonna let you stream all those ps3
games how that's how they do it how good
is the streaming it's a great question
yeah because you'll get a stream you can
stream like a movie lickety so one way
street right right yeah it's a one-way
street this is a two-way street there's
data going up yeah most of that is
coming down but there is some data
coming up and now those are the inputs
that you do on your controller it's not
the best but it's not the worst it
started out real bad it started out not
good at all I was my first initial
impressions of PlayStation al which was
poop there's a poop out of 5 now it's a
little better and now is it like poop +1
yeah it's like yeah like three and a
half poops out of flavor five it's not
bad we're still in boob terrace it's
nestled on a poop scale alright guys
liking the movie all right let's go yeah
a lot of a lot of crap out there so it
works a little better than how it
started but I think for twenty dollars a
month it's still may be too much to end
yeah
terms of the whole backwards
compatibility I mean xbox the games are
free i mean if you have the games they
work and it's free i watch your feet
right I feel a little I feel a little
chipped if it was like this was the only
way I'd be able to play my back
catalogue of ps3 get you because you
will you're one hundred percent right
that's you know there's a lot of games
on ps3 that I personally didn't get
around to playing and you know there's
games that I own like there you know
I've one of the games heavy rain took me
a while to play that I what happened you
know now I can't just pop this in I
guess I could hook up my console again
but who wants to do that who wants to do
that nonsense everyone's thrown there's
out anyway so this is an ok solution $20
months a lot of money but I think
they're almost there they're almost at
the spot where streaming games is a
thing you do need a really good internet
connection yeah just don't wanna like
think Rinkitink why I have the low end k
board yes I'll connect you can have that
entry-level fios five and five upper
room you gotta get that 50 50 I think
it's I think the minimum is 25 in my at
home I have 75 and that does it as good
as it's gonna get right oh but that's a
pretty high end it is hot on the higher
end yeah sure yeah that's too much I
mean 50 50 and that's cheese yeah that's
that's pretty pricey 5050 you're gonna
do okay but you're gonna spend some
money so I don't know do what do you do
you think cloud gaming has a future I
mean yeah I mean like I'm a fan of steam
in terms of using their service but i
don't but a lotta that's not really
clown stuff right yeah i guess there is
stored the games are your saves or
stored in the cloud but you have to
physically download the game yes that's
true yeah in terms of like actually like
netflix type service yeah that seems to
be kind of a pain because you know if
you live the family of more than two
yeah and they're all using the internet
that's it starts to go to show you know
definitely that pipe that whole idea of
having 50-50 connection yeah that only
works if you're the only one using that
correction if someone else is streaming
netflix or playing video games elsewhere
that's I mean that's gonna be a crap
experience right yeah they all you know
drink your milkshake
yeah a little bit when it comes down to
that what are you your I know Ben you're
not the biggest gamer mmm you stole a
bunch of games for me use a nikon d60
it's mine now I paid for dude to leave
I'd off two of his victim in the same
room I didn't give him as a time I gave
him my entire catalog I gotta think that
like this twenty dollars a month thing
that doesn't it seem overpriced ooh you
like shouldn't it be ten dollar like
everybody likes ten dollars a month for
streaming sure yeah okay that seems to
be pretty regular video whether it's a
different category read music and videos
of their old games that's the old
catalog they had already squeezed out
all the money that they were gonna get
from nobody much more i agree i know
that is what i always do and you're not
wrong what they should do is they should
offer people who have a PlayStation Plus
subscription a discounted rate for it
and I should do that number one number
two I think the the the starting rate
should be if you want to do twenty
dollars a month fine give me a discount
for doing the year they had a temporary
one it was like a hundred dollars a year
and I believe three months is $45 which
is way better than twenty bucks oh yeah
how about that is so that's the move
like I don't know who these people are
paying per month like I don't know who
does that anybody was like I'm gonna pay
another twenty dollars again and not get
like the 35 do you have even a hardcore
gamer you only have so much time the day
consuming you're spending your time on
ps4 games so how do they justify paying
that extra twenty dollars for old games
right like and what like so you have you
need to have a ps4 to access this right
you need to have a certain sort of
device like where's the where's the
balance right I don't know but but
that's sort of the deal with PlayStation
now now it's coming to pc so you'll be
able to plug in a dualshock 4 into your
computer and play that service on your
computer's is that a big deal is that
important all the time another piece
yeah it opens it up to people who don't
own a PlayStation 4 right like it
anybody can play the games right in your
computer wait wait a minute it's only
ps3 games right yes yeah yeah oh yeah
david says
good good but there is a there's a
library of pretty good game for sure for
sure I means pretty stock library it's
there and they offer great so expensive
it's a lot of my discharge you're
talking about who you so much money yes
I don't have sold catalog yeah are they
good angle is their last gen their last
gen though they're not like you know
this these aren't ps1 games I don't know
ideally they already made the money off
of it though they already did the but
they can make more money people like it
always make more money and matter with
you but I know it's like stop giving
them money me like no no this could be
even more lucrative yeah yeah yeah I
look I can't say I disagree but that's
the situation where right now I think
playing them on PC is there is a special
sort of thing about that because
everyone has a computer and you don't
need a super high-end computer cuz
you're just screaming stuff essentially
so I think it opens it up to a different
audience who maybe doesn't have a
PlayStation as it is and now they can do
that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
