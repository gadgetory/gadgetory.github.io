special unboxing the Tesla Model S oh
yeah and this is Mikey look it's a
little baby Tesla all right up tempting
Johnny Law let's get to the specs the
Tesla Model S is an all-electric car
built to compete head-on with gas
powered vehicles design wise it's
gorgeous
talk about a head turner I saw people
taking pictures of me while I was
driving it down the freeway in Silicon
Valley because there's no engine under
the hood there's extra storage up front
which Tesla employees jokingly call the
Franck there's a regular trunk too and
there's also an option for an all-glass
panoramic roof the entire thing is made
of lightweight heat and UV blocking
glass I drove the signature performance
model in this gorgeous red with black
interior
unfortunately this model is sold out and
you can't get this pink color anymore if
you want to Tesla Model S in another
color
they start at 49 thousand dollars
fifteen thousand more than the
all-electric Nissan Leaf there are three
battery options the largest is 85
kilowatt hours which will supposedly get
up to 300 miles on a single charge
driving at 55 miles per hour which no
one does
the base model still goes twice as far
as the leaf 140 miles per charge
charging is simple just find an outlet
there are adapters for 110 volt or 240
volt outlets and you can get a
high-powered wall charger to top off the
car faster to help reduce your range
anxiety even more Tesla Motors founder
Elon Musk just announced these new
behemoths superchargers that charge
superfast there are six in California
now with many more coming you'll be able
to pull over at one on a long road trip
and charge up for free
now what you're here for the tech on the
inside check out this 17 inch of
multi-touch display in the dash which
controls most of the cars functions
Ted Marin Dino of Tesla Motors gave me a
walk through the touchscreen is sort of
segmented in a few segments we have a
status bar along the top which tells us
temperature battery so this battery
indicator here is the actual battery
indicator this is that's the range that
is gonna give you a shortcut to look at
charging so if you tap it it'll bring
open a image of the car it's color-coded
to your car it's also has the wheels and
the roof that's on this car nice in fact
even if you turn on your turn indicator
it'll turn the turn indicator on you'll
see the heaters go on and the same thing
if you flash the headlights just kind of
fun things like that oh wow that's super
geeky I love it the status bar in the
app are static they're always there as
is this sort of vehicle controls bar
down here which has our climate control
and some of the controls for the car
these two pieces are we can we can move
and play around with we can swap them
from from top to bottom that way we can
maximize whatever's on top to take up
the the whole screen this is Google Maps
yeah so this car uses Google Maps so if
you have our connectivity package
meaning if you have the native internet
in the car you'll get Google Maps and
this isn't our navigation per se but it
does give you a view of the car our
location and a lot of the features that
go along with Google Maps and we can we
can maximize this to take advantage of
all this beautiful screen real estate
we have multi-touch on the screen so
unique you can squeeze or pinch we can
also switch to a satellite view and have
a really nice beautiful view of the of
the terrain and you can zoom in and out
all the things you're used to doing on
Google Maps the company is still working
out details but there will be some kind
of option for a 3G data connection from
Tesla personally I'm surprised there
aren't more details about a data plan
yet and I'm a bit disappointed that a
car shipping in 2013 won't have 4G
when it comes to performance I am not
disappointed
the base model s has 362 horsepower and
325 foot-pounds of torque the
performance edition bumps that up to 416
horsepower and 443 pounds of torque
that'll do 0 to 60 in 5.6 seconds the
Model S is a pleasure to drive Tesla
says it's meant to compete with the BMW
5-series and the Audi a6 I can
definitely see it in that company
although I find the German cars a little
bit more responsive and the BMW still do
have better road feel there are a few
oddities like the steering column
borrowed from Mercedes which puts the
cruise control lever annoyingly above
the turn signal lever also the side
pillars are huge visibility is not good
in this car but luckily you can put your
rear and side views in the 17 inch
display while you're driving then you
can see anything you want and no other
luxury sedan will give you the Tesla
Model S's most outstanding feature
complete silence if you want one of your
own be prepared to put down $5,000 now
and wait about a year or more for yours
to Iraq what that should give you plenty
of time to get over the car you already
have</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
