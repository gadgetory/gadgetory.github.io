virtual i'm rafe needleman at the
augmented reality event Santa Clara
talking to miles Ludwick from the Sesame
Workshop tell me about what my kid is
going to be using next well Rafe we're
looking at how can augmented reality
create new kinds of educational
experiences that can help us teach kids
numbers and letters and all the other
important skills that are part of what
Sesame Street does and working with
Qualcomm and and using their view Fauria
engine we've been able to build a
prototype in which children can play
with familiar Sesame Street figures like
Ernie here place Ernie into a room and
Ernie comes to life he becomes an
animated character that's right so it's
kids are able to play with physical
objects just as they might play with a
playset or a dollhouse but then looking
at them through the tablet looking at
the scene they've created and the
choices that they've made it animates
the characters come to life and they
start suggesting in educational
storylines and ways of interaction
interacting that will bring learning how
do you interact you move them around you
talk to them ok what you can you can
move them around you can so if I place
this object into the room for example
this jukebox boom now we're having a
dance party disco Ernie huh all right
exactly and one of the things that we're
testing with kids because our our
organization is very research driven as
a non-profit everything that we do is
about getting out there putting things
in front of kids and finding out what
engages them and what ultimately drives
educational outcomes why is giving my
kid a virtual reality app and a fragile
tablet better than just give me a couple
of toys oh I wouldn't necessarily say
that it was better but our mission is to
help children reach their fullest
potential and we avail ourselves of
every option every platform every
technology that parents ultimately are
going to be choosing to put in front of
their kids we want to make sure there's
something positive and constructive for
them so when are our kids going to get
this I hope you'll see it
next year alright thanks a lot thanks
