makeover and started testing same-day

also on the topic of shopping have you
heard of fab.com yet it's a shopping
site that features unique products that

already has about eight million users on
the web and mobile but it's putting a
much bigger focus right now on mobile

fabs traffic is from the app but the
company expects that to jump to half by
the holidays fab launched brand new apps
for Apple and Android devices and it's
running a new 30-second commercial fab
says it expects you to do 150 million
dollars in sales this year there could
be a big shake-up at sprint the carrier
just confirmed in a statement it is
talking with a Japanese mobile carrier
called softbank about a substantial
investment sprinted and say much else
but the wall street journal published a
report with sources saying that soft
pink wanted to pay twelve point eight
billion dollars to acquire sprint
