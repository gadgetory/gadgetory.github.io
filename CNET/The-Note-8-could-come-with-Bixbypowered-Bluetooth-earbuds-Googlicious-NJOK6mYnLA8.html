back to Google issues for all the Google
you could think of Samsung officially
announced that their next unpacked event
will be on August the 23rd and you can
bet your bottom dollar will see the
unveiling of the note 8 there now spec
wise it's expected to be pretty similar
to the galaxy s 8 plus but with more ram
dual cameras and an S Pen now a Twitter
post by wind futures rule in quant
claims the new note will come in black
the galaxy s 8 orchid gray and the new
deep blue at the very least the teaser
invitation even features a deep blue
looking S Pen which could be the new
color we'll see now Samsung also finally
rolled out Bixby for us owners of the s8
and sa pleasant no surprises getting a
lukewarm response like it had so much
potential and you know it could still
evolve down the road even more but if
you want more big suite right now ET
news reports samsung is working on big
speed powered Bluetooth earbuds and yes
it will be their version of the air pods
now Samsung does have experience with
wireless earbuds from their gear icon X
line the report claims the air pods
competitor will connect over bluetooth
you can listen to music and you will
also be able to prompt Bigsby for voice
commands plus it's noise blocking
technology will be able to understand
you in a loud environment now Samsung
will be reportedly testing them sometime
this month and ET News says they'll be
announced with the Galaxy Note 8 now
they could be bundled for a limited time
with the no tape but we'll find out on
August the 23rd
alright video and images of the upcoming
samsung galaxy s 8 active have leaked
out this line started back with the s4
and this new active adds a significantly
more durable body military standard
certification and a larger battery the
leak allegedly comes from a friend of a
samsung employee in San Francisco with
very professional finger drawn
watermarks you guys should do that more
often
now the image also confirms a four
thousand milliamp hour battery that's
larger than the s8 or s eight plus but
it won't feature the gorgeous curved
infinity display of those phones instead
it'll just be flat now no pricing of
information or release date has been
released yet
okay Google has released the last
android o Developer Preview with near
final testing images for recent pixel
and Nexus devices and
allows developers to conduct their final
testing for apps now for those of you
who want to do this you can get access
to the factory images right here down
below you can check out this link again
it's a Developer Preview and not all
your apps may work with it but you have
the option to check it out
there's also fun Easter egg in the
preview that features a floating octopus
that's kind of black and white like an
Oreo so what's it gonna be Android
octopus or Oreo and another connection
Android oh is 8.0 and the number 8 is
the number of legs and octopus hats I
bet you didn't know that it also
replaces that cute nougat Necco game if
you don't know how to get to that
there's a tool called YouTube someone
told me about that might be able to help
you so go and check it out and in a
quick story Google is also working on a
new lossy image format for the web
they're calling pic that's pic with a K
because of course it is that's all we
know right now and it was revealed on
Google's github profile as a collection
of newly uploaded files pic is right now
not an official Google product but it's
been developed by them at the moment and
I'd like to thank Martin Mandor for this
moment of retro the man turned a 1986
RadioShack intercom into a Google home
what time does Curry's closed today
Curry's PC world at Sweetbriar retail
park Sweet Briar Road closes at 6:00
p.m. this is amazing and Mandor did it
with an intercom body a Raspberry Pi and
Google's artificial intelligence
Yourself kit that came with issue 57 of
the Maggie PI Magazine check it out all
right that's gonna do it for this week
you can email me at Google Isha's I've
seen that calm or tweet me at Brian Tong
thanks so much for watching we'll catch
y'all next time for some more of that
Google issues
