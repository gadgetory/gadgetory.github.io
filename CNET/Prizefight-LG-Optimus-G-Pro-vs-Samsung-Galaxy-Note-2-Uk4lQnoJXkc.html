and it's a big screen phone tablet
battle between two fabulous phablets
it's a prize five-foot out between LG's
optimus g pro and Samsung's Galaxy Note
to our judges for this fight our senior
editor Bryant boom shakalaka Bennett
associate editor Lin it to win it LA and
myself Brian too strong tongue now we'll
take all three judges blind scores and
average them out to the nearest tenth of
a point the final prize fight score will
be an average of all rounds between the
same system let's get busy round one is
designed the LG optimus g pro US version
brings one of the more refreshing
big-screen designs to the table with the
front that looks pretty generic but a
clean metal accent around the edges and
a cool geometric fishnet like pattern on
the back and I like fishnets now it has
a slightly slimmer profile and it's also
not as wide which makes this the easiest
phablet to hold the galaxy note 2 brings
Samsung's familiar design but it's
larger and more awkward in your hand
compared to the optimus g pro its S Pen
Stylus also slides right into the notes
body so you'll always have it with you
both bones have vibrant five and a half
inch screens but LG brings a full 1080p
resolution and 400 pixels per inch that
bests the note tues 720p resolution with
267 pixels per inch and you can see the
difference the optimus g pro gets a 4.3
and the note 2 gets a 3.7 next round is
user interface and controls LG brings a
really fresh and snappy you I that's
really one of the fastest we've seen its
biggest you I feature is qslide which
enables you to use specific apps like
its video player or notes to float
anywhere on your screen and change the
transparency while doing other functions
it's nice to have but it's not as useful
as Samsung's multi-screen feature and
the US version of the phone omits the
web browser as a qslide app now the note
2 can be great if you want to keep it
simple with its classic TouchWiz
interface that runs smoothly as well but
the
guess difference between these two is
the s-pen that opens up even more
features and functionality but at times
it can seem like there's a little too
much going on here it's multi screen
feature takes advantage of all its real
estate and allows you to run two apps
like web browsing and watching a YouTube
video at the same time and it's the best
feature by far on top of that throw in
specific features for the s-pen like air
view for hovering over items to preview
them or cycle through your home screens
LG takes another round with the poor and
Samsung gets a 3.7 so after averaging
two rounds the optimus g pro has a
slight lead round three is all about
features both phones bring a lot of
android signature features like google
now services androids unmatched voice
search and commands NFC capabilities and
tracing characters on the keyboard to
enter in words both phones also bring
their own level multitasking and TV
remote functionality now the LG optimus
g pro is loaded with a blazing fast 1.7
quad-core Snapdragon 600 processor
that's really one of the fastest out
there right now with 32 gigs of storage
they even added the look away to pause
video feature from the galaxy s4 now it
also has a programmable quick button
that's set to the quick memo app that
let you create notes or even draw on top
of the current screenshot it doesn't
come with a stylus so all your notes
will be done by finger now Samsung's
Galaxy Note 2 brings a quad-core 1.6
gigahertz processor with 16 32 and 64
gig storage options you also get their
motion gestures like swiping across the
screen to take a screenshot or tilting
to zoom into a picture but its biggest
feature is its s-pen stylus that brings
a whole new level of functionality to a
device that already acts like a phone
like cropping pictures from your screen
and being able to access multiple
brushes by selecting them on the S Pen
and really showing off your artistic
skills you can jot down note I Diaz and
even add voice memos on top of notes and
this is hands-down the most productive
phone or phablet we've seen if you're
willing to learn the system
takes this route with a strong 4.7 and
the optimus g pro gets a 3.7 next round
is web browsing and multimedia we've
talked about how amazing LG's optimus g
pro screen looks and both phones look
great but LG's takes it up another level
the Chrome browser runs great on both
platforms and it's still the best mobile
browser out there but LG brings a 13
megapixel camera and we know megapixels
don't always matter but most of our
judges prefer the more natural muted
looks from the photos it took compared
to Samsung's 8 megapixel camera that
brings a little more saturated colors
that I preferred 1080p video capture is
on both phones but if you're watching
movies on these devices you'd have to
give the edge to the optimus g pro as
well and also it has a variety of more
multifunction video shooting the optimus
g pro gets a 4 and the note 2 gets a 3.7
so after averaging four rounds LG has a
slight lead the final round that decides
it all is called quality and performance
these two phablets are big but let's not
forget they're still phones now overall
call quality was great on both of them
but will depend on your carrier location
and data speeds were excellent as well
bow phones performed well but we talked
about the optimus g pro snapdragon
processor and in the quadrant benchmark
tests that measure cpu memory and 3d
graphics performance the g pro was a
beast with a score of 11,000 745 the
dominates pretty much every android
phone on the market compared to the note
to score of 5763 and that's a huge
difference now on the flip side if we
talk about battery life using our own
in-house Cena battery drain tests the g
pro came in at over eight hours of video
playback while the note 2 gave us 12 and
a half hours and that's a huge
difference as well now our judges all
didn't agree anywhere in this final
round and the final round ends up being
a tie and four point three points of
peace so let's average out all five
rounds and in a prize fight with a
g pro EDS doubt to note 2 in several
rounds samsung had a huge round three
but it just wasn't enough and the LG
optimus g pro takes this battle 4.1 to
3.9 and is your prize fight winner these
are two of the best phablets on the
market but let's ignore the score for a
second and the real decision comes down
to whether you want a stylus or not and
if so go galaxy but in case you didn't
know the g pro is one hundred dollars
cheaper I'm Brian Tom thanks for
watching I will catch you guys next time
for another prize by
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
