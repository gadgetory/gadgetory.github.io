appliances and this is a review of the
iRobot Roomba 880 this little guy looks
a lot like some of its predecessors it
has that classic Roomba shape the sensor
at the top it has that kind of wonky
handle that you use to carry it from
place to place and so at first glance
there isn't much different about this
new 800 series but flip it over and
you'll see a really unique new feature
some of this is still the same there's
still the spinner rotator thing that
pulls in the debris but the main
difference is what iRobot calls the
extractor and the extractor is this part
underneath that's what really gets the
debris sucked up into the dustbin this
is the 790 model for $6.99 that's on our
robots website right now the big
difference is that it has brushes
underneath and this one has rubbery what
they call extractors and it really seems
to make a big difference
it really does outperform the 790 some
of its marginal but for pet hair it does
a lot better like the 790 Roomba this
one is also $699 and it's the very first
model they're introducing to the 800
series I'm not sure if they're going to
be phasing out the 790 since this one
does perform better and they're the same
price but I do really like this new
model a lot and I would recommend it
over the 790 this little guys still
won't replace your upright model but if
you want some day-to-day maintenance
something that can get under your bed or
other areas this is a great option I'm
