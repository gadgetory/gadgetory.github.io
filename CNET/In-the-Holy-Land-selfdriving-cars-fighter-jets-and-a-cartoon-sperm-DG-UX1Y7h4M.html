of our roadtrip project this summer I
traveled to Israel and the Palestinian
territories a tel aviv jerusalem and
ramallah we uncover new and innovative
startups and tech projects there we
learned how museums and cultural
institutions in Jerusalem are using
cutting-edge technologies to digitally
preserve and analyze historical
artifacts then we travel to the south of
Israel to see the country's homegrown
military technology including an Israel
modified f-16 I fighter jet in Israel
startups are reaching for higher
ambitions as the texting matures one of
the new leaders there is mobile I a
jerusalem company that develops
technologies to help drivers avoid
accidents the company is now a top
contender in the field of self-driving
cars right the computer is driving yes
here we're driving down a highway
outside of Jerusalem in a mobile i
powered autonomous car windows ago the 2
100 kilometer power oh so that's all I
have this little graphic so we will slow
down their speed yeah we adapted so this
is the adaptive cruise control
hey you're not doing anything right now
hi can I can do this the West Bank taxi
nearby is tiny compared with Israel but
there are a handful of startups hoping
to bring more attention to Palestinian
tech when Ramallah firm i visited was
yamas offer a fast-growing hotel booking
site with a focus on the Arab world I
also stopped by pinch point a mobile
gaming company which got a lot of media
attention for creating sperm mania the
game lets people play as a sperm trying
to fertilize an egg as I said it's like
a racing game you're missing other
sperms to each level and I kind of to
make it not as realistic but we depicted
other parts of the story from the real
thing so basically now you see let us
asset fools also these are for example
assets if you touch them good I think
expect to see more of this tech from
Israel and the Palestinian territories
in a smartphone car or computer near you
