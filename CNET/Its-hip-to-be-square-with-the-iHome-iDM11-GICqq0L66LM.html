editor for cnet.com and I'm here with
the ihome IDM 11 this is a portable
bluetooth speaker it looks a little bit
like a miniature version of the boxee
box for those who know that product but
basically it is a little box tilted on
its side there is one of the better
built and designed products from my home
and this is a wireless audio speaker
that's designed to be paired with your
smartphone tablet it also has a built-in
speakerphone now this speaker retails
for seventy dollars while the jam box
which has similar features it's a little
bit bigger and sounds a little bit
better than this retails for around $175
so there's a lot of good value here
there's a built-in rechargeable battery
here it also comes with a cable that
allows you to charge the speaker as well
as add a 3.5 millimeter audio jacks so
you can plug it into a non Bluetooth
device that's really all there is to it
there are some controls on the back that
allow you to control the volume on it
you probably want to set it to a high
volume and then control the volume from
your device itself and apart from that
this you know this doesn't sound
fantastic it's a little bit thin on the
basis you might expect from a speaker
this small but it does play pretty loud
and can fill a small room with sound and
most people will be impressed by its
output especially for its size and its
price if you're comparing this to the
ihome IDM 8 which has a rounded design
that looks like a top of a microphone
this one sounds maybe a little bit
better it's ten dollars more and it has
that built in microphone the brown was a
little bit easier to transport around
but this one does look a little bit
better so I would recommend spending the
extra ten dollars on the IDM 11 i am
david carr nguoi and that is the ihome
IDM 11 portable bluetooth speaker thanks
for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
