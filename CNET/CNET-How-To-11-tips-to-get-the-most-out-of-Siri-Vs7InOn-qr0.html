features and enhancements when iOS 8 is
released later this year among them are
new dictation languages voice activation
and song recognition but even now Syria
is capable of doing more than you
realize
I'm dan Graziano and I'm going to share
with you some of Ceres lesser known
features everyone knows that pressing
the home button will activate Siri but
did you know that you can actually hold
the home button to ensure that Siri
keeps listening this will prevent the
voice assistant from cutting you off mid
question you probably know that after
you ask Siri a question you can scroll
from top to bottom to see the previous
answer but did you know that you can see
these recent exchanges even after you
closed her STR a question such as what
is the temperature close Syria by
tapping the home button and open her
again but instead of asking a new
question tap the lower section of Siri
screen next to the question mark icon
and swipe down but what happens if you
made a mistake when accent Siri a
question sure you can repeat and
rephrase the question or you can edit it
swipe up well inside of Syria - you see
your question tap on the phrase tap to
edit and retype your question or speak
it by using the microphone icon on your
keyboard while you can yet use Siri to
control third-party apps you can use the
voice assistant to open any app speak
the name of the app you wish to open and
Siri will comply feeling a little lazy
you can use Syria to post a status or a
new tweet to Facebook or Twitter use the
command post on Facebook or post on
Twitter and Siri will ask you what you
would like to post you can also send an
email or a text message to a contact in
your phone by saying text or email Steve
and have Siri read your incoming emails
and messages to you to hear all of your
emails in your inbox at one time tell
Siri to read all my email to hear the
most recent email by date and time
simply tell Siri to read my latest email
the same commands can be used for your
text messages as well in addition to
Siri reading the names and numbers of
all your miss phone calls you can take
it one step further
having the voices system playback your
voicemails simply say play my voicemail
and Siri put your phone on speaker and
automatically reads your latest
voicemail
want to be able to tell Siri to text
your wife or send an email to your mom
you can set Syria to recognize someone
who is in your phone open the voice
assistant and tell her that veronika is
my girlfriend or Anne Marie as my mom if
you're frustrated because Siri
mispronounces your name or the name of
one of your contacts you can teach her
the proper way to say it for example
tell Siri that's not how you pronounce
graziano Sarah will then ask you how to
pronounce it simply say the name and
Sierra will give you a list of
pronunciations pick the right or closest
one and Syria will correct how she says
the name from now on and finally you can
view a list of commands serious capable
of understanding by saying what can I
ask Siri or by tapping the question mark
icon in the lower left corner and there
you have it 11 of series lesser known
features that you can perform on your
iPhone or iPad right now for more how-to
