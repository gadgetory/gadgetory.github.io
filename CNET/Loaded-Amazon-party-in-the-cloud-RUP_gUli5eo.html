amazon went ahead and launched its cloud
music service called Amazon Cloud Drive
for now this is only for music it lets
you upload all of your music to Amazon's
own servers and then you can play that
music any time you have a web connection
or an Android device it accepts AAC and
mp3 formats if you're not on a mobile
Android device you can play your music
in just about any browser you get five
gigs of storage for free upgradeable to
20 gigs with the purchase of just one
album more storage can be purchased
starting at twenty dollars for 20 gigs
per year you can find out more at amazon
com / cloud drive sprint would like to
put the brakes on the ATT acquisition of
t-mobile this is a surprise to no one
sprint released a statement this week
that urges the US government to block
what they are calling an
anti-competitive acquisition that would
quote harm consumers and harm
competition at a time when this country
can least afford it end quote sprint
argues that the merger will undo nearly
30 years of work by the government to
modernize and open the communications
markets the New York Times became a paid
site this week amazon announced that
customers who already subscribed to the
paper through the kindle can also read
it on the internet it isn't exactly free
just another part of the service that
kindle users already pay for facebook is
going to continue renting movies after
testing this last month the new movie
soon to be available in your Facebook
account will be to Harry Potter movies
Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber of Secrets
life as we know it Yogi Bear and
inception these movies cost around 20
facebook credits and you can access them
within 48 hours of your rental Netflix

Canada this is a five-year deal that
brings over 350 new movies to the
service in addition to exclusive
subscription TV rights to all first-run
films this is more paramount content
than netflix customers in the u.s. can
access rumor has it the news corp wants
to give the online video site VEVO
control of my space remember that News
Corp put my space on the chopping block
in February VEVO is owned by three music
labels so their interest in the site
would obviously
be for music if this is not a fit rumor
also has it that myspace has had up to
20 other potential buyers all interested
that's your news of the day I'm Natali
