showcase refrigerator it's a luxurious
$3,700 fridge from last year but this
year you can get it from major retailers
like Home Depot and Best Buy for around
$2,500 at that price I think it's
actually a steal now this fridge is a
traditional French door design with the
split door fridge up top and the drawer
style freezer down below but you get a
nice modern aesthetic thanks to that
black stainless steel finish this fridge
also has two pretty compelling features
that help set it apart from a lot of the
competition first up is this flex zone
drawer down here it's got 3.8 cubic feet
of extra storage space for groceries
along with these four dedicated
temperature presets you can cycle
through those just by pressing this
button here it's a very nice feature to
have in a fridge like this you also get
a food showcase compartment which is
just the right half of the door you open
it by pulling this trigger in the handle
when you do the front panel will come
open while the door will stay closed
that lets you get a beer or some butter
out without actually opening the door I
really like the interior of this fridge
too and I love the fact that you get two
sets of moveable shelves you get this
one that slides back out of the way and
then another one that folds up out of
the way with a little bit of extra
effort I am less enamored however with
that ice master icemaker up on the top
shelf it heats up a little over 1/2
cubic foot of space and it drops ice
down through that chute in the door and
that chute kind of locks off the shelf
below it performance-wise this is a very
solid fridge it held accurate steady
temperatures in the body of the
refrigerator throughout all of my tests
and even that food showcased compartment
did well it held all the average
temperatures below 40 degrees Fahrenheit
which is a very good result
the standout though is probably that
flex zone drawer all four of those
temperature presets are very very
accurate especially the coldest setting
down at 29 degrees all in all the bottom
line on this fridge is pretty simple
right now it's a great looking
refrigerator with excellent performance
and very cool features at $2,500 it's
absolutely a steal</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
