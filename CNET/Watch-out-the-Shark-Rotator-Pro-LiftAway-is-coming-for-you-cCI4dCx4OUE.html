Megan Willerton for Sina here with a
review of the $200 shark rotator Pro
lift-away vacuum cleaner this vacuum
cleaner has a removable wand that
doubles as the handle it has different
brush attachments and it can actually be
turned into a canister vacuum you can
just lift out the bin and take it
wherever you want to go that makes the
shark actually the most versatile of all
of the five vacuums we tested in the set
and that says a lot since it's the
cheapest like the others it has a clear
bin so you can see how full it is it's
easy to remove and incredibly easy to
clean it also comes with a HEPA filter
like the others and it rotates very well
and it even has two headlights which is
kind of cute at 200 bucks this is by far
the least expensive vacuum that we
tested in this group the dyson DC 41 is
actually six hundred and fifty dollars
so we wanted to see how a $200 vacuum
cleaner with similar features would
stack up to the dyson I like the design
and construction of this vacuum cleaner
better than either of the Dyson's we
tested but not quite as much as the ORAC
or the Electrolux all right let's talk
performance instead of a sharks regular
fare of fish and hapless surfers we
decided to test this one against
Cheerios pet hair a mix of sand and
sawdust nuts bolts washers and human
hair so how does the shark do on dry
land
overall it did pretty well on every test
it didn't do great picking up sand and
sawdust from our thinnest carpet it also
didn't do great picking up pet hair from
hardwood floors
although the shark didn't pick up most
of the pet hair on the hardwood surface
if you turn the brush on it collects
everything some folks might think that
that will scuff up the floor or scatter
some of the particles but it did work so
if you're willing to take that risk it
will collect all of the pet hair on your
bare floors but it did a great job
picking up Cheerios it did a great job
picking up human hair and it did a great
job picking up pet hair from both the
thinner and thicker carpet surfaces it
did pick up a few bobby pins
washers and nuts but most of them
actually got stuck in the brush so for
$200 the shark is an incredibly good
vacuum cleaner it didn't quite stand up
to some of the others on performance but
for its price you're getting a great
value I'm Megan Willerton for CNET and
this has been a review of the shark
rotator Pro lift-away vacuum watch out
more expensive models shark is coming
