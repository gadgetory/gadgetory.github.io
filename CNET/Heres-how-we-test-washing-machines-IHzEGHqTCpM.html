really seriously and we're proud of the
test procedures we've developed but
there's so much that happens behind the
scenes so we thought we'd give you a
glimpse of how we test washers so you
can peer into the wild world of large
appliance testing a lot of companies
rely on the association of home
appliance manufacturers or AM to assess
their own models before they hit the
retail floor the general gist is that
eh-hem accounts for the multitude of
potential variations that can happen
when you're testing a machine so that we
can actually standardize from machine to
machine and compare them fairly that
includes everything from the washers
water temperature and pressure to the
size of the load and even how the
laundry is loaded we also use a ham
approved detergent stain strips and
other materials all of which have much
less variation than the stuff we can
find in stores so the two main things we
test are one how well a washer remove
stains and two how tough or gentle it is
on the clothes for stain removal a hem
suggest stain strips complete with five
different stains sebum are the oil on
your skin carbon cocoa blood and wine we
use a reflective color immature to test
how well each machine removes stains the
color emitter measures the percent
reflectance we can actually compare the
results pre and post cleaning cycle to
determine general wear and tear on
clothes a hem suggests mechanical action
strips for these odd-looking
five hole punch sheets we use a ruler to
measure all of the attached strings that
are two millimeters or long or after a
cleaning cycle thanks for watching be
