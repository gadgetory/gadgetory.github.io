and today we're going to take a closer
look at Google project fly launched on
April 2015 project Phi is a tech giant's
take on a mobile wireless service it
enables you to make calls send text and
surf the Internet by default it uses
local Wi-Fi networks the same kind you
have set up at your home or find in a
coffee shop or airport because some
Wi-Fi spots are public Google promises
to encrypt your data so it is secure if
Wi-Fi coverage is unavailable or too
weak you'll automatically and seamlessly
be switched to either Sprint or t-mobile
cellular network for now you can only
use project fly on Google's flagship
handset the Nexus 6 that's because
there's a specialized radio inside the
phone that supports multiple cell
networks and it works with a unique
project by SIM card that has multiple
carrier support as well part of the
services appeal is it's easy to
understand pricing structure the base
cost is $20 a month which gets you
unlimited calls and texting in the u.s.
unlimited international texting in the
US to 120 and more countries and Wi-Fi
tethering if you want data that costs
$10 a gig per month so for example if
you sign up for four gigs that'll cost
$40 bringing your total monthly bill to
$60 whatever data you don't use at the
end of the month gets refunded back to
you if you end up using 3.1 out of the
allotted four gigs this month that means
you have nine hundred megabytes left
over and you get nine bucks back now
some of our own preliminary testing has
shown varying data download rates have
ranged from 3 to 13 megabits per second
while upload rates range from 1 to 18
megabits per second of course take these
results with a grain of salt data speeds
vary widely for a number of reasons
including location and time of day what
we're observing here is just a miniscule
sample size in our San Francisco offices
now Google isn't alone in its wireless
endeavors carriers like republic
Wireless and scratch Wireless offers
similar services with the former
charging $10 a month for talk techs and
Wi-Fi and $15 per gig of data Google has
described project Phi not necessarily as
a competition to its carrier partners
but rather an ongoing experiment that
will hopefully push these companies to
offer cheaper and more efficient
services
if you're interested in experiencing
project 5 for yourself you'll need to go
online and request an invite and for
