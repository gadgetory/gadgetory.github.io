way of the dodo I'm Bridget Carey this
is your scene at update two-year phone
contracts are on a path to extinction in
the US Sprint announced that by the end
of the year it's gonna stop offering
customers the option of a two-year
contract and subsidize price on a new
phone so instead of paying $200 for that
new iPhone with a contract renewal
you'll have to pay the full cost of the
iPhones six hundred and fifty dollars
over time in monthly payments Verizon
killed the two-year contract last week
and t-mobile instigated the change when
it ended contracts two years ago now 18t
is the last major carrier to keep
contracts but even it is slowly pulling
back you can only renew a two-year
contract in an official 18 t store not
at another retail shop like Best Buy
to better compete with t-mobile Sprint
is also offering a new plan called
iPhone forever you lease an iPhone for
$22 a month and as soon as a new one
comes out you trade it in an upgrade
there are benefits to the monthly
payment system it's more clear in your
bill on what you're paying for the cost
of the phone is separated from your
service cost which is now cheaper so
when you pay off the phone you only pay
for the service and if you're shopping
around for which carrier has the best
deal now it's easier to just compare
service plans between each company
Sprint is fourth place among US carriers
when it comes to the number of customers
but it's in third place in terms of
coverage according to the latest report
from Wireless testing firm route metrics
Verizon took the top spot with AT&amp;amp;T
following closely behind t-mobile was
held back by poor performance outside of
the major metro areas moving from phones
to Facebook more changes are coming to
the social network in particular it
wants you to do more blogging on
Facebook its beefing up notes yeah
remember notes it's changing so you can
post a long-form story with large cover
photos you can also resize photos within
a post and insert links it looks a whole
lot like medium shown here it's a place
people go to post long-form think pieces
and articles it's also similar to how
tumblers used now this facebook notes
change is only a small test now it's
likely you
see it and there's a new way to chat
over at Google Hangouts the messenger
service now has its own desktop website
so you don't need to pull up the mobile
app or go through Gmail to start a
conversation or video call you can find
it at Hangouts and Google com Facebook
does the same thing with messenger
letting you access chat on messenger com
