a band plus an app that runs on your
phone that work together to help you
understand yourself through tracking
your movement and sleep at night up 3.0
which is a new application update that
really helps give more personable and
actionable insights to all based on
people's data with notifications which
are personal nudges to help people move
along with their goals we are
introducing a new band option to the
family which is up 24 gives you tailored
actionable insights all delivered at the
moment that it happened all is enabled
with real-time Bluetooth wireless
syncing so the band is tracking your
movement throughout the day when steps
happened throughout the course of the
day it's also tracking your sleep when
you went to sleep when you woke up your
deep sleep versus light sleep so we use
it as a feedback mechanism so if I don't
want to be sitting for more than 30
minutes at a time it will notice that
I've been sitting in old buds mean
gently so I can stand up you've probably
had this experience where you wake up
very jolted when your alarm goes off and
that ALPHAN happens because you're in
deep sleep at that point and so what
we'll do is we'll watch when you're in
that light sleep before that and we'll
wake you up maybe at 6:50 so you feel a
little bit more refreshed because you're
in the middle of that light sleep
what up 24 can do is by pressing the
button to go into sleep mode or waking
up in the morning my my coffee maker
could turn on basically the way that
works is that if this than that one of
our API partners sees that that has
happened and tells the coffee maker to
turn on so it's a way to create these
intersection of all these different
products that are connected together to
start to work on my behalf so this is
the home screen of the up app I can see
how much I slept last night my movement
throughout the day and what I've eaten
today I can tap into see additional
detail and you can quickly log food here
as well I can come in and I could search
scan with a barcode I could type in
through a nutritional database or I
could even just do a quick picture</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
