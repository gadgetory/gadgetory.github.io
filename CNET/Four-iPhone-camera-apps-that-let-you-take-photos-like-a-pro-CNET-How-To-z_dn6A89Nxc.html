for the iPhone but what about apps that
help you take better photos there are
plenty of those too and here are four of
the best camera plus is one of the
original third-party camera apps for
iPhone and it's only gotten better with
time you can choose between shutter
priority auto or full manual control
which lets you manually adjust focus
shutter speed ISO and even white balance
camera plus also lets you shoot photos
in raw one of the best features of
camera plus is the ability to tap with
two fingers to set exposure and focus
separately and as far as manual camera
apps go on the iPhone camera plus is one
of the easiest to navigate but it's also
somewhat light on features compared to
some others one thing you'll be missing
here is video support there are also
tons of other apps with similar feature
sets such as moment manual Muse cam
halide and even vsco cam another manual
camera app that's a bit of a step up in
terms of features and difficulty is pro
cam 5 you get the same controller for
white balance manual focus ISO and
shutter speed but you can also choose
between Raw and TIFF and there are
several modes to choose between 360
photos slow shutter burst mode portrait
mode night mode video and time-lapse pro
cam also lets you customize the
interface by changing the color choosing
between different grid styles and
enabling and exposure histogram and
focus peaking at first glance pro cam
can feel like information overload but
for photographers who are used to
shooting in manual and having total
control all of these settings are very
welcomed stepping out of the wide world
of manual camera apps there are other
types of apps that specialize in certain
shooting situations Hydra for example
specializes in tricky lighting it excels
at HDR photos videos and low-light you
won't find fine-tuning settings within
the Hydra viewfinder really all you can
change is the resolution or select one
of the five shooting modes HDR video HDR
low light
zoom and high res one of the best
features of Hydra is the high-res mode
which borrows a trick from Astro
photography by snapping multiple photos
rapidly and using these slight
differences in each to fill in the
blanks which turns a 12 megapixel photo
into a 32 megapixel image and it works
very well finally slow shutter
specializes in long exposures you can
choose between three shooting modes
motion blur light trail and low
light you can adjust the light
sensitivity blur strength or noise
reduction as well as shutter speed and
ISO this app is perfect for night
photography light painting or creative
nature photography for more tips and
