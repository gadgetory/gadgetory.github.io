comes a point when you realize that the
TV you really want wouldn't even be able
to fit through the door maybe what you
really need is a projector we're seeing
a fresh crop of great new projectors
that will leave you just as breathless
as a 4k TV but at a fraction of the
price i'm donald bell and in this top 5
we're counting down see Matt's picks for
the best home theater projectors
selected by senior editor David Katz
Myer starting off at number 5 the Epson
power light home cinema 3020 now Epson
is a big player in this game at a $1,500
a 3020 gives you a taste of what got
them there
great black levels good shadow detail
and 3d support you can upgrade this one
to a wireless hdmi for an extra $300 but
at that price there are some other
options worth exploring plus something
about the grills on this one give it an
evil robot vibe that kind of freaks me
out for the best value check out number
for the Ben QW 1070 at $1,000 the Ben Q
is the most compact and inexpensive
projector on this list but the picture
quality holds up to that Epson 3020 you
can even shift the lens around a little
bit instead of having to digitally warp
the image to get it all squared up and
nice on the downside the 3d glasses are
99 dollars each so if your kid really
wants to watch avatar they've got to
earn it but for a projector that covers
all the bases check out number 3 the
Sony VP LHW 50 es you get two pairs of
active 3d glasses an extra replacement
lamp and reference quality picture right
out of the box unfortunately the price
tag on that box is around four thousand
dollars this is a big step up in picture
quality try to think of it in terms of
picture quality per square inch and it's
a steal over a 4k TV coming in at number
two the JVC dla X 35 this beauty comes
in five hundred dollars less than the
Sony but matches it absolutely in terms
of picture quality once it's calibrated
now out of the box the sony is the clear
winner but having that five hundred
dollars in your
pocket to pay for professional
installation and calibration which you
should be doing anyway
makes the jvc a better choice also is
compatible with some inexpensive
third-party 3d glasses so you won't have
to go broke just to watch some of
Hollywood's crappiest movies now before
we get to our number one pick and home
theater projectors let's take a minute
to acknowledge one of the best TVs you
can buy seen its current top choices the
Panasonic TC Pvt $63,000 buys you the
best picture quality we've seen since
the legendary pioneer Kuro and unlike
the projector there are no bulbs to
replace no fancy screens to hang up and
you can keep the freaking lights on but
for all you cave-dwelling video files
one projector rises above all the rest
when it comes to both picture quality
and value at number one the Epson power
light home cinema 5020 you be now for
under $3,000 you get excellent color
accuracy deep blacks and 2 pairs of 3d
glasses best of all the projection is
bright enough that you can actually
leave a few lights on without ruining
the image quality that said maybe you're
weird home theater dungeon is best left
in the dark so there you have it 5 great
home theater projector is perfect for
your remastered edition of Citizen Kane
or maybe a storage wars marathon I won't
judge you more top fives like this head
over top-5 cnet.com i'm donald bell
