top the galaxy s5 I'm Bridget Carey and
this is your cnet update when it comes
to Samsung smartphones the Galaxy S line
has always been the flagship model but a
report out of Korea says Samsung could
be cooking up a new high-end smartphone
that will launch next month eTnews says
this would be better than the galaxy s5
and it was designed to challenge the
iphone 6 the Korean report calls it the
Galaxy alpha and said to have a metal
casing and come with additional features
now this could be a blend between the s5
and the larger galaxy note but alpha
could be a code name there also have
been some rumors of a device called the
s5 Prime so that could be in reference
to the same phone now it seems every
week there's a new rumor about what
samsung or apple is up to and you can't
always trust these anonymous sources but
there could be some truth behind the
speculation and in the world of Apple it
appears the iWatch could begin
mass-production in November which is
later than expected that's according to
a research note by a KGI Apple analyst
the researcher is forecasting that the
development will be later because of
hardware and software challenges it's
expected that apple SmartWatch will have
a curved screen and it could be water
resistant but we shall have to wait and
see in the meantime there's one small
apple feature you don't have to wait for
iTunes extras is now available on more
Apple devices normally if you buy a DVD
or blu-ray disc it comes with bonus
content like deleted scenes but if you
buy a movie on iTunes the digital
version of that bonus content is found
in iTunes extras and that's now
accessible from Apple TV before you
could only get it on the pc and mac
versions of itunes android users also
got a small update recently regarding
email now android litter attached files
from your google drive directly into a
gmail message the update also brings
better autocomplete suggestions when you
type a name into the to field on your
email and in the world of apps Google is
bringing its augmented reality location
game to Apple devices it's called
ingress and a bland
is real world maps and landmarks with
made-up energy sources that you have to
collect first you pick a side are you
the enlightened or the resistance and
then you use your smartphone to collect
sources of energy that are overlaid on a
map of your actual location now if
you're physically present in a
neighborhood with a power source well
you can claim it for your team and then
you can put other objects down to defend
it as more iphone owners join the
virtual game things could get more
challenging that your techniques update
you can get more details on these
