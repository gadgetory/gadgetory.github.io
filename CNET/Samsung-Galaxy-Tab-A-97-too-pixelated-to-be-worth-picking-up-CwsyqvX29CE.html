taking a first look at the Samsung
Galaxy Tab a nine point seven the Galaxy
Tab a nine point seven is fashionably
thin enlike and the rounded edges make
it comfortable to hold the smooth
texture on the back feels nice against
your fingertips but it doesn't provide
much grip support running the latest
version of Android lollipop 5.0 it
features Samsung's TouchWiz overlay and
Samsung also throws in a few free perks
like complimentary subscriptions to the
new york times and audiobooks from
audible as well as Microsoft offices
full suite of apps including Word and
PowerPoint if you have a compatible
Samsung Galaxy phone the tablet includes
side sync software which allows you to
control your phone using your tablet so
if you're carrying around both you only
have to use one the Galaxy Tab 89.7
houses a 1.2 gigahertz quad-core
processor one and a half gigabytes of
RAM and 16 gigabytes of internal storage
it also offers a micro SD card slot
that's expandable up to 128 gigabytes
performance isn't very fast but it tends
to be smooth it takes its time when
loading large apps are using the multi
window function but once launched it
tends to run without issues according to
Samsung the battery should last around
15 hours and after one test run in the
CNET labs it clocked in at 12 and a half
hours which is still a decent amount of
time the 1024 by 768 pixel resolution on
the nine point seven inch screen is
disappointing it's overwhelmingly
pixelated and though HD content still
looks relatively sharp and text is
readable it's just an unfortunately
outdated display I like the comfortable
design and the software extras but the
baseball-sized pixels are a deal-breaker
for me
starting at $2.99 it's also a bit
expensive for what you're getting if you
don't mind downsizing the screen I
recommend you pick up the 8 inch model
instead which starts at a more
reasonable 229 for all the details check
out my full review i'm Xiomara bulk
oficina and this has been a first look
at the samsung galaxy tab a nine point
seven</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
