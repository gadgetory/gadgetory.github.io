Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update twitter is about to launch its
own music app as of friday afternoon the
site music twitter com was up but not
active but Ryan Seacrest got an invite
he's tweet about how he's been testing
it out and loving it scene it was first
to report on Twitter working on a music
app that would suggest artists and songs
to listen to based on different things
like the accounts you follow or artists
that are trending looks like Twitter
might want to launch this during the
Coachella Music and Arts Festival in
California stay tuned for updates on
that the Facebook home interface came
out friday but only a few of the newest
android phones can get it however
Facebook updated its messenger app on
Android to give everyone access to the
chat heads feature once installed if a
friend sends a text or Facebook message
a circle with their head will pop up and
float on your screen reminding you to
get back to them that is until you
remove it some of the latest gadgets
were on display at the digital focused
technology showcase in New York you may
have heard about the nest smart
thermostat but Honeywell is also coming
out with an advanced connected system
for the home called the Wi-Fi smart
thermostat it has the connected features
you expect like being able to change the
temperature and set timers from a nap it
also sends alerts when the environment
changes greatly or if it's time to
change the filter it learns how long it
takes to heat or cool the home so it's
ready when you wake up or arrive from
work and you can set the screen color to
match your home decor it comes out in
May for two hundred fifty dollars same
price as the nest thermostat and it will
be sold at Home Depot also making an
appearance at the show was the link case
a case for your smartphone that has a
built-in antenna to boost your Wi-Fi
connection signal by up to fifty percent
it doesn't mean you'll have a faster
connection just that the connection
stronger went on Wi-Fi it costs fifty
dollars comes in multiple colors and
right now is only for the iphone 5 but
the company is making it for the galaxy
s4 and the ipad and i'm told they're
looking into ways a case can boost
cellular signals now that would be
helpful if it ever happens duracell
showed off a new iphone 5 wireless
charging station and case which has a
backup battery that you could snap onto
the back for extra juice there's a new
smart tag coming out from IFI systems
that keeps track of your phone and other
items an alarm will go off if this tag
gets too far from the phone and it
serves as a pager if you can't find your
phone or your keys the company now has
separate versions for Android and Apple
devices but in two months one silver
version is coming out that works on both
costing thirty dollars that's your tech
