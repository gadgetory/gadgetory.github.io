welcome to smart daily the best geek
talk-show in the known universe I'm
Ashley together I'm Jeff kanata and
we're here to keep you up-to-date on the
headlines we've heard a lot about
Harvard's Robo B's but it looks like
they've got some new tricks up their
wings the goal of the Robo B is to
create robot insects that can fly
autonomously for sustained periods of
time they've been working on this B for
years now and the most recent version is
about the same size as the real thing it
weighs just 84 milligrams which is
lighter than a real B and it can do
something previous versions couldn't it
can land on a wall during flight using
electrostatic adhesion robobee can stick
to just about any surface and needs
1,000 times less power to perch compared
to hovering which greatly extends its
battery life research on Robo B will
continue and the team leader Robert Wood
says it might be five to ten years
before we might see Robo be used in
real-world situations are they going to
be pollinating Robo flowers that's well
there that's one of the things they're
saying that they would maybe consider
robotic pollination well that's good
because I guess all the bees are dying
off and we're doomed really scary I have
the robot army save us and they may have
to replace the lost bees with Robo bees
which would be kind of cool yeah
sneaking robots guys there's a robot
that can now fold my laundry so gimme
gimme gimme
folding mate just dropped a preview
trailer for its robot laundry Overlord
the bot has clips that you hang your
clothes on and then it draws your shirts
into the machine to be folded up nicely
and stacked for putting away it also has
d wrinkling perfuming softening and
sanitizing options available for an
additional price sadly though you will
not be getting one for your significant
other this holiday season because
pre-orders won't start until next year
and the folding mate won't ship until
2018 and the starting price tag is an
eye-watering 700 dollars also it cannot
handle oversized items or things like
underwear but but who is folding their
eye
we're number one and also who's folding
fitted sheets no one cuz what's
impossible it's impossible to further
finishing then you invent a robot to do
that yeah that would be there's no price
too high for Robo fitted sheet robot
sky's the limit
blank check this is the start of this
story was so wonderful and the end was
so bad yeah I want 700 ollars is way
steep and not till 2018 couple years I
gotta wait tears I already stopped
folding things just when I heard about
it and now I have 2 years of unfolded
laundry I can only pre-order one thing
two years in advance which is my tether
car oh yeah I can't there's no I can't
wait that long it's too much but ok so a
lot of people the argument is I think we
have to talk about this on Thursday
there's a lot to there's a lot to get in
June and I'm dying I'm so dying to know
what you guys think of the fold you mate
uh ok there's a huge schism in people
there's a good Canyon between them right
one side says this is the laziest thing
I've ever seen in my life
people are the worst not wrong you're
not wrong uh and yet and yet the
majority of people if you look at polls
about this thing say this is the
greatest thing since sliced bread
I want one but not at $700 I want the
the roomba to move hit my laundry toss
it to the folding maid who then fold and
fold say yeah yeah it's like a Rube
Goldberg machine of robots oh I like
that a lot of laundry folding I
absolutely hate folding anything so this
makes me so happy I'm ready okay so
