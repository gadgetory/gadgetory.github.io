that TV here at the season 3 premiere of
HBO's Game of Thrones we're gonna talk
to the stars have a little fun goof
around here in San Francisco so let's go
check it out
so season 3 seems like you're coming of
age if you're kind of becoming not only
more independent but your characters
gonna grow a lot can you kind of talk a
little bit about that he needs to make
less mistakes this season because he's
growing into a man now and he needs to
use to fulfill that role but the trouble
is when he gets a taste of freedom
he doesn't really know what he wants
anymore so I think the the difficult
thing about this season is knowing where
his heart lies one of the oaths is that
you can no longer have relations with
women right yeah that's that's a that's
a big deal right terrible isn't it would
you make that choice in real life do you
have any tips for people to survive a
white Walker invasion Rawlings
it's all about confidence if people say
that when boxers are entering the ring
they kind of win the fight in the
entrance it's all about body language
it's all about confidence it's all about
intimidation so you can try these
naturally me what do we expect to see in
season three with you and Gilly well
it's all about intimidation again Gilly
might not think she think she loves some
at the moment when she look into these
big brown eyes your defenses are down
you're a tough mom a strong woman also
kind of a little reckless does her own
thing
hiring a man to slay my son bran let's
say forget the script if you wanted to
slap someone across the face kick him in
the butt who would that character be
well that person standing right beside
me mr. Jaime Lannister I think yeah
you're kind of like the Beyonce
independent woman oh I like that you
like that one
independent Marjorie's really
interesting she's very much the protege
of her grandmother you know the Queen of
thorns lady Olenna who is now joining us
to see the season 3 in the guise of our
Dame Diana Rigg so that was pretty
amazing to work with that experienced
older woman and get them all read in
real life if you saw Joffrey on the
street you didn't know him you didn't
work with them what do you think we'd
give him I'd give him a number ranking
or something Sophie and I have a joke
because Jack is who plays Joffrey it's
like the nicest most intelligent
sensitive boy from a young man you could
ever hope to meet
and it's kind of like the biggest like
joke of the entire show that the nicest
guys playing the worst guy and he has no
idea how he's reviled well I was
checking out your watch because it's a
pretty impressive watch let's just have
a look at that about the bling
I mean come on you're from royalty thing
like that really and I was expecting
there's a lot of Silicon Valley
billionaire so but that is that's a
trend this time I'm afraid in real life
a lot of people sometimes think the
characters themselves personify who they
are in real life
they believe that that's great I wish I
have his he's so fast he has this wit
and you know usually I'm the guy who
like I want to come up with something
and then 20 minutes later I go oh I
should have said this or that and but of
course he is you know he's just sharp so
but no I'm not I'm an actor I'm like
stupid it's nice to kind of get dressed
up and let people see like the real
Maisie and not always look like a kind
of 12 year old boy that's what with you
has anyone ever said you look amazing
they were like you can't say amazing
without saying Maisie and I thought that
was kind of sweet and cool so I'm
basically on a rigid completely
unoriginal
you try you really want to look for your
family because I would totally want to
like get another face and you know get
that coin I mean that would be kind of
cool right if you could choose yeah this
is the thing I think as Maisie I would
have gone with Jackson because I would
have been so much cooler and left the
boys but this is the whole starte thing
we're too loyal for that and you know
that's kind of our our downside maybe
that's that's our bad trait you you have
the final piece of the puzzle put
together in your head yet or where were
you out with that well I know the I know
the important things I know the broad
strokes a lot of the thing that you
discover any actual act of writing the
fine details and and little bits that
make the story come alive between you
know the great turning points is there
any space for like an Asian warrior with
a blonde streak in its hair that buys
for the throne is is there any way that
that can get squeezed in somehow can you
ride a horse yeah I can work on it
alright alright so there you guys have
it Game of Thrones season 3 Storm of
Swords
we can't wait to check it out March 31st
that's from here I'm gonna go watch it
right now we can't wait for you guys to
