the laundry this is an automatic robotic
folding machine that will actually fold
all the clean laundry that you throw
into it up to about 30 or 40 clothes now
at the moment this demo version that we
saw on the show floor at CES can fold
pretty much everything but it was only
folding one t-shirt at a time in theory
when it launches in March it will be
able to fold pretty much everything from
t-shirts to pants to underwear but not
socks unfortunately which is pretty
strange but apparently they're really
hard to fold even though we can't show
you what goes on inside because that's
all patented technology it does use
artificial intelligence and image
analysis to work out exactly what the
clothes are and how to fold them
individually so once the robot works out
what the item actually is it will pick
it up with the robotic arm analyze it
and then fold it into shape however it
does take a long time just to fold one
t-shirt it took about five minutes or so
and it's not going to be cheap and this
big black structure is not the final
image that you're going to see of the
laundry it's going to change form factor</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
