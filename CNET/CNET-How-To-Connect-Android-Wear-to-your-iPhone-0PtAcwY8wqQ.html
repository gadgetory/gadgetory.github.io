iPhone here is how to connect and some
of the things that you can do first up
though a couple of caveats at the time
of recording this video only the LG
watch urbane is officially supported
though moving forward all Android wear
smartwatches will be compatible plus
third-party watch apps are not supported
to set things up install the Android
watch app on your iPhone from the iTunes
Store turn on Bluetooth on your iPhone
now you need to pair the devices
together the app will walk you through
the process of entering a code from the
watch on the phone you might find that
if the watch has already been paired
with an Android and you can't get it to
connect factory reset the watch once the
devices are paired the app will ask you
to sign in or choose your Google Account
activate Google now then turn on watch
notifications and location now on to the
fun stuff message alerts from iMessage
appear on the screen but you can't reply
from the watch call notifications also
come through and you can answer or
ignore but you need to use the handset
to talk to get the best email experience
go to the app tap the Settings Cub email
cards and toggle on rich Gmail cards now
you can tap in to read the content of
your email get options to archive delete
or reply also you can use voice or draw
an emoji to reply I really think that's
a great idea
Google now cards show up on the watch
face as well as notifications from other
iOS apps to dismiss them just swipe to
the right and they will also be
dismissed from your iPhone thanks to ok
Google you can set an agenda an alarm or
even a reminder ok Google remind me to
record an Android wear video at 1 p.m.
some extra settings that you might want
to change from the iOS app include watch
faces or you can download additional
ones that's a quick look at setting up
your Android wear with your iPhone for
more tips and tricks make sure to check
