welcome to google issues for all the
Google goodness that we can pack inside
of a show this week is google making a
Power Move and acting like a big bully
well no they've always had their power
but according to a new report from the
information the googs is changing the
terms of its licensing agreements with
Android device manufacturers like
Samsung and LG that are using their
google mobile services like Google Play
google maps and gmail there now
reportedly requiring their partners to
include more google apps displayed
prominently on the device in addition to
making Google search more visible now
Android still available for anyone to
use but big manufacturers like HTC or
motorola must agree to the terms in
order to offer googles apps and services
on their phone it's really an
interesting shift where Google is
starting to exert more power and control
than we've seen in the past over android
but phones aren't the only platform the
g men and women are watching the googs
appears to be also imposing its tight
control over their Android wear wearable
platform after it asked crowdfunding
site IndieGoGo to take down a campaign
for a budget SmartWatch called the calm
one according to android police now we
know that they are overseen every aspect
of the Android wear user experience from
the UI to over-the-air updates but after
this move we shouldn't expect any
crowdfunded Android wear hardware if
ever Google just come out and at least
acknowledge publicly that you're
changing your approach these days and
you want more control of your ecosystem
instead of doing it hush-hush behind the
scenes Google don't be evil all right LG
appears to be working on a new
SmartWatch of their own according to
recently discovered FCC documents the
watch looks to be oval shaped and will
support a 3g cdma connection of its own
for data which would point to sprint and
verizon compatibility in the united
states the SmartWatch won't be dependent
on a phone but there's no word of the
operating system it will be running yet
LG's first round watch the G watch are
still has no release date so this
stand-alone watch probably won't be
coming out anytime soon and I know
you've been bombarded by been date but
Consumer Reports took some of the top
bones out right now and held a bend test
of their own to see which phones really
are the easiest to Ben now the iphone 6
and 6 plus weren't the sturdiest phones
but they also weren't the weakest that
award goes to the HTC One m8 which
buckled under 70 pounds of pressure now
the six plus managed to hold up to 90
pounds of pressure and the most durable
phone on the market right now guess what
the samsung galaxy note 3 which started
to deform under 150 pounds of pressure
and that phone works out now the LG g3
tied for second place with the iphone 5
bending at 130 pounds as well and info
news the director of 1 plus global
revealed that the one plus two is in the
works in the company's targeting q2 of
2015 but let's hope they drop their
stupid invite-only program for the one
plus to purchase it see you guys aren't
that special in fact no one is you have
a legit phone but you made people care
about it less because there's a lot of
other great ones out there so learn from
that alright sony's inviting press out
to an event on october the 9th in new
york city that could possibly see the US
launch of its latest xperia z3 lineup
that we saw it Aoife and its stellar
camera so we'll keep an eye out for that
and nexus 6 fans or nexus x fans who
knows what they'll really call it more
pictures have leaked out for the
smartphone built by motorola codenamed
Shamu but why named it after a killer
whale well maybe because of its rumored
5.92 inch screen now this is no whale
tail it's coming in specs of revealed
not only the monster screen but a 13
megapixel rear camera 2-megapixel
front-facing camera a qHD display three
gigs of RAM and 32 gigs of storage we're
expecting an announcement in October
with a release in November and with a
code name like that you guys should
probably make it waterproof all right
that's going to do it for this week's
show you can always email us at Google
licious at cnet com or tweet me at brian
Tong thanks so much for watching and
we'll see you next time for some more of
that Google Isha's
delicious</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
