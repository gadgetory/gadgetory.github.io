we're here with simple TV you remember
simple TV from CES 2012 where the
product NAVSEA nuts best of CES Award in
the home theater category and now it's
finally shipping for a hundred and fifty
dollars escort simple TV is a DVR for
recording free over-the-air TV signals
although it's quite not like any other
DVR you may have seen it's just a small
white box and when you turn it around
you'll notice there's no HDMI output on
the back that's because simple TV is
designed to stream to compatible devices
on your network which includes Roku
boxes an iPad or even a standard web
browser you can also access your content
outside your network giving you the
Slingbox style ability to tune into live
TV and recorded programs from anywhere
you can get an internet connection to
get the simple TV box working you
actually need to provide some of your
own hardware including a hard drive for
storage and an antenna for receiving
over-the-air TV signals simple TV also
requires a wired Ethernet connection the
box doesn't have built-in Wi-Fi so you
need to find a place where you can
connect both an antenna and an Ethernet
cable setup is pretty simple and once
you get it working you can set up season
pass recordings and browse the
electronic program guide just like you
would on a normal DVR the iPad and
browser interface is really pretty slick
including artwork and program
descriptions now the roku channel has a
more basic user interface but it's good
enough for accessing shows in your
living room again though it's worth
pointing out simple tvs limitations
you only get basic Network TV channels
so there's no cable channels like ESPN
Comedy Central HBO or Showtime also
simple TV only has single tuner
capability so you can't record two shows
at once or watch live TV while it's
recording another show now because
simple TV sends all its video signals
over your Hjelm network it needs to use
some compression and that affects image
quality if you've got a sharp eye you're
gonna notice the image softness right
away but for a lot of shows it actually
looks pretty good
where I did notice the difference a lot
was on programs with fast moving action
Sports NFL games really suffered from
simple TVs compression making it
especially hard to track the ball on
long passing place and simple TV is it
nearly as responsive as a typical DVR
when you're fast-forwarding or skipping
through content the image and the
background actually stays paused so you
don't have any idea where you're about
to stop you just have to guess really
the best thing simple TV has going for
it is its low total cost of ownership
even when you include its $5 per month
premiere subscription option that you
really need to access its best features
the best competing over there DVR is the
TiVo premiere and while the hardware
only cost one hundred and fifty dollars
TiVo's $15 monthly fee adds up fast
total cost of ownership for a TiVo is
three hundred and thirty dollars for one
year while simple TV is only two hundred
and if you look at lifetime subscription
options TiVo's total cost is six hundred
and fifty compared to just three hundred
for a simple TV so sure simple TV isn't
as good as TiVo but it is much cheaper
and that pretty much sums up the simple
TV experience it has a lot of
limitations compared to a traditional
DVR and the experience is it nearly as
good but it does offer significant
savings which will definitely appeal to
the court cutter crowd simple TV still
feels like an early adopter only product
but if you're looking to save money and
can put up with its limitations it's
worth checking out I'm Matthew moscovia
and this is simple TV</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
