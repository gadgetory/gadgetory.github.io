at their smartphone and think why can't
the tech in my car be more like this and
then all of a sudden it was now cars
have to be nearly as digital connected
and fast evolving as mobile devices
without becoming death traps of
distraction in this episode of cnet
conversations we meet the chief
technology officer at Ford Paul
Mascarenas who has the cutting edge of
this major automaker on his plate at a
very tech forward time have you ever
seen more innovation than right now just
more and more and more innovation again
this trend is the consumer world now
extending into the vehicle environment
but us having to do it in a way they're
seamless and way that's very sure if
that's safe Mascarenas became CTO of
Ford in January 2011 right around the
time Ford SYNC got the ability to
integrate third-party apps by pandora
and stitcher that's also the point in
automotive history where a lot of folks
begin wondering aloud where an app-based
car leads us in terms of distraction the
answer to that question begins in Fords
vehicle simulator vertex this is like
aerospace technology right this is like
something that NASA would use voice this
person it's a flashing light yeah that's
exactly what it it it's a very very real
driving experience you can see here the
view from a driver's seat in terms of
the street scene we've been using this
for about 10 years now to simulate all
aspects of the driving experience and if
you think about the you know driver
distraction in the broadest sense is
everything from the headline-grabbing
texting while driving phone calls while
driving there's a lot more going on
let's get in vertex I feel this is quite
an experience let's go right if I'm well
I guess I'm first of a slaughterfest all
right so what do you do in a simulator
like this what are you learning from me
doing this well the first thing is just
the driving experience itself so we can
experiment with lots of different setups
in the vehicle whether seating positions
steering wheel configurations the type
of displays that we have in the car we
also see in front of you Brian there's
some cameras up Yeah right in front of
me here we can actually use to monitor
your face particularly your eyes and
detect whether you're dry drowsy or
whether you're distracted because those
wouldn't lie those cameras will know
what I'm really doing and my eyes are
really knowing they know whether you're
looking at me they know whether you're
looking down I know whether you're
focusing on the road ahead being our own
yeah now it's getting interesting now
I'm getting traffic here's an area where
you might start to sort to measure my
workload right exactly some more things
are happening now I got a lot of traffic
around me all of a sudden we might
choose for example to say hey I can't
receive a telephone call
or we might write new radial or you
might stop changing chapters on premium
if i recall correctly with the evos
concept you're looking to a future of
starting to measure even more biometric
or biological inputs is that right it is
and one of the things that we have in
there the evos as a concept is a heart
rate monitoring sing we can use that
information to shut down displays to
shut down telephone features and really
just help you concentrate on on the
driving it's a whole new world that
we're going into and a couple of bumps
in the road yeah it's a mission it's
absolutely amazing how immersive mishits
michigan paintin this is right i can
tell what state where that's how
accurate it is for Paul Mascarenas
evolving and improving the automobile is
part of a career-long engagement with
the high tech side of cars what got you
into this business in the first place
I'm getting the cars I love cars I've
always loved cars I I join food right
out of college in the UK yeah I've
worked my whole career in vehicle
development there's just so much going
on out there whether it's safety
technologies whether its connectivity
communications and so on how you stitch
all of those things together in a
vehicle and provide this different and
kind of wonderful user experience has
just been fantastic how can it be
anything other than an exciting business
to be in now not long ago a CTO at a
major car company might have been
somewhat out of the spotlight while the
focus was more on styling or horsepower
even rebates but today a CTO like Paul
Mascarenas finds himself very much at
the center of the action anywhere but
the middle of the road
