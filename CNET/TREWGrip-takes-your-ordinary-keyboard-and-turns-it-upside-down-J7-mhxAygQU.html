CES 2014 with a whole new tape on the
keyboard this is called the true grip
and imagine a normal qwerty keyboard
setup but you split it and then you
flipped it so the concept here is that
you can be able to just type very easily
using the way that your school teachers
taught you how to type with your fingers
on the home row keys but your muscle
memory instead of being down here it's
kind of to the side and it's a little
odd for me because I don't remember how
i typed in school I have a new way now
so I have to reteach myself the right
way to be able to use this but when you
hit a key the lights on the other end
will light up so you know what you Hicks
who would use this why would you want to
reteach yourself another keyboard well
they're kind of aiming towards the
health care industry for this imagine a
doctor walking around taking patient
notes they don't have to lose eye
contact with you and they could still
take notes and not look away to to a
tablet which is slower to type on or
turn away to their office pc so this is
Bluetooth enabled with all sorts of
devices anything that could take a
Bluetooth connection whether it's a
windows phone or an Android tablet or an
iPhone it'll connect to this with
suction and magnets so there's nothing
clipping on this the tablet is not
falling out it's just a suction system
on it you can also use this as a
bluetooth keyboard for your home PC
maybe your Smart TV because you don't
want to have to have different types of
keyboards for all sorts of devices in
the home now aside from the medical
field may be a journalist would want
this because it's a lot easier to take
notes on the go with this than it is to
write in my notebook then go back to my
computer and retype it out and it's also
faster than typing on my
tablet but they really see this as
something for a medical industry
probably coming out at the end of the
year and they're selling it for two
hundred and fifty dollars and if you
think that you know it might be hard for
you to get used to this they say if you
learn the right way in school it might
just take you an hour to type the same
way that you do right now we're seeing
that I'm Bridget Carey he was your first
look at the children</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
