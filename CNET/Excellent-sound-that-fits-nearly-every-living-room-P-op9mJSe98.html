today we're going to take a look at the
Sony HT CT 260 this is a budget sound
bar with a distinctive design and
selling for about three hundred dollars
now the sony has a long tube-like shape
like most sound bars but it's angular
hexagonal shape gives it a unique look
the sound bar itself stands four inches
tall which should fit nicely in front of
most TVs without blocking the remote
sensor like some sound bars do if it
does block the remote sensor on your TV
the HTC T 260 has a neat remote control
pass-through feature where it repeats
any remote signals received from the
front out of the back of the sound bar
it's a cool work around especially since
most sound bars don't deal with the
issue at all the system also includes a
wireless subwoofer that you can place
nearly anywhere in the room as long as
you can plug it into an outlet the
included remote is a nice size although
it's a little more cluttered with
buttons than I'd like but otherwise the
button layout is good and overall it's
much better than the standard thin
remotes that come with many sound bars
around back you'll find just three
inputs optical coaxial and mini jack
that's not much but that's because Sony
intends you to connect all your devices
to your TV first then connect your TV's
optical output to the sound bar it's a
simpler setup overall as long as your TV
has enough hdmi inputs for all your gear
the HTC T 260 also has built-in
bluetooth which is a must-have feature
these days Bluetooth lets you wirelessly
stream audio from nearly every
smartphone or tablet and it works with
any app you have on your phone so you
can load up Pandora on your phone and
streaming straight to the sound bar as
for sound quality the sony is really
pretty impressive for a budget sound bar
for one it sounds better than our
favorite sound bar from last year the
higher SBE v40 slim with the wider
soundstage in more detail the little
subwoofer is also surprisingly powerful
with deeper bass extension than other
systems in the price class it's not the
best sounding system I've heard this
year as it was slightly outclassed and
head to head comparisons with the Vizio
s 4251 w and the sharp HTS be 60 but
it's still a
excellent overall so altogether the sony
HTC t2 60s real strength is that it
delivers excellent sound quality and a
flexible design that should work in just
about any living room other sound bars
may sound a little better or have more
features but the sony is a very balanced
system without any major flaws making it
one of our go to budget sound bar pics
I'm Matthew miskovic and this is the
sony HTC t 260</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
