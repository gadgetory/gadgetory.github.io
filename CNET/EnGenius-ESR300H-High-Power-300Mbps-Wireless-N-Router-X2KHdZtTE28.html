wo foster calm and this is my very first
review of 2012 and let's just say this
the year is only gonna get better why
because it's not very good rarer now
this is the extra range one is rarer ESR
308 foam and genius this is the first in
the extra range family that the company
introduced just last week SC at 2012 and
it was very excited to view it
unfortunately he didn't have much to
show in my testing it was actually one
of the slowest I was seen in terms of
Wi-Fi speed and its range not so extra
or exceptional either to acquire this
this small compact router come with a
few very good features one of which is
the VPN server which is built-in
this allows user to create a secure
connection for remote user via the
Internet and the second good thing is
come with a robust parental control
features quality of service and a few
other is web interface why responsive is
not very friendly to home user however
but the very best thing about this
router is his price which is only $45
making it a good investment for those
who just want to take advantage of the
VPN feature as a wallet router it comes
with two detachable unten a on the back
where you also file for LAN port and one
one port all of these ports are not
gigabit on the front you'll see an array
of tiny LED started light that show the
status of the router the connection to
the internet and the port on the back
and here you see the Wi-Fi potato setup
button that helps you quickly hook a
Wi-Fi client to the network the router
is desired to be put flat on any surface
squid for feet on the bottom but it's
also well mountable and it comes with
the screws overall this is a budget
compact router which I cannot recommend
to anybody due to is pretty bad
performance but if you want to find out
maybe it's worth four or five dollars go
check out the full review at sea calm
once again my name is dome
and this has been the first look as the
extra rains wireless router ESR 300 H
