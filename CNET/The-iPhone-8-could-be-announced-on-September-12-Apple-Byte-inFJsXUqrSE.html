the Apple buy for everything good and
bad inside the world of Apple
now don't worry we're gonna start off
with little note stuff but the Galaxy
Note 8 was officially announced it looks
like a great addition to the note family
and then classic Samsung style you know
they threw a barber too at Apple
including the classic headphone jack one
guess what you can do with those
earphones that's right
you can plug them in to the standard
earphone jack yeah but you know what I
still want them to bring it back to the
iPhone just saying now the best thing
about the note 8 is its dual lens camera
where you'll be able to adjust the
amount of background blur before you
capture photo and even after the other
cool feature both lens have optical
image stabilization but then they
decided to compare what an iPhone 7 plus
looks like taking a video clip compared
to the note 8 but come on
Samsung really like I have never seen an
iPhone video taken by a grown man or
even a child that shaky unless we're
talking about Brian Cooley he takes
horrible photos so I'm calling BS on
that comparison Samsung and you know
what you're getting a bad apple and this
is the part where I read the comments to
see how many of you wrote just make sure
your Note 8 doesn't explode yeah we get
those all the time now Mac forever is
reporting that Apple's upcoming iPhone
keynote will take place on September the
12th according to their carrier sources
they say carriers have been notified
when to expect the announcement to
prepare for inventory and marketing the
device now historically apples done it
within the first two weeks of September
but we'll wait until we hear an official
date confirmation but the timing would
be right okay the biggest feature people
ask me about is the new iPhones facial
recognition you know how would it work
in different lighting conditions what
about with the phone at different angles
and how does Apple pay work without the
presence of a touch ID button anymore
well a report from the Korea Herald now
claims the new facial recognition
scanner with 3d sensors will be able to
sense a user's face in the millionths of
a second now Bloomberg's mark Berman the
man behind almost every legit Apple
rumor we have wrote in early August that
Apple will pitch face ideas faster more
secure and more accurate than touch ID
according to people inside Apple is
i phone tech that I'm most curious to
see in action so we'll see how well it
really works in person
all right we're expecting to see the new
Apple watch at Apple September event and
all signs point to LTE being the new
feature for it MPD collected data from
over 5,000 SmartWatch owning respondents
and found a few interesting things now
as of June this year nearly 9% of US
consumers aged 18 and over
owned a SmartWatch the millennial
generation has the highest SmartWatch
ownership at 13% and the male-to-female
split of ownership is the closest it's
ever been with males at 60% and females
at 40% as its audience broadens and you
know what you can probably thank Apple
for closing that gap with all of its
more fashionable wristbands you know
color choices now when you look at how
people are using their SmartWatch daily
54 percent are using it for
notifications and text messages and 45
percent are using it for activity
tracking that's not a surprise but
what's stuck out to me 26% of people are
using it for phone calls daily like
that's way higher than I thought and
really good for the upcoming series
three LTE watch alright just after last
week's show a report from Bloomberg
revealed that Apple and others have been
talking to movie studios about offering
digital rentals for films just weeks
after their release in theaters now
nothing has been agreed upon yet but
reports say Apple Comcast and now Amazon
are looking for a delivery system that
would make movies available for renting
30 to 45 days after its theatrical
release for a price of $30 there's also
been talks of a 50 dollar price point
just 17 days after a movie's release now
I asked the Twitterverse when the story
first dropped and a lot of people were
just turned off instantly by the idea of
a $50 price point as a rental but you
know what I think this is a great idea
it's just another option you have to see
a movie for a family or if you're
someone who owns a killer home theater
system and you want to bring some
friends over $50 is not bad at all and
again it's just an option it doesn't
change what you have already available
to you today and if you want to pay for
it you can you know what I'm all about
Apple and others getting something like
this done ASAP all right that's gonna do
it for this week's show you can email us
at the Apple bite at cnet.com or tweet
me at Bryant on bass what you're
watching we'll catch y'all next time for
another bite of the
okay we're good yeah okay hey it's cool

mean is he bad have you have you seen
his photos they're they're bad I mean

bat I'm surprised he's thriving man that
guy's hey Charlie he's bad right yeah no
