dot and really loved it I mean we gave
it an Editors Choice Award but with just
a few small tweaks we also think that
this could be one of the coolest car
gadgets around for starters this device
was already halfway toward making a
solid transition to your car I mean it
has this rubberized base that can go
onto a dashboard and won't really slip
around it also has a line out so you can
connect to the aux port in your car but
if it had these three things
Alexa could go from being a home device
to an everywhere device one thing we'd
really love to see is 3G connectivity I
mean Amazon already does it with the
Kindle so why not just transfer that
functionality over to the echo dot that
would allow for a solid internet
connection without having to deal with a
mobile hotspot we also love for it to be
able to pull information from our phones
so contact information they can do
hands-free calls texts and emails that
would make things so much simpler
although Alexa has the ability to know
your location at any given time I would
also love turn-by-turn directions that
would be so cool as a hands-free
integration yeah you can already do a
lot of this stuff with your phone but
reaching for it while you're driving is
a hassle and a hazard with Alexa it
would all be voice controlled so we can
keep our eyes on the road and our hands
on the wheel
so we already love the Amazon echo dot
as a smart home device but with these
few changes it could become a really
cool everywhere device</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
