just in time for Episode two 18 of the
359 podcast shout out to beefy tech in
the chat and in the house we got Alfred
Eng and Ben Fox Ruben good morning guys
it's podcast I don't know what Alfred is
doing just ignore him all right we had a
we had a big wheels in here Alfred got
very excited yeah now your microphones
not on because you were playing with the
big wheels you act like a big boy you
got a big boy okay all right I'll put
the big wheels away what are we talking
about today
well we've got some big news coming from
Amazon well it's a bit bit of a scoop we
think that the next Amazon is going to
have Amazon echo is going to have a face
on it or at least a screen I mean this
is coming after yesterday when they had
when they were billed the Amazon look
the echo look with a camera on it yes so
it looks like the next one's going to
have a screen on it maybe also a camera
and it may be coming as soon as next
month
so yeah what else we got I also took the
look at two cybersecurity reports that
you know pretty much pointed out the
same thing about ransomware and how it's
basically tripled in price not to buy
but on the road to you know pay off if
you ever get infected and so it's
basically getting much more expensive
and then we're taking a look at Facebook
lives a killer problem where essentially
you know a lot of people are in just
like two weeks people have been like
murdered alive on Facebook and it's
terrible news let's try to let's try to
keep that one a little light but it is
very important to yes guys yep either
way sending your questions and comments
Brian we'll get to as many of them as he
can at the end of the show and let's do
podcast it's podcast and then here we go
in three two
you
welcome to the 359 I'm Alfred Inge I'm
Ben Fox Ruben we've got a scoop from one
of Ben's many many sources about the
next Amazon echo there have been rumors
for a while now that Amazon wants to
release an echo with a screen that could
help with you know video chats and
online shopping the news comes just a
day after Amazon unveiled their echo
look the voices system with a camera
that pretty much judges your outfit then
why it was Amazon pushing all of these
different variations out all of a sudden
yeah we actually talked about this on
the podcast yesterday that if Amazon
could create an echo for literally
everybody that's exactly what they're
going to do so it looks like that's what
what's happening on top of that it looks
like they kind of feel they they're like
hearing the footsteps with Google right
now with the Google home that they're
trying to get out these products a
little bit faster in hopes of keeping
ahead of the game against Google I'm
starting to feel like they're April
Fool's prank the Alexa for dogs and cats
is like not a joke anymore
oh yeah that's probably going to be
coming sometime in q4 I would imagine so
I'm kidding I'm kidding
so why do they want an echo with a
screen like what kind of benefits does
that have I'm talking to a couple
analysts about this they really see the
potential of voice assistance not being
able to do anything and everything like
for instance I've tried to shop on my
echo and it just takes a while like if
you're waiting until you get to like the
third option you're already like sick of
it already so if you get a screen
attached to it it you can you can query
the the echo the same way that you
normally would but you would get all the
options all at once you probably like do
a touchscreen thing and you'd be able to
do much easier voice shopping you could
also use it for like video chats
different stuff like that well next up I
took a look at two reports on
cybersecurity released this week they're
both pointing at a trend of an increase
in ransomware in both variation and
price so the average price of ransomware
in 2015 was about two hundred
ninety-four dollars a victim so in 2016
it jumped up to more than a thousand
dollars look if you were unfortunate
enough to be hit with the mere cop
malware that ransomware demanded twenty
eight thousand seven hundred and thirty
dollars from its victim
that is not cheap then jeez so what are
people supposed to do like if you talk
to experts as far as like are there ways
to avoid ransomware like should we pay
them I mean it's the same way that you
avoid most malware you know don't open
suspicious emails of the majority of
them came through emails and what some
of the malware does is that they'll like
if they get an entire system like a
hospital or networks they won't just
infect that single computer it'll like
wait until it's spread around the entire
network and that's because then they can
up their price even more that way good
good and and the reason why they've gone
up in price is so heavily is because
people are more willing to pay the
ransom than try to break out of it
because it is so difficult to you said
like before like in 2015 it was like
what 200 bucks yeah like you got to do a
lot of ransomware to actually be making
some money if you're just gonna shake
people down for 200 well the thing is is
that you know people are actually start
are just paying it and then if they know
that they can't decrypt it easily then
you know they're gonna raise the price
more you know if they know the customers
willing to pay I mean this semantics
research found that 64% of American
victims pay up instead of you know just
trying to decrypt it as it becomes like
increasingly difficult mmm and last we
have a story on Facebook live having a
problem with murderers and just the last
two weeks there have been two notorious
situations one in Thailand one in I
believe it was Cleveland yes yeah um you
know where you know these killers are
going on the live streaming service for
the world to see I mean clearly this is
an issue for Facebook which is trying to
expand its live platform but it's at the
same time becoming a platform for for
killers and this is like pretty grisly
stuff I definitely hope Facebook does
something more about this and to be fair
other live streaming services from
Google and Twitter you know they you
know this problem too but Facebook does
have the largest audience totally anyway
if you like what you heard check us out
on Sina com I'm Alfred Inge
I'm Ben Fox Ruben
and thanks for listening everybody all
right let's go ahead and jump right into
the chat we want to give a shout out to
uh Keaton Lanka who is asking if we know
when this what would they call this
Amazon face so okay uh the screen and
the code name is night like night with a
K that is so weak it's a code name is
it's not what the actual name is gonna
be when it actually comes out CR I have
to apologize very visceral response on
my part right no it's okay this miss
don't code names
it's what Amazon is calling it
internally and you know my source who
told me about night like mention that
name and the Wall Street Journal
mentioned in their report back in last
May so this is close to a year ago they
also mentioned an echo with a screen on
it called night so they've been working
on this thing for quite a while and I'm
quite confident that this thing
definitely exists because there have
been a lot of rumors about it and it
looks like it may actually get
introduced next month so we might be a
couple weeks away from this actually
getting introduced we have fantastic
theory from Matthew declar in the chat
who says is this a reference to Michael
Knight I don't even what does that mean
Knight Rider
Knight Rider maybe but so it doesn't
have a face serene so the other
interesting thing about this is is that
the echo look they basically did like a
soft launch of it yesterday
they didn't pre-brief anybody they just
like brought it out there they were like
here's the YouTube video check it out
the fact is is that now that I've heard
that this other echo may be coming next
month that means that like it makes more
sense why they would soft launch this
product they just wanted to get the look
out the door but then like prep for this
other much bigger product next month but
that's all speculative we do not
completely speculative completely
speculative but I guess it provides a
little bit more insight as to why they
would just kind of drop the luck and not
do like a much bigger splash about it
and Matthew dad sure also points out
that oh sorry I got distracted here for
a second oh sorry no beefy tech beefy
tech had a comment the benefits of
having a screen is the facial
recognition
and possibly medical support right
that's it well that's if this screen has
a camera on it which yeah so the
assumption is is that now that the look
is out the one with the screen is
probably also going to have a camera on
it too I mean like why now I mean if
that's the case those and wouldn't it
wouldn't that kind of like cut sales
away from the look where it's basically
if the other ones also going to have a
camera like why would I spend money on
this one I can just wait for the one
with a screen that I can also use well
the question invite-only right so this
is kind of a beta test phase can't you
imagine that at one point the echo is
going to be all under the same hood it's
going to be screen camera audible one
box kind of thing they're not going to
have this be a component it's not a Sega
Genesis I mean I still hope they keep
like the different variations of it
because I am a big fan of the hockey
puck oh yeah definitely well the hockey
puck like the echoed died yeah 50 bucks
definitely makes a lot of sense
Bloomberg wrote about an echo with a
screen in November so there have been a
lot of reports about this thing coming
it just looks like it's definitely it
looks like it's coming very soon now but
they were describing it as like a
high-end echo so the difference between
the echo look and whatever this night
product is going to be would be a
perhaps a substantial difference in
price like maybe they would price this
like the look is $200 maybe this one
would be I don't know it's hard to say
maybe 300 maybe more than that again
that's allocation I did not hear
anything about price the screen is
definitely helpful but I only see it
being helpful in like very specific
situations where like it can't pick up
like based off my voice command what I
want so the other day I was trying to
listen to the song music by Madonna mmm
and I asked at you know echo play music
by Madonna boy it was like oh playing
like all of Madonna's songs instead you
specify so in place so I did that and
still that that's the thing it always
has these errors like I was trying to
listen to I've got to learn I was the
other day I was trying to listen to joy
badasses new album but like his name is
Phelps a badass I hear what it sure the
Atma in his name though the esses are
spelled with like dollar signs so it's
like you didn't recognize that either
like that's Joey bedded olivella yes
so like this green would like definitely
help with that I've had that problem to
listening to Bruno Mars is 24-karat man
check because it's it's spelled out 24k
magic and I have to say that which I
sound like a limo being like Alexa play
24k magic by the way I know what the
song is really uh let's talk about
ransomware for a little bit uh Matthew
wherever he operates and works says he's
had a few clients get hit with some
ransomware and that backups and shadow
copies are your friends that is good
advice to all yeah that's that's
generally the the way to go but the
attacks have gone a little bit more
sophisticated where it used to be will
they encrypt like specific files or
specific you know folders and things
like that that you can't access but now
they've gone to the point where it's
like they would just encrypt your entire
like drive system yeah um
which again like if if you have
everything backed up then that's a
little bit different but that's also why
they're like not specifically targeting
like we're just gonna get this one
computer to where it's like we're gonna
take over an entire network so like even
though we have a backup of this you
might not have a backup of you know
something on another computer or
anything like that and then you know
they've been targeting specifically like
public sector places so like hospitals
a few months ago or like a few weeks ago
San Francisco's like entire public
transportation system got hit by it
mm-hmm
so and it's those things that like you
can't exactly backup like you know right
not only that but there's more money
there too yeah that if you take over an
entire like public sectors yeah or like
a hospital hospital needs that stuff to
work like so there's more potential for
them to just pay up the money and get
this over with and then I gets to a
point with like security and that aspect
where it's like they've targeted like
police departments and then essentially
if you make a backup of that like who's
to ensure that that backup is safe from
you know somebody like stealing it and
like physically in the police station or
anything like that but yeah the entire
systems it's like it you can't really
back up like the the like the thing that
you put your money into like to get your
what's the San Francisco equivalent of a
metro card I don't know whatever now
from San Francisco yeah I've never used
a public we need to do so we need like
one or two extra Internet's just lying
around yeah yeah let's get on that
swinging back over to
smart home tech beefy tech asks do you
think the new if the new Amazon echo
will have more control over your
personal info are we talking about like
the the night product I think between
the night and the look yeah it's a safe
assumption that yeah I would totally
agree with that comment I mean I think
that once you add a camera once you add
a screen in then Amazon is potentially
there's much greater potential for
Amazon to require a lot more data for
from the customer I mean the more
information that you know the more
features that it has the more
information people are willing to give
to it you know we're like oh it knows
all the music I listen to but at the
same time that's because I allow it to
you know have access to my Spotify
account so and aside from privacy issues
to the possibility of having at least a
screen could maybe make Alexa a little
bit smarter too right because it would
be able to like if it didn't fully
understand what you said maybe it would
provide you with like three different
examples and be like what did you mean
by that and that would at least train
the system a little bit better to
understand something if it's garbled
text or what have you so there is a
consumer benefit to doing this beyond
just Amazon getting more information
from you
branching off of that Joey comments the
Amazon or Google just need to build an
entire home how long do we think how far
away from that are we like like a
prebuilt home they just like drop
somewhere a just a grill house they 3d
print it on the spot and I mean we is it
self together and the whole thing just
knows you I actually love that idea
we had terrifying but we have something
like that on our Instagram it wasn't
from Amazon or Google but it was like
some engineer that like 3d printed an
entire home it was like the thing that
printer was like in the middle and it
had like it would like go around and it
were just like 3d print based off of
that I can all you have to do is make it
smart
yeah um can't imagine how sturdy it
would be like a 3d printed home but it
would be really funny if it was like
your new house brought to you by Google
and then inexplicably Google or one of
those other tech companies goes bankrupt
and you're like how stops working you
have to move we mean to stop at working
that doesn't work yeah like like No
I'm sorry all the services are done more
likely gets bought out by something you
hate and then you get like you get read
Yahoo home right
you rise warp time warner home evil Corp
took over my house you know and like now
the sink like spills out blood this is
horrible and the Wi-Fi constantly fails
a Michael Brown our old buddy Michael
Brown on the subject of home assistance
do you think we'll ever see a Samsung
big speed home assistant well they're
aiming at that yeah they talked about it
going in there washing machine that's
like one of the first like non Galaxy s8
that they're aiming it for and then the
TV which like is like pretty standard as
far as you know like yeah TV washing
machine refrigerator yeah Samsung makes
a ton of products and the the potential
and the assumption that they're gonna
add the Bigsby and to a lot more studies
definitely did there however Bigsby is
still a very early product they
purposely made Bigsby to be able to you
know be on pretty much every device not
just their phone mmm it's like imagine
if you know like if we were like Apple
TV I was able to be controlled by cereal
or like seriously specifically to be
Apple TV can be controlled by Siri yes
that but imagine it too oh yeah yeah
just like so sorry I misunderstood you
um swinging back around beefy tech is
asking how do we feel about Amazon echo
and their shopping trends is that bad
news for other rivals of Amazon like
eBay it's terrible news for them I would
imagine I mean like I just saw a
statistic today that Amazon in the u.s.
accounts for 40% of online commerce like
EECOM how so I mean like in Walmart and
eBay are the two closest competitors and
they're not even close
so what does this mean is that we're all
shopping if you're an online shopper
you're extremely likely to be shopping
on Amazon and you're probably a Prime
customer so you're shopping on Amazon a
lot what does that mean for competitors
and other sellers I don't think it
really like seems very good like Amazon
is extremely dominant right now and it
would be useful for the market if other
competitors came in and balance a bit
the edge of this these voice assistance
though is that it's helping them like
collect a lot more data like
customers and then they can like tailor
their ads a lot more effectively that
way right right giving Amazon the
opportunity to really continue to pull
ahead yeah so is Walmart going to do a
better job in the future they've
definitely been stepping up their game
as far as e-commerce is concerned I
would probably expect at least from the
tech situation and the device situation
to have Google but generally come in at
least like with the home and with a lot
of their services to at least
counterbalance but this perspective
isn't on you know we want to sell things
it's more like we want the information
to you know for like ad revenue purposes
yeah they make most of their money I
make like 90 plus percent of their money
off of ad sales but you can buy stuff
through your Google home and they
definitely see Amazon as becoming more
of a direct competitor every single day
so yeah it's it's we'll see what happens
with that we've seen Amazon do nothing
over the last decade but climb slowly
but surely and then sometimes quickly
and surely I even if these new endeavors
we're the ultimate horizon like this is
our new tentpole is this the smart home
integration where everybody nobody ever
has to step outside ever again smart
tend to shop yeah smart tent
even if these the the look and the night
look are relative failures that's I
don't think that's going to slow
Amazon's roll at all yeah and they're
they're still ahead right now and yeah
the potential of the Amazon lifepod
Allah the matrix is just around the
corner I think they're actually going to
come out with that product in 2020 where
you just you go into the life pod and
you just live there forever and they'll
send you stuff from Prime hopefully on
the night with a screen it'll make it
easier to actually make phone calls on
the echo because that's still like my
number one like yeah request its its
connect as the internet its voice
commanded like just let me make phone
calls on it it's there I think a lot of
that has to do with the fact that
they're probably not making the deals
that they need to with the telecom
providers and they also need to like do
a better job of connecting to like
Android and iOS and like those two guys
like Apple and Google don't I mean I'm
saying more so
like like I mean with Google home they
have the potential to do like Google
voiceover on that
mmm so not Google voiceover sorry but
like void yeah way voice voice voice
alright yeah yeah okay they said void
void that's their new product what would
that be
what would Google void be I don't know a
black hole being on there yeah being on
the fifteenth page of search like trying
to find that one song that is yeah the
greys anyway is that an urban dictionary
we should put it there I like that idea
a lot all right that's a perfect place
to end for the week thanks everybody
let's uh let's wrap it alright if you
