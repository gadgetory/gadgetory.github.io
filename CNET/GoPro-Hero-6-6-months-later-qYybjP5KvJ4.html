camera I've been using it for the past
September October to January it's like
six seven months ish
this is what I think this is some of the
issues and the good things that I found
about it over that entire period so
we're gonna dive into it and then I want
to know what you think - first up let's
talk about what I really like about this
camera
okay so form factor it hasn't changed
from the hero 5 problem is I still get
them confused because I have a hero 5
and a hero 6 and when I'm trying to find
one in a hurry I have to actually like
open the case find the thing that says
hero 6 that's kind of hot I wish there
was a little bit more visual
differentiation but I just realize
that's probably more of a negative than
the Plus because we're always gonna
start off with the positives ok let's go
back to the positives little tangent
little detour okay sorry form-factor
great yes it works it's easy to use like
if you've ever used to GoPro before
you'll know exactly what you're getting
into image stabilization oh my goodness
okay so for ages I've been wanting GoPro
to put on optical image stabilization
onto the cameras I know that's a big ask
and it hasn't happened and they've kept
saying look the digital stabilization is
just as good's just as good okay until
this camera until the hero 6 it has not
been as good this camera has made me
totally rethink my OS versus a is debate
I really think this is really cinematic
it compensates so well for walking
biking running like absolutely anything
it makes the footage really watchable
and very smooth so I very much
appreciate that and I think that's a
huge plus on this camera so when it
first came out the price was an issue
it was $499 when it launched thank you
so much GoPro you've changed it to 399
dollars that's the price it should have
started at because it's an expensive
investment obviously like five
dollars on a standalone piece of
equipment is a lot especially for an for
an action camera so I think $400 is a
lot more reasonable and a lot more
affordable that being said GoPro just
announced a new action camera called the
hero and it has a lot of the features
from the 5 and the 6 at a much slower
price point as well it's about $200 so
that's great
obviously one of the big problems that a
lot of people have me especially when I
have GoPro footage is that I don't know
what to do with it like my life that I
feel what an action camera is kind of
boring and I think most people look out
of that too because like I'm sorry we're
not all skydiving we're not all going to
like the ski slopes every weekend well I
mean at least I'm not but that being
said all the footage that I do get when
I have it
I don't exactly like know what to do
with it like I have a lot of stuff and
you know I have you know three-minute
clips I don't know exactly at which
point something cool happened and having
to go through and edit all that myself
like in Premiere or Final Cut I just
don't want to do it so the quick app
that actually you can download and use
with the GoPro is a lot better than I
was expecting like over the past few
years it's really kind of developed it's
made it super easy to transfer all the
footage to your phone and then it just
pretty much automatically makes a cool
two to three-minute clip all the
highlights are pulled out automatically
too with AI and that's really cool it
gets it right probably I'd say about 85
to 90 percent of the time it's pulling
out boom the moment where I'm at the zoo
and the giraffe is like looking towards
me or the moment something funny happens
and I fall over you know like those kind
of moments it tends to get right which
is great and doing it together in that
clip means that I don't have to worry
and it's just easy to share and then I
don't even need to look at the footage
ever again like the roof it
so compared to the hero five I also love
that the hero six has image quality that
is a step above so I'm talking about
dynamic range I'm talking about low
light and that is really an improvement
that I notice in particular when I've
been comparing shots from the hero five
and the hero six I can definitely tell
which was shot with which camera and I
think that was worth a big part of the
price of admission alone even the stills
has improved a lot I mean I definitely
not going to take that many stills on
this camera just because I would rather
pull out my phone but if I do have to do
it it's good to know that it can
probably cope with it and the zoom it's
useful it's not something that I'm going
to do a lot of the time just because it
is digital zoom but I definitely find
that it is a lot better than having to
kind of like worry about trying to get
closer to a situation that I physically
can't get closer to I probably won't get
exactly all of the shot that I want but
it's still a good feature to have sorry
all of the good things that I like about
the hero 6 some of the things that bug
me about this particular camera so I'm a
generous person like I lend this to a
bunch of different people they you know
take it on activities rough and tumble
so I got it back from someone who will
remain nameless and I noticed that the
top part of the touchscreen just stopped
responding and that made it almost
impossible to kind of turn off any
features if this happens to you top tip
flip it upside down mix oh yeah the
accelerometer will know that you've
actually flipped it upside down and then
all of the menu options that you need at
the top of the screen will be at the
bottom of the screen and that meant the
bottom of the screen was still working
so I could still select them I would
love to know if you've had a similar
problem I'm not sure if that's just
because this person totally did
something super extreme with it I guess
that's the point of an of an action
camera that you are doing extreme things
with it but I don't know if this is a
particular issue with something the way
that it just landed something like that
so if you've had that problem as well
please let me know I would love to hear
if you have a fix for it or if you have
some kind of idea of what might cause
that kind of damage to it
the other thing is that the battery life
oh my gosh okay seriously when I was
testing this out like at the GoPro
launch event that was the first thing
that I noticed was the battery drained
super super quickly it still is the case
so I was pretty much doing maybe like
two to three hours of filming
intermittently and it wasn't even at 4k
it was at 1080 60 and I noticed that the
battery was just like going off a cliff
so so quickly so you're going to have to
invest in so many extra battery packs or
take something with you that you can
charge with fortunately it's USBC yay
thank you so it's efficient but the
thing is it doesn't last long enough I
wish there was a solution to this I wish
she could make the battery have a
greater capacity so I could do more
filming without needing to change it out
the voice controls while I thought that
they were initially a little bit
gimmicky are very handy and I love the
fact that there are different accents
and different languages that it will
understand however I would say it
probably works maybe about seventy to
seventy-five percent of the time
there is that oakwood time where I'm
standing there I'm saying GoPro take a
photo try try and take a selfie and he
doesn't do it so I have to like bring it
really close shout at it hold it out and
then maybe it would work but come on
like you look stupid having to do that
in front of a bunch of people especially
like if they're not the people that you
were taking a photo with it's just
random people walking by you're
literally shouting at your device this
is not the future so I would love for
that to be a little bit more refined in
the future versions as well and one last
thing I wanted to mention about some of
the GPS and the internal telemetry data
when I'm trying to put that footage on a
computer and I want to overlay all of
those cool like visuals of where I was a
little map you know like elevation speed
all of that sort of stuff sometimes it
works sometimes it doesn't
I'm not entirely sure if this is a
problem with the GPS just not acquiring
a lock and on some clips and then maybe
on others it does or if it's an issue
with the software I haven't really been
able to narrow that one down but I would
love if that was a little bit more
refined as well I just want to be able
to see all of like the cool places that
I've been and overlay that on the
footage if I want to so those are my
thoughts of the GoPro Hero 6 I would
love to hear what you think let me know
in the comments below if you've had
problems concerns issues love it
absolutely want to buy more of them like
let me know you can also find me on
Twitter and thank you for watching okay
cool okay thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
