Bridget Carey on sina com and it's time
to get loaded back in February Apple's
App Store added the subscription payment
option and media companies quickly
adopted it for newspapers and magazines
but now for the first time the app store
features subscription-based games for
699 a month a user can get access to
dozens of game titles from developer big
fish games and the games are streamed to
the app instead of being downloaded
because of that you have to have a Wi-Fi
connection there is a free version to
sample the games but you only get 30
minutes of play time Microsoft's
lobbyists are quietly working to alter
the highly controversial Stop Online
Piracy Act bill currently under debate
in Congress the bill called SOPA for
short aims to give Congress more power
to stop websites that post copyright
infringing material but large web
companies like Google are against it
because it would give Congress broad
power to sense with the web Microsoft
has always been supportive of stopping
online piracy it doesn't want legal
copies of its software out there but
apparently even Microsoft isn't thrilled
with the wording of the SOPA bill
penguin group is the latest book
publisher to stop libraries from lending
digital copies of its books penguins
suspended authorization for libraries to
check out its newest digital books
electronically citing security concerns
the changes only impact new titles
publishers Hachette Book Group McMillan
and Simon &amp;amp; Schuster also don't
participate in digital book lending
through libraries so if you're getting
the e-book reader as a gift this year
hope you're not doing it for the library
lending features it's looking less
likely that the AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile merger
will ever happen the chairman of the
Federal Communications Commission has
requested another hearing for AT&amp;amp;T to
prove why spending thirty nine billion
on t-mobile is in the public interest
that's on top of the US Department of
Justice filing a lawsuit to block the
merger FCC officials said it was
impossible to see how the deal could
serve the public interest if you get a
new smartphone two years from now you
might get through those black friday
shopping lines slightly faster that's
because more than half of the smart
phones in the market will be able to do
mobile payments with NFC technology so
in about two or three years from now
more shoppers will be
upping their phone at the register to
pay those are your headlines for today
I'm Bridget Carey prasina calm and you
just been loaded</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
