a look at one of the big PC gaming
announcements of the show it is the B
FGD what does that stand for big format
gaming display it looks like a big TV
it's not it's actually a big gaming
computer monitor it's a 65 inch 4k
display with a 120 Hertz refresh rate
now you can take a computer and hook it
up to a TV like you have now and play PC
games on it it's a super fun experience
but the TV is not really built for it
can get a lot of latency sometimes you
can get tearing you can get stuttering
the best computer gaming experiences
often use Nvidia g-sync technology
sometimes that's in laptop sometimes
it's in standalone computer displays and
that matches the refresh rate of the
display with the output of what's coming
out of the computer you're playing on
and that gives you a very smooth
experience so this is that but built
into a giant fork a 65 inch display in
HD our display even so whether you're
playing something on a big gaming
computer like we're doing right here
playing destiny to or from some other
source it's gonna match the refresh rate
with the output rate and you're not
going to get that latency and lag and
tearing besides PC gaming you can
actually also use Nvidia shield that's
built right in that's one of our
favorite streaming boxes it's a very
ambitious streaming box because besides
just the normal entertainment and movie
streaming apps it gives you access to
tons of Android apps and Android games
and also lets you very easily stream PC
games if you have a gaming PC set up
somewhere else in the house and you get
a lot of the same no lag no tearing
advantages even if you're not using
computer hooked up directly to it but
when you're streaming from somewhere
else on your network and Nvidia is not
actually going to make and sell these
big displays they're working with
partners HP is one of them as soos is
one of them
Ezra is one of them but they're all
going to be very similar these Bigfork a
65 inch displays that not only have G
sync built-in they've got the Nvidia
shield built-in so that is invidious BFG
d the big format gaming display
