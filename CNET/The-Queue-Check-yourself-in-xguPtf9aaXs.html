free tunes and can robots look too human
find out next in the queue
what's going on hope your day is great
I'm rich too mural with CNN TV and you
are in the queue the only show that
keeps you connected to the digital
lifestyle and now that AOL is moving to
the NYC that's gonna be a whole lot
easier let's get you started with your
must click moment just how scarily life
like can robots get look no further than
Hanson robotics the companies
specializing in human-like robots that
could keep you up at night the robots
walk talk maintain eye contact and
simulate personality all this thanks to
some hardcore artificial intelligence
mechanics and frubber flesh rubber it
seems there really is no end to the
self-service trends and if you think
airport or ATM touchscreens are teeming
with germs
you'll love checking yourself into the
emergency room the bloody touch screens
now making their way into the ER you
enter in your personal info then use a
body diagram to describe what's hurt
broken or bleeding paramedics are
standing by to help in case of a real
emergency like if your insurance card
doesn't swipe correctly many kiosks made
by the same company as those supermarket
self-checkout cash registers and we all
know how easy those are to use even
without a broken bone moving through the
queue years ago I had dreams of cell
phone companies letting you self install
a mini tower at your house or apartment
for spotless reception that's why I'm so
excited about a new technology called
femtocell it's what powers t-mobile's
hotspot at home service and now sprint
giving it a spin through a device they
call air rave it's a little base station
you plug into your high-speed internet
connection giving your abode maximum
reception instantly in range your calls
route through it and over the net you
can use any sprint phone with the
service but with t-mobile you need a
special Wi-Fi phone AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon you
listening Amazon taking a belly flop
into widgets the site with the huge
selection now lets you easily post
dynamic content with a simple snippet of
code you can clue your friends into what
you're watching buying or wishing for
and even earn a referral bonus when
someone makes a purchase
there are slideshow widgets to show off
your favorite stuff a product cloud with
items related to your site's content and
my personal favorite and embeddable wish
list but does anyone actually ever
gotten a gift off on one of these things
finally throw away that peer-to-peer
software why pirate when you can
download music for free spiral frog is
officially
open for business mark the intern has
more Spyro frogs the website offers free
music but can people get past the name
spiral frog I would think it would be
sounds like we need to be able to
download music and listen to whatever we
want
because a lot of people they do it
illegally why don't we just do it
legally sometimes I just leave stop
playing and I really wouldn't like you
know watch advertisement you know just
music I would one download it to my ipod
I tried out the service not bad it takes
a while to download but pretty cool for
free songs that's all folks I'm rich
demure woodsy no TV in New York City
later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
