welcome to Google issues for everything
Google you could think of in yeah you
know what it doesn't look like 2008
anymore on here this is the new show the
new look and it's a big week for the
Google world and this is all about my
reactions to most of the stuff Google
dropped on us at they're made by Google
event
now the googs got things started with a
montage of the past year wait was that
do I think it was hey that's me but why
is it playing over the Verge's website
and look that's Google Isha's well the
old one now okay enough about us and
thanks for the love Google but what was
the highlight of the entire keynote it
had to be the instant translation
between two people with the new Google
pixel buds so while you're up here what
color should I get Midland event has
become festival yeah hmm Jethro dance
Capua scallop us a day all right your
mind wasn't the only one that was below
and after that and it was one of their
you know magical moments now Google's
wireless earbuds are $159 but clearly
white and kind of blue are already kind
of sold out
they include touch gestures and the
Google assistant as well truly one of
the highlights of the show but why would
you even need the pixel buds
the biggest reason taking a page from
Apple there is no 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack on the new pixel 2 and
pixel 2 XL phones but what's even worse
than no headphone jack Google is just
including a USB seat a 3.5 millimeter
headphone adapter that you'll end up
losing but there will be no headphones
in the box
it's BYO H and that's a Boogle
all right Google's new phones are solid
entries and they emphasize that hardware
is getting to the point where it's
almost the same across the industry and
innovation will come from software like
you can squeeze it to prompt the Google
assistant and always on screen with the
ability to hear songs plane was another
cool moment think of it like Shazam on
your phone but all the time and what
about that camera now DxO mark once
again has given the new pixel the best
rating ever in a smartphone camera with
an overall score of 98 beating the
iPhone 8 plus and the Galaxy Note 8
scores of 94 each now even if it's still
a single lens it has portrait mode with
its dual pixel sensor and optical image
stabilization and let's not forget it's
unlimited photo storage but no HDR on
its screen with a camera that shoots HDR
photos in today's competitive market is
a Miss the pixel 2 starts at 649 and the
2 XL starts at 8:49
and you can buy them today they
obviously don't have the sexiest design
on the market like I would never say
that
but once again it brings the best camera
on the market today an innovative
software that shines with this phone on
pure Android alright now let's talk
about my favorite product announcement
alongside the pixel but it has to be the
Google home max yeah the Mini is cute
and it's their $49 answer to the echo
dot but the max is just beast it's
bigger and badder with two woofers and
adjusts to the sound of the room like
the home pod you can rest it on its side
or stand it up or pair two of them
together and it has the power of the
assistant like I told you this thing was
beast and it comes with a heftier 399
price point but this is just flat-out
better than the home pod + Diplo
okay stay cool stay cool bride okay
now Google drops another surprise on us
with the all new pixel book their
convertible laptop with the twelve point
three inch touchscreen that can really
be anything think of it like the Lenovo
yoga form factor with the killer feature
like instant tethering that pairs with
your pixel phone when no Wi-Fi is
available come on that's just sick and
that design that matches the pixel phone
yeah real slick now the Google assistant
is here with the press of a button and
then they drop the pixel book pen on us
circle someone's face or an object and
the assistant pulls up information on it
plus it has an industry best latency of
10 milliseconds the surface pen is that
21 and the Apple pencil is at 20 now the
only thing really holding back this is
the Chrome OS and the lack of all these
high-end apps to take advantage of this
for creatives but starting at $9.99
there's a whole lot of value here as a
daily driver and play more people are
actually going to consider this and you
know what to me that's a win for Google
right there now the biggest bomb for the
goog had to be the Google Clips camera
that took out all the energy and
excitement out of the keynote like it's
a camera that you can place or clip on
things to capture candid moments it's
aimed at families and it costs two
hundred and forty nine bucks like really
dropping to forty nine for that why are
you even going to get this this was
worth an online post and not a feature
spot in the keynote and it was a total
bust oh yeah they showed off a new
daydream in three colors for $99 that
brings improvements in performance but
I'm going to spend as much time as they
did on it on their keynote okay that was
it so what do you think of Google's
event we want to hear from you you're
looking at this company that is evolving
and growing up right before our eyes
after their commitment to controlling
both the hardware and software Allah
Apple they're surprising us with new
features that really no one is doing so
that's it for this week you can email me
at Google is just at cnet.com or tweet
me at Brian Tong thanks much for
watching we'll catch you next time on
