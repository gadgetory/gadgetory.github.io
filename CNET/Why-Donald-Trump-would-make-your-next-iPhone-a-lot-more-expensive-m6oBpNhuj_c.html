another juicy episode of the Apple buy
for everything good a bad inside the
world of Apple and let's get to it and
you know what we start off with the
iPhone and Donald Trump yes you heard me
right so we're not gonna get all
political here but the Donald recently
made a promise that in order to make
America great again he would get Apple
to start manufacturing its products in
the US instead of China now according to
the New York Times a Foxconn employee
gets paid roughly $400 a month now if
you assume Apple could manufacture the
phone in Wyoming or Georgia which have
the lowest minimum wage at $5.15 an hour
that US worker would make more than
double at eight hundred and twenty four
dollars a month so all right after let's
say shipping marketing and research and
development you're talking about an
iPhone that currently costs around $650
will now cost around 1300 at the minimum
and you know what I'm all for jobs here
but the number one way to scare away
voters is to tell them their iPhone is
going to cost them two to three times
more I'm just saying all right we showed
you the iOS 9.3 beta last show but
Apple's iOS 9 point two point one update
dropped this week and it's a must-have
for security updates but even better it
appears to have given older iPhones like
the iPhone 4s and five speed boosts now
this clip comes from a YouTube channel
that ripped off the name of our show and
put an I in front of it but I'll still
give them credit because no one watches
them now Apple is typically ignored
older phones and past iOS updates have
made them slower and lag here but today
is not that day and it's worth the
update if you have an earlier iPhone all
right new music apps have been released
from Apple including a really cool one
called music memos that let you make
quick recordings with instruments or
your voice CNS Dan Ackerman shows us
what it could do
Apple has a brand new app called music
memos and it's sort of a voice recorder
memo app but for musicians so it wants
you to play your guitar player piano
maybe sing-along it's gonna record what
you do in a very simple memo format
after you're done recording it takes
that audio recording and tries to figure
out what chords you played puts down the
bars the tempo that you played and even
lets you add some basic bass and drums
based on the chords and the timing it
gives you a nice little demo package
that you can then either play around
with in this app or export it's got a
tuner built it first so if you want to
tune up you can do that and it seems to
work best if you do big ringing open
chords basic four over four time kind of
like this
I could play it back and follow along
with it if I had the drums and the bass
based on the chords and then I can go in
after I'm done trimming it and I can
edit the actual chords and then when you
want to do something more of the song
you can take it and export it into
GarageBand or logic or just send this
audio file to someone by email post of
YouTube whatever you want it's a free
app for iOS that is music memos by Apple
thanks for that that's some really cool
stuff Dan and also GarageBand gets an
update with new loops tools and a
smarter drummer feature so check them
both out plus I've got to give props to
Apple music that now has over 10 million
subscribers after just six months
according to the Financial Times I
honestly did not expect that see it took
Spotify around 6 years to accomplish
that same goal and yes the times were
different when music streaming was just
starting out but that's just flat-out
impressive so there you go plenty of
great news in the music space but guess
what there's also bad news especially
when Apple announced they would be
ending their ad supported iTunes radio
feature at the end of January
look I use it all the time it's free
think of it as their Pandora like
service and the only way you can use it
now is if you're a pain Apple music
subscriber which I am NOT and their
beats one channel will now be the only
free music option moving forward for
iTunes users are you kidding me Apple
you're sitting on 200 billion dollars
and you're taking away a service we
actually listen to for your beat ones
radio station that people barely listen
to you know what that is everybody
that's a bad apple told you is bad all
right we all know Apple has its eyes set
on the smart automobile MacRumors
recently discovered that Apple
registered a trio of top-level domain
names including Apple car Apple cars and
Apple auto back in December
none of these domains are currently
active now Apple's been very active with
our carplay platform as well and
released a list of over 100 compatible
cars on their own website rumor still
the biggest project tightened car will
be ready sometime around 2020 so we're
still not anywhere close but I always
look at other projects they've done as
points of inspiration for others ladies
and gentlemen this could be the first
Apple car and look there goes that Apple
car again yes I know I battled them
constantly about that battery case but
it's literally that bad you know that
the execs were in a room talking about
how crappy looking of a product they
could make and still convinced Apple
loyalists to buy it they had to be
asking how far can we push them well I
think they found how low that bar goes
and it's the iPhone battery case all
right that's going to do it for this
week's show you can email us at the
Apple bite at cnet.com or tweet me a
Brian Tong and I'll answer them after
I'm done dehydrating my homemade beef
jerky thanks for watching we'll catch
you all next time for another bite of
the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
