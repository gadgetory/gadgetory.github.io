and it's one of the best micro
four-thirds models that I've tested thus
far it's got a more refined design
improved feature set better photo
quality and faster performance it comes
in two kits one with just the body and
another with the big but nice electronic
viewfinder and a very good 17 millimeter
f-18 lens and this camera really needs a
good lens the body is heavier than
before but that accommodates the new
tilting touchscreen display along with
the Wi-Fi antenna Olympus's Wi-Fi
implementation uses a novel approach for
setup with a QR code that you scan with
a fairly basic device app I had some
setup issues with it during testing
though hopefully Olympus will be able to
fix them quickly overall I really liked
the shooting design it's reasonably
customizable with a lever that toggles
extra settings dependent upon your
shooting mode the grips rather shallow
but it has a nice large thumb rest which
makes it comfortable for single-handed
shooting the touchscreen display
operation is a little more limited than
you usually find you only really is it
for camera settings when in auto mode in
more manual modes it generally serves
for touch focus touch shutter scrolling
through images during playback and so on
do find the navigation control annoying
though it's too small and imprecise
which means for example that I'll hit
left when I wanted to hit down and I do
wish the flash could tilt back for
bouncing its autofocus shooting and
image processing we're all quite fast
though it's got some of the usual
pulsing issues with continuous auto
focus during video the addition of
peaking is nice for manual focus except
it doesn't operate in video mode low ISO
sensitivity image quality is very good
as well
with clean JPEGs through about ISO 400
and usable through ISO 800 you might
want to shoot RAW above that because
high sensitivity JPEGs get pretty mushy
videos just ok with the usual edge
artifacts
vp5 is a really nice camera with great
performance and a streamlined design but
for the same money I think some aps-c
interchangeable lens models deliver
better photo quality I'm Laurie grinning
and this is the Olympus PEN</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
