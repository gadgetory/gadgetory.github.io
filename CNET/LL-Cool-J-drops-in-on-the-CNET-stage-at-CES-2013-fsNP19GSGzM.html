the scene at stage at CES 2013
we're excited you know last year we
laughed we cried we made some music and
we even hugged
l knows what I'm talking about you guys
welcome back to the CNET stage live at
CES mr. LL Cool J all right your mics
right there man hi here let's hear it
sup everybody great good stuff so this
is year two at CES yes how are you
feeling the energy here what's that like
know what the energy is amazing the
people have been really nice to me you
know they think they've allowed me
they've given me my geek pass some
people to my inner geek ll kick J foot
today we're having a good time yeah you
know it's a lot of fun yeah now last
year you showed off your boom dizzle
studio yes through a PC hey you're gonna
show us a little something-something
right okay yes so to give everybody some
backstory we boom dizzle my company boom
digital networks we came up with this I
thought of this idea called the my
connect studio which basically allows
let's say a kid in Los Angeles and a kid
in New York or you know a kid in Idaho
and a kid in Montana to go online and
create music in real time so let's say
out there in the crowd there's a you
know a 40 or 50 year old rock star who
happened to become a lawyer but they're
really a rock star deep inside you'll be
able to go on this this application and
collaborate in real time with somebody
else across the country and it's we're
not trying to like replace Pro Tools or
Ableton or anything like that but we're
making those systems collaborative so
you know someone across the country can
load up the beat you can load up you can
sing they can load up a bass line you
can load up the drums and together
you'll be able to collaborate and create
music in real time and for me the reason
I wanted to do it is because I'd be on
tour I'd be you know doing my TV show
but I'd always be in the mood to go in
the studio but didn't have
the ability to really do it so that my
friend would or my engineer producer
would have to email me a track then I'd
do something to the track then I'd email
it back then they email me something
else and not email that back in there
was this whole back and forth thing and
you lose the creative vibe and the
collaborative feel of you know working
together when you're emailing stuff back
and forth so uh we came up with this app
you know in case you didn't know I don't
write code so I got two friends got some
engineers put a team together and said
look this is the vision this is the idea
and this is what I want to do and they
helped me build this thing and I think
it's really cool it's for any kind of
music you know you you know if you you
don't happen to be an authentic hip-hop
fan then you can if you're into country
you want to do your Nashville thing you
want to get to Brad Paisley on you could
do that if you want to you know if your
rocker if you like to wear you know
jeans so tight that they make your calf
muscles burst out I'm going to rain
don't look at my go like that look at my
you can do that whatever kind of music
so it's good for any kind of music but
that's basically technology and this is
called the liquid at yeah so this is the
liquid liquid my studio okay and it's
actually if we leverage Windows 8 so
it's on Windows 8 platform so we we
basically we call it liquid it's like we
took that Windows 8 platform and we just
poured to my connect studio into it and
it's great for touch devices and mobile
yeah now you guys you're gonna be able
to see the app as he's working on it we
have our cameraman back here so don't
worry it's not like you just gonna be
staring on the back of this you know of
the Sony tap actually what I did was I
give up I gave up the controls just like
I do in a real session I have my
engineer in a separate location all
right you can assign control of the app
so in other words if you're the one
who's more of the engineer and your
collaborative relationship you can
control the studio so to speak if the
other person is more the engineer then
they can control the studio you see I'm
saying so you can give up control so for
me my engineer right here Glenn how are
you Glenn smile Glenn I'm doing good
buddy uh-huh
blends into several locations so Glenn
why don't you uh so we can get this
thing rolling why don't you give me a
loop you know you know that funky loop
that I like put put a loop up here just
give me a little loop or something you
know so I can feel the vibe and
get my toes tickled and all that alright
alright play up later Luke okay alright
so now think about it now this happens
to be from a song I did call take it but
this could be something that you created
that's original something that you know
you just came up with you could have
played it did whatever you wanted to do
and you know uploaded it to the boom
fizzle my connect studio as we speak
okay so just really really envision what
I'm saying this could be whatever music
you wanted to be Sinatra you name it all
right okay all right Glenn so now now
you know what and give me some drums and
some drums to that in mind you remember
if you have Pro Tools or if you have
Ableton you can hook those systems up to
this and it can export sounds and it's
integrated with SoundCloud just so you
know I just wanted to be clear about
that it's integrated with SoundCloud so
um Glenn now play it for me
give me the loop and the drums you know
that's funky crispy you know turn it up
a little bit let me feel it
you know like I'm in a studio Oh
yeah look at you you ready to start
singing again yeah I saw your face
alright hi Glenn
so alright so now let me let me do a
vocal let me do a little lead let me let
me let me record a lead on here now if
you you know if you happen to be more of
a Neil Sedaka fan you might want to
cover your ears but this is the hahaha
but this is lvl you know I'm saying and
uh you know it's a this is a good thing
CNET lick with my connects to do you
know I'm saying and um okay it goes
something like this looking at my Roly
it's about that time for me to paint
pictures on the walls in your mind these
MVD masterpieces are hard to find that's
why from six to nine and staying online
I feel like a hundred dog coming from
behind pressure busts pipes relax you'll
be fine
ll got the remedy intervention divine I
gave you the gift for missing me it's
all by design
stop it Glenn stop it stop it stop it
let me do it again let me do it again I
don't like that tape we do it again
remember we in the studio now this is
how it goes you know I mean you know no
it wasn't perfect it wasn't perfect one
more time Glenn one more time you know
you he's processing it right so you
don't like it you can go back you can
erase it you can delete it you can do
what you got to do you see it I'm saying
everybody with me I think that's what
makes you I'm not speaking like a
foreign language over here you hear me
all right okay so um you're loading it
up all right now let's let's do that
again one more time let me get that
again let me get that let me get that
again
now remember this could be the
star-spangled banner this could be
whatever you want it to be it could be
you know my funny Valentine
you know you be David Bowie ac/dc
whatever you love coming ought to be LL
Cool J check it looking at my Rollie
it's about that time for me to paint
pictures on the walls in your mind these
quality masterpieces are hard to find
that's why from six to nine they stand
on line
I feel like an underdog coming from
behind pressure busts pipes relax your
feet wine ll got the remedy intervention
divine I gave you the gift for missing
me is all by design it's a privilege to
be mine I put it all on the line all
night you can come all day you can shop
let the bells jingling let the champagne
five all right that's good I like that
glam come on come on
all right now Glen can you can you play
that back for me can I can I hear that
in a few minutes you know work it out
and then yeah absolutely
oh it's processing right now all right
ten seconds and remember this is all
leverage so Windows 8 so you know and
just so you know we snap Skype in so the
communication is seamless so when you're
on here you just you know you can hits
night night you can hear Skype going
there and invite your friends you don't
have to have a user ID it doesn't drive
you bananas you can have a ball all
right you come home from the rave you're
slightly tipsy you've been dancing with
those funny glow sticks all night you're
going to my connects to do you do your
thing all right your wife thinks you

okay hold on a sec explain do me a favor
stop it for a second
I want you to turn my vocals up a little
bit shocking him a little louder turtle
vocals up so you guys can see here on
the brain EQ it you'll be able to GQ it
add effects do what you need to do
compression or they can sound the way
you want it to sound just so we're clear
you're also now you see how it sounds
you'll be able to place it on the grid
so you think this any delay on anything
you can move it on your leg so that it's
perfect stop it right now flame so any
place that it's on the grid you'll be
able to move it and it'll be perfect so
you know it really works go back to the
top one more time Glenn let me do it

back me in Austin so as you see look
that's basically it it's really simple
it's not that complex it's not like I
have to pretend that is something that's
not very simple two people two different
places record music at the same time and
collaborate if you have Pro Tools if you
have English in if you have another
system that you want to work on you can
use this and collaborate and make it
what you want and their position that's
it everybody clear
well that's it that's the liquid
mechanics studio app that's it there you
go now hello I mean you've been doing
music for a long time right and this is
part of your dream and vision
I mean imagining seeing this type of
device being able to create this stuff I
mean here's something in your past well
you know what the dream was this you
know it's really simple I just wanted to
do something that was really cool and
really helpful I never really had a
record label that's not something that I
did you know we started Def Jam when I
was 16 years old but this is my gift to
the music world and I hope that the
aspiring artists out there can use it in
good health and create some great music
on it you know it's really really cool
you know it really works you know like
anything else
it'll get better with time you know it's
not every part of it isn't perfect yet
and we have a lot of different ideas
that are gonna make it even better as
the seasons come up but I'm telling you
this is the future of music you know the
same way we use social media for
everything else we're gonna collaborate
and that was my dream of doing this I
came up with this idea I didn't you know
no big company came to me and said ll we
want you to put your face on this I know
there's a lot of celebrities running
around
CES you know I recalled it pretending
that they're doing things that they're
not it's ridiculous this is good this is
really mine specifically might you be
I'm not whoever but this is really mine
this is really my you know idea my
vision and uh you know I really hope
that you guys you know give it a chance
and you know write about it talk about
it and try to use it and uh if there's
anything wrong with it please you know
send me comments this sucks that's great
we will pay attention to it because we
only want it to be better and it will
get better any any questions
yeah I'll say questions take a couple
questions I'll take some questions
you can have one right now there's two
connect points in other words there's
two nodes but I mean I can be you know
me and Brian it could be five people
here and five people there it's not yet
we're not quite at the point where it's
three separate you know people on the
app yet but we'll get there yeah the
girls are working towards that we're
definitely working towards that but it's
just two right now two points two setups
any other questions you know what we're
still figuring it out but you can go
online right now and try it for free you
know you can try for free right now you
can go to Bull dizzle dot-com slash
studio and try it out for free and you
know we'll figure out maybe a
subscription basis or something as it
gets a little bit more advanced and as
we perfect the technology and get the
technology in a place where it's just
seamless then you know we'll you know
people will charge a little bit for it
but you know this is for you guys you
know I want them again we all want to do
well and and you know make some change
but this is for the world you know last
one last one
sips it again you know we want to we
know it's possible but right now this
liquid app right now we're just focusing
on Windows 8 you know Windows 8 is you
know fairly new and we just think we
have something really really cool we've
been you know having a lot of fun with
Microsoft and Sony has been very helpful
with what we're doing and we're just
trying to put this thing together and
make it right on Windows 8 and once we
perfected you know and really nail it
all the way down where it's just you
know what I mean seamless then we'll
move on to
platforms as well but definitely yeah
I'm in you yeah hi oh yeah that's the
whole point it's any device that uses
window 8 Windows 8 can use this so it
can be mobile and touchscreen well I
mean yeah if the Wi-Fi is working I mean
let me tell you something I'm a brave
guy I'm doing a demo in here with this
in this area with this Wi-Fi you know
this is crazy but yes you know if you
didn't have 350,000 people on there
blackbird you're on their iPhones and
their different whatever they're
touching their devices yes
you know maybe not Blackbird but you
know what I mean god bless them maybe
not you know but um yeah so yes the
answer is yes you'll be able to do it
anywhere that a mobile device works all
right which is amazing ok guys well you
know what I'll be here a little bit you
said you take a couple pictures of
people take some pictures I'll take all
right but we want to say thank you so
much for Ella back to our stage thank
you so thank you very much you don't
need vocals on that next time I got you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
