simplicity comes with a trade-off even
the best sound bars can't create true
surround sound like a 5.1 speaker system
unless of course your sound bar comes
with rear speakers which is the idea
behind videos latest sound bar
hey I'm Matthew Muscovy ak from see Matt
in the $500 Vizio s 54:51 wc2 is the
company's new 5.1 sound bar which comes
with two rear speakers to create a real
surround sound experience it's a truly
massive system with the sound bar itself
coming in at 54 inches long designed to
match TVs that are 55 inches and larger
it's also a little over 4 inches tall
which could be a problem if it blocks
the remote sensor on your TV that's not
going to be a problem if your wall
mounting but otherwise you're gonna need
to boost up your TV somehow so your
remote signals can reach the wireless
subwoofer is designed to be placed in
the back of the room where you can
connect the two rear speakers using the
included speaker cables it's a smart
design since it eliminates the need to
run speakers from the front of the room
to the back although you're still gonna
have some wires that you need to hide
the included remote is also a cut above
the competition mostly due to the
built-in display that means you get
visual feedback right on the remote
instead of needing to squint across the
room at a display on the sound bar and
the vizio does have a neat display on
the sound bar as well with a series of
white LED lights that light up when you
adjust the volume and make other tweaks
the videos features are pretty great too
with plenty of inputs including two HDMI
ports optical coaxial analog and mini
Jack usually HDMI inputs aren't that big
of a plus on the sound bar because you
can always use your TV as a switcher but
here they actually matter that's because
most TVs dumb down incoming audio
signals to stereo so on this system you
wouldn't get the full surround sound
effect there's also a built-in Bluetooth
so you can wirelessly stream audio from
smartphones and tablets as for sound
quality the vizio jumbo-sized really
makes a difference the ultra wide sound
bar gives you more stereo separation
and the bigger stuff gives you more base
and you don't have to be an audiophile
to appreciate the surround sound of the
rear speakers which make a huge
difference on movies that are heavy with
special effects when we put it
head-to-head with Sony's HTC T 770 there
was no contest in terms of surround
sound ambience on movies and the video
even held up well with music too
the big question with this system is
really just its size the sound bar
itself is too big for most living rooms
and you do lose some of the simplicity
of a sound bar once you start adding
rear speakers and additional wires and
the $500 price is high too especially
when Vizio makes a 42 inch 5.1 sound bar
that's selling for about half the price
but if you have the space and you want
the best performance the Vizio gets you
closer to the cinema experience than any
other sound bar out there without the
full clutter of a home theater in a box
system that's a truly impressive feat
and that's worth the five hundred dollar
price tag I'm Matthew moscovia from CNET
and this is the Vizio s 54-51 W 2 C 2</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
