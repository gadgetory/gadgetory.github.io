the apple pie for all the good bad
inside the world of Apple now as WWDC
2015 gets closer a whole lot of info
about iOS 9 has been revealed thanks to
the team at 9to5 mac now according to
reports Apple is preparing a new iOS 9
feature that will combine siri contacts
calendar passbook and third-party apps
to create their equivalent of google now
for the iOS platform it's codename
proactive but not to be confused with
the skin care products Adam Levine
promotes right the very beginning of
being in the band we would play shows
and I had acting but I can tell you
firsthand the solution is proactive plus
now its goal is to provide timely
information based on what a user is
doing at the time and their data
patterns proactive is expected to be
shown off at WWDC and will be found on
the left side of the home screen where
spotlight used to live in hopes that it
will boost its usage now this sounds
great and I've always been jealous of
google now and google's voice
recognition but Apple is going to have
to take a major leap to best Google's
brand new now on tap feature that takes
Google now to the next level and the
reality here Apple is just plain ketchup
now Apple will finally release transit
directions in iOS 9 after it was pulled
before WWDC last year Apple plans to
debut bus subway and train route
navigation to upgrade the Maps app but
don't get too excited just yet reports
say it will only support a half dozen
cities on launch including New York and
San Francisco in the US Canada will only
get support for Toronto and the first
supported cities in Europe will be
London Paris and Berlin also Apple pay
will be bringing a rewards program to
WWDC according to the New York Times
details are scarce but people familiar
with the service say Apple will be
offering perks to consumers who make
purchases with the service I'm pretty
excited because I could just imagine
using something like Apple pay to buy a
meatball sub at subway and getting an
extra meatball
Hey look an extra meatball then stop and
pay and that sandwich was good alright
9to5 mac reports iOS 9 will also bring a
new app called home which will work with
apple's home kit platform in an attempt
to control the connected home and its
myriad devices on your iPhone iPad and
even Apple watches so we'll see how
Apple's vision of the smart home starts
coming together after its introduction
last year at WWDC now Apple will also be
using its own design San Francisco font
that was developed for the Apple watch
and integrating it into iOS 9 as well as
OS X 10.7 to really give it a fresher
look and feel developers have already
hacked OS 10 Yosemite so you can get a
good feel of how it will look like right
here overall guys and gals don't look
for any major new groundbreaking
features in iOS 9 + OS 10 10 point 11
codename gala the focus here is really
quality and refinement with a lot of
under the hood optimization so think of
it like Snow Leopard back in the day now
the company has even been working on
ways to optimize iOS 9 to run more
efficiently on older iPhones and iPads
so we'll see it all on june the eighth
now shifting gears to the rumored apple
TV ricoh reports apple reportedly wants
to include live local programming in
their apple TV streaming bundle but seen
a reveal at WWDC might not happen Apple
wants to include live local programming
from TV stations to broaden the appeal
especially with people trying to cut the
cord entirely but you know it takes time
to get individual local TV deals sign
now my own sources working on video
shoots with Apple told me while they
were on set they were interacting with
entirely blank screens with iPhones and
iPads and directors told them to swipe
from right to left to get to the live TV
feature they were talking about it like
a feature that didn't exist but they had
to use it for their advertisements or
tutorial videos so get ready it's coming
even if no deals have been signed now in
some Apple watch news apple senior VP of
Operations Jeff Williams reveal that the
code conference that this fall native
watch apps will finally be made possible
so you won't have to wait those annoying
5 to 10 seconds for an apt to load from
the iphone first I know first world
problems now he says Apple will be
releasing a dev kit for native watch
apps at the conference now when asked
about apples car project he said the car
is the ultimate mobile device giving a
little wink wink at the rumors that
Apple is working on a car of its own for
2020 with the code name project titan
and let's just forget about the apple
watch edition we showed you a service
that charges four hundred dollars to
turn your watch the gold well how about
a do-it-yourself home kit for 115
dollars the Midas touch Kickstarter will
allow you to go play your own watch with
24-karat gold there's also a package for
159 that covers the entire watch and a
band it's an electrochemical reaction
that Bond's the gold atoms to the steel
and they can be removed with a polish if
you want it back to its original state
pretty sick all right guys now let's get
to our feedback of the week from last
episode this one comes to us from Carlos
Lopez who says had to fast forward the
beginning because Brian just aint funny
I'm starting to dislike him a lot but
Carlos you still watched the entire rest
of the video and an honorable mention
goes to don angel who said i thought it
was just me that licked my products
alright that's gonna do it for this
week's show you can email me at the
apple byte or tweet me up brian Tong I
know this is longer than expected but
I'm going to throw my Apple watch review
in next week because come on Marilee
anyone has one anyways thanks for
watching it will catch you all next time
for another bite of the hour
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
