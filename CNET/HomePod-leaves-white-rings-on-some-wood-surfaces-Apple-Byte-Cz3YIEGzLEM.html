something's so simple you didn't think
you needed it until today it's a circle
a perfectly circular circle and the
perfect companion for your home pod the
apple Costa what's good Brian Tong here
and welcome to the Apple bite for
everything good and bad inside the world
of Apple hold on to your butt's for this
one Apple fans Apple has confirmed the
home pod can leave white rings on some
wood surfaces what come on guys are you
killing me or what reviews published by
wire cutter and Pocket lint and even
customers online revealed the issue or I
mean maybe they'll call the feature now
Apple reps told pocket-lint it was not
unusual for a speaker with a silicone
base to leave a mild mark when placed on
certain oil or wax based wood finished
surfaces so why'd you make it out of
silicone then you guys had six years and
Apple reps also told wire cutter the
Mars can improve over several days after
the speakers removed from the wood
surface but what if they don't do you
have an answer for that Apple's response
try cleaning the surface with the
manufacturer's suggested oiling method
brough you're asking us to basically go
and refinish our own furniture because
Apple's response can't be you're putting
it on the wrong surface to listen to
music wrong and you know what's coming
that's a bad and thank you for that
hand-drawn bad Apple mr. Alberto V Alta
I'm accepting submissions and come on
Apple biters the Apple coaster coming
soon you know what's gonna happen
alright the whole pod sounds great but
you'll get different opinions from
different people Fast Company decided to
put it to the test by using NT eyes
Excel 2 recording device to capture its
audio data from four different locations
in a room and they found the whole pod
had the best consistency of overall
sound this is backing up apple's claims
of how to adjust depending on where it's
placed in a room and that's nice and all
but you can check out our review where
the home
has great sound its booming bass for its
size but when you compare to other
speakers you know it lacks the subtle
details and vocals and other instruments
and it can also sound muddy at times now
Consumer Reports came out with the same
observations that stirred the pot up
claiming the home pod sounds good but
the Google home accent Sonos one sounded
better but come on don't get wrapped up
in all this
this is totally subjective and data
points aren't gonna tell me what sounds
good guess what my ears are and my ears
aren't the same as your ears and the
music I listen to might sound better on
different speakers compared to the
genres of music you listen to so don't
listen to anyone but yourself unless you
like to do horrible things yeah don't
listen to that person
alright bloomberg reports iOS 12 is on
track to bring new features like single
sets of apps that will work across
iPhone iPads and Macs a new digital
health tool to show parents how much
screen time their children have had and
improved an emojis because come on
that's what we all really care about now
Apple is approaching development
differently focusing more on key
features and deciding to push others to
the following year until they're ready
after you know the mess of iOS 11 Apple
realized their schedules were not being
met and features were being released
with bugs mostly because we were
screaming about it now a design to home
screen for iPhone iPad and carplay and a
revamp Photos app that would suggest
which images to view have been put on
the back burner for now but there is one
thing that Apple can be proud of because
they developed something that they beat
Samsung - and emojis see it's probably
going to end up being my least favorite
word of 2018
especially after Apple completely killed
the viral an emoji karaoke trays by
making a produced commercialized version
for their own TV ads good job guys
a new report from et News claims Samsung
will be revealing their own 3d emoji
characters Allah and emojis and the name
will be revealed at the announcement of
their new Samsung Galaxy S 9 phone on
February the 25th my bet is that they go
with samajis that sounds horrible but
maybe you guys have a better idea
throw them in the comments I will try to
read through them if I can get through
it without crying and a recent change
will affect people trying to get
unlocked iPhones from Verizon the
company
told CNET Verizon devices will be locked
to their network from now on the move
was made to deter bad guys from stealing
their phones to resell them or send them
to be used overseas good guys like us
would buy them so we could get them an
unlocked phone to use on another carrier
and get the iPhone with the better
performing LTE antenna now later in the
spring Verizon will allow you to unlock
them but they have not shared how long
the phones will remain locked all right
let's take a break and check out the
party game that you've got a track and
guess what it's free
