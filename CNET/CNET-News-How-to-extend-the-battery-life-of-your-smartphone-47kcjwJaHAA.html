long time not only to clear but also to
get for example the power companies back
in but there are ways to make sure you
have enough juice in your cell phone to
write out the storm first while the
lights are still on keep your phone and
laptop plugged in your laptop which has
a bigger battery can charge your phone
if you have external battery devices
either solar-powered chargers or ones
that use double A batteries have those
handy then track down all your cables
and chargers one of the reasons is good
to have those cables and adapters handy
is if you need to go to another location
to charge if maybe the power is out and
you're in your home but maybe there's
that power over at starbucks or at
emergency center down the street car
chargers or another way to power up in a
pinch next turn off all the features on
your phone that aren't necessary and
drain the battery that includes the
backlight and if you can't do that turn
your screens brightness down Wi-Fi
Bluetooth vibrate mode and all alerts
and all push notifications facebook can
wait till after the storm text instead
of calling it uses less power but the
best way to preserve battery life may be
the hardest I think really the best
advice is to just not fiddle with your
phone you want to last as long as
possible don't pick it up finally if you
have an old phone lying around you
should still be able to place an
emergency call even if it's not
activated in San Francisco I'm Sumi das
