and I have some news that you may find a
bit distressing spring is here but that
also means summer is right around the
corner problem is you may have gained
some or even a lot of unwanted pounds
this winter not to worry if you can
handle the initial sting of humiliation
a slew of new household gadgets promised
to help you shape up and trim down
hopefully in time for all that hot
weather the 159 why things body scale
was the first Wi-Fi scale device to
build a following not only does it
detect your percentage body fat and
calculate your BMI just like other
products such as the Fitbit Aria it then
automatically uploads that data to your
why things account that lives online
users can also view and track their
weight measurements via a PC or with the
why things iOS and Android mobile apps
the why things body scale itself
certainly has the looks of a premium
bathroom scale flat the device has a
smooth black surface made from glass
there's a white hue model too like the
Fitbit Aria a rectangular backlit LCD
display sits just below the scales
platforms top edge the backside of the
5.1 pound scale is also flat sports a
silver paint job and holds four triple-a
batteries
setting up the white things body scale
does require you to physically connect
it to a PC using a USB cable you only
have to do this once however and the
entire installation process goes pretty
quickly now one huge strength of the
body scale is its ability to link to 44
different health centric apps and online
services including RunKeeper
that said the Y thinks body scale
doesn't offer the Fitbit Arya's level of
online tools to analyze and create
personal fitness goals and tactics for
example you can't track your activity
level against calorie intake and weight
as you can with the Fitbit system the
body scale does support Fitbit accounts
though if you have one other areas where
the Y thing's body scale doesn't quite
measure up to the Fitbit area our build
quality size and ironically weight the
smaller Aria weighs almost a pound
lighter looks better and has
a bottom side that doesn't flex under
pressure the Aria also boasts a
completely wireless setup on top of that
the Aria is $30 cheaper - I'm Brian
Bennett and this has been a first look
at the white things body scale be sure
