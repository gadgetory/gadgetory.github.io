master builder does a legal master
builder is employed by the Lego company
and we design and build huge statues or
sculptures out of Lego to represent the
brand kind of as inspiration for kids to
build so what was the most challenging
part about designing Darth Vader I think
the size size the most challenging part
so so normally when we would design a
model we'd have a full assortment of
different pieces all the way down to 1
by 1 brick or a 1 by 1 plate and so it
can be very tapered well when you're
doing it as they was as an interactive
event now you get a blocky shape and so
trying to get to details in the sculpted
part of Darth Vader and a life-size form
12 feet tall and that makes it a little
challenging so to get a really
good-looking dart but still be able to
have the kids help with the with the
large brains was probably the biggest we
designed them originally in Maya which
is a 3d modeling program and then we
import that 3d image too into a program
called Lego brick builder that changes
that 3d image of Darth Vader all into 1
by 1 bricks these little little ones
right here all into these and then we
take and model it again and there and to
create the one that you see behind us
right here they say the most challenging
mobile you've ever designed most
challenging I think that probably a we
did a car actually a Volvo car Volvo
xc90 haul out of Lego and it had actual
wheels they sent that's the chassis the
car from Sweden what's your favorite
thing about liquor my favorite thing
about Lego is it's uh it's actually
there's a couple things one is this as
you push them down on there
it fits and there's something right with
the world you know what I mean I don't
know I'm probably adding too much work
but if there's something right there's
something good because it fits together
everything in this universe works you
know you put it together it holds
together it works and so there's
something satisfying I don't know what
it is in the brain that that creates
that but when you put it together it
fits it works and so it doesn't matter
what you make and when you push it down
and stud it down as I call that's it's
it's gratifying it's it's a it's a good
feeling it's a feeling of accomplishment
and then the other part of it is is I
enjoy working with my hands I enjoyed
sculpting I'm still able to do that with
a medium and as a fine artist it's very
hard to find a job you know what I mean
where you can create all the time and so
this I can create all the time and I can
build and create different things and
it's never boring I've been doing this
21 years and still love putting these
things together</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
