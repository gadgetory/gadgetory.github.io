well the Apple watch allows you to
communicate in a lot of different ways
on your wrist if you're texting you get
text messages all the time just like you
do on your phone here's how you respond
to them they might pop up as
notifications you can swipe down and see
which ones you've missed or you can open
up a separate messages app that's right
here see your list of messages looks
like an iPhone and you can reply but
there's no keyboard here you're going to
have to dictate press the microphone
button here hi honey
I love you when you're done you hit done
you can click the text and send or you
can actually send the audio message
which comes in handy because the
dictation is not always perfect now if
you want something a little quicker you
can also use a canned preset message the
variety of options it could be something
like okay sure
see you soon if you want something a
little less verbal you can go with emoji
there are apples own strange animated
ones there are ones that are hearts of
right different types of hearts and
there are thumb gestures thumbs up
thumbs down etc and a collection of
standard emoji hundreds of the good
old-fashioned kind so I'm going to pick
one of and confuse my wife you can
actually make phone calls from your
wrist to what are you going to use that
for it maybe it's because your hands are
occupied you're going to be getting
coffee or something and your phones in
your pocket and then your phone starts
ringing you can answer really quickly on
your watch oh hey look someone's calling
me right now it's a wonder who it is
hello oh hey it's Dan Graziano of CNN
that's a coincidence
hey what's going on I'm getting coffee
about 50 feet from you um here actually
pass off so if you want to do a handoff
you actually just do this and then tap
over here and now I can talk to you here
it sounds a little bit better yeah so
that's pretty good she just passed off
the phone call like that all right
I'll see you back at the desk in a
moment yeah now let's say you've got
another friend with an apple watch well
you guys are part of a secret little
communications club called digital touch
you guys can do a few extra fun things
together this I do it you open it up the
friends wheel here which is your closest
friends and if you add somebody on here
that already has an Apple watch you'll
see a third option normally you see call
or message the third one in the middle
is digital touch you press that little
icon you bring up a screen that's going
to basically be your doodle screen and
you can draw with your finger anything
that you can think of that would fit in
that space alternatively if you start
tapping your finger it will send tabs
and finally if you hold down both
fingers together you will eventually
feel a throbbing heartbeat and it's
actually saving your real heartbeat over
to the other person it's pretty intimate
and it finally works well for couples
but maybe there are other uses too we'll
see talking texting phone calls those
are all the things that you can do on
the Apple watch and there are bound to
be more when more apps come out to take
advantage of these features that's how
you can be Dick Tracy on your Apple
watch
