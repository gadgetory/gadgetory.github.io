buy the Google pixel to excel before you
go off and preorder one let's talk about
why you might want to pass for now
before we start this list is based on
what we saw at Google's presentation
things could change after we get our
hands on the two excel at number five no
wireless charging
dagnabbit looking forward to a
relatively wireless future sorry you
won't find that on the new pixel to
Samsung and even Apple let me say that
again
Apple has wireless charging on its a new
phone's charging on pixels is still
handled by USB see Google claims you can
get seven hours of battery life with
only 15 minutes of charge time though
number four there's no headphone jack
last year Google proudly explained that
its phone had a traditional headphone
jack built-in this year welcome to
dongle city if you want to attack your
standard wired headphones to the pixel
make sure it's got the included dongle
attached for this and number three fixed
storage options you can add stores to
the samsung s8 but note a to the LGV 30
and you can do that using a microSD card
hmm they forget the pixel to excel in
this list no no I did not you get two
options of 64 gigabytes or 128 gigabytes
you're not using a microSD card to
expand your storage on any pixel
although you can upload photos and
videos to Google's cloud for free
and number two it sticks to a single
rear camera the pixel to excel is
Google's super phone and will be
compared directly against the Galaxy
Note 8 iphone 8 plus iPhone 10 and the
LGV 30 all of those phones have dual
rear cameras now google claims it can do
portrait effects to separate out the
background from a subject thanks to its
software other phones that use two
cameras for this maybe Google software
really is that good but we'll have to
see and the number one reason not to
pick up a pixel to excel is the
competition this is a big sticking point
Google even said that when it comes to
hard work a lot of phones are pretty
much the same on the inside the pixel to
phones use the same processors as the s8
si plus the note and others Google is
trying to stand out thanks to how its
software interacts with its hard work
like with google lens but Google lands
will eventually head over to other
Android devices the assistant was first
on the original pixel and that spread
out over time
the pixel devices do get the latest
versions of android first which is still
a really big deal but otherwise the
pixel is just one of many Android phones
Google's latest phones don't do
everything that his competitors can but
Google is getting pretty close if you're
looking for reasons to buy the pixel to
excel
check out top five seen at calm high as
actor I'll pretty much argue anything</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
