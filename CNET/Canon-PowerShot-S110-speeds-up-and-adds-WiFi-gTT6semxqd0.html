nice updates over its predecessor the
s100 these include better autofocus
performance wireless connectivity and a
touchscreen it retains the same general
body as the s100 including a nice
control ring but it also does away with
the small indented grip and the
rubberized thumb rest that made that
model a little easier to hold than the s
95 at least this one's got a nice matte
finish that's not so slippery it also
has a touchscreen which you can now use
for operations like touch shutter and
touch focus but adjusting settings is a
more hybrid affair for instance you have
to pull up the shooting options via the
func set button before you can select
them via the screen overall I still like
the interface screen feels very
responsive and overall I still like the
interface but it's clearly not optimized
for touch operation the biggest new
feature on the s1 tends wireless
connectivity you can connect it to
another camera to a phone to a computer
or upload to the web via Wi-Fi access
point I'm not crazy about canons
implementation which requires that you
set up an account with Canon image
gateway in order to upload directly to
Facebook Twitter or YouTube which are
the only services that are currently
supported you're better off connecting
to your phone and saving the images
there then using your phone for those
uploads rather than the camera camera
window application though this model has
a new sensor it's the same resolution as
the s100 and I found the image quality
to be about the same good to excellent
in bright light and ok up to about ISO
800 performance has improved a bit most
notably with regard to autofocus which
is very fast however it's still a little
slow at image processing for someone
who's looking for something a little
better than a point-and-shoot with more
manual features and slightly better
photo quality but still wants the
smallest camera possible the s 110
remains a good choice but it's not
substantially better than its
predecessors so if you can find them for
less the S 100 and s 95 are still good
options as well
I'm Laurie grinning and this is the
canon powershot s110</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
