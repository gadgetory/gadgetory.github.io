has come
amazon has launched in Australia the
site went live on Tuesday morning with
thousands of products on offer over 23
categories including cameras electronics
pcs software and video games amazon's
kindle lineup is also there as well as
its fire TV streaming stick which plugs
straight into your TV for streaming
services like Amazon Prime video and
Netflix anticipation around the local
launch has been mounting for around a
year now the company confirmed it would
be coming down under in April but it was
quietly hiring staff for its Amazon
fresh grocery delivery service from
January there's still no word on Amazon
fresh but we now know Amazon's echos
speakers and Alexa smart assistant will
be coming in early 2018 it's the 13th
market for Amazon and the service is
already massive overseas offering
everything from two-hour delivery to
unlimited music streaming even the
option to order groceries with the press
of a button
Amazon Music Unlimited is coming in
early next year but Aziz will have to
wait for two-hour delivery
Amazon Prime is coming in mid 2018 but
we still don't know how much the
subscription shipping service will cost
or how quick the shipping will be for
now the big cities have it best theirs
next business day delivery to the East
Coast capitals plus a delayed for $10
and 2-day delivery to Perth for everyone
else free shipping is available
Australia wide on orders over $49 though
you'll have to wait a little longer
so is Amazon going to change a world or
is it just another way for you to spend
your hard-earned dough let us know in
