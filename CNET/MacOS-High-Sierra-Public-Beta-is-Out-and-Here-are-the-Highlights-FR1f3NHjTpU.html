sierra doesn't seem like a big change on
the surface but that's because there's a
lot new going on under the hood to lay
the groundwork for future enhancements
but they're also some excellent updates
to the Photos app in Safari browser as
well as tweaks elsewhere to streamline
your experience Safari goes a long way
to improve your browsing thanks to
blocking autoplay videos with sound by
default it also offers intelligent
cookie management to help prevent sites
from following you around the web with
ads photos has a newer interface with
more ways to filter your content but
Apple basically overhauled the editor
it's now much easier to get to the
advanced tools and you can turn
adjustments on or off with a click to
experiment but really my favorite tiny
addition is support for tables in notes
both to create them and to paste them in
with high sierra Apple expands iCloud's
role as the hub of your Apple world it
rolls out its new iCloud file sharing
for working on documents collaboratively
sharing links instead of files syncing
shared files and controlling shared
access the public beta is free to
download today but I did hit some bugs
while testing so as with most Vedas I
recommend that you not install it on a
system that you really need to work
properly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
