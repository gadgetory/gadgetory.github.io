family movie night is a great way to
capture some of that movie magic but if
you ever tried to project onto a
bedsheet or a blank wall you know that
the image quality can be pretty awful
but spending the cash for a high-end
projection screen doesn't always make
sense I'm Donald Bell and in today's
how-to I'm going to show you how to
build your own gigantic projection
screen for just $100 now if you check
the home theater forms you're gonna find
dozens of very strong opinions on the
best materials to use for your DIY
projection screen some people use
blackout cloth some people use
reflective paint some people swear by
white vinyl but what I use for my
experiment was white spandex white
pearlized spandex is a projection
material that gets used a lot in
theatrical productions it's relatively
affordable its reflective enough to
catch the projection light and because
it's stretchy you can really dream big
when it comes to your projection size
the only problem is that it can be
difficult to track down the good stuff I
got this from a company called Rose
brand that specializes in fee at Racal
fabrics this is their Tendo style fabric
comes in a 10-foot width and I got two
yards of it for about $50 now it's the
most expensive part of this whole
equation but it's also the most critical
so i'm idea was instead of hanging this
up and putting holes in my wall i could
create a frame and pull the spandex over
the frame and for that i use PVC pipe
it took some planning and some trial and
error but $45 worth of 3/4 inch PVC
pipes and joints gave me a fairly solid
self standing 10 foot wide framework for
my screen you can find photos and a bill
of materials over on my full post at how
to see Netcom
so for the next step I had tried to
figure out how to stretch the spandex
over the frame my first idea was to use
bedsheet clips on the corners but the
end result got the screen all bunched up
it looked pretty ugly
so my bright idea was to actually fold
the spandex in half and create a pocket
by sealing the edges and then pulling
that over the frame only problem is I
don't know how to sew and I was about to
get started on $50 worth of spandex so
instead I use this this is fabric
adhesive tape also called stitch which
with this and an iron about 20 minutes
on the floor I was able to get a
reasonable stitch on this and seal up
both edges like a giant envelope now the
stitch doesn't have to be perfect it's
all gonna get stretched out anyways and
if you turn it inside out like a t-shirt
it actually looks pretty decent looks
better than you'd think so the final
step is to pull the spandex over the
frame but before we do that I just want
to point out one thing here on the
design that I learned the hard way when
I first made this there was a bar going
right down the middle but because was
flush against the fabric and the fabric
had a little transparency to it
it caused a shadow on the screen right
in the middle and it was a total
deal-breaker so to fix that I moved this
middle support bar back away from the
screen so that you're no longer you
getting that shadow it takes a little
extra tinkering and a few extra pieces
but it's totally worth it
now if you're trying to do this by
yourself I would recommend tackling one
corner at a time going back and forth
you can try to pull the fabric tight to
take out any of the creases or wrinkles
that might be in the fabric and then
tighten things up in the back by pulling
it over that hump in the back there and
then pulling it down tight and then
you're gonna have a pretty good looking
screen hopefully and just realize that
once the lights go out you're not going
to see a lot of the the wrinkles and
creases you'll see in the light of day
so there you go this is the final result
a 10 foot wide screen that you can take
anywhere all for just 100 bucks and the
best part is you can break it down and
store it in your closet it doesn't have
to hang out in your house all the time
it may not be cinema file quality but
I'm pretty proud of it
we're how to's like this you can head
over to how to cnet.com and for more on
projectors like this epson 50:20 ub you
go to cnn.com slash projectors I'm Donna
bell for C net go out there and make
something cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
