awesome stuff that's gonna happen at
Comic Con 2015 my knee that wasn't my
knee it's tomorrow daily yeah love you
talk about I was just like let's get
this thing so you do so we're good this
is our official comic-con preview
episode 4 2015 so those of you that
don't know comic-con is a huge
convention that happens in San Diego
we're talking about san diego comic-con
of course there's new york comic con but
this is this is considered the big show
or a lot of movie properties and comic
books and television I'll show off their
stuff so that's we're going to talk
about so let's get start with those
headlines I should just really briefly
mention for anybody who is listening the
show for the first time I'm Ashley
scatter this is cale anonymous and this
is tomorrow daily okay who tuned in to
just this once and man some people
really like comic-con probably better
they like this show and it might be like
hey look a preview episode i'm gonna
click on it and then they're gonna be
like who are these who are these clowns
yeah this is me this is my first and
last episode watching this show exact
okay so uh so how are we doing this
because okay it's coming up at comic-con
is coming up this week um officially
tomorrow this is Tuesday it's preview
night as Wednesday then we're gonna
start getting news Thursday Friday and
Saturday and then that'll be it so
they'll be news from pretty much all of
your properties except for Marvel and
stuff like that so how are we tackling I
so let's do it by let's just group up a
couple of the days obviously Saturday's
its own kind of big thing but sunday is
kind of small and then Friday's its own
big day and then Wednesday Thursday so
let's start with Wednesday and Thursday
let's let's get into this so we have
preview night which I have found to be
really interesting and I like i have
found TV shows they show a lot of what
pilots and things like that people can
go in and like sit and watch and stuff
on preview night kind of fun but really
the important stuff is happening on
thursday starts on thursday kicks off
Doctor Who panel which is going to be a
really big panel this is the year where
we will see a new companion more than
likely might get a new companion could
be it could be a guy
don't know this is the read-through of
this coming series with Peter Capaldi
and Jenna Coleman and also a guest star
this this season you can see right there
she's very small Maisie Williams who
plays Arya Stark on Game of Thrones will
be a guest star on Doctor Who oh oh do
you know that would be fun this coming
season and add which is pretty awesome
and they look like they're having a
great time they're talking about the
read for through and everything on BBC
america so I'm sure they'll have a great
panel that'll that will be happening on
thursday CBS are our parent company will
be showing off a few of their summer
shows and hopefully i'm hoping for a
Supergirl like I would love to see more
Super girls if we they can maybe taco
it's a CBS TV panel so it's all a little
bit of everything so I'm actually hoping
that we get to see some super girl
action may be a little bit more because
i think a lot of people really
conflicted about the trailer but then
when the show actually leaked the pilot
people seem to be really into it they
said it was a lot better than what the
trailer had sort of indicated it would
be yeah so we're pretty judgmental about
trailers but Harry and then lastly just
as for anyone who's a fan of the Hunger
Games Hunger Games Mockingjay part 2 is
going to have a panel on Thursday and
that'll be the very last one to Hunger
Games house because they've got their
very very final I like I want to say
it's a trilogy is a trilogy with the
third movie broken into two parts a quad
really dumb quadrilogy I hate that we do
that with movies now I'm just gonna call
it a trilogy Franz Empress's last half
of the last movie Mockingjay coming out
this year so they'll have a panel on
Thursday as well ok so let's talk about
friday because Star Wars is Lucas film
has there that this is literally this is
the big panel that I think most of you
this and Saturday Warner Brothers huge
two huge panels so Lucasfilm has their
panel right up front people are like
let's get more star wars but now we're
hearing no trailer no clips from star
wars force awakens it looks like they're
probably saving that for their d23
conferences got him lame super lame so
what do you think they're gonna show
they did say they have like some special
surprise like some spectacular thing
that they're gonna be showing on friday
or that they're gonna be announcing
they're gonna do they're gonna do i know
we said none of this
sort of thing but they're going to show
some sort of different version of it or
like Oh check it out there's an app
where you can watch the trailer yourself
like they don't have to show it but they
can announce that you can see it now I
like that yeah they're gonna they're
gonna pull something is no way they're
gonna walk away from this and not wanna
go because right now Warner Brothers is
the only one that everyone's like a game
in town that's the one to go see mm-hmm
um do you think though that they're
gonna hold off on video until d23 next
month cuz that's like the disney
conference that's like the big to do for
disney and they want people to buy
tickets that oh yeah do you think
they'll kind of like kind of hold their
hand a little bit like maybe just give a
taste yeah give a taste and then and
then say well if you want to know more
you yeah but thinking about if they that
were like a nap if they announced a nap
I would like you to your access to
certain things even at d23 like I know
that's the most boring theory that
someone could come up with that they're
gonna announce an app but I don't think
you're gonna find a workaround of all
their quotes that they have here well JJ
Abrams is really good at that like kind
of saying one thing but then saying like
what didn't really say this i kind of
said this like so I I think you might be
on the right track there i also i also
want to put a little bit of money down
on I i would bet that we're gonna hear
more about who's replacing josh trank to
direct one of the spin-off films because
he stepped down and then also we might
be hearing more about Road one so I
think we're gonna maybe learn who the
cast is a rogue one or something like
that because then we'll get some maybe
get some castanets pretty good that'd be
exciting that would be cool also on on
Friday Game of Thrones panel gonna be
ginormous just these are the hugest
panels that you possibly I mean these
are 6,000 seat 16 thousand seats yeah in
Hall H 6,000 people it's so many people
too many people how they even I still
don't understand how they even have
these panels since everyone's just gonna
ask questions about what happened next
season or what happened to a certain
character and they can't answer that but
it should be an interesting panel if
anything slips because the show is
caught up with the books Tracy kind of
how see if we start getting hints about
where both of them are going now so yeah
it should be interesting there's always
something that slips by so now HBO is
gonna be fending off not only fans of
the show
want to know what happens next you
haven't read the books but the people
who've read the books now we're like
please hopefully slip up and tell me
what happens in the books next so I'm
sorry HBO you guys are in for a tough
fight and then lastly Walking Dead
Season 6 this is gonna be to see in six
panel this is some behind-the-scenes
stuff so you can see everybody kind of
walking around then add michael cudlitz
abraham also known as one of the varsity
players in Mighty Ducks three go back
and watch it I swear it's true I'm just
gonna ruin my life it is gonna ruin your
life it gives a little tour a backstage
pretty cool like I love this little clip
you go to AMC's youtube channel they
uploaded this a little while ago and
it's it's really fun it's actually
really interesting and cool i like
watching them like filming and behind
the scenes and stuff so that'll be
happening as well that's another show
where it's kind of the book has kind of
blaze the pathway so and there's many
different stories where they could go
next and a lot of people are saying like
one place there's a character I would
love to have them introduce so it should
be interesting because that's that could
be one where they're like we have a new
person add to the cast and there's like
oh my god this perception when the show
is going so I am very interesting and
the show's been getting steadily better
so yeah I think it's really good and I
do like that um there kirkman has now
kind of been like taking the same tack
as george RR martin where he's like the
show and the comics are just different
things now like they exist and they're
both equally great but they're this is
like a separate thing so in it it's good
but it's just it's not gonna things are
gonna be different I'm and don't forget
that they also have now are going to
have fear The Walking Dead which is a
spinoff from the walking dead it's gonna
take place in Los Angeles which also
seems exciting we haven't seen anything
we've seen like a few seconds of people
running but no zombies no character
development maybe one line of dialogue
so they're probably show a scene or
maybe they'll give us the intro or maybe
it'll show the like I might even show it
was the first episode yeah we know there
could be a lot that comes out of the
walking dead I know that they're going
huge this year yeah they've got my
chance three parties like they're going
big they're collaborating with like a
couple of other like e.w or something
like that absolutely it's a lot of
stuffs yeah okay so now let's talk about
saturday with ends sunday so mostly
saturday no saturday is gonna be a
really big day at the conference um
that's that's saying
lately this is this is Warner Brothers
day like I mean literally I mean there's
some other heavy hitters that we'll talk
about a second but Warner Brothers I
mean we've got how many movies kind of
Aquaman Suicide Squad Justice League
Batman V Superman dawn of justice I mean
they have so much content that they
could talk about what do you think
they're gonna talk about kill every
single one of those things you think all
i think i'm going to talk about every
single one of those things they don't
have any way of getting this information
out otherwise like Marvel does Marvel
has their own they've thrown their own
panels they you know they have they have
like they just have disney in general
right they have engine and warner
brothers in DC don't really have
anything they're definitely going to use
the fact that nobody has any buzz going
to make this convention DC con and
honestly they've been kind of dwarfed a
lot and gone big is really gonna keep
the eye on them for the rest of the year
so i think they'll show every single one
of those things uh I hope they have the
cast Suicide Squad I really want to hear
your Harley Quinn's voice like that they
just give everyone a little bit more
taste but the problem is that we've seen
a lot of the leaks of the Suicide Squad
thing I don't see any actual suicide
squad I think they need to like fix that
Elena get out in front of that kind of
behind-the-scenes kind of shaky cam
footage and be like okay here's but
here's what it's really gonna be like
and blow us away anything goes with that
though so I mean they should bring
everything and they're smart they'll
just bring everything yeah and everyone
just bring them all spring everybody and
then there's also the 20th century fox
panel which is going to include Xmen
apocalypse we're going to learn more
about that movie that's coming I finally
finally just saw x-men days of future
past always like two days ago I loved it
yeah it's good I thought it was really
really good it was a really interesting
way to sort of reboot the characters
without rebooting the characters and I'm
really looking forward to what they do
in Apocalypse like I mean this it was so
great I straight end of an era this one
may be able to lose some cast members
after the end of this and I don't mean
they're gonna die but like Jennifer
Lawrence said she's not coming back josh
is gonna be the huge Ackman is he's
finished with he's like I've been
playing Wolverine for 17 years I didn't
even think about that until he'd said it
an interview and my
my god he has been playing Wolverine for
almost 20 years that's crazy um but yeah
so Xmen apocalypse and then also
fantastic for they have that coming out
the Fantastic Four show a little more of
the movie get people jacked up about
it's coming in a month and then also
what we're really hoping for is some
Deadpool which wrapped up production
last night Marvel but yes but isn't it
isn't it isn't 20th Century Fox like
producing this or distributing oh yeah
maybe I have a Deadpool movie I guess
I'm not in tune with that so probably
yeah i think it's i think it's funny
century but they're cool so they're like
I'm hoping that that'll be a big focus
like I would love for them and focus on
that because I think a lot of people are
super excited cluding you I don't think
they need to show us anything okay I
honestly think that if anything they
should give maybe a one-minute clip and
it should have an shouldn't even
necessarily be from the movie because
yeah we the people that are hyped about
Deadpool are hyped about Deadpool you
don't really need all right all the
pictures that have come out have been
enough to high people up like we don't
need a trailer yet just get it finished
get the trailer out when you can I put
Ryan Reynolds up there to call
everyone's like if you have any fears I
don't really think we need to like
expose too much of it there people have
already read the script apparently and
they said it was great solo we're good
just show us something but it doesn't
have to necessarily can be new maybe
like that uh maybe like the teaser that
was sort of the kind of impetuous to do
this like the the thing that kicked off
the the snowball off the hill you know
like that little animated bit where he
was sitting on the bridge and he was
drying I think something's self self
referential towards the actual con
itself would be really funny because I
like that Deadpool is all about breaking
the fourth wall so if he breaks the
fourth wall of actually being on a panel
that be a great something like that
something that makes that makes you
think oh my god we never know what to
expect to come out in the costume and
like have Reyn Reynolds just do the
entire panel as Deadpool that would be
amazing to put it past them on that
would be glorious and then lastly
legendary legendary pictures has a
couple movies coming out in the next
like eight or nine months crimson peak
they'll be bringing crimson peak which
oh yeah right awesome finally I I mean I
love giro del Toro so this is like right
up my alley cuz this gothic horror like
it just looks amazing and I have to see
it and then also not only crimson peak
they're also going to do a warcraft
panel which this might be the first time
I'm see footage we see some footage I
mean we saw some at blizzcon but they
never released it um they didn't release
like what I saw and what I saw was
mind-blowing like I mean I just couldn't
believe what I was seeing on the screen
in terms of the rendering I think about
Blizzard cinematics already like how
good they are and how much people enjoy
them and just like time to buy a
thousand I mean it was unbelievable the
expressions on their faces and the eyes
and it was the orcs are amazing yeah I
think we'll get a trailer I think why
should I get a full trailer full trailer
because uh because yeah it's coming out
at the end of the year and we have in
the head not so much now tomorrow'll be
partial next year they push it back like
six months ago six months ago you don't
want a movie to come out March well
that's from my birthday and also I think
I'll get a trailer yeah I think we'll
get a trailer and I think it like a
teaser trailer or something like that no
like a foot we want yeah they're gonna
want to push something out so yeah I
think we'll get some time it's time to
wit that we see some warcraft so yeah
there's there's all that going on that's
that's comic-con I mean really those are
the big panels of course there's gonna
be other stuff happening kale is going
to be doing some doing some fine work
I'm sure yeah a lot of interviews with
the folks at Yahoo I'm so follow kale on
twitter at kill anonymous to check out
what he's a big announcements but behind
things like agents of shield which is
going to be moving over to like being a
superhero show their hateful eight is
gonna be there so yeah I see something
from that just so much but no sony no
paramount no marble this year no
certainly no paramount television is
really ruling this year since that seems
to be where at what everybody's offering
so all that DC television shows are
going to have something to show so if
you're in if you're in any of that TV
nerd stuff it's gonna be a huge year for
you that's me that's me and i'll be
hosting a panel on friday i'll only be
there one day kale gets to go all days
but i only get to go one day which
brings us to our hashtag of the deck TD
sdcc 15 san diego comic-con 15 like I've
got a bet you I can guess what the
question is what are you excited about
it do you like ham sandwiches or do you
prefer turkey sandwiches mmm um no yeah
I probably Turkey yeah courage good job
that
it is exactly what kale said what are
you most excited about what what do you
want to hear from your favorite panel
from your favorite studio what what's
the haps for you what's what are you
looking forward to let us know and we're
going to take a quick break we're gonna
be right back with new releases we have
some of your robot wedding gift ideas Oh
God and and then of course we have our
phone talker for the day so don't click
away it's tomorrow daily
welcome back to the show we've returned
it's a tuesday are you calling your
agent uh yeah no it's jennifer lawrence
oh yeah she always calls cal during show
tapings room 463 so gross uh oh I'm not
a lot okay don't call back is what she
said oh well uh you want do you want to
maybe just get your mind off that and
talk about new releases yes okay so
Jennifer Lawrence might have rejected
you but I will tell you somebody who
won't your very favorite Ryan Reynolds
Deadpool what about he's got a movie
coming out this week um but first wait
really quickly minions is coming out
this this friday from despicable me they
get their own movie they get their own
movie i'm excited about this it looks
really cute like I i mean i love the
minions who doesn't the arclight here in
LA got turned into like the minion a
giant minion i don't know if you saw
that oh they put a huge rap over the
arclight theater which is a big dome and
it's like it's a minion it's insane it
looks amazing but yeah I love this
trailer where they're like trying to
like help all of these bad guys and end
up either killing them or otherwise
disposing of them in different ways
which is really funny but yeah so they
go to the they go to villain-con that's
their big thing I go to fill in con and
they meet Sandra Bullock's character who
is it who's a big-time villain scarlet
overkill and she takes them in and it
looks super entertaining in hilarious so
I i would say maybe that's one of the
movies you want to go see this weekend
if you're going to go see something and
then your good friend the the bromance
of your life ryan reynold around you and
and then ben kingsley star in selfless
which is coming out this weekend which
is an interesting premise it's ben
kingsley's this rich old guy he doesn't
want to die and he ends up using Ryan
Reynolds's body to like interject his
consciousness into inject his
consciousness into Ryan Reynolds body
and so he goes and then it turns out
that apparently like I guess they
murdered Ryan Reynolds to like put him
in or not murdered him but somehow took
him out of the equation
him alive to like use for this
experiment or whatever this company and
he starts Ben Kingsley gets the
procedure done and then starts seeing
visions of Ryan Reynolds life and so he
goes and seeks out Ryan realms family is
like a wife and a kid and all this stuff
and it just looks really intense yeah
that's a really crazy summer release
yeah this seems like an October movie
yeah it seems like a little bit more
like a thoughtful month yeah like no
fall all right it definitely it looks
interesting it looks like it looks like
yeah you're gonna have to like really
pay attention and I feel like it's gonna
be no terminator it's applicant could be
good or it's gonna be like really not
make any sense like I feel like there's
not really gonna be an in-between where
it's like well it was alright like it's
like you're gonna go wow that was
actually better than I thought it would
be or you're gonna be like wow that was
worse I thought it would be so fingers
crossed it's better than you thought it
would be but that's coming out this
weekend as well that's it that's it for
new releases really slow month for video
games because we've all just like died
of exhaustion from e3 so they're just
there's smaller games coming out you can
always wander around the internet and
find out what's happening but some but
yeah so we're you're still playing
Batman like Logan right oh yeah yes in
fact he produced Logan is playing Batman
right now he's not even he's he's mapped
the buttons on the pull on his
controller verse ps4 to actually do the
show with the TriCaster and play Batman
at the same time was so impressive so I
civ yeah that's living the dream okay so
new releases we're done we're gonna get
really quickly to just a couple of user
feedbacks we know we went a little long
on our Comic Con coverage but we're just
excited about the show so let's talk

multitasking consider consider her
feelings and mine at the same time same
time not just one at a time that would
be amazing um Jason wrote in and said
oil and access to the beta of Skynet not
