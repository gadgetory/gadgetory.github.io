a first look at the brand new Google
Photos app now this app from Google kind
of takes a lot of the functionality that
you might be familiar with from Google
pluses photo integration but it pulls it
out separately into a nice standalone
way you can access on either Mac or PC
on the web Android or iOS which is
actually available now if you want to
play around with it now what Google
Photos tries to do is integrate all of
your photos and videos from everywhere
in your life with unlimited photo and
video storage 1080p video is the maximum
can deal with and 16 megapixel images as
well on the photo side but it tries to
gather everything in one place and then
automatically categorize things by
people places and things without you
needing to do anything via machine
learning now this is kind of where it
gets a bit fun if you want to use the
search bar within Google photos you can
go in either tap the blue button on the
app or go into the search bar on web and
then type in something like beach or
food and then automatically once your
photos have been put onto the service
Google will find all of those images
automatically tagged so I'm a big food
photographer and it pretty much found
everything that I'd ever taken on my
mobile and all the cameras that I've
used over the years in Google Photos
with all the photos there it's found
everything kind of creepy I didn't even
tagged anything with food it just knows
now on mobile you get lots of different
gestures to navigate between your photos
like pinching in and out to go between
all of the years months and days and you
can also just tap and hold to select a
whole bunch of photos and drag down then
you can share them really easily either
on Twitter Facebook wherever you want to
put them or you can grab a standalone
link and with that link you can send it
to friends and family they view it on
google photos and then if you want to
revoke access at a later date you can do
that as well so that's a quick first
look at all of the features on Google
Photos if you want to find out more you
