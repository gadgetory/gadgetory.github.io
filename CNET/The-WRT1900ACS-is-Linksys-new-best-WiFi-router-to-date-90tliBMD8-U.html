WR T 1900 a CE s Wi-Fi router phone
Linksys now this one is not to be
confused with this WR t 1980 it came out
last year even though the two are very
easy to be confused with one another
they have basically the same same color
same design same amount of antenna same
Airport on the back but if you look
closely though they actually do have
some difference like this one here the O
one has the fan on the inside and the
new one here no more fans that means as
one less thing to break and there's no
noise and don't worry in my testing you
still stay quite cool on the inside
there are even more differences and they
are huge this new one here is the first
I've seen that run on a very powerful
dual-core 1.6 big heard processors
compared to the 1.2 gigahertz one here
it also has 512 made by a video system
memory twice that of the O one here now
the new ACS router here still remains a
three stream or 3x3 8:02 point you have
an AC router but thanks to the more
powerful Hardware in my testing it was
clearly faster than the OAC right here
in fact it was one of the fastest on the
market it has the top sustain Wi-Fi
speed of up to 550 megabit per second
that is really good now working with an
external hard drive as a network storage
server is also very fast via a gigabit
connection in average almost hundred
megabyte per second that is faster than
many dedicated Ness servers so you know
this new wrt 1930s here is a total great
upgrade to this
OWR t99 a seer outer here and completely
what is new price of $230 now remember
this one here is a true dual band router
and that means it will support all
existing Wi-Fi client form on this one
here check out my full review se Netcom
basically this new router replace the
old one over there as the best Wi-Fi
router phone Lynx's to date it
is so good that it would be happy to
have one right now neither I think I
want to and take a look I do have two
and that's because I'm don't know and I
always have what I want and you on the
other hand alway want what I have and
this has been the first look at the wrt
1900 a CS router for Lynx's</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
