you've ever played this is the
PlayStation aim controller a new motion
controller from Sony for the PlayStation
VR headset coming out this October it is
radically different than any controller
we've seen before from the company
although they had a previous controller
called the sharp shooter which put a
PlayStation Move controller at a motion
controller together so you can get a
limited range of motion in virtual
reality
this here is designed to give you
pinpoint precision in games it has a lot
of the features you've come to expect
for PlayStation including Ant dual
analog sticks front of back d-pad so you
can navigate around in games and the
triggers fronted back so you can play
also there is an ambidextrous reload
button on either side our one button on
either side of the controller so you can
quickly stick new shells in your shotgun
and things like that regardless of
whether you're using your right index
finger or your left index finger to make
it happen one thing you won't find on
this controller is a touchpad
the button up top here replicates the
function of the DualShock for touchpad
when you're pressing down but there's no
ability to swipe across it this is
designed more for aiming guns and bows
in virtual reality I just tried it with
an assault rifle and a shotgun in a game
called Farpoint that's going to be
coming out with this controller probably
sometime after the PlayStation VR launch
we don't know when yet we don't know
quite how much it'll cost yet but it
feels extremely accurate compared to any
other light gun game I've ever played as
soon as I put the headset on my head
brought it down the face mask over the
front of the controller it turned into a
virtual gun and it aimed exactly where I
thought it would aim in addition to the
controller itself feeling like a gun it
also helps cement you a little bit in
the virtual world when you've got a
headset on typically the CVR system can
only track your head but with the aim as
well as the head tracking it can kind of
tell where your arms are where your
wrists are in virtual reality and as you
turn your body you could feel more like
you're there
that's the PlayStation aim controller
don't know when it's coming and don't
know what it cost quite yet but it will
be for the PlayStation VR virtual
reality has
