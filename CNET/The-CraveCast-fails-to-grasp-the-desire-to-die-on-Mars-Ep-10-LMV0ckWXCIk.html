eric mack and i'm joined today as usual
by stephen Beecham kelsey Adams Bonnie
Burton Jeff Sparkman in the cnet studios
in San Francisco and also via the magic
of skype which we hoped continues to
work as well as ever right now but from
Australia it's michelle starr and her
tad oh okay Holly hey so once again
we've got some live viewers if you want
to join in on the conversation here you
can tweet at me at Eric CMAC or at krave
at crave and we've also got the live
chat rooms going on our YouTube and our
livestream pages and there's some folks
in there right now so jump in on the
discussion we're going to be talking
about a space today once again I should
also mention I'm live from Taos New
Mexico and the offices of the
award-winning taos news my hometown
newspaper and one-time employer and
because today we're going to be talking
about space on the crave cast let's
start with this image from the taos news
com this is actually a shot of the great
Orion Nebula captured by an amateur
astronomer right here in northern New
Mexico named Gary's antara hopefully I'm
getting that right using his telescope
on a hilltop and the beautiful son g'day
de cristo mountains not far from here
you know so personally I love seeing
images like this that were literally
captured by the retired teacher down the
road and then imagining what else is out
there what else we might discover with
the far greater you know scientific and
technical resources we have available to
us today on this planet so on this crave
cast we're going to talk about where
we're going next in space we'll also
revisit the moon including the things we
found in Neil Armstrong's closet and
because we've got so many Star Wars and
sci-fi aficionados on our panel here
will also leave some time to talk about
the great characters and alternate
universes that our obsession with space
as inspired but first let's address the
question that Mars one has been asking
humanity who wants to die on Mars no not
right oh wait a bit that feels like it's
a multiple choice
can I send people i can send people i
don't want to live anymore tomorrow's
right yeah it could be like a reality
show the loser goes to Mars okay
competing right people are applying and
competing yes yes a Mars one who's
actually doing this there are nonprofit
based are the Netherlands and they're
planning to build a permanent base on
the red planet and their financing the
whole thing through this weird mix of
donations crowdfunding and by holding a
bizarre reality show style competition
to select their astronauts who will then
make a one-way trip to mars sometime in
the 2020s you're not coming home there
is no returning from Mars with Mars one
the pool of applicants started at over
200,000 and this month was whittled down
to just a hundred finalists okay so
another way I figure there's two
questions we need to address here number
one will this actually happen and I can
answer that one right away no it won't
but most interesting who are these two
hundred thousand people who want to go
Diane mom you know it would be such a
great reality show though as if they
made them believe that they really are
going to Mars and name of you may put
them in like some sort of like
simulation that they've actually gone
into a spaceship and then they're going
and then make them land on some sound
stage and make it look like Mars and
then film that and just see how they
like like freak out and think it's the
real deal because there's a lot of
reality shows that let's be honest
reality is really is the farthest thing
from the show great so I kind of feel
like that's not true I or not the real
world's not about the real world but um
yeah I would love to see that I really
would I think that would be great but
then again I'm all for sending stupid
people in space and leaving them there
so if it does happen I'm totally fine
with that because that helps the gene
pool a little bit more they could do one
with just training just training to be
an asteroid like space camp yeah wasn't
there Space Camp really TV show I feel
like there was on Nicholas an awesome
move his knee I'll see movie in me it
was a very awesome great baby why don't
they reboot that that's a great movie
because nobody could replace Lea
Thompson that oh that's true okay anyway
we've already tan jadid tangent it off
into netherworld would
I guess the question would any of us go
yeah did you guys go Bonnie says no I
say no I'm saying no depends on what's
on TV that night I find the earth much
more comfortable yeah I did too well
that like hell I got Jeff's like on we
win so I'll go i'm bored bored what's us
planet but how are they narrowing people
down what are the criteria and I want to
know yeah well they're going through
kind of like a training camp sort of
thing where you know they'll be tested
physically and mentally I mean literally
it is kind of a reality show thing
they'll go through through different
rounds um I mean yeah be drowned you
guys even know anyone who would who
would consider doing this I mean there's
been some profiles on some of the people
that have applied and I mean there's
like you know me Mary people with
families it's crazy go to space I think
it costs I don't know how many millions
of dollars it costs but it costs a lot
of money and you have to go through the
actual NASA training but they do take
none astronauts under space missions
I've taken teachers they've taken people
that aren't I don't know I at the top of
my mind I can't think of anyone that
necessarily is not a teacher that went
still kind of blew up too often for my
taste yeah i just i don't know if you
can see me my my reality is based on all
space horror films right so I just keep
thinking I'm gonna be the red shirt I'm
gonna be a red shirt I'm gonna be the
first person that dies or eaten or
something practicing my passive
submission now yeah but I like the idea
that there is a like they are
trying to whittle down all these
applicants that think that they're
actually going to Mars it's just kind of
sad when they find out they're not and
they're gonna have to good I don't know
Utah or something instead we're all just
basically cowardly writers who would
never been you know suppose hey you guys
don't tell us all about it yeah well
we'd love to cover it it's not worth it
to have a street on Mars named after you
yeah i don't know i just get
clausterphobic easily and also space
supposedly doesn't smell that great and
i don't know i don't want to go we're in
an article that it's not like steak no
it smells like I thought it was like
burnt hair and cinnamon and metal like a
goth club Michelle can you confirm haha
I don't remember where an article no
God smell like that perfume called
poison oh yeah your categories yeah she
would you go to would you go to Mars
it's Australia seems like the kind of
sauce really seem like the kind of
people that might sign up for that kind
of a thing similar landscape 20 and
you're closer we've got a bit more
gravity son what kind of into that um no
I don't think I would there was a
documentary a couple of years ago called
Mars one way and they interviewed a few
of the people who had signed up for the
Mars one mission and it was actually
really depressing there was this one guy
who he wanted to go because he he just
didn't have any friends he didn't relate
to anybody on earth there was another
guy who had a wife and kids and he was
like I yeah I want to go to Mars like
you know it's my life's you know mission
to go to Mars this is my destiny
meanwhile is poor wife's they're going
well I guess I guess we're gonna have to
support him there's not much else we can
do like it just I feel like that should
come up in the first date like yeah sure
you should talk about this lake how do
you plan on going to space anytime yeah
like this should probably be something
you bring up before you get married is
are you cool of me abandoning you to go
to Mars and not come back I think some
marriages would be okay with that but
not all well what if so what if we did
it the way we've done every other man
space mission where we figure out a way
for you to come home well I mean how
would that change the amazing the other
great if it wasn't like if I didn't
return to a planet of apes I'd be
totally cool with it but as fictions
taught me well we can't change the
planet while you're gone this fiction
Tommy when they come back it's gonna be
all right everybody hide hide look money
to see the Apes it'll be hilarious all
the other four Baca's and like three 3d
printers will have taken over and hope
words and hoverboards and all the humans
will be like corralled into like factory
farms or something like I just I don't
know my my superior but my fear of
things happening while I'm gone it's
time to paranoid
the planet I'd be afraid of things
happening while I was there but good
parties yeah like while i was asleep
yeah well you couldn't miss another
burning man well the things I could be
tricky all Mars is isn't it okay so i
guess i'm thinking venus glow sticks
dehydration yeah i know if there's one
thing astronauts should always bring
with them as glow sticks and tang and
tang and we know we reported last year
on there was a study by some students
out of MIT who were kind of looked at
the preliminary designs the Mars one has
and they predicted the people who
basically start to die in like 63 days
don't buy any girly bananas kids the air
system wouldn't work um which is which
is debated but the point is you know
they did a crowdfunding campaign for
four hundred thousand dollars and didn't
even get halfway there I don't entirely
think this is going to happen so I just
been not sure we needn't worry about it
the people who applied didn't all pay I
don't think there was an application
they show a really attractive woman and
then they say never to return seductive
he's stuck on a planet with a beautiful
woman no it's like 50 shades of Mars
this is kind of an for the this is the
ad for the reality show right meet the
Mars woman sounds like Mars tinder all
of a sudden yeah anyway well you know as
romantic is making it tomorrows might be
for other people who are different
powers like us ah there you know there's
plenty of really smart people out there
like renowned a Canadian astronaut and
microgravity musician Chris Hadfield who
think it makes more sense to go back to
the moon first the moon might not be is
sexy because you know we see it all the
time but as Michelle you reported on
recently we're actually just not getting
a good look at the other side of the
moon the so-called Dark Side of the Moon
which unlike the album of the same name
you don't have to be totally stoned to
enjoy from what I understand they're
right Michelle well about the other side
of the moon not there I just don't know
it's it's not actually the dark side of
the moon cuz it does get some
it it's called the far side of the moon
because it's actually the face of the
moon that we don't actually say on earth
so as the moon orbits the earth it's
tidally locked in place so that we only
ever see the one side and the other side
the far side of the moon is what the
Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter has been
checking out as it sort of orbits so
yeah it's pretty cool um Derek there's a
there's a video of it down there at the
bottom Steven and it's kind of cool and
it sounded like basically there's more
or different kind of craters on the far
side than what we see on the side that
that faces us I think it's so strange
the moon doesn't spin it just kind of
hangs in one spot you know it's well it
does it was tripped me out it doesn't
spin it all no it does spin but it's all
but is sort of locked to it like to our
to our plantation yeah yes so we only
see one side of the moon forever basic
yeah yeah it's really obsessed with us
uh-huh the other side is making faces at
us so Michelle you mentioned things that
are different about the other side um
yeah because that side sort of faces
away from the earth it's sort of more
vulnerable to impacts from asteroids and
other stuff that's out there so it's
it's got yeah it's got it doesn't have
the big dark spots that you know the man
in the moon or the rabbit in the moon or
whatever you want to call it that's got
these big dark spots they don't exist on
the other side of the moon and it's just
got all these craters just yeah it's
just full of impact craters basically
from yeah I just liked it I just need to
pretend that the other side of the moon
we don't see is just completely littered
with broken down satellites like the
whole thing looks like a like a Sanford
and Son like junkyard of like broken
satellites and like different ships that
had parts and debris and just trash and
like all this crap that we don't see
because it's kind of like when you clean
your room and you shove everything in
the closet or under the rug that's the
end of the rug side the moon
so that's why I always currently I have
no evidence well I'm not letting you
been cleaning the moon it's just you
know whatever you can't see for sure I
mean we are seeing it now but for so
long we didn't that I just thought that
would be hilarious if you just went to
the other side and it was just like crap
everywhere or the first day to be
covered in sarcastic commentary on doing
so yes the man the man faces though this
is you right well the funny thing too I
mean it was not funny but I there's so
much space junk in orbit right now that
you don't really know where that stuff's
landing and so it would be pretty sad if
we were turning every planet into our
own little personal junkyard cos so do
we just can't be bothered yeah I know we
need a little Wally to clean up
everything well you know who had his own
personal junkyard moon junk it turns out
is a Neil Armstrong in his closet in his
closet yeah so Steven you and Amanda
both covered this there was some stuff
that's now in the Smithsonian but it was
literally found by Neil Armstrong's wife
in his closet after he died stuff that
went to the moon with him yeah I've been
in there for 50 years 40 some 50 years
and it's officially an old the purse the
purse yeah I was called a lunar purse or
something like that and uh it was just
meant to stow away um loose objects in
the spacecraft and he just left it in
his closet and there's like cameras in
there and all kind of stuff did alien
Skelton yeah that's crazy but um well
yeah so they were covered in they and
their here at all as all the stuff and
they've lent it to the Smithsonian you
know so um this is the purse she looks
like the actress who would play her in
the mix like a pretty boring Birkin bag
actually yeah it's just a totally like
they call it mcdivitt purse yeah
Courtney gale yes it's just like you
know something he called it a bunch of
trash he's like I don't think it's
useful stuff right it's just things that
like there's a belt that strapped you in
so you don't float away you know that's
useful yeah but there's a camera too i
mean yeah i receive this is a really
nice film camera that he used to
document a lot of the trip yeah but
nobody uses film anymore yeah 10
millimeter camera I mean did he go yeah
what haha but um and like power cables
you know things that yeah
just would power lights and just just
all kinds around with stuff but you know
it's pretty interesting all this the way
this is a 6-pin it looks like six pin
plug just kind of random stuff that but
they feel so weird that he took it home
like usually yeah that stuff in your
desk at work yeah and then do you want
it I mean my grandpa would have been
breaking in there and borrowing the
tethers to use yeah except other stuff
with yeah well that just makes me think
like how awesome Neil Armstrong was that
oh this is just a bag of crap I put in
my my closet right yeah a few people in
the chat room are calling them a see if
I don't know if we can let that stand
I'm sure a lot of people can comment
saying that thief too but come on I
don't think it's really a thief if you
drift that risk his life that dude went
a space and pretty sure you could do
anything you want at this point see the
guy who punched someone on the job no
that's muzzle that was you don't tell
buzz that the moon landing my name is
also send buzz after these people yeah
you know never say moon landings faked
around real astronauts are low yeah you
up um yeah no I don't think he's a thief
I don't know I kind of feel like it's
work stuff so you can take it home oh
come on it tastes like why pretend you
didn't paperclips post-it note here they
never profited from it was in this
closet now it's any museum we know the
lungs in a museum look now it's now it's
a museum worthy but back then it was
probably just junk I mean you know when
Star Wars was shot almost all in the set
was just thrown out the dumpster and
then if you were smart enough in the 70s
and worked on Star Wars and grab that
stuff by the dumpster you can sell it
for you know five hundreds of thousands
of dollars back then and just set pieces
to a movie they didn't think would do
anything my uncle said he knew it'd be a
huge hit I mean I know people probably
say that all the time but he said as the
first start sci-fi movie he'd seen that
really looked like sci-fi you know where
things are really gritty right anyway
sorry didn't mean to throw no sorry
that's a good transition we're gonna
spin it into Star Wars instant yeah we
were gonna talk about Star Wars it
anyway but I did want to talk about the
other astronaut news cuz I did write a
story about the astronauts that we're
posing as Jedi yeah yeah man and this
kind of revealed something that most
NASA fans already know is that for each
mission the astronauts have been posing
as different movies like different
sci-fi and fantasy and cult classic
movies for each mission so this one was
star war
but they've done Star Trek they've done
Indiana Jones they've done Reservoir
Dogs um yeah they're not done Batman and
Robin the women pictures yeah the
hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy is one
of my favorites just because they have
every once in a while they have the
robot can't cameo as well but metropolis
was a weird one I'm not sure sure why
you would I don't even see Superman into
I like the tron one yeah the trauma
one's pretty cool I mean it's
interesting i loved the Star Wars that's
the most recent one so the star wars
ones for the the upcoming mission but
it's just fun to go back and see all
these and the matrix ones great because
they totally look like they look they
look like a great band I mean there's
the reservoir dogs one I'm not these
don't make sense hugs I know right happy
rose I'll be space movies well there's
some yeah they did pirates of the
caribbean which is hilarious because i
really do look like pirates yeah there
you go I mean you know people are having
fun with photoshop for sure but it's
it's one of those things where it's nice
to see astronauts and NASA have a sense
of humor I mean they do already and
they're already cool astronauts and this
just kind of drives at home and then
there was another astronaut he had taken
his official fellows and it was with his
dogs it's actually not from this year
it's from a couple years ago but a
journalist saw it and tweeted it at of
course the astronaut and he retweeted it
and it became a viral sensation just a
couple weeks ago or a few weeks ago but
it's not his current NASA photo but it
didn't matter it was just so great that
there were dogs in it it's just like
yeah you know I could see dogs going on
a mission they probably won't because
the original dogs that went on missions
didn't always come back um but anyway
anyway the point B gonna go down downer
the point being is that astronauts are
cool yeah they like stuff that we like
and they have have they done a poster of
ice pirates yet cuz that oh i don't know
like I just kept thinking of all the
movies a Time Bandit back on my eyelids
yeah but you have to be careful you
don't want to pick a movie where
astronauts die okay so probably not
event horizon not a venomous
blog gravity lucky idea I like the idea
that this might be like in your
astronauts contract you're gonna spend
six months in the International Space
Station and you're gonna be obi-wan yeah
i think it was it was interesting that
took him this long to do with star wars
won I mean they've done every movie
until Star Wars but maybe they're afraid
of getting a season decision from George
Lucas I don't know but it's pretty
awesome and I think I mean I did an
article about it but if you go on
starwars.com I think they interview one
of the astronauts it's going on the
mission that actually did pose for the
for the poster but they're pretty cool
and you can download them off the NASA
site in high res and print them out and
put him on your wall so you can have
these posters to to decorate your home
or locker I do not decorate yeah there
you go I do want to think astronauts
love their jobs you know you don't want
that really I guess I'm a mascot its ok
now ours are tough yeah they should love
it maybe it's kind of a pain like a
shoots of pain I mean that's a thing too
is a lot of times when these astronauts
are no longer on space missions they do
a lot of stuff with education they go to
school that's different you try to help
with stem yeah I mean they really look
at that look how great they are even
that even the badge that they do for
each mission is cool oh yeah all the
collectible badges so anyway I decide we
bring it up I really want to know what
what's the deal with these star wars
cruises oh yeah star wars crew okay so
this is a deal they're not what you
think they are okay there oh god they're
not what you think they are they're not
an entire cruise full of like Jawas and
he walks and stormtroopers and Vader
there every single day dance what it is
is that there's only going to be a
select amount of these Caribbean cruises
for Disney Cruise Line and it's one day
/ cruise vacation package that's going
to be called star wars day but the cool
thing with that is you can watch all
they're going to show all the movies
outside so you can see them on the water
with like you know the stars in the sky
and that's kind of cool Vader's gonna be
wandering around I know there's so many
jokes to be had on this is so great ah
Vader's wander around there's going to
be stormtroopers I believe some
celebrities will be there that they
haven't announced who yet and then
there's a bunch
activities for the kids love Jedi
training like they do with the jedi
academy training at disney for star wars
weekends i mean it's kind of like star
wars weekends from disney but on a boat
but it's only one day / cruise oh man
i'm just so seeing the video singing i'm
on a boat i know i don't know what
they're gonna do I know they get there
probably need some sort of dancing
karaoke number that's gonna be painful
to watch but I have a thing where you
get to launch like a jar jar mannequin I
don't know they're gonna have fireworks
I don't know if they're gonna explode
Ewok sir I don't know I don't know
what's gonna happen but the promo
pictures operational Chewbacca will be
on board so that man a Wookiee on the on
the ocean I mean come on sweating like
yeah I'm going off the hi dad why can't
tell you gonna do a triple Lindy from
past experience from working at
Lucasfilm that they give to the guys who
play Chewbacca they give him lots of
breaks what do you mean the guys who
play Chewbacca the guide is not the real
Chewbacca Peter may his busy doing real
movies he's busy doing well don't say
Chewbacca's not real he's real there's
more than one Wookiee you know ok so
anyway so I'm excited for this this is
the first time Disney's done a cruise
where there's a Star Wars element so I'm
pretty excited I don't know if I'm gonna
go but it's pretty awesome I can't wait
for all the viral videos to start
popping up on YouTube all the blue milk
you can drink I'm just a little worried
there will be some seasick stormtroopers
and that's not the video i want to see
but take the bucket off first you're
worried doing this yeah I just don't I
don't know but there's been a lot of
Star Wars news lately so that's one of
the things I was excited about was the
cruise and another one how are there you
wrote about how there's 32 new Star Wars
Legos okay so here's the thing what have
they not made 32 sets coming out that
span all the movies and Star Wars rebels
which is the new obviously the new
disney animated series and clone wars
which was the old cartoon network series
and they haven't even announced the
force awakens sets yet so this is the
stuff that they showed at toy fair that
hasbro gave us it's a lot it's not all
32 they didn't reveal all 32 pictures so
people that are snarky in the comments
saying i apparently 12 pictures / 32 the
reveal them all uh but they're so cute
look at them look at so cute so i looked
at the poster of the minifigs their
Jabba the Hutt actually has the slave
change yeah so this has got to be the
first lego minifig with a slave chain I
just want to I will point out there is a
jar jar yeah there is a charge our
minifig i will point that out for the
two people that like charger but the big
news you know and those are the new
figures look Holly good they're called
like I think they're called connects or
can actually probably like this I'm
contraction they're called contraction
sets and they look really weird but
they're kind of cool-looking are they
look like when they're fully dilated all
right but I will tell you all this money
uh it also came with a lego poster that
was like the ABCs that is I was very
very cute and was out on my son that is
downloaded all that on my wall so you
can download it from our cider from
hasbro site but i will say the big thing
that's cool is the TIE fighter and I
think I think I led the yeah I like you
Amy that is all that they've done Lego
Tie Fighters before but this one comes
with a display stand it's much more
intricate and it's pretty freaking
expensive and it's in the thousands of
pieces so it's gonna take you forever
put together does it make the pew pew
pew see how big is it uh pretty big it
says in there somewhere I can't yes the
figure down there looks pretty small I
didn't remember uh yeah I can't with the
little minifig it says about a foot yeah
it's pretty big I mean I have all the
typhoid ER sets from Hasbro in my
apartment already and I'm getting this
one because it's pretty detailed but the
point is start saving your money or just
wait for your tax refund and just give
it directly to hasbro because we're fine
to ship some of these sets are expensive
and some of them are a little bit
cheaper in the price range and if you
don't want the LEGO sets you can get the
brand-new hasbro lightsabers where you
could build oh yeah the crazy lightsaber
so you can fun like your cocktail for
you can make a lightsaber trident you
can make a lightsaber I don't know you
could just make the type of lightsaber
that will kill you the minute you try to
ignite it pretty much any of them really
speaking of mods can we look at the base
the rebel base oh yeah we're so yeah
definitely eternally in Falcon guitar oh
okay
two of them there's the Han Solo
Millennium Falcon guitar and then
there's the rebel base hmm which is I
think that's hilarious ah these are for
sale they are for sale on Etsy their
custom you can get you can even get a
custom made what's the word case for it
they light up they're made from vintage
Millennium Falcon toys and they added
blue lights as well so it's not just the
light up part of the toy that originally
came with but they added LED blue lights
and I interviewed the creator of these
guitars on cnet crave and you can check
him out there but he says they play fine
just like a normal guitar just you just
have to know how to you know play one
well but I love it I I think it's great
I would not mind yeah now we know why we
have no interest in going to Mars cuz
there's doing a great space toys here at
Halloween what's the point Oh
incidentally i'm on twitter I've lost a
page Oh Tyler G green comments that none
of the people went to die on Mars they
went to live on Mars fair point Oh
optimist wait um well you know all we've
got Michelle on the line um all the way
from Australia and we woke her up at
like seven in the morning to get her on
here we wanted to hear a little bit more
about a story that's been doing
gangbusters on crave the Euro of
Michelle about this mummified no it
wasn't found inside the to know what
what's this story okay so it's this
statue of the Buddha and a bunch of guys
CT scanned at last year and they found
this mummified monk inside um they think
he's around nine hundred to a thousand
years old and yeah he's just stuffed
inside the Statue how big is the statute
or is this a really tiny monk it's
personalized okay oh yeah there's a
picture of it I don't know I'm feeling
it's not a sure you're sure you're back
then they're shorter back then I'm just
saying we got the idea to do a CT scan
on the Golden Buddha in the first place
was it a rumor or something we asked
like where its eyes following people
around the room
well you can see the base of it is is
cut away so I don't know if it was like
that and they sort of looked inside and
saw it I had something inside or if they
just thought there was something a bit
strange about it I don't actually know
that so um and they found something yet
they didn't just find a body to they
found something about the body yeah they
found these scraps of paper inside where
the organs should be with our Chinese
writing on it I don't know what the
writing says I iou assumably you have to
go to the museum to check that out okay
probably like a trophy for best hide and
seek yeah I am the monastery back in
five minutes right oh god this is such a
great story though i love this i hope
that they start doing more CT scans of
everything but apparently apparently
there's a mummification practice in in
Buddhism of this area where well she
talks about it I'm just trying yet
kelsey's trying to keep us on point out
in from Australia this is a Varrick yeah
tell us more Michelle well it's it's
self-mummification so they go through
this period where they they go on this
diet of nuts and seeds and then they go
on this diet of bark and this this sap
that they normally use for lacquering
plates and then they'll sort of be
sealed into a tomb for a thousand days
and if at the end of the thousand days
of being sealed in the tomb they've been
mummified then they become a sort of a
living Buddha or yeah they're basically
worshipped in a temple as a living
Buddha I'm not entirely sure that this
guy was a living Buddha because he did
have his organs removed and pick and
stuff put inside him but he could have
been I don't know bo is this practice it
was outlawed I think in the 19th century
they they sort of made it illegal to do
this because you know if obvious reasons
but um those who achieved it were sort
of putting the temples and put on
display and people would go in and
worship them more or venerate them I
don't know if worships the right word
and those who
and we're just sort of left sealed in
the tomb but with with respect for for
their attempt for for their endurance in
in sort of going through this this 2000
a horrible deprivation to try to turn
themselves into these living borders
you're actually trying to lacquer your
insides practically is there yeah that's
hardcore that's impressive yeah
literally yeah some of us do that every
weekend but favorite part of the story I
think is that Michelle seems becoming
our own like in house Indiana Jones in
charge of these archaeological
expeditions you had another one the
other teeth or the teeth and the Mexican
statue yeah it was a Jesus that's right
yeah Jesus yeah they found eight human
teeth in this statue of Christ yeah
that's not that's like touch me I so
that is not creepy at all nope no it's a
greedy but Jesus is a good name for a
band yeah so what kind of a human teeth
like what kind of tea under human yeah
he would taste Wow I mean it's it's a
what's the word it's Reverend you know
it just it seems creepy to us but it's
intended reverently yeah the interesting
thing about both of these cases is that
they seem unique like there is no other
statute in which they've found human
teeth religious statue and there's no
other Buddha statue in which they found
a mummy so but have them checked have
they really ja they really checked I
feel like now everyone's gonna be
checking their you know resident
mummified whatever in every museum to
see if there's something in signing off
their bases I know yeah imagine being an
asian art museum at night and looking
around and just they're all people in
there there's about to be a comer o
terracotta warrior zone oh my god that's
crazy the Emperor who did all that was
crazy yeah he wouldn't actually
surprised I don't know I kind of I kind
of missed that I kind of feel like we
don't have that I mean the closest thing
we have mass murder we totally do we
totally do know with an artistic to know
I mean like you know warlike leaders
that have kind of a crazy side like pute
Putin I got huge monument yeah North
Korea I guess what's for us we don't
really have that kind of like death
etsy death cray-cray over here like we
like they did back in the day I'm not
like they'd had back in the day and I
don't know I guess I'm being nostalgic
for a time we should never be the
stalker banerjee coud we don't really
Vlad to employ Impaler we don't there's
some guys trying to bring that back I
mean the closest thing we knew the NFL I
guess I think we have right now is the
head of the NSA his picture has gone
viral because he there's a picture of
him kind of looking like a Star Wars
character or something where he's just
screaming into the microphone about how
the NSA doesn't really spy on us when we
all know they do and so now everyone's
saying that instead of every time a
journalist posted like some sort of
stock photo of some creepy guy to
computer to show a hacker like to show
that they should just show this guy
that's the head of NSA screaming into a
microphone because it's even creepier
that I'm getting aids us getting a
message in my ear Bonnie that that is
not correct alright well we're about out
of time but I know we've all got some
interesting stuff that we're working on
we wanted to tease the folks with under
Kelsey you were working on some stuff
about the flash is that right oh yeah
well look nice I can't tell you how many
people just grin at me when I walked
down the street wearing this thing like
a lot of us there a lot of us out there
people obsessed with the flash the next
episode is not gonna be for basically
another month and I don't know how I'm
gonna get through it oh man but some of
that will be therapy at by posting blog
post probably yeah that's it that's all
for me I think you're also gonna do a
gallery right I've been requesting a
gallery of images I've taken a lot of
screen shots but I'm not sure they're
really yeah I don't breathe alright just
said it is just send them to me directly
it's totally fine yeah dropbox i'm
working on a story about the godzilla
hotel that is hilarious of an actual
hotel that you can have a room that
looks like Godzilla's peeking in it um I
think that's great i love this idea i'm
a huge Godzilla fan and where is it it's
in I think it's in Tokyo I'm not too
sure I'll find out it sits in its in
Japan I know that much but we'll see
well
the thing is when you're a big Attila
fan and you go to Tokyo and you want to
go to the Godzilla statue and then you
actually go to the Godzilla statue it's
not godzilla-sized it's like tiny and so
you coming down let me know yeah it's
like a little it's like scrappy-doo
Godzilla oh you know it's just tiny
that's just unnecessarily if you're
gonna have a John if you're gonna have
an iconic monster represent your country
it should be full size so I'm excited
for this hotel this is going to be the
closest thing i get to retribution for
having to take that trip to the godzilla
just you i just found godzilla hostels
in Russia period oh really whoa all
kinds of weird stuff happening why are
those in Russia yeah on a budget
Godzilla on a budget you don't know how
Godzilla decorates his place I don't
know I mean it looks kind of amazing
assuming does he invite you over that
doesn't invite me he doesn't return my
calls no maybe maybe they have an actual
Godzilla and sleeping and then Godzilla
breaks through the window yeah yeah yeah
and then they film it and they sell it
on cable I mean here's the thing when
you go to Japan there's always gonna be
there's always a weird hotel like
there's the robot hotel that's supposed
to be I want to go to that and I wrote
an article about it but they didn't
reveal what the robots look like so i
don't know how like humanoid the robots
will be that are running this hotel in
Japan that's all robot run all of it so
when you check in robots check you in
I'll entire made chicken the mate
service is awesome yeah that's not them
this is no no no no that's prototype
that's them pretending that's like hey
this could be it that's that's how
they're getting people interested in it
that's it oh we lost Eric that's how
excited you was about the room now
here's the thing when you're trying to
get investor money you sometimes you
photoshop photos know that don't look
like the real thing and so you don't
feel like the respect us or something
yeah they don't have the real robots
like game trailers yeah it's
what anyway my point being is Japan has
great hotels and I can't wait to visit
Godzilla the end ex back Eric's back hey
whatwhat's Michelle working are we hear
from Michelle I I recently interviewed
the director of the giant Magellan
telescope foundation so I will be
writing that up soon um that's going to
be the world's biggest telescope they're
hoping to have it up and running by 2020
and using it they're going to look for
the beginning of time well if there's
not a target cities that are gonna be a
TARDIS their guitarist at the beginning
of time everything I know about doctor
who will be ruined say giant space
telescope yeah i know i'm excited for
this thank you for keeping us legit well
I've got I've got one last space related
teaser as well it's kind of related what
Michelle is working on I recently spoke
with an astronomer who's actually out of
Puerto Rico and he gave me his
prediction including a pretty hard date
for when we might be able to confirm the
existence of the first habitable planet
like right now we have these potentially
habitable planets are like the right
size and and in the right you know
listening to their son but this guy
actually has a time frame for when he
thinks will confirm that the right
conditions for life exists on another
planet and perhaps even when we confirm
the existence of life on such a planet
and it's it's not that far away sadly
only two days after the colonists I on
Mars yes timing yeah so anyway I look
for that alley drunk I do you want to
say really quickly the crop circle
towels that I wrote about they did reach
their funding on kickstarter so if you
did fund some of those that i wrote
about and they're great they're just
green towels that look like crop circles
that you see on farms and they're just a
design on towels they reached their
funding so you can get these awesome
towels now and you can still is i think
there's like 10 days left so if you want
to buy some now's the time to do it but
they're pretty awesome i just love this
idea
but they look like round their best
thing to do is to buy some matching
regular green towels give them to your
friend as a gift and then sneak in some
time when they're not looking guy swap
them yeah that's great I like that
you're already thinking of crop circle I
might have got a little too much about
them no it's brilliant yeah all right
well thanks you guys I think that's all
the time we've got for this creative
cast will be back next month as always
check out all the stories we've talked
about an one's upcoming at cnet com /
