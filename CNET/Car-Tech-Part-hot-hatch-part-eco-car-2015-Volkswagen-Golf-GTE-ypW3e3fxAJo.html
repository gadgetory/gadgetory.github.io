no i didn't misspeak its GTE not GTI
this is the plug-in hybrid version of
the hot hatchback and it's what happens
when you take all of that turbocharged
performance and excellent handling and
combine it with a little electric know
how gathered from Volkswagens eGolf
program
now I've plug-in hybrid we've got a
combination of engines under the hood
first is a 1.4 liter turbocharged engine
that's smaller than the two-liter you'll
find in the GTI and has made it within
electric engine and together they put
their power to the front wheels through
a 6-speed dual-clutch transmission total
system power is 200 horsepower and 253
pound-feet of torque which
coincidentally are the exact same
numbers that you'll find in the
conventional GTI the difference here is
how that torque is delivered where the
standard GTI sort of builds its power in
linear fashion the GTE kind of has the
advantage of having the immediate
electric torque on tap at all times now
why bother with a plug-in hybrid version
of the GTI if your numbers are going to
be about the same well the big
difference comes when you're talking
about efficiency because it's got a
battery and a place to plug in the GTE
can do about 31 miles under a full
electric charge before it's gasoline
engine has to jump in to help Volkswagen
says that the GTE is good for a combined
about 150 to 160 6 miles of driving if
you plug in regularly and have short
commutes or short trips between charges
now unfortunately they did not supply us
with an American plug for this European
model and it's charging port is not the
same standard as our j1772 plug that we
have at most charging stations here in
California so I haven't actually been
able to plug this thing in to test it's
sort of full electrified performance
consequently I've just been driving it
as a hybrid which is still pretty fun
but that means that i've only been
getting about 33 to 42 miles per gallon
per trip and with the gasoline and
electric engines working in concert this
vehicle feels every bit as awesome as
the GT I with the GTE volkswagen has
added a lot of city car practicality and
efficiency to
one of the best hot hatchbacks on the
market without compromising very much of
its performance so the GT is as fun as
the GTI and it's more efficient but what
about price well we don't have us
pricing because this is a European model
so let's go with that in Europe the GTE
is about a five percent price premium
over the GTI so that's thirty-six
thousand euro instead of 30 so we can
expect a similar price to that if it
comes to America now Volkswagen
currently has no official plans to bring
the GT each of the United States yet
here we are in California and there is
the GTE so we can at least hope
personally I think that a plug-in hybrid
version the DCI is going to sell like
hotcakes when you get here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
