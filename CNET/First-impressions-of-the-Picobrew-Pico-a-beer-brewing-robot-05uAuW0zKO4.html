at brewing beer at home but you're
scared off by all the equipment that
looks like it belongs in a lab well
don't worry anymore because this thing
takes care of the process for you
you take prepackaged ingredients you
stick them in here you plug them into
the machine you hit start we're a couple
of days into testing here's what we know
so far
keep the instruction manual handy the
display on the front gives you some help
but you're still doing all the main
steps of an authentic brew and the
instruction manual is handy and clear
with its instructions so keep it around
it makes cleaning easy the Pico takes
care of most of the work for you using
steam and heat to cleanse the pipes
between brews and keeping most of the
ingredients in sealed packs now we
haven't tasted the first beer yet so if
it comes out infected my joy over the
ease of cleaning is gonna be kind of
undone but there's hope it doesn't help
you crash cool
after you brew you have hot liquid
called wort
that's essentially unfermented beer you
can't add yeast yet or the heats gonna
kill it so you need to cool your beer
and while the wort cools it's super
vulnerable to infection the Pico
recommends you seal your keg and set it
aside for 24 hours to let it cool on its
own maybe the seal will hold up and
letting the vulnerable wort sit out
won't have any negative effects maybe
give it time to Pecos credit this is
still an authentic brewing process it
keeps the hands on part of brewing to a
minimum but it still takes a couple of
hours to cook up a batch of wort than a
few days for the yeast to ferment the
wort into beer and that's what we know
so far we'll be tasting our first beer
in the next couple of days and brewing
more soon the Pico allows you to do a
fast and a slow method for fermentation
we're also going to mess with the
alcohol by volume and bitterness levels
on future groups we'll keep you updated
on whether this microwave for beer
actually produces a tasty brew
