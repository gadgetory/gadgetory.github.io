demos ever it's a robotic sushi waiter
it's the creation of Silicon Valley
startup Willow Garage they're dreaming
up how and why we'll use robots in the
future
that was so sparked it's really you know
I've been taking my digital dexterity
for granted was it your goal to create
that future where Rosie from the Jetsons
is actually occurring well our goal was
to get robots out of factories from
behind the cages and factories where
they could help people whether that's
having a bot to shoot pool with one that
can fetch you a beer from the fridge or
my personal favorite fold your laundry
what is it that makes this robot do
amazing things well it starts with how
it sees the world so this is the the pr2
head and there you see a lot of sensors
there's a high resolution video camera a
couple of stereo pairs this is actually
a projector that works with the stereo
to give you better 3d images and then
the Kinect is actually doing something
very similar
it's got uses infrared to project the
texture in the world and then use that
texture to also get 3d images and while
the pr2 s are programmed to work
autonomously they can also run via game
controller this is amazing I look at
dances there's a turbo there's a turbo
button everybody back up
now as cool as the pr2 robots are
hardware is only half the story here
Willow Garage is also developing an
operating system that they've opened
sourced so the hardware and its
underlying software can work together to
form the future of robotics it's open
source right it's open source and so
we've had about 160 interns visiting
scholars from around the world come here
for three to six months and then they've
gone back home and they kind of take the
software with them so they can program
the robot to do things like clear a
table pick up a set of clean dishes
then yes even attempt to serve me sushi
delicate I've either take a bow he's
really like yes I did yes I did I did
that boom
so what's preventing us from having a
robot in every home probably the price
tag is a pretty big factor and how much
do they cost the list price is $400,000
so it's expensive then of course there's
the constant fear that robots will take
over humankind but willow promised me
otherwise this robot is not gonna take
over the world
you drop a 2x4 in front of it it's done
for see that's what I like to hear
I feel very reassured and reassured that
my place was now set for a bite of sushi
Bon Appetit you could kind of see why
they call this restaurant yesterday is
sushi cuz 35 minutes later or so I have
my bowl my chopsticks and my slightly
wilted food but I can definitely imagine
the not-too-distant future where robots
are servers and much more and I for one
look forward to it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
