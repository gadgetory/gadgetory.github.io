how to contributor and today we're going
to cover how to apply a body guards
protective film to the iphone 4s the
process should be pretty similar across
all the devices at bodyguard supports
but today we're specifically looking at
the iphone 4s so in our bodyguards kit
came to a set of two protective films
for the device I've already applied the
skin to the back this one is for the
front and here it is for the sides we're
going to go ahead and set this stuff
aside and begin applying the film to the
front now because I've already applied
it to the back of course I've gone ahead
and washed off the device dried it
washed my hands and made sure no
fingerprints or pieces of dust or dirt
were on the device itself and the new
application process for bodyguards uses
a gel instead of a liquid or the dry
application like they may have in the
past and most of you probably struggled
with the gel makes a little bit easier
it's a little bit more forgiving and the
process seems to go by pretty quick so
let's take a look at it what we'll do is
we'll peel off the backside of the
Front's protector I get it to separate
here there we go
and then like I said it uses a jail now
so what we'll do is we'll take the
application gel and just put a couple
globs on the protector itself you don't
want to put too much and then making
sure not to put a fingerprint or dust on
the protector itself go ahead and smear
the gel around once you get everything
covered we're going to pick it up reply
to the device now you can still do the
dry application process but that will
limit you in being able to move it
around and set it in the right spot once
you set it with the dry application
that's where the film is going to be
with the jail you can kind of slide it
around and get it lined up and if you do
for whatever reason have to take the
jail or the film all the way off put a
little bit more gel on the film and
reapply it it's not a problem all right
so that seems to be a fairly good spot
we're lined up what we'll do now is with
the cleaning cloth and just a credit
card type device we're going to squeegee
out all the excess gel underneath as
well as any of the air bubbles of course
start in the middle work your way out
get rid of all that extra jail that's
all there is to it I'm going to go ahead
and leave the top film on for right now
I don't want to peel it off and have a
chance of peeling the film off with it
as well bodyguardz recommends you wait
overnight until you put the device in a
pocket or a purse after having applied
it and you really take 72 hours to
completely cure and dry up and you won't
have any issues with it after that so
that's how easy it is to apply a
bodyguards film to the iphone 4s make
