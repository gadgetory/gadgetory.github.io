it's time for episode three 45 of the
359 podcast the podcast it's marketed as
four minutes and has yet to actually hit
that mark and your host today are Alfred
Inge Ben Fox Ruben and rich Nieva or as
Ben pronounces it rich
yeah neova yep that's it thank you very
much
yeah oh I have to I have to host yes
sorry I've been missing from the show I
oh hey made a few Tide Pods and have to
be out breakdancing in your downtime so
either way for the show today we're
gonna be focusing on two major things
the Samsung Galaxy S 9 which we're now
expecting to come out well they're first
gonna reveal it a month from now at
Mobile World Congress February 25th
we'll run through a handful of the major
rumor mills that have been going on and
plus we've got rich here as a special
guest he's going to talk about all the
trials and tribulations about facebook
or at least we're gonna try to get to as
many as we can in the two minutes of the
podcast either way
send in your questions and comments BBG
we'll get to as many as he can at the
end of the show without further ado
let's get to the podcast and here we go
in three two look that's the wrong one
hey I've been I've done pretty good this
week three - welcome to the 359 I'm Ben
Fox Ruben
I'm alfred hang and we've got a special
guest today richard Nieva or ace Google
and Facebook reporter and all-around
super nice dude hey how's it going
everybody hello
is that a nice intro so anyway so
Samsung on Wednesday we revealed that it
will show off the new Galaxy S 9 phone
on February 25th at Mobile World
Congress there's not really as much
anticipation for this phone after
Samsung needed to hit a home run with
the s8 last year following the note 7
debacle still we wanted to run through
some of the major rumors that are coming
out about this device the big one that
at least Samsung hinted at was a dual
camera setup
how significant do you think this is
gonna be for the phone I mean I think
the camera is usually their biggest
selling point isn't it yeah yeah I mean
I mean but I think this one they're
focusing a lot more on it like their
tagline for this is like the camera
reimagined exactly I don't really know
how much you can do to how much
reimagining it is to have another have
two of them you have two of them which I
think one more well a lot of people were
expecting that to happen on the SAE yeah
and you know actually bringing in both
of them now I think people who are
hoping for it a lot sooner so we'll see
what happens with that one other element
that I think could be interesting is and
I don't really see this happening but
Samsung apparently having their own
version a face ID also you could unlock
with they already had that though they
had that first six it was terrible they
didn't work that well not that good I
mean they're actually gonna be better
yeah I mean that was the thing about you
know why the face idea was so much like
better that because it used you know
they are kind of like scanning like 3d
scans on your face as opposed to like
image scanning so maybe it'll be better
maybe it will have a better camera on
the front for that and I think that
would be what the camera reimagined
might okay I might be better at this one
I'm also a little skeptical about it
that it would have an in screen
fingerprint reader I know there have
been a lot of rumors about in screen
fingerprint readers coming to major
smartphones but they haven't really
quite mentally the least skeptical about
that one because I had written a story
about a Qualcomm development that would
allow for that and they said it would be
coming around this time so really I
think yeah I think it makes a lot of
sense you can see that on the s9 well at
the very least they're gonna be moving
the fingerprint sensor on the back of
the phone like below the camera that's
at least like some of the stuff that
we've been selling definitely be a lot
more helpful that would definitely be a
lot more helpful and a little less weird
but I don't know we'll see what ends up
happening definitely check out more
stories from us about that as we get
closer to that date February 25th next
rich because you're here we wanted to
delve into a little of the trials and
tribulations about what Facebook has
been dealing with lately it seems like
people have kind of fallen out of love
with the world's largest social media
site but is this really hurting
Facebook's business are
people using Facebook less than maybe
they were before well see I think you
hit it on the head I think it's it's not
people like users that have fallen out
of love with it it's just that Facebook
has gotten more scrutiny from people
like us people lawmakers but it doesn't
look like people are using it less I
don't think people are using Facebook
less maybe you're not no I mean like a
lot of people that I talk to also aren't
using yeah but that's why you stay
totally anecdotal yes that's why I was
like curious to hear like Rich's opinion
ah well I they may be using it less but
it's not because of the criticism I
think so tell me a little bit about the
friends and family newsfeed thing do you
think that's gonna make like Facebook a
little bit more of a positive place I
don't know like do I really need to look
at more babies well that's the hope for
them so they announced this big overhaul
to the newsfeed the biggest one that
they've ever done probably and it is
gonna do prioritize news and show you
more political rants from your friends
yeah so that'll make it a positive place
I guess so okay you have five seconds to
answer this question yeah a really easy
question to finish the podcast out with
his Facebook hurting democracy yeah
we're not gonna know we're not gonna
figure that okay anyway if you want to
read more about these stories check us
out on CNN I'm Ben Fox Ruben I'm
offering I'm rich Nova thanks for
listening I think it's a good idea as
far as Facebook goes friends and family
thing yeah that's the reason I got on
Facebook in the first place I I don't
need another place to regurgitate the
same stories to me over and over again
that's what I have only reason I'm there
for is to stay in contact with the ever
shrinking list of people I care about
yeah I think Facebook also realizes
though that people are getting annoyed
by like you know third party family
members like your cousin's cousins
boyfriend or something like that I love
that guy
where you know like a few weeks ago they
had introduced all these like features
there's like oh you can now now like
mute these people for a certain amount
of time or like I mean I pretty much
unfollow every new person that
get to add it on or like anybody that
pops up on my newsfeed mm-hmm it's
almost always like an immediate unfollow
for me well I think with a lot of this
stuff it's good that Facebook is at
least recognizing that there are some
issues some of them I don't know may not
be like I think a lot is being heaped
upon them like maybe we actually have a
little bit of time now to talk about
that issue about democracy Facebook
initially immediately after the election
said no we had nothing to do with this
then they owned up to it and said well
maybe we did a little bit so what's
what's your take on that and like what
are they doing about yeah well I mean I
think to Facebook's credit they are
actually taking a hard look at
themselves and and reflecting Mark
Zuckerberg usually does this big what's
basically a very very extravagant New
Year's resolution where like he takes up
a challenge every year he when you he
decided to learn Mandarin last year he
said he was gonna does it every state
that he hadn't been to this year though
he said that his challenge would be to
fix all the big problems with Facebook
mmm I love totally do that
I love that the CEO of Facebook you know
it took this long for his new year's
resolution to be fixed Facebook goes
like all right I'm gonna learn Chinese
I'm gonna tour the USA I'm gonna open up
some more schools oh yeah I should
probably work on the website yes yeah
but I think that switching the newsfeed
to and having less news on it and
there's also this thing that are trying
to do to amp up like the trustworthiness
of the news that you actually do see
might solve the problems that a lot of
people did recognized during the
election where there were just basically
Russian trolls that were trying to
inflame both sides whatever side you
were on they were just trying the weird
thing is so like a lot of it wasn't so
Facebook right now is taking a big
priority on news right saying you know
we're gonna curb these fake news things
and all these posts but they haven't
really done much to address kind of like
the fake operatives kind of thing like
when I was looking into it one of the
bigger like issues that they had was
with events so that they would set up
like they would set up the protests and
the counter protest just to get people
to like you know argue in real life with
each other
they did they did it's in Texas where it
was something about a mosque opening up
and there was like a protest they the
the Russian trolls set up an event that
was protesting the Moscow opening up and
then they also set up the event for the
counter protest
we're so easily socially but in here the
thing is like that's what I find
surprising that's that's like the
biggest issue and I think that's why
people are like kind of calling out
Facebook on this you know saying a lot
of people are like believing stuff on
your website without any kind of
disclaimers on it but like how do you
like tell if an event is a fake now you
know like with news I can at least
gather something out of that like this
URL doesn't look legit or anything like
that with an event I think it's much
harder yeah and the other leads and
that's something that they still need to
figure out because when they when they
announced all of their findings for
investigating Russian interference they
it was it was ads and it was organic
posts and the organic posts are you're a
whole different beast the organic post
it got like way more traffic than any of
like the post with ads on it to be fair
so right but you can curb the ads anyway
I want to get to the questions I feel
like um probably got a lot of viewers
that are interested in talking a little
bit more about the s9 so let's let's
track back to that yeah we'll swing back
over to the s9 Jessica says bring back
the fingerprint scanner on the front I
think at least like you said the the
relocation of it on the back is a smart
move it's a better positioning I think
that's what they're trying to do with
the fingerprint scanner under this
screen though that it will be on the
front like it'll be on your screen like
if the s9 is anything like the SI where
it's like kind of like all screen on the
front like it'll probably be on the
front but just under your screen right
right Joe we'll see I it's it's I don't
maybe that will actually happen it's
actually pretty hard to know because all
the leaks that have been going out
there's no way of telling whether
there's a fingerprint scanner under the
glass or not but yeah Jessica also wants
to know if the s9 is going to be 4k 4k
screen I'm assuming so I mean that's
that's a tough one to answer
partly because like why would you need
4k on such a small screen I guess maybe
for verbal we are for the VR that you're
doing it's the other problem with that
is that if you
are gonna do VR or 4k stuff exactly how
much content exactly are you gonna be
getting I think I think a lot of media
companies still need to catch up to do
more content around that I wonder if the
s9 will finally be the kickoff device
for Bixby that Samsung keeps trying to
like push forward they've been pushing
big spin did that with they start with a
yes a didn't they yeah yeah so I mean
but I mean like there was kind of a
stumble on it cuz Bixby wasn't ready
when the SA like came out so I wonder
now that it is ready and it is like a
fully functioning device maybe the s9
will final it will be like the read
debut or the repackaging of like Bixby
yeah they keep talking about Bixby and I
expect they will continue talking about
that voice assist and the other thing
that I think is important to mention is
is that the s8 was a pretty significant
overhaul of the look of the phone and
there was like a lot more screen real
estate there was a lot less bezel from
the rumors that we've been seeing so far
the s9 is suspected to look very similar
to that device so what exactly is gonna
be the big to do about it
cameras ringing imagine right the camera
exactly reimagined it they're gonna
reimagine it reimagined as a sock okay
god I want to hate that phrase
reimagined what have to make it like
something whatever hammer
what sock well redesign there's
something you know luckily new
functionality I don't know but Lee they
redesign it's still a friggin kansai
camera that you can wear luckily they
don't have the dual you imagined it
might be a cloud stupid lofty marketing
crap anyway you really yeah take it in
your eye and cranky today sorry guys
well hey a dog when is gonna be the
release date for the s9 obviously we
don't know that because we're in a world
where we have a preview of a preview to
preview the preview as they announce the
announcement totally accurate you didn't
see the trailer we'll find out with you
on the 25th but assuming looking at
history we're gonna see it within like a
week or more likely a month afterwards
you think only usually then drop it in
like April I don't
it's I don't actually
remember off the top of my head yeah
usually it's within like a week to four
weeks after the actual announcement but
yeah that's that's typically what they
do is they unveil the device then they
tell you when you can actually buy it
and you can pre sale it so I would say
wait another month to actually find out
that information right Sanjaya wants to
know when will the Oreo update come for
the s8 good question I don't know that's
I will try to I will scramble to try to
find that out on the googles while we're
talking it's funny because I was at the
Oreo launch and they said that it would
be ready for the yes a like within the
week clearly it's not so I I mean there
might be some miscommunication on
Google's and with Samsung but I don't
know
apparently so trusted reviews I just
opened this up Android Oreo update for
the Galaxy s8 is now painfully close
alright but have you heard of this
website before yeah yeah they're running
by electron net I I don't trust them at
all because I don't know Facebook survey
for for weeding out fake news have you
seen this before and how much do you
trust it no trusted reviews I I know of
them but I do like seeing that more
probably because I got paid is that so
Scott Myatt says I'm using Facebook way
less than I used to Facebook memories
prove this but seriously there's been no
new features no bio stuff in the last
year couple years has there been I mean
I mean days is this see my space if
occation of Facebook ouch
I mean I would think I think the that's
news feature that Alfred mentioned a
little bit earlier is the biggest thing
that I can think of the the new survey
thing know they where you could break
you could meet people oh yeah yeah yeah
yeah but Facebook has also been focusing
on its other properties like messenger
yeah adding new things to that yeah they
have this thing called like stories now
that they invented they invented no one
else has ever done yeah where you can
take photos and they don't last like
forever they disappear in 24 hours
that's like no one else has ever done
that
is that true though that they're
focusing a lot more of their innovation
on like Instagram and messenger and not
so much
unlike the thing that two billion people
are on well when you've got something
with two billion you can't people on it
you can't we mess with you that much
without people getting yeah really bad I
guess imagine remember every time they
change like the wall that people would
like be furious about I was up in arms
their college student there'd be like
petitions wherever just really change it
back I want to poke people again is that
still a thing
poking yeah I think it is actually yeah
no one's ever they never sunset any of
this fun fact
when Facebook tried to clone snapchat
the first time wait what it was called
poke the app was called poke yeah
Facebook has never tried to clone
snapchat what are you what are you even
talking about right yeah I don't know I
I think there's not been a lot of new
features on Facebook I think right now
that they're they've been very hard on
driving like nostalgia where it's like
hey it's been three years since you met
a rich you should post on his wall again
yeah like the problem with that is is
that that's not actually reality like
sometimes I'll friend somebody on
Facebook that I've known for years yeah
and they're like your one-year
anniversary with BVG and I'm like but
BVG was at my bar mitzva like when we go
way back we'd go back like 30 years we
go way back no yeah sir enjoy whoo given
him a special shout-out right now
because he's balancing between our show
and a very important cutthroat game he's
watching on TV so thank you for sticking
with us we're keep our fingers crossed
we know you're in dire straits right now
sir enjoy will Mark Zuckerberg make any
huge leaps with Facebook to compete with
the Bitcoin strength of the Winklevoss
twins oh good question
Zuckerberg did mention cryptocurrency in
his post announcing his year-long
challenge to fix Facebook so who knows
Facebook dollars
Facebook's Facebook's that's good oh my
god the worst part the worst part is is
that that's entirely possible I don't
think he'd do that just despite the
Winklevoss twins I don't think that's
like a like that's a weird motivation to
start your own cryptocurrency but I mean
I could see them doing that to be honest
mmm-hmm blockchain it's the future face
block and storm king wants to know will
there be will there be any news on the
note nine that that comes later they
usually save that for later in the year
like yeah yeah like we've temper or so
right I I don't remember exactly but I
think that you what Samsung especially
it likes to do because they have two
major flagship phones is that they get
as much juice as they possibly can out
of the s9 or the Galaxy S launches and
then the note nine or the note launches
are completely separate and they do
their own thing but yeah I think you're
right it's around September when we
would see that so as we're starting to
wind down at the end of the show here we
have the article on CNN of course but
what is everyone's personal wishlist for
the Galaxy S Line yeah like to be able
to afford it
yeah it's I would probably see say the
on screen
fingerprint reader I just like kind of
Miss that aspect of it after I got the
s8 and I think the fingerprint reader is
in a awkward place I still use it but
it's not as good so that would
definitely be appreciated I think that
would make it a much much better phone
if we're really talking about
reimagining the camera I would like for
the phone to also double as a drone
where you can fly around and take photos
of you that was I would actually be very
impressed by that if they did that
nothing we have to say yes here
something
oh wait I'm gonna change my answer to
I'd like the phone to transform into a
toothbrush and brush my teeth because
apparently that's a big imagined as a
toothbrush apparently that's my idea for
all tech now is that it should brush my
teeth I just want to make sure you talk
I just want him to troll everyone the
big unveiling since those things are so
friggin hoity-toity anyways just rolled
out and sick reimagine and they just
hold on a basketball ball is life and it
makes phone calls what about you reg I
was I was gonna say the the phone where
are you my calls yeah I would like can i
dial numbers on it yeah definitely add a
rotary to the camera
lenz whoo I like that idea too isn't
there like an app or a case it doesn't
know or something where you can actually
function as I hate cases that are like
that there's one that like for your
tablet that like it's like a typewriter
like thing sorry that's how much
I hate it we are a live show so we got
them to that one more before we call
today three two one Bluff says will the
s9 iris scanner come to par with face ID
it would be hard I tried the iris
scanner and turned it off almost
immediately it was really poor and maybe
it's because I wear glasses I'm not
really sure but it was similar in in a
sense to like the facial recognition
that it's on the phone but to me seems
pretty yes so they would need like a ton
of cameras to match up with face ID
because what face ID does the
front-facing camera also has these AR
stuff and it plots out all the stuff on
your on your face the iris scanner kind
of takes a photo of your eyes and then
alike it scans that so like I could hold
up a 2d image of like my eyes and hold
over everybody oh yeah that's Alfred
that's not iris scanning yeah sort of I
mean I know you're right but that's
that's what they have so far I think
that is iid right yes it's hopefully
they improve that stuff but I don't
really think that like they're like a
bunch of different ways Samsung yeah
Samsung has disputed this a lot when
I've asked them about it where they'll
say you know you need the perfect
lighting and conditions to do that stuff
but the fact that it's can be done then
why does it exist yeah it's so precious
why does it even bother yeah so I ideal
situations all day yeah but I do know a
lot of people that do use like face idea
and that might be anecdotal again but
it's just I think the function of it is
is like probably some of the best facial
recognition in the industry right now
for a phone at least so I think it'll be
hard to top like face ID all right we'll
say I like what Scott's drumming up in
the chat right now I says maybe Samsung
could have a whole new way to unlock
your phone up at sleeve and that's got
my brain gears turning and we've got
we've used your face we've used your
finger you use numbers letters I kind of
want to have a phone that only opens
when
thrown with such velocity against the
wall that it recognizes my pitch or
that's what I do well if it turns into a
toothbrush and you brush your teeth with
it it could check out your yeah it knows
your dental yeah yeah all right one of
the first Facebook apps not Facebook
sorry iPhone apps that ever came out
where was like launch me or like throw
me to the sky or whatever it was
basically yeah it was like it would use
the the GPS or the accelerometer honor
to see how high you could throw it up in
the air Apple Bandar Tun line launch me
anyways
tell us what you think is a unique new
way to possibly unlock the phone in the
future slide or otherwise yeah blood and
tell us what's on your wish list for the
s9 coming on February 25th stay tuned to
see net to learn more about that as its
coming up and on that note I think it's
about time to bring us home alright the
