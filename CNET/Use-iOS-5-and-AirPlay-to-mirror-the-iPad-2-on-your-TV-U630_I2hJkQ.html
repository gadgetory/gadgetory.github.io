a how-to contributor today I'm going to
show you how to use a really neat
feature that's coming in iOS 5 what it
does is it allows you to mirror your
iPad 2 through your Apple TV using
airplay on to your big-screen TV it's
really neat you're able to do basically
anything you could do on your iPad shows
up on your TV it's gonna come in real
handy for educators as well as those who
want to play games on their on their
big-screen TV and take it off their iPad
let's see how it works all right we're
gonna mirror our iPad to via airplay and
apple TV with iOS 5 both the Apple TV as
well as your iPad 2 need to be run in a
developer preview of iOS 5 in order for
this to work to start we'll go ahead and
double click the home button will see
our app switcher menu pop up and we're
going to scroll over and you'll see the
airplay icon when you tap on that you're
gonna have two options iPad or Apple TV
tap on Apple TV and then turn on
mirroring once that happens your screen
will switch on the TV and whatever you
do on your iPad will also show up in
near-real-time there's a little bit of
lag on your TV through Apple TV so if
you open up the browser a little web
page browse the Internet right on your
TV you're the new reader Edition in iOS
5 and go back to turn it off double
click your home button go back to the
airplay icon and just tap back on iPad
that was just a very brief demonstration
and married your iPad 2 with iOS 5 again
both the iPad as well as Apple TV have
to be running iOS 5 which should be
available later this fall make sure to
