our coverage of CES 27 continues with me
right now is dr. Michael Bruce he's the
sleep tech ambassador
I am also known as the sleep doctor and
today he is going to help us hack our
sleep with some new products here at CES
so you've been around you've seen some
stuff you know how to cut through all
the nonsense do all the stuff that's not
gonna help you sleep but you've got some
things here that you think will do that
so can you explain what you have here
absolutely so working with the National
Sleep Foundation they've had me go
around and look at all of the different
sleep tech right that's out there and
it's pretty impressive some of the stuff
that they've got going on these are
three of my favorite items that are out
there I'm gonna start here and I'm gonna
move my way towards you it okay so I'm
these two items are created by a company
called AI home you're probably very
familiar with AI home they're you know
big into the but the bedside table sure
and what's really interesting is this is
a new unit it's called the Zenergy unit
and so it actually uses light and sound
to not only help you fall asleep but to
help you wake up so this is stuff that
you kind of have you've done a lot of
research on this up isis stuff that is
actually designed to follow a certain
sort of science that'll help you lower
your heart rate exactly so this does not
work is that I feel like when you tell
somebody like oh yeah this alarm clock
is gonna lower your heart rate just play
along with it explain how that were this
is really interesting most people don't
know but you want your heart rate to
lower to about 60 beats per minute in
order to enter into a state of
unconsciousness well if you're sitting
up or even if you're lying down your
heart rate might not be anywhere near
there yeah I think yours might be
actually so what's really interesting if
you notice the light is changing yeah
and so you would breathe in with the
yellow light okay and then you would
breathe out as the red light comes on
and by doing that just that simple
breathing technique your heart rate will
begin to lower lower lower and get you
there and then bring you right into
sleep which is pretty cool there's also
different sounds that can be actually
quite helpful as well we've got ocean
sounds you got nature sounds things like
that that are also very valuable in
terms of relaxation right before sleep
cuz you know we talk about this all the
time on your show but you know sleeps
not an on/off switch it is certainly not
right it's more like pulling your foot
off the gas and slowly putting your foot
on the brake this is an assistant to
doing all of that so for the people who
have a hard time shutting off their mind
which a lot of people do or they're
looking for a way to hack their sleep
and get there quicker this is the type
of unit that I would recommend for
people I'd recommend it to my patients
I've got it in my house things like that
I'm sure it's a lot of fun so now in
addition to the breathing assistance
that it does for I you said there's also
a bunch of like different kind of sounds
that oh there's you into sleep lights
and so the lights are designed so blue
light we know is something that wakes
people up okay and red light is
something that we know that helps people
fall asleep gosh so it turns out that
there are cells in your eye that react
to these different colors or wavelengths
of light blue light actually shuts off
the melatonin faucet well we don't want
that shut off at night but we do want to
shut off during the day so that's why we
get blue in the morning and we get red
in the evening cuz red actually helps
turn the faucet on okay so that's that's
what's pretty interesting about this
it's also obviously got an alarm it's
got a smart wake feature so we can kind
of wake you up at a good time there's a
lot of really cool stuff on yeah there
seems to be an intense amount of
functionality going on and then I really
dig the kind of subtle you know time
just displayed behind the grill there it
looks really cool so now this is going
to go for how much so this is available
right now on amazon $99.99 okay great
okay and now we have a portable portable
version so this is interesting so this
actually won the 2017 CES Innovation
Award okay and so this is a portable
unit as you can see there's you can
attach a cord but it's chargeable sure
and here's what I like about this is I
can toss it into my suitcase yeah and I
can use it when I travel or I can put it
in a child's room I can put it on a crib
something like that it's a really nice
thing and it's got a lot of the similar
functionality to what we've seen here
but much more portable sure type of unit
which I really enjoy quite a Bluetooth
speaker absolutely you can use it as a
Bluetooth speaker like my kids like to
use it as a Bluetooth speaker and then
they throw it in their room so it's kind
of with them all the time
excellent so this is essentially the the
mini version of the larger one and this
is gonna go for how much so this is on
Amazon now for $69.99 okay excellent now
we have a different kind of tech very
different kind of this when you were
explaining this to me in the back I was
a little intimidated to be quite honest
so what we got going on
cool so this is by a company whose name
is ResMed so ResMed is the foremost
leader in CPAP machine so if you
remember people who have sleep apnea
where their throat closes at night they
have to wear a mask and a breathing
machine at night sure that's what this
company does they've been doing it for
28 years they've been in this business
they're an 8 billion dollar market cap
company so they really know and
understand sleep one of the things they
wanted to do is be able to track people
sleep so we've seen a lot of monitors
out there there's one right there's one
on your phone there's one on your wrist
there's one everywhere so one of the
things that we wanted to look at is
contact lists but accurate okay right
because a lot of times if you just have
you know your phone on your bed all it's
doing is looking at accelerometry sure
this actually uses Doppler radar that so
if it's raining in your bedroom this
will be a bill you're not gonna sleep
well without exactly right so what this
does is it actually will shoot out a
radar signal that actually sweeps across
the body and they can actually measure
your chest movement to the millimeter
even under the covers Wow okay that's
and so we're presenting is people
breathe in a particular pattern and
their heart is a particular pattern at
certain sleep stages so we get to the
algorithm of being able to now monitor
sleep and we don't have to have
something attached to me to be able to
do it you can have one on either side of
the bed and then in the morning you get
a sleep score other thing that's kind of
fascinating about this is it also
measures the light in your room
it measures any sound that's in your
room and the temperature in your room
okay so if any of those affect you it
will actually generate advice
the next day based on your personal
sleep where's that advice really coming
from coming from me okay so I actually
even the person who developed the advice
engine behind this and so this is all
from a real sleep specialist so it was
kind of complicated because there's a
lot of different things that can go on
but when we learn certain things about
people sleep at night we can then give
them really applicable device and that's
the big game-changer here because
there's a lot of monitors and some of
them you know are very very accurate but
at the end of the day they don't do a
whole lot for you other than well I got
13% of REM sleep well what the heck does
that mean what do i do what do I do with
that that's where this comes in as the
advice engine also by the way I forgot
to mention over here that these are all
fully controllable with a nap okay so
you can actually monitor and do all that
stuff just hop you know Helicon
exactly excellent all right so something
dr. Bruce and I do together when we do
podcasts is turn to the audience for
questions about sleep advice absolutely
so no pressure if you have a question
about sleep sleeps important I don't get
it enough of it but if you do have a
question about sleep raise your hand
we'll come over and give you a
microphone don't worry I have a few that
I've gotten I'm gonna warn everybody
I don't do dream interpretation yeah
that's something everyone always so good
health at right away so I'm just gonna
dispel that myth right here right now
okay
first question from Twitter what should
people say what kind of food should
people stay away from before bedtime
okay this is a great question so there's
foods that are pro sleep and there are
foods that are anti sleep if you will
obviously anything with caffeine in it
is probably not what you want you have
before feed before bed no brain right
although I've got patients who turn to
me all the time and they say hey dr.
Bruce you know I just had a triple
espresso and then I went four straight
to sleep yeah they're not they're not
human well they might that's possible
right but the truth the matter is is
that they don't realize it but the
quality of the sleep that they're
getting is really not that great sure so
that in and of itself is a pretty more
isn't trying right exactly trying to use
the iHome machine is something that it
could be very difficult if you're having
a lot of coffee turns out spicy food can
actually cause indigestion and that
indigestion turns out can affect your
dreams that's the part that's
interesting
so so when people have like high spiced
foods and things that are upsetting in
their stomach it can actually manifest
itself in their dream state okay it can
be a little on the scary side so you
just have like the attack of like a
chili pepper
I heard we have a question from the
audience let's get to that Thank You
Suri brave soul over here absolutely
never Britt
oh is that on hello okay hi so I'm
curious about sleeping and the apnea
when it's just before because one of the
challenges is how do you know you're
having it
how can you sense it because with sleep
apnea you've already been diagnosed and
you have that whole gear set up right is
there any way to check it out beforehand
is there any like this device would that
support it or is there any other
solution that we might use
it's great question so first of all
historically we used to know that you'd
have to go to a sleep laboratory and you
know
twenty-seven electrodes attached to you
and wires and cameras and all that kind
of stuff
now technology's actually advanced a
week we actually have home kits that are
very very small almost the size of this
unit now these units are these are not
diagnostic units these are not medical
grade units but there are ones out there
that your doctor can actually send home
with you and number one see do you still
have sleep apnea let's say you lost
weight or using a new treatment number
two they can also see how your disease
progressed so there are some difference
because that can happen so there are
some things that are out there from a
technology standpoint that where we can
assess sleep apnea but they're not
necessarily on the consumer side they're
much more on the medical side excellent
I think we have another question in the
audience yes yes sorry I just with
regards to maybe you can dispel dispel
any rumors with screen time before we go
to bed like when you should I read on a
tablet or watch TV on a tablet or and I
want to go to sleep and my mind's racing
got it I is there any sort of like rules
as to how this is a great question so
thanks for asking it so we get this
question all the time so one of the
things that we know is lots of people
are on their phone right before
lights-out who could that be
and or on the iPad or watching Game of
Thrones or playing candy crush or
whatever game like that's probably not
be surprised how many people do so
here's the thing is television which is
from a proximity standpoint is all the
way across the room is it necessarily as
bad now I'm probably the only sleep
doctor in the universe that says it's
okay to fall asleep with the TV on
and I'll tell you why because I do
alright so if I'm gonna be this like dog
I better follow my own advice right so
what I find is it's hard to turn off my
brain at night but if I'm listening to
the television usually when people are
watching TV to fall asleep their eyes
are closed and they're just kind of
listening and it's just enough of a
distraction to make it so that it's not
I'm distracting my brain from what it
would normally keep me awake that's a
proximity issue and and an engagement
issue but if I'm on my phone and I'm
looking at Facebook I'm reading an email
that has an emotion ality to me that's
not a great idea right also the
proximity it's like 18 24 inches from my
face and so the blue light 460
nanometers is the blue wavelength that
actually hits particular cells in your
eye
that can turn on or off the melatonin
faucet like we were talking about before
so you want to avoid screens that are
close to you probably about between 45
and 60 minutes before lights out and
just to piggyback on that if I could you
may I find 80s comedies are the best
thing to fall asleep
that's better than sign building fall
asleep and you just don't want to really
engage in something you just want to be
able to like have Tom Hanks in the
background like falling into like
buddies yes and that really does the
trip Oh trick and one other thing that
would address that issue as well is um
there are now blue blocker glasses so
and and they're fairly stylish fairly
comfortable you can actually wear these
glasses while you have in your device so
if you're just tethered to your device
and you have to do it even though again
it's not my recommendation I know it's
gonna happen these blue blockers will
actually block that blue wavelength of
light and it actually reduces eyestrain
and and so I was like really come on
does this really work and I started
using them I was shocked at first of all
how much more relaxed I just felt
walking around my house because we have
all this bright bright light in our
homes and that's really not how our body
is designed to have that because you
know used to be you'd fall asleep when
the Sun went down right way back in the
day now we don't have that so these blue
blocker glasses can actually be quite
effective pretty cool do we have one
more from the audience I think yes
actually yes Oh Oh excellent
do you have any suggestions besides
drugs for PTSD nightmares
absolutely so when we look at so PTSD is
you know first of all it's prevalent
it's very very prevalent and it's not
just in our veterans or people have been
in active theater for it's in our police
it's in our fire it's in traumatic
traumatic times you're involved in
something traumatic so the answer to the
question is yes now when you look at
nightmares there is one drug that's
actually been shown to work for
nightmares for PTSD in particular the
drug is called prazosin it's an old-line
antidepressant but I know we're looking
for things that are not drug related so
when you're looking at nightmares one of
the things I like to talk to about
people is there is a treatment that's
out of bye-bye by a guy by the name of
Barry Krakow out of the University of
New Mexico and what he's done is he has
you write out your entire nightmare
every detail you can imagine and then
change the ending so that it's no longer
that you're being pursued but you're
pursue
them and then you read this new
nightmare if you will with the new
ending multiple times before you go to
sleep within seven to ten days it
actually starts to change in your dreams
which is quite fascinating and so it's a
really nice way of not having to add a
pharmaceutical to that situation and be
able to use more of a behavioral
methodology um there's a little bit of
data looking at cannabis and the use of
cannabis for nightmares for PTSD as well
interesting all right I want to finish
things up with few more things that you
and I have talked about a bunch a lot of
people are curious about the effects of
snoring uh-huh like is snoring
it's obviously annoying but is snoring
can it damage can it do damage to you is
it is it something that you know can
lead to something else
absolutely so when we look at snoring so
when we think about breathing we should
think about it across the spectrum so
there's regular breathing and then comes
snoring then calls it comes these things
called hypopneas so not quite a complete
stoppage of breathing and then apneas
which is complete cessation of breath so
snoring is part of that continuum and so
if you're snoring on a regular basis you
could be walking down a bit of a
dangerous path when it comes to apnea
now just to be really honest with
everybody roughly 50% of America snores
but only about 10 to 12 percent have
sleep apnea so not everybody that snores
has sleep apnea but everybody that has
sleep apnea
snores right right so it's a two-way
street but the traffic's not the same on
either side and also we know that when
people are lying next to a snoring bed
partner they lose approximately one hour
of sleep a night
right it's a selfish thing finally we're
here at CES I've taken this advice from
you at the show this year actually want
to bring it up before we have to say
goodbye yep explain how somebody can
really turn a mini nap into something
way more get a lot out of that with
something you call a nap a latte so this
is one of my favorite sleep hacks out
there and I call it the Napa latte and
so what you do is let's say that you
only got four and a half five hours of
sleep the night before you know your
body needs more or two or let's hope not
right so what you do is you take a cup
six ounce cup of black drip coffee that
has the highest caffeine content in it
okay throw in a couple of ice cubes to
cool it down drink the entire thing as
quickly as
you can and then take about a 2025
minute nap you will actually reduce the
amount of stage 1 stage 2 sleep that
your body is craving the caffeine kicks
in you're good for four hours I to the
moon
take my advice thank you so much for
being here doctor it's always a pleasure
sleep doctor ladies and gentlemen thank
you so much man fantastic advice thank
you right now we're gonna take a break
when we come back we will be featuring
the best new tech for business
professionals so stay tuned we'll be
right back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
