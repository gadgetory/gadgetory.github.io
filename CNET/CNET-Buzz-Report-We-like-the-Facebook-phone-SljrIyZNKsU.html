buzz report the show about the tech news
that everyone is talking about this week
androids on TV your shilling for
facebook and the booger heard round the
world but first it's the gauge of the
week the gadget of the week is the
facebook phone maybe rumor has it that
HTC will launch to Facebook branded
phones running android at Mobile World
Congress in Barcelona next month neither
HTC nor Facebook is commenting on the
rumor but unnamed sources say the phones
will be decked out in facebook blue and
they'll integrate with your facebook
contacts and show status updates on the
home screen so now you'll be able to see
exactly when your friends post their
CityVille development updates and you
can call them and tell them to please
stop it was not interesting with
farmville and it is not interesting now
and now for the news Eric Schmidt
stepped down as CEO of Google last week
as you know since then the tech world
has been abuzz with news of his 100
million dollar stepped down payout it
plans to sell 334 million dollars worth
of Google stock and the fact that
apparently he shot a TV pilot for CNN
that by all accounts was a disaster no
real surprise there actually though with
that kind of cash and Hollywood
aspirations Eric Schmidt's dream does
not have to end in fact maybe we could
call the casting directors for the real
rich white guys of Silicon Valley
the real rich white guys of Silicon
Valley every thursday at nine eight
central only by Bravo watch what happens
moving on in the news the Department of
Justice is hinting around again at a law
to make ISPs keep records of user
activity users means you and justice is
being disturbingly vague about what
information how long is PS would have to
keep it and how it might be used to help
criminal investigations in previous
years the DOJ has suggested saving data
for a minimum of six months and up to
two years best case they would just save
IP addresses worst case they'd save the
emails IMS SMS search history and IP
addresses of everyone in America what
could possibly be wrong with that not
cool alright a couple of quick tech
headlines from the week cnet best of CES
winner the motorola xoom is reportedly
launching at best buy stores februari
17th for 699 dollars ok now that price
isn't actually that high compared to an
ipad with the same memory it's actually
better considering the hdmi flash
support dual core processor and dual
cameras but it's still causing major
sticker shock with everyone who hears it
point ipad we'll see but here come the
tablet wars egypt is reportedly blocking
access to twitter and maybe facebook in
an effort to quell demonstrations
against government corruption good try
guys but the internet always finds away
and I know you were worried but the Pope
has issued a statement saying that
Facebook and social networking are not a
sin not the actual act of using the
sites anyway just probably everything
you say and post on any given day
speaking of Facebook everybody's
favorite privacy violator just rolled
out sponsored stories it takes your
likes and interests and turns them into
ads for the things that you liked it's
kind of like they're selling your
content to advertisers not your personal
information just your content oh and you
can't opt out of it you're just a little
unpaid ad generating mule what are you
complaining about Facebook is free all
right now let's take a look at what's
clogging the tubes this week youtube was
loving this classic moment from the AFC
championship game between the Jets and
the Steelers the moment when cameras
caught Jets quarterback mark sanchez
picking his nose and wiping a booger on
teammate Mark Brunell no really check it
out got one here again today it was
quarterbacks leg stay well enough to
bloody perform now Sanchez told ESPN
radio it was a fake wipe but I am not
buying it let's review the play you can
see his setup is perfect here he goes in
hard with the booger blitz steps back to
throw and his delivery is right on the
money let's see that again there yep no
booth review necessary that is a score
the defense had never had a chance o our
show nothing but class and that's the
buzz report for this week everyone I'm
Molly wood and thank you for watching
hi I'm Molly where I stepped on my card
they're being disturbingly vague about
what information they want how long I
let me just I don't know where I'm going
to that word salad</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
