I'm here to speak with why tricity CEO
Alex cruisin on his company's wireless
charging technology so the basic
principle is that you have a resonator
operating at a certain frequency and
that if you build a receiver that has a
resonator in it tuned to the same
frequency you keep them in tune as you
come in the presence of the source the
power source power is transferred and
what's unique about this you know
there's been many approaches it
inductive charging which needs you know
for induction you need two coils that
are perfectly matched it's kind of like
my electric toothbrush or even Chi
phones with magnetic resonance you get
this positional flexibility you get to
operate at a distance you can have one
power source and multiple receivers the
same principle all it does is it just
draws more power right now almost no
power is being consumed now it's been
transferred to the receiver it also goes
through materials
I've been embedded in a table I think
that you know a desk and concrete
asphalt for charging an electric car
also goes you know through human body so
we have a very interesting business in
implantable medical devices it's a whole
new field of bio electronics so you
could imagine charging surface now with
multiple devices you just toss them on
and they start charging and that was why
Theresa tease Alex cruisin now hopefully
the wireless charging technology will
make its way soon to rebels or even our
homes
