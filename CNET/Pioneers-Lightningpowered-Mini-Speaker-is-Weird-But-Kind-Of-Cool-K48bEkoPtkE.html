being billed as the first lightning
powered speaker aimed at digital nomads
the speaker plugs directly into the
Lightning port of your iPhone or iOS
device and it's instantly powered on no
battery required it's designed to be a
mini business grade speakerphone but
also plays music and outputs the sound
from your video content the single
button on the speaker serves as a mute
button during phone calls or a pause
play button while listening to music or
videos there's also a pass-through
lightning port that allows you to charge
your phone while the speaker is on
speaker software can be upgraded through
a free companion app and there's a noise
reduction feature that filters out
background noise while you're making
calls a speaker does use some battery
from your phone to power itself but it's
not a huge strain on your battery the
speaker does sound louder and fuller
than your phone speakers and while it
doesn't sound terrible for music
listening it's really tuned for people's
voices so its strongest in the mid-range
and has little in the way of bass it
does excel as a speakerphone for making
voice and video calls and that's where
its value lies however the only issue I
have with it is it's $100 price point
it's pretty steep makes more sense at
around 50 dollars but it's new to the
market so we'll see how things shake out
I'm David carnivore c-calm thanks for
