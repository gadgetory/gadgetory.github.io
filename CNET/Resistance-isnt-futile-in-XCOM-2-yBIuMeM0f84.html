command of an elite international
organization with one objective defend
the Earth from alien invasion spoiler
alert they failed XCOM 2 picks up 20
years later with you leading the
resistance against the occupying alien
force like its predecessor XCOM 2 is a
tense turn-based strategy game based on
careful positioning keeping your
soldiers alive and lining up those
perfect shots overwatch is back and
better than ever letting your troops lie
in wait and attacking enemies
unfortunate enough to cross into their
line of fire when paired with the new
concealment ability that lets your squad
secretly maneuver into position and
gives the guerrillas a much-needed
element of surprise before reigning
incredibly satisfying death on their
targets packing you can put guys in
position and get the advantage on the
aliens and do ambushes you are the
aggressor and not the defender and
you've got no choice but to take the
fight to the enemy because they've got
secret plans of their own so the aliens
have their own victory conditions like
they're looking for they may be hunting
the Avenger right they may be building
facilities they're doing all sorts of
different things and all these little
projects where the aliens are actually
trying to get the jump on you they're
trying to achieve victory and they're
racing time just like the player is and
the new customization options really let
you bring your ragtag band of rebels to
life there are now hundreds of ways to
customize your troops from tattoos to
hats to nose rings you can even
personalize your squad weapons and armor
with modifications decals and custom
names XCOM 2 is out for pc and mac on
February 5 2016 I'm Luke Lancaster and
