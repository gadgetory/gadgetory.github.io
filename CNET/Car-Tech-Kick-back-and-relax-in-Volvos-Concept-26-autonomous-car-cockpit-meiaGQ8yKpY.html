concept car a new model at the LA Auto
Show and well they brought us part of
one this is their concept 26 and what's
very cool about it is that it's a
concept cockpit that shows us what's
gonna happen when the car start driving
themselves what are our role as the
driver gonna be it's got three different
modes the first mode that we see right
here is the drive mode if your
traditional hands on the steering wheel
upright feeding position from here
you'll be in control of the car you'll
do all the driving we've got the
vertical census infotainment system
right here on the center console it's
just like your typical s.p.a platform
Volvo vehicle right now now on the
steering wheel we've got two paddles
that allow you to enter the autopilot
mode so you pull those two paddles the
car goes into its autonomous mode and
the seat slides back the since this
infotainment system is on the center
console so it moves with the driver so
you don't really have to reach for it
and as you see right here this large 25
inch color display flips out because the
car is in autonomous mode you're now
free to do some work or browse the media
the seating position is a little bit
more laid-back and relaxed and you're
moved away from the steering wheel and
it's sort of four tracks into the
instrument cluster the third mode is
going to be the relaxed mode and that's
gonna be when you just want to kick back
and let the car do its own thing while
you relax the seat goes into a very very
laid-back seating position we got this
little Ottoman that slides out and the
25 inch display hides itself from here
you can relax while the car drives
itself when you're ready to take control
you just grab those paddles and the car
gives you back control now what happens
if you're kicking it and relaxing and
something happens well the autonomous
system should be smart enough that it'll
be able to pull the vehicle over to a
safe stopping location until you can get
the seat back into the upright position
to take control of the car now this is
conceptually based on Volvo's Bob
platform so theoretically it could be in
vehicles as soon as they're ready for
the autonomous driving to catch up to
the technology
