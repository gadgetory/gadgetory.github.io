launched a pair of smartphone controlled
toy robots called mini drones the line
proved to be enough of a success the
parrot is back this year with five new
models for the sky land and water
starting with the sky there are two new
quad copters the airborne knight and
cargo the knight has built-in LED lights
that blink and flash at your command and
help you fly in the dark the cargo has a
base plate on top with six lego-like
studs for attaching figures or bricks
then on the ground you'll find the
jumping knight and jumping race like the
airborne Knight the jumping knight has
built-in LEDs so you can roll around in
the dark the race is capable of reaching
speeds up to eight miles per hour
doubling the Knights top speed the
jumping part of the name comes from a
rear spring-loaded leg that when
retracted and released launches it up to
two and a half feet into the air for
zipping across the water parrot created
a hydrofoil mount the included
quadcopter on top to a hinged mechanism
and spin up the props and it pushes the
hydrofoil across the water
you can also detach the quadcopter and
fly it around all of the mini drones are
controlled with a smartphone or tablet
using parrots free flight 3 app and
while cameras tend to be a big component
of consumer drones that's not the case
here only the jumping models can record
video in only at VGA resolution the quad
copters can take photos from a camera on
their bottoms
but again in VGA resolution only also as
was the case with last year's models
battery life isn't great at only up to
nine minutes for the quad copters seven
minutes when pushing the hydrofoil or 20
minutes for the jumping models prices
range from $99 up to a hundred and
eighty nine dollars and while there's no
exact release date yet parrot says
they'll be in stores this fall I'm Josh
Goldman with CNET and that's a quick
look at parents new mini drones for 2015
