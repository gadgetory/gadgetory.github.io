it's the xperia x z-bone
it's got loads of camera technology
onboard some of that tech is brought on
from older phones and some of its new
but let's take a look of what's inside
it around the back that's a 23 megapixel
camera while on the front that's a 13
megapixel camera now those are very big
sensors but there's a lot more going on
here
the starters sony hopes that this thing
will take a photo very very quickly so
you're not hanging around and missing
the moment the company reckons that
you'll be able to take a photo in naught
point 6 seconds now we're only getting a
brief hands-on here but I have to say
that it does feel pretty fast when it
comes to hammering that shutter button
there's no point in taking a photo
quickly if that photo is then really
blurry and looks rubbish so there's some
interesting focus technology going on
here as well vs. laser autofocus that's
something that we have seen before in
smartphones what that's basically doing
is sending out a beam of light to try
and very accurately gauge the distance
between your phone and the subject the
thinking is that that's going to lead to
better low-light photography now
something that's pretty interesting is
what's only calls predictive hybrid
autofocus now what that does is it lets
the phone actually track objects you can
see here I'm tapping on an object and
the phone is monitoring whereabouts it
is in the frame even if it's moving
towards or away from the phone now the
idea there is that the phone can make a
best guess at where exactly the subject
is going to be when you actually hammer
down that shutter button we were playing
around taking some photos using that
technology of these moving toy trains
here and they were looking pretty crisp
even though the trains were moving not
perfect but not paps finally if you'd
rather take matters into your own hands
something I like is that Sony's added
manual focus so using this on-screen
dial here you can control exactly what's
sharp and what's blurring the ex-head
also comes with an RGB Cir center now
what sony says is that that's going to
make for better color reproduction it's
going to let the phone do a better job
of gauging white balance and overall
what you'll get a more accurate hues
there's 4k video recording in play as
well and Sony's touting this as the
first phone with five axis image
stabilization
we've only been playing around with it
again for a few minutes but I have to
say that some of the moving footage we
got just looking really quite smooth
when we played it back
so some interesting promising camera
ideas in here but of course we won't
know the full story until we get it into
our labs for the full review where we
can really really put it through its
paces so stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
