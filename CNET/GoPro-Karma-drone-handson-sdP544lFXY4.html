from gopro as you can see it's a fairly
compact design it is designed to fold up
and fit into a backpack which is
actually included at the front you'll
see there is a stabilizer unit built
into the 3 axis gimbal and that's used
to stabilize your GoPro camera that you
can put in the front it's compatible
with either this Hero 4 or the brand new
recently announced Hero 5 minutes it's
in the front lights so you can actually
remove the handheld stabilizer with
something like this and then you can use
it to keep pretty steady to move
handheld shots with your GoPro and it
doesn't necessarily need to be on the
touring when you're feeling so the drone
also comes with this gang in the lake
controller so it has a touchscreen in it
you don't need an actual extra point or
tablet in order to control the drone
there are a couple of joysticks on there
too and some controls there that you can
the poem says it's pretty easy to fly
for beginners and it should be very
simple using kind of similar smartphone
based controllers that you are used to
so you can fly it easily the drone comes
with a backpack is stabilizer itself and
you cost seven hundred and ninety nine
dollars but if you want to add a session
camera to it it will cost nine hundred
and ninety nine dollars in the package
and then 1099 or 1099 dollars with the
zero five relax edition but stay tuned
to see net we are going to test this out
and see what it looks like here at the
GoPro launch event in Tahoe in
California</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
