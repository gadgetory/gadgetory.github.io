welcome to the apple pie for all the
good and bad inside the world of Apple
plus our JBL poles giveaway winners and
you don't want to miss that so let's get
to the show in Apple's biggest rival
Samsung just revealed the galaxy s5 but
let's be honest it kind of feels like a
galaxy s4 s now the screen gets a slight
bump in size at 5.1 inches it brings a
fingerprint scanner this time around and
a heart rate scanner placed on the back
side under its improved camera its body
retains an almost identical plastic
design but this time the back looks more
like a band-aid than it does a phone
samsung fans overall had lukewarm
reactions after expecting the next big
thing but Samsung really left an opening
for other android phones and the iphone
to get back that psychological edge and
consumer minds that Samsung's really had
for the past year now they're here to
watch was nothing to write home about
and their gear fit their coolest piece
of hardware really should have been the
new gear SmartWatch instead of a fitness
band and a user interface that can only
be used horizontally which is pretty
uncomfortable for anyone with a neck now
I'm still not even sold on the idea of a
SmartWatch yet but without even seeing
what Cupertino is cooking you almost
have to give the big a and edged out of
the gates now even if they just do with
this concept video from Todd Hamilton
does they'll already be ahead also this
week the big bad apple news was a
security vulnerability known as go to
fail which allowed an attacker on the
same network to capture or modify data
transfer from Safari mail iCloud and
other Apple apps that we're supposed to
be securely encrypted pretty much
everything you do on an Apple device now
Apple released patches for iOS 6 and iOS
7 first but then still left desktop and
laptop users vulnerable until the most
recent 10.9 point to update now
everything has been patched up to our
knowledge but this affects iphones ipads
and macs so if you haven't already you
need to run these updates on all your
devices also in some iOS 7 use apples
pushing for wider ibeacon adoption it's
their location sensing technology that
delivers information when a user is
within 100 feet of an ibeacon now can
provide anything from
indoor navigation of a store to product
information or relevant promotions or
discounts apple recently released
specification requirements under the
made for iphone program for third party
companies looking to incorporate the
technology Apple has rolled out its tech
at its US retail stores and macy's
flagship store in New York is running a
pilot test as well now Major League
Baseball has installed ibeacons in
Dodger Stadium mm-hmm and petco park to
deliver ballpark information and points
of interest and plans to rolled out in
over 20 ballparks before the 2014 opener
in March now a lot of you have been
asking me about when we'll see a legit
standalone controller for iOS devices
it's coming soon with the recent mad
catz announcement for their iOS 7
controller called control I that will
release an April for around eighty
dollars bringing what they call a
premium experience to iOS now it's a
Bluetooth controller so you can either
mount an iphone or ipod touch to it or
use it separately with an ipad it uses
to triple-a batteries and will provide
about 50 hours of gameplay alright guys
so the quick bytes The Hollywood
Reporter says the social network
director David Fincher is in talk to a
Sony to direct the Aaron Sorkin scripted
Steve Jobs biopic now Sorkin completed
the script last month and it's supposed
to take place across three 30-minute
scenes at three different Steve Jobs
keynotes based on the Walter Isaacson
biography now you know fincher and
Sorkin would be the perfect team to make
this happen I mean did you see the
social network they made a movie about
facebook it won three Academy Awards it
was nominated for best picture and best
director in 2010 as well now think about
it it was about Facebook so make it
happen Sony now apple recently released
an update for iTunes with bug fixes and
compatibility improvements so get on
that but even cooler if you use iTunes
radio upcoming albums from Pharrell Rick
Ross and Lea Michele are also available
to listen to in their entirety before
they're even released so you guys can
just check it out on iTunes radio in the
featured stations and the WWE announced
their WWE Network that's available as a
channel on the Apple TV and is also
available in their own iOS app it will
give you full access to pay-per-view
events like WrestleMania replays of
classic matches and
original programming it's 59 99 for six
months which is basically the price of
one pay-per-view event and you know how
WWE fans feel about this all right it's
time to announce our winners for the JBL
pulse bluetooth speaker giveaway I told
you it wouldn't be easy and we had over
1,500 submissions so we asked you guys
how many times did I sing me in the
warm-ups and then add that to the number
of pipes I personally flew through in
flappy bird and for all you that were
wondering the correct answer is 29-27
out of 27 be easy and I flew through two
pipes all though some of you said it was
actually four because the pipes were
separate which is a good point but I'm
going with 29 so congrats go to our
twitter winners Lanita and stanley wong
but i'm sorry Brian Kadena who actually
did the correct math but wrote the wrong
number and on email kevin ruddy who
asked me not to give him the one I had
in my pants so don't worry you're all
getting brand new ones congrats again
and we'll be in touch all right that's
going to do for this week's show email
us at the apple byte at cnet com or just
tweet me at brian Tong and i'll answer
when i can thanks for watching we'll
catch you guys next week for another
bite of the Apple
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
