week's biggest tech rumors and you can
vote on what you think about the rumors
too in the interactive player if you're
watching on cnet this week everything is
getting bigger and the next iPhone could
want your fingerprints on the screen on
purpose let's get started first up
according to the verge nokia is eyeing a
launch date later this year for a six
inch Windows Phone the big phone
codenamed bandit will be powered by a
Qualcomm Snapdragon quad-core processor
and it will offer a 1080p display with a
polycarbonate body and a 20 megapixel
rear camera six inches is heading into
phablet territory and is slowly creeping
into tablet territory but it's not
unheard of just this week samsung
announced that the 6.3 inch samsung
galaxy mega was going to get a u.s.
rollout beginning on friday but this
would be the first windows phone phablet
so why not i say go for it nokia build
your little heart out samsung could use
some competition next some leaked photos
point to the next iphone having a
fingerprint reader people started
talking about this feature last year
when apple acquired fingerprint
recognition chipmaker authentic the talk
ramped up again last month when a beta
tester discovered biometric scanner code
in one of the iOS 7 builds the blog
laptop reports that photos leaked of the
inside of the alleged iphone 5s show
support for fingerprint scanning
hardware the pictures look like nothing
much to the untrained eye but according
to laptop there's a redesign metal
spacer cushion near the home button that
has extra room to accommodate additional
components and that could be the elusive
fingerprint reader I guess we'll see
next month but i'd rather have NFC than
a fingerprint reader what do you guys
think and finally and other make it
bigger news according to the korea
economic daily samsung is working on a
12 inch tablet that will be released in
october the report is very brief because
all it really says Samsung's current
biggest tablet is 11.6 inches and
according to a wall street journal
article from last month Apple may also
be testing larger screens could this be
a new trend what do you guys think how
big is too big what is your tablet sweet
spot don't forget to vote and leave a
comment and ask the scenic council what
it thinks the cnet council is composed
of five editors who cast their votes
anonymously their opinions are not an
endorsement by cnet or CBS Interactive
obviously because these are rumors folks
and the cnet council's verdict is yes
they do think that Samsung is working on
a 12 inch tablet because as one editor
says they're working on every size
tablet pets are show everybody share
