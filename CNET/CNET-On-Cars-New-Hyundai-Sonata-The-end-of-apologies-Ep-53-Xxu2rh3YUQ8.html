the apologies hypermiling not just for
hybrid heads anymore
and the top 5 distracting in-car
interfaces time to check the tech
we see cars differently we love them on
the road and under the hood but also
check the tech and are known for telling
it like it is ugly is included at no
extra cost
the good the bad the bottom line this is
C net on cars
welcome to C net on cars the show all
about high-tech cars and modern driving
i'm brian coulis Hyundai's been making
great cars for a number of years now but
you still had to explain your choice
that may be changing with the 2015
Sonata a heavily revised model that
plays into the heart of the best-selling
cars in Auto dump let's drive this
all-new version and check the tech
sometimes when you want a major hit in
the auto business you don't have to be
hot looking or super fast or anything
superlative you just have to be a nice
car let's see how they all new heavily
revised 2015 Hyundai Sonata goes after
that bull's eye do they hit it now the
Sonata as you may recall got serious in
the market with the 2009 model all of a
sudden it became a real threat to Camry
accord Fusion and the rest but it always
had this unfortunate Hyundai trait of
looking a little bit ornamented shall we
say just not a handsome car that's
changed now and that's the big story on
the outside of the new Sonata refined
more urban lines now call your attention
to a couple of exterior features first
of all the panoramic roof which is
optional even on this limited trim
there's one bar in the middle but it
opens up a lot of sky and an interesting
take on the trunk just walk up to the
rear of the car with the key in your
pocket and stand there for three seconds
and the trunk opens automatically
if you don't recall what the previous
Sonata look like here's a look now
here's what we have today this is
completely different kind of Teutonic
it's got a little bit of an Audi layout
to it it's clean it's handsome it's
modern its angular that theme continues
now our cards pretty loaded up is a
limited with almost every ox in the CNET
style navigation system as you see here
Hyundai's always did a pretty good clean
job of that and they've tended to have
the fastest touchscreen response in the
industry by a big margin I'm afraid to
report that that's a little bit muted
now it's just you wouldn't notice it
watching me on camera here but I can
tell you shut up
just little milliseconds little
heartbeats worth of difference or
happening now when you touch the screen
I will say this when your navigation
mode it's got a new I believe split
screen option plus auto zoom and a lot
of things going on makes it kind of busy
your standard audio is going to be iPod
and USB and aux jack all down here in
this new and large bin Sirius XM and
standard and bluetooth streaming are
also standard HD radio and more comes at
an optional level which includes our
navigation that we've got in here now
check this out you don't recognize that
little orange icon right there that
sound hound let's say I'm listening to
something on a station that doesn't do a
good job of putting those RDS tags on
the screen so I can hit the sound hound
button and it's going to listen to the
broadcast for certain amount of seconds
here get a nice sample figures out what
it is pulls it right up on the screen
and it's a really cool tool to have in
the car where you don't want to be
fumbling with your app on your phone to
do the same thing you can mark it as a
favorite go back later figure out what
it is there is something as advanced as
an online buying store for the track
just yet but maybe it's a matter of time
this car also supports Siri eyes free
with your iPhone and later in this model
years run in 2015 they'll also support
apple carplay they're one of the early
adopters on that another interesting
feature especially for a popularly
priced car you've got start/stop and
replay on satellite radio at 22 minute
buffer here to let you capture and go
back install the blue link telematics
app and you get a wide array of sort of
auto remote control functions and most
importantly you can get a live online
search utility that can tie into the
cars navigation system there's also
remote start via the app with the
interesting wrinkle of a delay timer of
1 to 10 minutes
now under the hood all sonatas continue
on as four cylinders only this or the
2-liter turbo sport that's a different
video here we have an interesting story
the horsepower and torque have come down
a little bit to 185 horse and 178
pound-feet of torque down 5 and 1
respectively
but what Hyundai says they've done is
move the responsiveness lower in the rpm
band where real people drive not revving
their car out to a yellow or red line
but loafing along the numbers changed a
bit as they did that these guys are all
front-wheel drive and go out through a
6-speed automatic with a little shift
gate but there are no paddles on the
wheel you've got some drive modes sport
eco and normal very straightforward 0 to
60 happens in 8.1 seconds a car the way
it's about 3400 pounds but delivering
quite good fuel economy
24:35 you're not seeing any turbos no
brake energy regeneration no
electrification of any kind though auto
start-stop pretty straightforward
powertrain but gets it done now that
whole theorem about just be a nice car
really is where the sonata prints on the
road its overall quietness and ride
quality are really exemplary the power
band is used for I want it to be the
transmission is unobtrusive it never
leaves the car flat-footed when you need
power there's a meaningful difference
between eco normal and sport the
steering is surprisingly heavy for a car
made today of many cars have over
assisted very light steering I think
it's part of giving the car a feeling of
more mass and more quality to the driver
now the driver assist technologies are
primarily passive the one exception is
your active cruise control which will go
all the way down to a full stop of the
tone braking and back up to full freeway
speed should conditions warrant what's
interesting is what they've done with
the blind spot technology here it's a
little more um contemplative if you will
when you have that
and it indicates that you do a turn with
your stalk here it's going to read not
just where cars are so if a car off your
side is closing rapidly I'll have a
different sensitivity toward warning
than if it's not okay let's price our
2015 Sonata this heavily revised version
we have a limited which is a really good
place to start
27:3 with destination but there are two
chunky options you've got to go for
packages they really take it seen that
style one as you can imagine is called
the tech package that's 3500 bucks with
a panoramic roof the 8 inch nav screen
xenon high-intensity discharge
headlights HD radio with infinity sound
backing it up a heated steering wheel
and ventilated seats and the ultimate
package for the lower 1500 is a lot of
your smart driving stuff adaptive cruise
lane departure warning forward collision
warning automatic high beams and Ritter
park sensors on top of the already
existing rear camera all in about 32 for
recei net style Sonata Limited the other
one you want to look at however is the
Sport 2.0 T smaller but turbocharged
engine more power roar to your
performance in fact they think it'll be
their biggest seller among all the
sonatas bottom line is this is the
Sonata that should end excuses for
buying a Hyundai this is an outstanding
car in the top-tier with all the other
big boys don't forget they got a hell of
a warranty five years 60,000 mile
bumper-to-bumper and 10 100 powertrain
we don't normally talk about warranties
but this one is so outstanding it's
worth a mention
find our full take on the new 15 sonata
at carzy Netcom where you can also look
up our latest reviews on the cars that
want to knock its block off like fusion
camry accord and ultima among the flurry
of recent recalls one transcends make or
model the airbag recall that can turn
safety tech into a hazard facing you
square in the face is that your car will
tell you how to find out when we come
back
7.8 million cars on us roads have an
airbag made by Takata corporation they
can explode when activated rather than
deploying properly and sometimes a metal
piece will be thrown out like a piece of
shrapnel the company blames moisture
during manufacture and in the cars
driving environment from making the
igniter and propellant unstable now to
find out if your car is one of the 54
models of one of these airbags go to
safercar.gov or call the hotline at
Triple Eight three to seven or two three
six have your cars VIN number handy know
that you cannot deactivate a driver's
side airbag but your dealer may tell you
to cease carrying passengers in the
front seat of an affected car until the
airbag is replaced it pays to double
check if your car has an airbag with a
potentially explosive problem welcome
back to see net on cars coming to you
from our home at the Mount Tam Motor
Club just north of the Golden Gate
Bridge well if you've ever heard the
term hypermiling I bet you heard it from
a Prius owner possibly a fanatic Prius
owner they get some amazing real-world
MPGs not by modifying their car but by
modifying their own driving behavior
which means it's transferable to any car
makes for a miserly how to segment you
can put to use today
hypermiling could also be called
momentum conservation because that's the
core of what you're doing
it starts with mechanical techniques
make sure you're at full or even upper
pressure on your tires consider using a
lower weight approved motor oil to
reduce drag on the engine park in the
shade and maintain the gasket on your
fuel cap to reduce fuel evaporation use
a narrower but approved sized tire
instead of the widest approved one no
idle roof racks cargo holders bike racks
or kayaks that ruin aerodynamics some
folks even gas up often and only as much
as needed to reduce weight and it
probably won't hurt to go on a diet and
reduce your own weight then there are
the driving techniques here's where you
get to the core of it modulating your
momentum another way to put it is to use
the brake and the accelerator pedal as
little as possible look down the field
as you're driving and don't go so fast
that you know you're gonna have to
needlessly brake up there that turns
precious gas into brake dust and heat
even cars with regenerative braking
throw away energy when you slow down
with the brakes and how do you replace
that energy by burning more gas so seek
the least and gentle acceleration and
braking in traffic
hit the sweet spot that means keeping
the car very generally between about 35
and maybe 60 miles per hour going much
faster drags down mpg due to wind
resistance going a lot slower isn't good
because combustion engines are
inefficient at low speed ranges use tall
gears this will dampen responsiveness
but that's not the point here your
modern automatic will already seek the
tallest useable gear when you're in
normal or eco mode but stay out of sport
and stay off those panels now if you've
read about hypermiling or people gain
the most out of their Hybrid ever you've
probably read about a technique called
pulse and glide this is getting on the
throttle kind of hard to get up to speed
with the engine running it's sweet spot
then coasting until you're down to a
speed where you've got to pick it up
again and repeat the cycle
it requires fairly open traffic
conditions of course and is maximized by
having the car in neutral or even
turning off the engine during the glide
part because coasting in gear introduces
quite a bit of engine drag it reduces
the games however coasting in neutral or
turning off your engine on the road are
illegal inadvisable or both another
technique I do not recommend on regular
public roads is drafting this is tucking
in tight behind a large or at least
larger vehicle to reduce your wind
resistance but to do it you really have
to violate the three-second Gap rule on
public roads just not cool especially
behind the vehicle that isn't in on the
game as you can see hypermiling has a
lot of little pieces to it you've got to
make something second nature that aren't
right now and you've got to get some new
muscle memory if you will but the nice
thing about it is you can use an
undemanding the current car you already
have why not try it see how much you can
wring out of your current vehicle you
might need to buy that hybrid after all
and when you do want to crack it open on
a fun country road you can still do that
as well it's not like you had to make a
hard mechanical commitment to a
different kind of machine in a moment a
quick shortcut to the list of the best
MPG cars gas diesel or electrifying when
CNET on cars returns
I am Bruce Meyers I'm a Southern
Californian that created this little car
behind me called the Meyers Manx it's
the world's first fiberglass dune buggy
you can go buy yourself a Porsche or a
Jeep or a Corvette but all those cars
are made in factories these are all made
in the family garage so there's
something different there is there buy
more from the ex car team of CNET UK at
cnet.com slash
welcome back to CNET on cars I'm Brian
coulis time for some of your email this
one coming in all the way from Saudi
Arabia where Hani writes in can you do a
top 5 best mpg cars that are strictly
gas-powered meaning no electrics or
anything like that and can you also do
one for diesel cars well honey we
typically do a year and top five of the
best mpg cars but you don't need to wait
you can actually use the US government
rankings and look this up anytime you
want which is a pretty good barometer so
go over to fuel economy gov click on
find a car then drop down to best and
worst vehicles and from those results
you can choose cars excluding V's right
there at the top now as I mentioned this
is not a ranking unique to your market
it's a US market barometer
but as car makers get increasingly
globalized with their cars and sell more
of the same cars and similar
configurations around the world this is
becoming a better and better barometer
at least of who's on the top who's on
the bottom who's in the middle also note
that we have a lot fewer diesels in the
US so some models you're thinking of may
not be in our list at all last episode
we brought you the new top 5 in car
media sources but how distracting are
the new interfaces you use to get to
them here's a top 5 of recently
evaluated and highly distracting
dashboard display
they told us voice technology was going
to solve in-car distraction
they lied new research for the triple-a
and university of utah shows that
talking to your car keeps your mind on
that and less on driving it here are the
top five distractions in the dash that
our voice oriented rated on a scale of
relative distraction value number five
climate or radio commands via voice I've
always found these kind of ridiculous
I mean radio and climate is pretty darn
easy without talking to the car command
clean in the time it takes you to simply
activate voice command you could already
change the station or the temp number
for destination search via voice even if
it's error free it's real tricky getting
the voice command gear to understand
every command you say every detail of
street and that happens about once a
year that it gets it right remains a
complex task number three emails and
texts this should be a no-brainer I'm
actually surprised they aren't number
one a range of scores here is because it
varies whether you're composing or
listening and whether you have a natural
or one of those computerized voices
coming out of your car
either way composing is always
foreground obviously as can be listening
when the texture email is infuriating
number two is just sheer menu navigation
let's face it you can't just talk to
your car it ain't that smart on most
cars you need to give it the exact
stilted command it wants to hear from a
strict menu of choices that means you
either memorize all those right or
glanced at those on-screen prompts
that's sort of like getting around a
foreign country with nothing but a
phrase book and you know how well that
goes before I get you to our surprising
number one dashboard distraction here's
a list of how the same study ranks some
of the most popular in-car systems
overall the number one voice oriented
dashboard distraction is believe it or
not Apple Siri being used for almost
anything this will surprise some folks
because Siri is a natural conversation
tool but that open-endedness
along with the range of tasks it can
control along with the fact that you
might end up drifting off into an inane
conversation with her it makes it
perhaps a bit too much
