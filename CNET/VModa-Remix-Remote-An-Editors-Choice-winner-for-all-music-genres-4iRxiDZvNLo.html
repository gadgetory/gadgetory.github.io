CNET and these are the v-moda remix
remote earphones I'm giving these an
editor's choice because they're the best
value for under a hundred bucks right
now Amazon is selling them for 80 which
makes them an even better deal not just
because they sound great and work well
to block outside noise but also because
when you buy into the v-moda brand
you're also getting the benefits of a
generous two-year warranty and an
attention to detail and headphones that
I have yet to see from another
manufacturer the first thing that sets
them apart is their durability the
earbuds themselves are fitted with metal
that housed the 9 millimeter drivers
inside then you've got a kevlar sheath
that wraps the 32 inch braided cable in
an extra layer of toughness also the
joints are all reinforced with extra
rubber that lets them Bend and
accommodate all your smart phone cases
and accessories with all that material
you may expect them to weigh a lot but
they don't in fact there are only 17
grams and that includes the three button
microphone and remote control that sits
beneath the why split left and right
cables of course a headphone is only as
good as it sounds so a good fit makes a
big difference in their sonic reach now
the term universal fit is kind of a
misnomer because there's really no such
thing but v-moda does its best with four
pairs of black clear silicone ear tips a
set of ear stabilizers for your workout
as well as a padded case to take care of
them in transit all the ear tip options
means you should be able to get a tight
seal in your ears and that means a lot
for the sound design the company uses a
31 band equalizer to test all the
drivers and the custom tuning means
these are great for any genre of music
they're also excellent at blocking
external noises so there are worthwhile
buy if you're shopping for headphones to
take away from your surroundings whether
that's a daily commute or the drone of a
busy office so the v-moda remix remotes
definitely earn CNET's Editors Choice
Award for their clear highs resonant
bass 2 year warranty and a generous
array of accessories if you're in the
market for a new pair of headphones
these definitely deserve your attention
so I'm Justin you for CNET you just took
a first look at the v-moda remix remote</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
