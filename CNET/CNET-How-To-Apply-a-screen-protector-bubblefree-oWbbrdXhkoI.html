I'll show you how to purchase and apply
a screen protector for your phone not
everyone believes in screen protectors
but after seeing how scratch prone
Molly's iPhone 5 is I'm pretty much a
fan okay so let's get right to it
the screen protector you choose will
vary depending on your phone
protectors also come in matte finishes
or as privacy screens but I would avoid
those if you can they tend to produce
this unavoidable rainbow effect with
these clear protectors you'll shield
your phone without affecting the display
so today I'll be using a clear protector
for the iPhone 5 from sir Lancelot's
armor and it's time to apply this thing
first things first you want to be in a
dust free environment pick a clean
surface in a quiet area where no one
will bother you it's really important
that you get it right the first time and
one more thing
if you have lotion on your hands you'll
want to remove it either by washing your
hands with soap and water or wiping them
down with some rubbing alcohol now
you'll need to clean your iPhone screen
first remove any case you might have on
it just take this one off and spray with
just a little LCD cleaning solution
alright give it a good rub down with a
microfiber cloth and take your time here
you don't want any dust okay
let's double check to make sure see a
couple flecks I'm telling you you want
to take your time here now we can get to
applying our protector alright so take
the protector this is brand new out of
its packaging and most times these will
come with a microfiber cloth and even a
card for pushing out the bubbles alright
there it is
you can start from the top or the bottom
but in my experience you get the best
alignment when you start with the home
button okay first we'll peel the backing
off the protector and make sure you're
holding its sides do not touch the
sticky part if you need to if you have
fat fingers you can use tweezers to hang
on to it but I'm going to go ahead and
just be really careful here okay so
we'll start by making sure that it's
perfectly aligned around a home button
again you want to take your time with
this it's not a race
because if you do it right it's going to
last a long time okay that looks pretty
good okay as soon as you found the sweet
spot around the home button grab a
credit card and slowly use it to apply
the protector again really take your
time here that's the secret to not
having any bubbles so I'm just pushing
pushing pushing keep going up alright if
at any point you see a bubble you can
lift the protector a little bit and go
back and oops and push that bubble out
alright so far so good
alright when you have it all smoothed
out and in place it's time to peel back
this tab which will expose the actual
screen protector itself it should look a
lot shinier now if there are any bubbles
you can't quite get out there's either a
scratch or dust under there if it's dust
lift the protector with a piece of tape
and then use another piece of tape to
remove the dust just like that and there
you have it if you did it right you
should really hardly be able to tell
that there's even a screen protector on
your phone and once you put your case
back on your phone will be totally
protected remember you should apply a
screen protector soo
after buying your phone otherwise those
scratches will give you unwanted bubbles
if you have any questions or just want
to tweet me a photo of your bang-up job
hit me up on Twitter for CNET I'm Sharon
