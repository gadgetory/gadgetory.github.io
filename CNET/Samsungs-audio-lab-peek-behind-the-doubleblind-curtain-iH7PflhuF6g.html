950 at my sound bar and the radiant 360
speakers under its belt it's been a busy
two years for the engineers at Samsung's
audio lab in California the lab on the
outskirts of Los Angeles is tasked with
researching speaker design as well as
developing new audio products for
Samsung the lab also spends time audio
tuning the company's new lines of
televisions one of the highlights of the
facility is the dual anechoic chambers
which engineers used to test audio
equipment I'm here at Samsung's labs in
an anechoic chamber where I've heard
that if you spend long enough in here
you can go insane because you can all
you can hear is your own heartbeat in
addition the team also uses computer
modeling and specialized photography to
map how materials move when used as part
of a loudspeaker in addition to the
theory the team also does practical
listening tests at the laboratory
these include double-blind tests using a
unique revolving wall which can mount up
to four TVs or speakers at a time so we
can put the speaker's like right here
which would simulate a kind of usual
placement of a speaker on a on a shelf
and put the four of them on here it's a
total typical use case the team at the
Samsung lab says its aim is to make the
company's product sit in the same breath
as Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins it's definitely a
lofty goal and we look forward to
testing out its latest products
including the Atmos on bar here at scene
8 in the near future
