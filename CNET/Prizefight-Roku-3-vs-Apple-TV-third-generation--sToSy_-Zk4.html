and we have a battle between the best of
the best with two cnet editors choice
streaming media boxes it's a prize
five-foot out between the Roku 3 and the
Apple TV 3rd generation our judges for
this fight our executive editor John
Stone Cold falcone senior associate
editor Matthew the big show vez cove yak
and myself real ding a ding dong we'll
take each round score and average them
out to the nearest tenth of a point the
final prize fight score will be an
average of all rounds in the same system
let's get this party started round 1 is
designed to Roku 3 brings a new and
improved design with its black glossy
finish and thicker curves that I approve
of their classic fabric tag is there and
a heavier weight that makes it feel more
solid now the third generation Apple TV
is still the little mad bucks that holds
up better against dust for fingerprints
with rounded corners and a heavier
weight neither of these guys get in the
way but the judges prefer the apple TV
4.72 for next round is user interface
and navigation the Roku 3 completely
revamped its main interface and it's
great to navigate while allowing you to
see more channels and content one slight
drawback is the inside of a roku channel
still retains the old horizontal look
and feel now customization is king here
and you can personalize the entire
layout of your channels and let's not
forget its killer search functionality
that pulls from Roku's multiple content
sources roku seriously stepped up their
game now the Apple TVs interface is an
elegant experience but it could be
simplified and needs a facelift
animations are smooth and its interface
feels polished but there's no real
customization here and no search across
it's different so
the roku 3 gets a 4.7 and Apple TV gets
a 4 so after averaging two rounds we're
tied round three is features the roku 3
makes a point of not being a stripped
down box anymore with a snappier
processor that you can feel bringing
hdmi 1080p video support with 802 11 n
dual-band Wi-Fi and an ethernet
connection you'll have a micro SD card
slot for additional storage and a USB
port to connect external drives and it
even supports MKV files but that's not
all the killer feature is it to enhance
remote with an audio jack for private
listening that lets you listen to what's
playing through your headphones so you
won't disturb anyone else and it even
comes with purple earbuds the remote
also acts as a motion controller for
games like Angry Birds and it may not
have airplay but the Roku app for
Android and iOS lets you stream your
photos or music to the box now the Apple
TV also brings HDMI with 1080p support
802 11 and Wi-Fi and ethernet with an
option for optical audio out the USB
port is primarily used for service so
you can't connect just any type of drive
to it it's feature set up really opens
up though if you live in the Apple
ecosystem airplay support allows you to
play and display content directly from
your iOS devices and airplay mirroring
allows your apple laptop or computer
screen to be mirrored onto your TV with
just one click if it's supported now
that's all pretty sweet if you're an
Apple user now if you pay 2499 a year
for the iTunes Match service you can
access your entire music collection and
if you use the iCloud you'll also be
able to view your photo stream again if
you love them apples now the apple TV is
feature packed if you're part of the
ecosystem but the roku 3 just dominates
with useful features that
for everyone the row 23 gets a perfect
five and Apple TV gets of four next
round is content I can only tell you
that content is king so many times and
it still holds true here both streaming
boxes have access to netflix and hulu
plus but roku shines with over 100
channels of content like amazon video on
demand which has now become a must-have
an HBO Go which covers your movies and
TV shows now there's on-demand sports
for the NBA MLB and NHL and specific
content like our own cnet channel hey
that's one of my favorites or stuff for
the kids with the Disney Channel now
there's Spotify and Pandora for music
discovery and social services like
Facebook and Flickr have apps as well
the only drawback is there still no
YouTube but Roku's channels are endless
on the other side Apple's box has access
to content from itunes to purchase TV
shows music and movies and they have
support for on-demand sports as well but
when you're talking about Apple TVs
additional online services it's a
handful like YouTube Flickr and Vimeo
and yeah pretty slim pickings now the
catch is that you can actually play more
content through airplay mirroring from
your computer if you have the right
Apple hardware the Roku swings hard
again with the perfect vibe and the
Apple TV gets a 4dr averaging four
rounds
who needs by half a point the final
round that decides it all is valued both
of these streaming boxes are ninety nine
dollars and there's no denying that Roku
3 has packed as much value as you can in
a box this small now the apple TV is
worth it if you're an apple lover but
it's hard to say it's really an overall
better value than the roku 3 at this
point in the game in the final round
road crew gets a 4.3 and Apple gets a 4
so let's average out all five rounds and
the roku 3 finally gets to prevent from
its last battle of the Apple TV and
reclaim its title taking this fight 4.6
the 4.1 and is your prize fight winner
you can't go wrong with to cnet editors
choice streaming boxes and the roku 3
made sure to bring its a game to the
ring the next move is yours Apple i'm
brian Tong thanks for watching we'll
catch you guys next time for another
prize fight
