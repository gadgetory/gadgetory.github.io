buzz report and now for the gadget of
the week in the spirit of the recent
halloween festivities the gadget of the
week is the new LG chocolate phone which
now comes in white hmm I love white
chocolate ooh sorry wait I'm getting
some news here apparently there's a
newer LG chocolate phone the chocolate
platinum it's got double the internal
memory and oh oh wait sorry more news LG
has now launched the chocolate wine
which is a burgundy version of the phone
see now I just remembered what I hate
about Halloween chocolate overdose and
now for the news in recent days news
outlets have gotten the chance to try
out the new Nintendo Wii in person now
as you may know that we uses a new
motion sensitive controller that
features heavily in the gameplay and the
early reports are it's too tiring bit
technet reported that after playing the
game they think the wii generation will
be super fit super toned athletic gods
amongst men the BBC said that it was
more like ritual humiliation and actual
fun and our own veronica belmont
reported that after playing a boxing
game on the wii her arm was actually
sore the next day luckily the shipping
version of the we will include a
preferences menu so you can change the
default controller sensitivity from
robust and healthy gesturing to the
flabby pathetic twitches of modern man
the CIA has started a wiki much like
Wikipedia saying that openness and
collaboration is the key to successful
American espionage I mean their wiki is
top-secret accessible only to members of
the CIA and bound to be rife with
internal politics censorship and the
constant fear of enemy infiltration and
leaks to the media that could jeopardize
national security and lead to the
untimely deaths of who knows how many
citizens but other than that edit away
super spies internet yes this Tuesday is
election day and there are more concerns
than ever about electronic voting
machines the ars technica website posted
detailed instructions on how to use e
voting machines to steal an election and
early voters in Florida are reporting
that they've had a hard time choosing
democratic and
it's on their electronic touch screens
but voter officials in Florida say that
those types of problems happen all the
time because the screens just get out of
sync and it's easy to fix sure it
happens all the time first somebody
gives me some money and the screens get
out of sync this way and then somebody
else gives me some money and the screens
get out of sync the other way that's
computers for ya this weekend gamers can
finally get their hands on the new
Desperate Housewives video game in it
you play a housewife and you can cook
and work on your garden spend your
husband's money and gossip about your
fellow housewives you know all the stuff
that teenage boys just love to do I'm
Hollywood and this has been the buzz
