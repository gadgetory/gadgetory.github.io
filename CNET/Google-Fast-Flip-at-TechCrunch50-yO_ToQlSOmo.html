actually you presenting a product that
for launching today and you can see from
the presentations that have been here in
TechCrunch today that a big part of
innovation is having the right goal and
asking the right questions to frame
angle and at Google we've had for some
time a really aggressive goal around
speed we think that when you make search
faster people use it more when you make
the web faster people use it more that
also causes people to invest more in
those platforms so we've been going
about shaving milliseconds here
milliseconds there and really trying to
improve the user experience and then
that's all our founder Larry Page asked
a really interesting question which is
you basically said why isn't about like
a magazine how can you go to the next
page the content isn't already loaded
imagine how much you use the web and
going to new pages was as simple as
flipping pages in a magazine and it
really reset our thinking and kind of
humbled us our overall speed goals
and we mostly thought that this would be
something of the years or a detonator
for way until there's navara the
principal offender behind Google News
and Google Finance came with a really
interesting prototype so the prototype
in burnet launch of the day now is a
service on google labs we have some
exciting partners for launching this in
partnership with Washington Post The New
York Times Businessweek Newsweek as well
as popular mechanics Cosmo Us Weekly and
of course TechCrunch and about three
dozen other publishers so without
further ado I'm going to like Krishna
and then we can you introduce the
product and demonstrate thanks Thank You
bishop so as I said we here today to
unveil a new product let me go up on
Google Apps almost instantly the whole
world to see and use and you'll be the
first to see of course a few months ago
TechCrunch need a screenshot early
prototype of this product factors
codename flipper not a crunch it will
give you
unfortunately with my justice because it
was all about him so it's only improving
we come back take 550 and show you the
first time when it looks like the
product was gone Google fast it said
online radio for news has the name such
as fast but means you can flip through
news pages released as much by turning
the pages of the print magazine websites
have media rich content that takes
follow each page has dozens of units
that need to be loaded javascript CSS
flash
magazine completely destroyed
seamlessness of experience that's the
problem external to solve we want the
convenience of Prince news to speed and
the hands-on control but we also want
the advantage is the difficult managers
of online news aggregation of multiple
sources continuous updates being able to
search and navigate recommendations from
friends in the community and the ability
to have a content personalized for you
so we want good works and any que una
show you google our expression and when
you go to ask which is available in
Google Apps com you will see that we
have different models we have a popular
one sections one we have
II think each one of these modules can
get different categories for example
within topics again Israel kenya's in 10
/ 11 hip hop with in sections to get
politics business etc we call this
category's magazines but our belief is
that regardless of what your interests
are you will always be in a magazine
that you find interesting so let's for
example consider entertainment what I'm
getting right here is a magazine on a
treatment that has such particles from a
variety of different sources and the
beauty of google fast one which was not
captured in the station when was sleep
is holly green creates the magazine
experience and how easy it is to go
through content until you find an
article that you like so right now
looking at americol from the new york
times that i can easily flip and go to
different articles very very quickly
almost as quickly as if it were an axiom
until I happened to find our helo medic
Mike and once there is an article that I
find interesting I am single including
this be done and then I can read the
full article at publisher's website
also once they find an article that I
like I can easily get more articles from
the same publication or from the same
magazine in this case entertainment if
we happen to know who the owner when
article is he fails to get more and
articles or stories legacy longer
it is also possible of course to look at
all the stories from a particular source
and since this cabinet x150 it's only
fitting that we show and let the
TechCrunch magazine again he is then
very very quickly you can flick your
stories and
and a first always a search company and
Marissa here with surly are a bunch of
Product Search incorporated so the
lowest bunch of different magazines
England many different categories and
search is certainly important right now
the US Sylvan is going on and I can
certainly search for it and a very
quickly get the US open magazine again
has all the articles corresponding to
the USO and from allegations that
decided to be park to the last with some
point of course are going to find a
story that you really like you want to
be able to assure the people that you
care about we offer you two ways of
doing so and the first one of course is
to do we go green home again that's
pretty straightforward so this would be
you can start of the league this one if
you want it again person getting this
article will be able to don't you see no
and then go difficult aspect look at it
what you can also do this exploit
interesting is to light an article by
liking an article we're making a
statement that you find a particular
article to be enjoyable and that you
want to let other people know that this
is an article that you happen to care
about so after the likeness which allow
their people to be able to see that I
regain light and the story about the US
Open and the way that that's reflected
in other peoples pages is that there's a
section at the bottom that has the
stories that other people have its life
so it looks like my friend Jack was a
meteor that workman masculine and likes
fast company luck and these are the
stories that collected so here I am
getting magazine corresponding to the
story is dead Jack happens like and
again very very quickly
go for the stories we hope you'll try to
invest like the feel joy and again it's
like right now we should be and you can
play with it a slip knot Google Apps
them and if you happen to have an
Android 0 for an iphone you can also
find them all over and Asselin if speed
on a desktop is important and the
dramatic experience that you get by
making the mobile product faster is just
incredible it really makes a huge
difference when you're bored and you
have your cell phone begin to be able to
flip for a lot of articles right quickly
and thus Christmas going to show you
hi
teaching which is in some sensitive
which case scenario for something
generally use in a lot of fun so Marty
is doable fast but don't want to my
planet see the holidays
ah that's it excuse me
as we
I can't assume which gives you instant
full reservations on the pitch motion of
that and email alighted enough words you
can search
but in search of a topical get results
and if you get more you like the home
page where you have new topics that I've
been suggested to you maybe I don't know
came to my scissors I click on this is a
search working vice versa creating a
custom magazine for me about this person
before so the more you use it the more
relevant the things that we show you
again both of the best version full
version so goes national we partnered
with she doesn't talk to your
publications from New York Times
Washington Post online politicians like
salon and ProPublica Xenophon in the
speed of reporting the other losers we
the content and
whether meeting news browsing really
fast does in fact refers people to read
more news and sustains the industry by
revenue funding has here the two things
that matter to us one is they needs to
be a problem that appears to be profit
more than this for us so speed on the
world the problem everybody gets I'm
glad it's all we got and secondly you
wanna make the world a better place so
find people using demo versions of I
feel that they see them really getting
it will actually fun that is very
satisfied so next time you feel bored or
overworked testing back pick up your
iPhone
happy
to be on brain too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
