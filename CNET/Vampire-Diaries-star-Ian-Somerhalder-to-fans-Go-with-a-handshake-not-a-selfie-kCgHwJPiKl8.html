are here in Atlanta Georgia my
background being from rural Louisiana
particularly the wetlands of Louisiana
my parents showed me in a very young age
that when we take too much from the
environment the result is catastrophic I
realized that there is truly need for
immediate aggressive and collaborative
movement forward and that's where is FB
and Simran owner foundation was born if
we're talking about self-driving cars
clearly it's an ingenious idea but it
also is tech tech does fail I just got
married
and we want to have children relatively
soon and I'm just thinking about being
at work and my wife being on the way to
set our kid and dogs in the car at a
stoplight some unmanned car is coming by
and there's a glitch in the system and
what happens unmanned cars
scary I've been on Vampire Diaries for
six years it's flown by like that fandom
has changed it's no longer hey man how
are you I really like what you're doing
TV people come up to me in airports or
even on the street and we'll run up to
me and jump in front of me and take a
selfie and run away what's more
important is a handshake our hug or
interaction where you've actually get to
see someone's eyes yeah it's nice to
camera we're building an animal
sanctuary that's also a school teaching
innovation compassion reverence
gratitude and education I just want to
build this next generation of people who
understand that there's a balance
between humanity and technology we need
even the greatest tech geniuses to step
aside for one second and not be the mad
scientist and say let's also be human
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
