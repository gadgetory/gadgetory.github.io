you need to know about the Mustang when
you boil it all the way down first of
all the styling very different still a
Mustang the interior a lot more tech and
then finally a new engine when they said
really he doesn't belong it a Mustang
but well find out it actually does what
makes a Mustang look like one so
beginning at the front end we've got
this grille that kind of tips forward
and and pushes down the road that really
gives it this assertive look we call the
sharkbite grill and we were looking at
how that was on the original which
slightly tilts forward and sticks out in
the middle it does and then as you move
down the body side we've got these lines
through the bodies yet here that really
help to lengthen out the body so if it
pulls your eye through the body it helps
to compress the car visually takes a lot
of visual mass out of the car here wider
you're lowering it the car seems a
little more compact in terms of its its
mass it looks less chunky yeah so a
couple things we did with our with our
partners in crime our engineering
community we we lowered the roof by
almost an inch and a quarter in overall
height and that's just at the centerline
of the roof right you move to the rear
decklid there's about 70 millimetres of
heights taken out of that so that's
almost three inches of height yeah this
intrigues me because most cars we see
today have an ever-rising rump than up
here and why is that
and why isn't this design trends design
trends of you know kind of pushed more
design wedge into the car you know the
original Mustangs or very linear very
stable in their sideview appearance so
if you look at this car compared to the
outgoing car this has a lot of stability
visually inside you we pulled the wheels
out on the rear 70 millimeters in total
that allows us to get a lot more what we
call muscularity are the haunch the rear
muscle the whole vehicle the current car
has what we call a body colour b-pillar
so it's integrated body into the sheet
metal here but we took that out we call
it a unified diello graphic stands for
daylight opening that complements what
we call the fastback profile if there is
one thing the
have to do when you design a Mustang to
keep it a must what one thing could you
not do without and make this car if I
can follow me
the tri-bar tail lamps are
quintessential Mustang design Q of
course and without tri-bar tail lamps
it's not a Mustang this is raising some
eyebrows is raising some eyebrows but
this is a brand new 2.3 liter EcoBoost
it's new to not only Mustang but it's
actually new to the EcoBoost family more
horsepower torque definitely than
outgoing v6 for folks that don't know
and ego boosters having a turbocharger
and direct injection that's correct on
an engine that typically is a Ford they
can act like a six that's right the
power of a six a fuel economy over four
now these are not technologies that are
new to you guys direct injection and
turbo charging what can you do to tell
people that no you're wrong when you say
there's no replacement for displacement
that's the old mantra especially among
Mustang lovers well look I mean it
depends on what you're shooting for
right when you want fuel efficiency and
power and and and this is the technology
this is where it's at and this is where
the future is at don't you find modern
buyers especially younger modern buyers
are less aware of how many cylinders
they've got and what configuration
they're in no they could almost care
less how many cylinders they have yeah
they want a good performing car that's
still true yeah but they definitely want
to be more responsible they want to be
more green right because the Mustang
needs good crack of the throttle
response that's one of that kind of car
what have you done to minimize turbo lag
well that's what sets this EcoBoost
apart from our other EcoBoost engines we
have a twin-scroll turbo in here that's
new for you guys right so instead of one
single scroll you got two to it you know
to school yeah and then we're also
there's an in the exhaust manifold
there's an integrated three port exhaust
manifold and what that means is we're
taking the four-cylinder cylinder number
one yeah and we're putting it out
through one port cylinders two and three
through another port and cylinder four
through another port so that turbo is
always exposed to the pulses it needs to
spool up absolutely
for the first time you have an
independent rear suspension in the main
production Mustang what's the big deal
there for the consumer says I don't know
it seemed to ride fine before that
integral linked rear suspension is gonna
allow us to continue to tie down the
performance of the must they get it even
tighter and better performing but give
you better ride primary and secondary
ride so when you want to ride to work on
Monday and I'm looking to maybe go
around the racetrack yeah you're gonna
get a better ride I heard some Auto code
primary and secondary ride does that
mean
so prime it's it's the primary ride you
know when you're the bumps that you hit
when you're going down there and then
secondary ride is sort of what happens
after you hit that bump so oh
interesting yeah so it's the way that we
handle the impacts and then how we
handle it after these waves that go
through the car that's correct from the
crummy roads we all drive on that's
right and when you have a solid beam
back there you can excite the car much
differently than when you have an
excited elegant word yeah
so again we're taking Mustang higher
performance but also improving the
refinement as well all right well you
said there are four key things that make
the inside of a Mustang the inside of a
Mustang very much so looking at a
Mustang talking to the customer we knew
it had to be a symmetrical instrument
panel we knew it had to have the double
brow they're looking for a specific
thing in a Mustang they want the big
analog gauges in front of the driver
goes back to year one exactly and one of
the things we heard time and time again
honest premium materials Ford's taken
something of a beating over its myford
touch interface now Mustang gets the
technology for the first time but also
for the first time Ford has moved
several the most used functions out of
the touch interface and back on the
traditional knobs and buttons clustered
below it everything in this this
interior is tied into you know the
aircraft feel we've got toggle switches
push button starters new push-button
starter that that start is on it that
like is like that on every Mustang now
we've got a storage space here at the
base of the center so you know we heard
that from the customer there's a power
port there there's a USB port so there's
a place to put your phone here yeah look
where the shift lever is look where the
cupholders are they're shifted to the
side you clear towards the passenger so
there you have your weight you're clear
you're not fighting these things while
you're driving then I see them
symmetrically dropped in here
sometimes right down the midline but
it's right where your wants to go to
grab that shift you shifted them over so
they're out of the way when you're
driving the other thing is the steering
wheel is actually a little smaller than
today's wheel and if you notice the the
metal on today's wheel actually wraps
all the way around the outside well we
heard time and time again in a hot
climate in a cold climate that's not
great to put your hands on interesting
so we redesigned this so your hands are
right here and it's nice and soft and
you're feeling the leather when you're
driving the car paddles for the first
time two paddles for the first time yes
great great feature and just you know
it's all about this visceral experience
with with flying an airplane if this
feels like the cockpit of a plane
metallized surfaces here for the
controls also well all the mustangs said
that is that a trim level thing no no
all the mustangs will have this it's a
nice touch yeah the only thing that
changes actually you know sometimes
you'll get a smaller screen with with
different controls different technology
in the head but pretty much it's all the
same like this when someone gets in this
car who's got a current generation car
we the first thing is they're gonna
notice oh they're gonna notice that no
way out it out yeah you love this way
just I just think this is going to make
a huge statement for us the glove box
itself is actually we cut we call this
an active glove box it's it's a first
for Ford yeah the airbag module is
actually encapsulated in the glove box
so we were able to eliminate a hundred
millimeters off of the face of the
instrument panel which gave us this
beautiful form and we kind of keyed it
so this would have been real chunky up
here exactly real heavy across this
surface area right here which you'll see
in today's car the speaker's used to be
these big jutting things that came out
yes I always hated them yes
now I'm not calling anybody out but you
got them nice and flat here you didn't
have to do that why did you do that that
was all about making the interior a
little bit bigger for the occupant look
what we've done here we pushed the
speakers in we push this forward 100
millimeters it actually tapers down off
this a little bit we've tapered this
instead of you know we made the best use
of the space that we possibly could yeah
to really make it a more room a big car
no it's not but I think you really feel
the difference when you get in this with
what we've done
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
