the apple byte it's all the good and bad
inside the world of Apple so let's get
to the show now this year is wrapping up
but you better believe Apple is working
on their goodies for 2010 iphone
developer panda recently told macrumors
they found an unreleased iphone using
their I Bart application the device
using Apple's internal numbering system
was identified as iphone 31 the iphone
3gs is known as iphone 21 now there are
very few details about the next-gen
iphone other than the obvious probably
an improved processor and storage camera
improvements and possibly FM radio as
well so keep your eyes peeled because
the new iphone is in the wild or
probably hidden in one of those fugly
ipod socks now is apple going to name
their tablet computer the tablet mac
probably not but they recently
transferred the trademark for that name
from axio tron axio tron is the company
that takes apple laptops and converts
them by getting rid of the keyboard and
trackpad and replaces the screen with a
Wacom pen bay screen the modification is
699 if you already own the laptop now
axia Tron was marketing the device as
the tablet mac in 2007 but now refers to
it as the modbook an apple has been
known to be very protective of their
name and trademarks but if they feel
like naming the news baby the tablet mac
they now have that option alright here's
an email about a recent issue we really
haven't talked about Rick gray Wrightson
was upbeat song what's up Rick would you
please address this issue of the new
iMacs 27-inch screen flickering tearing
shutting off I was going to buy one of
these for myself for Christmas but we'll
hold off if Apple does not fix this soon
your thoughts hey Rick they're having
some recent reports and postings on
forums at Apple specifically about the
27-inch arriving do a or even with
cracked screens and now these days the
Internet they kind of magnify things a
lot and without a doubt every computer
line will have some manufacturing issues
I would be too paranoid but what I would
do is purchase her machine in an apple
store plug it in and test it out before
you leave I've done this with big screen
purchases before just to make sure
I don't end up with any dead pixels so
good luck with that Rick and really
that's what you should try and do all
right let's check out some quick bites
we showed you how Apple was getting
involved in the carrier battle last week
and after back and forth lawsuits from
both AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon over their 3g
coverage ads both sides have dropped the
lawsuits showing that we can all play
nice and get along now a lot of
developers complain about the App
Store's approval process so maybe they
should follow seattle-based mike candys
lead they've created an app for Android
phones that's a porn app store where you
can find adult apps no sensors no
restrictions just go to a porn on your
phone and it's the first case of app on
app action that I've seen and kids
remember you pretty much have to be 18
or older so ask your parents like I did
and really buy iphone a little droid all
right let's check out our iPhone app of
the week
ever wish you guys could sound like
t-pain whose amazes drinks to tree we
drunken this week's app of the week is I
am t-pain and now with an update you
guys can take songs from your own
collection and sing to them and really
there's no better way to build a
friendship with your producer then
through music you are a what's going on
man trying to make some music makes it
make some music no no here check this
out I think you know we could relate a
little I know your producer you got to
distortion static thing we need to make
music you know that I am t-pain app you
got it I don't know no seriously just
just hear me out okay just hear me out I
think you might like this no this is

hell is going on in here Oh get out we
