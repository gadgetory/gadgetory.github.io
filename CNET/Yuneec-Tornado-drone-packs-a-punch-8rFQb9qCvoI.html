monster drones this professional
hexacopter is the unique tornado it has
a retractable landing gear foldable arms
for portability and thirty minutes of
flying time the tornado is compatible
with a Panasonic Lumix gh4 or the sony
a7r - they sit on the three axis gimbal
with a floating mount to keep it stable
even in high winds but if you want the
most flexibility there is the C go for
camera made by unique inside it's the
same as the Lumix gh4 but you also have
the ability to use the three times
optical zoom during filming talking
about specs is all well and good but
this is how it actually slides so
everything is controlled through this
panel here I'm going to hit the record
button so I start recording the footage
I'm gonna start it up there we go here
we go alright now it's up it's holding
its position I'm gonna retract the
landing gear that's kind of cool it's
actually really easy to fly even for
someone like me was very limited during
flying experience but there's also the
option to drive it a bit more
aggressively through the angle mode or
you can also make it come straight home
to you by flicking it into home mode
it's really really fun too
okay now it's in smart mode it's not
gonna come any closer to me because of
that geofence so what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna try and land it I'm gonna
flick the landing gear down and then
bring it all the way down it has a
sensor so it's not going to crash into
the ground when you bring it in the
throttle all the way down it's going to
sense the ground and then insured lands
neatly and safely
it really is easier that the ground
controller runs Android and has a 7-inch
touchscreen that gives you metrics on
telemetry data camera exposure controls
and of course the live video view all of
the tornador will set you back five
thousand US dollars with camera
equipment extra for more on the unique
