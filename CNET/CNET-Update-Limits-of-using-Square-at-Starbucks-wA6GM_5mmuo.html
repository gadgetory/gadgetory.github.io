I'm Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update the partnership between starbucks
and square has blossomed and now
customers can use the square wallet app
to pay at 7,000 starbucks stores by
showing the cashier your phone screen
and i know what you're thinking doesn't
starbucks already have its own app for
payments well here's the difference the
starbucks app is like a virtual gift
card you have to keep filling and you
get rewards the more you use it to pay
the cashier scans the barcode on your
screen to deduct from the balance now if
you want to pay at starbucks with square
wallet you pre-program it with your
credit card info and when you pay the
cashier scans a QR code on your screen
to Bill you I just tried it out at the
starbucks near us and the QR code
wouldn't scan so the cashier had to
manually enter in a code and I was
holding up the line it wasn't worth the
time when I could have just handed over
my credit card maybe it'll be faster as
they learn the new system but Starbucks
could do so much more with square wallet
other small businesses that use it let
you pay without ever needing to ski in
your phone screen you just tell the
cashier your name your face pops up on
their register screen when you are
nearby and they just wireless still
charge your account Starbucks is holding
back from that feature it's a glorious
day for Pinterest users because now you
can finally create a private board to
collect ideas for things that you don't
want the whole world to see like if
you're planning a surprise party or
trying to collect gift ideas you can
keep it to yourself or just share it
with specific people amazon has uncorked
its wine store for some states but
ordering wine will cost you ten dollars
and shipping fees there's no free
shipping for prime customers to prevent
underage purchases all shipments require
an adult signature at delivery and you
can't send the wine to a p.o box or
names on a locker and the Star Wars
angry birds game is now available for
several platforms where the Rebel
Alliance birds take on Darth Vader the
Dark Lord of the pigs hurricane sandy
left thousands of people in need of
shelter so the do-it-yourself room
rental site air B&amp;amp;B became a resource
for people looking for a place to stay
hundreds of Airbnb users are offering
rent free rooms for anyone who has been
affected by the storm and New York City
is working with the service to connect
people who need shelter
it's great when you see technology
making it easier to help people in need
that's your tech news update for today
