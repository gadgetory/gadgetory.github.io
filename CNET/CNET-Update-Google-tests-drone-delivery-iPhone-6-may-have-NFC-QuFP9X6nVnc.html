Facebook no it's a google drone I'm
Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update google is known for some
futuristic projects and you can now add
flying delivery drones to the list
Google is working on a delivery system
called Project wing these are self
flying drones which can be
pre-programmed to set routes google has
been testing the drones in Australia and
is using the fleet to deliver small
things to locals like candy bars radios
and water and google says this could be
a way to deliver supplies after an
emergency for disaster relief the drone
itself weighs almost 19 pounds of course
Google is not the only one working on
delivery drones back in December Amazon
revealed its drone delivery plans with
the program amazon prime air facebook
also recently invested in a drone
company now that we know Apple will
reveal the iphone 6 in less than two
weeks the reports and rumors are flying
in at full speed a new report from wired
says the next iPhone could have NFC it's
also known as near field communication
and other outlets have been talking
about the same thing there's even an
image going around of the iphones board
with an NFC chip on it published by
known Apple news leaker sony dickson NFC
can let you pay wirelessly by tapping
your phone to a scanner at a register
similar to what you've seen on android
phones with google wallet and if see
also can be used for sending data from
one device to another like sinking a
phone to a bluetooth speaker with just a
tap oh and that rumor about Apple
showing off a new wearable device yeah
don't expect to be able to wear it
anytime soon or even this year if Apple
shows off an iWatch it may not ship
until 2015 that's according to a report
from recode it wouldn't be the first
time Apple showed off something months
before it shipped the first iPhone came
out six months after it was announced
and the first iPad took three months but
we don't even know if this mysterious
rumoured wearable is going to be and I
watch exactly or some other type of risk
gadget we'll just have to wait until
September 9th
and not everything these days is about
Apple there's also news in the world of
gaming Dells alienware brand has revived
a classic gaming desktop the area 51 and
it has a wild new pyramid design it's
built around a new Intel gaming
processor called the haswell-e it's
Intel's first eight core desktop
processor and Nintendo revealed pricing
details for amiibo that's the Skylander
style toys for the Wii U and 3ds they
