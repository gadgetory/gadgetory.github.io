for cnet.com and I'm here with the
updated version of audio engines highly
rated five series PC speakers these
speakers look a lot like the original
five but they're slightly bigger and
have some small but important design
tweaks as well as improve sound quality
and a higher price tag which is why
they're called the five plus the key
thing to note about audio engine
speakers is that they are bookshelf
style speakers masquerading as PC or
multimedia speakers but unlike classic
bookshelf speakers these audio engine
models are powered be a standard AC plug
that means there's no need for a
separate receiver or amplifier so you
can use them with any audio source this
model is available in black or white for
$399 as well as a swankier looking
bamboo version for 469 dollars while the
new model has grown up a little the
other key specs haven't changed speakers
of a 5 inch Kevlar woofer in a 20
millimeter silk dome tweeter because the
left speaker houses the amplifier that's
50 watts per channel it's heavier than
the right speaker the left and right
speakers connect to each other with real
speaker wire that's right real speaker
wire it's included and you also get an
input cable that allows you to connect
your PC to the 3.5 millimeter auxiliary
input on the back of the left speaker
one final design note these guys have no
speaker grilles which can be an issue if
you have small children or animals who
might decide to poke at them and
potentially damage them so what are the
differences between the 5 and 5 plus
well audio engine says the 5 plus has a
new thermal system for keeping the
amplifier cool and the designers also
changed up the connectivity a bit
instead of finding an extra 3.5
milimeter auxilary input on the top of
the left speaker along with a USB port
for charging portable devices that audio
input is gone and the USB port has been
moved to the back of the speaker that's
a good thing because it means you can
hide whatever you're charging behind the
speaker instead of the USB cord sticking
out on the top of the speaker with the 5
series audio engine integrate
a full-on AC power jack in the back of
the left speaker company touted the fact
that you could plug an apple Airport
Express directly into the output turn
the speakers into an iTunes streamer via
Apple's air tunes functionality that's
gone now though the speaker does have a
second pair of composite input jacks as
well as a set of outputs for connecting
a subwoofer the audio engine 5 series
did not come with a rope but this model
does include one and retains the volume
control button on the front of the left
speaker as for sound quality well we're
having a report that it has gotten even
better these guys deliver big rich sound
with deep tight bass and excellent
clarity and they also play very loud
we compared the 5 plus to the older
model and while their size difference is
small you can definitely hear a
difference in sound quality it's not
huge but it is noticeable the 5 plus
simply sounds like a bigger speaker with
more expansive sound yes we could
quibble about there not being integrated
AC power anymore but the combination of
the design improvements feature tweaks
and the speaker's exceptional sound make
the audio engine 5 plus easy to
recommend even at its higher price I'm
David Carr Noy and that's the audio
engine 5 plus PC speaker system thanks
