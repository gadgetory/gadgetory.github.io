smartphone I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your CNET update Nintendo will be making
games for your smartphone the company
announced that it's working with a video
game provider called DNA to bring
Nintendo games to Android and iOS
devices Nintendo also announced there
will be a new type of game system coming
it's codenamed + X now this shift to
apps marks a major step in Nintendo's
history taking carefully guarded iconic
franchises like Mario and Zelda and
setting them free on non Nintendo
systems no specific game has been
announced but there are some important
things to keep in mind here Nintendo
also said it's launching a new
membership service you may need to be a
member to get full access to games on
your smartphone or tablet the new game
system called NX is described as an
entirely new concept
it could be hardware that you'll want to
purchase to enhance your mobile apps
after all nintendo needs to still give
you a reason to buy its machines mobile
games are expected to exceed consoles as
the largest game market so Nintendo is
making small moves to adapt to the trend
and let's not forget Nintendo at its
roots knows mobile gaming very well
switching gears a bit Apple is in the
news again for working on a streaming
television service this time The Wall
Street Journal reports the Apple service
could have about 25 channels including
major networks like ABC CBS and Fox but
it has yet to make a deal with NBC the
report goes on to say that this would be
announced in June for a September
release and it could cost between 30 to
40 dollars a month of course Apple isn't
alone the movement towards streaming
live television over the Internet has
been progressing slowly dishes sling TV
is $20 a month for about 20 channels now
the service just expanded to include the
History Channel and lifetime in the base
package Sony also has a similar
standalone TV service called PlayStation
View it lets you watch TV without the
traditional cable box it will bundle
about 75 channels when it launches on
PlayStation consoles but you will need
to have a strong Internet can
to stream all this of course and a few
other security tidbits before we end
Google is now reviewing Android apps
before they hit the store for you to
download Google is doing this to crack
down on bad apps and malware in the app
marketplace Apple does something similar
you'll also notice that Google is now
attaching age ratings to Apple s teens
and Microsoft announced that Windows 10
which is coming later this year we'll
have a new biometric security feature
called Windows hello it replaces
passwords so you can unlock the computer
by scanning your face your fingerprint
or your iris that your technique is
update and you can stay updated at
