a look at the toshiba satellite u 925 t
now that rather generic sounding name
doesn't really tell you what this Kwasi
laptop does I call it a quasi laptop
it's really what we call it convertible
or to some sort of hybrid light
combination of a laptop and a tablet in
this case instead of the screen flipping
around or swiveling or rotating what it
does is the screen folds down and then
slides over the keyboard leaving you
with something that is very slate like
you see the keyboard is hidden inside
and then when you want to use it as a
regular laptop again you put it down you
slide the screen back and then you lift
it up like this
now we've actually seen this before sony
had one call the duo 11 that was very
similar it's it's screen kind of more
popped up rather than slid but I like
this version a lot better for a couple
of reasons number one the angle of the
screen here is actually adjustable so
you can get a better angle for it
depending on how you're sitting where
the lights are and much more importantly
or perhaps equally importantly the
Toshiba version has a touchpad down here
whereas the Sony version in order to
make it smaller and save space got rid
of the touchpad just had a little
optical track point right in the middle
that was frankly not very practical it
turns out even if you're using the
touchscreen and you're using it as a
tablet and you have a keyboard that
works fine it still really do kind of
need a touch pad for a lot of things and
that's probably the one area you
shouldn't really cut compared to a lot
of the other new windows 8 designed
laptops and convertibles hybrids we're
seeing this is actually reasonably
priced it's 1150 and for that you get a
128 gig SSD and an Intel Core i5 CPU
which means that it's basically on par
with a lot of the other ultra books that
we've seen earlier this year maybe
without the sliding screen and the touch
screen you'd probably pay maybe 899 900
dollars for something roughly comparable
sort of component-wise it is a little
bit of a premium for this experience but
of the different convertibles and
hybrids and sliders and
screen laptops that we've tried so far
for Windows 8 this is one of my
favorites because it's a little bit
different you get the adjustable angles
there on the screen and they managed to
work in a touchpad at the same time and
just feels like very sturdy and
travel-worthy
that said I would get some sort of cases
slip it into because when you have this
folded up even like a tablet the screen
is still exposed I'm Dan Ackerman and
that is the toshiba satellite u 925 t</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
