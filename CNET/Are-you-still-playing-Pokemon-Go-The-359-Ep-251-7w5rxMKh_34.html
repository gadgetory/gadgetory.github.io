one last big episode before we take our
mighty hiatus it's episode three 5251
and good morning everybody we couldn't
let you go without one last time talking
about Pokemon Cup oh come on come on an
important milestone yeah show we talked
about Pokemon go like all summer last
year yeah it's made to me this makes
sense prior to the hiatus to spend at
least a little bit time what are we
talking about Samsung blowing up Pokemon
go yeah and then just like crap
yeah so if anybody wants to sign out now
we're done we did it at all I don't know
if you all know but it is the it's the
birthday thing one-year anniversary of
Pokemon goes launch
happy birthday Pokemon happy birthday so
we're gonna talk a little bit about that
in our own personal experiences how long
we actually last with the game we're
talking a little bit about robotics and
sort of the opportunities in the
healthcare area that robots might be
able to bring and then lastly a little
plug for I hate package it's a series of
stories that looks like online hate on
harassment roll culture that has
developed over I don't know it's been
years
it sounds very light as always if you
have any questions leave them in the
comment section Brian will pick out the
best and we get to them in three minutes
of 59 seconds from three to welcome to
the 359 I'm Roger Chang I'm Ben Fox
Ruben
happy birthday Pokemon go emotive phenom
launched a year ago I despite the
perception that it's relevant 65 million
people are still playing that game each
my it's crazy worldwide right yeah well
yes I mean that's still pretty this is
longer that's an impressive means
they're still minting cash like crazy I
would yeah it's still definitely still
one of the most profitable games at
least the corn the App Store it's
definitely always on the top five list
yeah and it's just kind of give you a
little bit
right like like Sean Haugh sir who wrote
the the one-year anniversary piece kind
of looked at the big big games in PC
right like Warcraft heard of stone
overwatch all these games combined have
fewer users than Pokemon go no way
crazy yeah but like at the same time
Pokemon go we would all argue is no
longer the pin at the pinnacle that it
used to be I mean like we were talking
about this on the podcast virtually
every single day because this was really
like this this had broken through and
was like the song of the summer
basically yes everybody was playing it
non-stop I I don't know I eventually
gave up on it though right I mean like
yeah anymore either
no no I think they had made some tweaks
it's like probably two or three months
into the game that like I think either
made it difficult I forget I kind of
forget the reason why I quit I remember
light sequencing was always like really
weird
well like fighting gyms yeah like I
always felt those frustrating and like
after a while the the gyms were
dominated by players
yep so many strong Pokemon that you
really didn't have a chance right unless
you poured money to the game and
actually went out all the time looking
for Pokemon building them up they just
it didn't seem worth everyone just went
commercial man just really too bad prize
a game wanted to make money right so the
the primary reason that I eventually
ended up downloading it was the like
during my walk to and from Grand Central
Station yeah and I just realized that I
was like looking at my phone too much it
was like supposed to be like the one
time of the day when I wasn't supposed
to be looking at screens and I just kind
of hated that that had become my life I
mean it was a fun game I just did my
general argument to that was the game
got me to take different routes fine
like I have like a set route that I want
from Penn to our office everyday right
sort of like the most efficient route
but with Pokemon go I was able like it
made me kind of go out of my way to walk
around different parts of the city and
that was kind of nice in hopes of
finding it hopes of finding a vapery and
or whatever I haven't played in a while
go easy on me
next up robots robot robots are taking
over our own Katie Collins visited the
International robotics showcase in
London
where she saw robots that could care for
the elderly perform surgery or even
diagnose stomach cancer which would be
really helpful yep you know in certain
area she mentioned like in rural China
you could use like one of these things
even if you do not have a medical degree
or your low level and that I could
potentially help save lives so it is
interesting to see how robots are
actually being used these days right
mostly in like the medical environment I
mean like they haven't quite taken over
all of our jobs I mean it is kind of
nice right we talked about you know
robots stealing our jobs we talked about
robots taking over the world or sort of
the other end of the spectrum we talked
about sort of superficial uses right
like robots cleaning our floors right
serving of strengths like robotic
bartenders but these are actually robots
that have a real use and actually have a
real impact potential impact on our
lives
yeah well-being so that's kind of nice
you should definitely check it out
lastly we wanted to plug our I hate
package series of stories that look at
online hate control culture our own
cherry calls is the leadoff story today
so sure check it out seen it just a note
to our faithful listeners will be out
for the next two weeks but we did tape a
few specials that will air during the
break be sure to check them out yeah
we'll be back or Ben will be back on
July 24th so maybe you will anyways I'm
Roger Shay I'm Ben Fox Ruben thanks for
listening so let's talk about Pokemon go
I guess Peter in the chat still playing
it
Jonathan Bailey however says am I the
only one who's never played Pokemon go
oh my to be completely honest at least
you know understand I don't know I think
we just bored him to death though now
he's never gonna play it I mean I'm with
bullfrog bullfrog in the chest as I
played Pokemon go for like three months
and quit because I lived where there was
no Pokemon but yeah and now we're in New
York we get spoiled their Pokemon ever
but it's the same once exactly 37
piggies and I stopped caring yeah after
a while
yeah it was 37 yeah I mean I caught
probably 50 of them I mean I had fun for
a couple of months but it did very
quickly get stale because I just want to
go catching and I'm not going to go get
an international plane ticket to keep
playing this game although I was a when
I was a herp I did I remember I did turn
it on I turn it back on
that's kind of cool cuz I was trying to
find mr. mime which was like the Europe
exclusive Pokemon and he was on my radar
and then I was I was running to a
conference and I like should I just
stick around and guess mr. mime I did I
ended up running to cover the conference
like I seriously regret it was like it
was the only time during my week in
Germany that he showed up mmm and I was
looking pretty regularly for him
look at that you really should have
yolo'd that situation you know Mercedes
told your boss I was playing Pokemon go
excuse me
I don't remember important what my
favorite I caught was I caught a couple
Mike I think I thought I caught a
Tentacruel right outside my apartment is
terrifying terrifying frightening
looking
I remember the what's the Buffalo
looking one poor tauros tauros is a u.s.
exclusive one so when I went out to like
Germany I was hanging out with our UK
colleagues and they like looked at my
tourists like oh my god he looks so
majestic literally that's what they said
it's kind of makes me want to download
the game again but they add they added a
bunch a couple of months short I haven't
played it though they did a bunch they I
think they changed the rules around the
gym where like you can't stack
superpower Pokemon at each other
the battles are bit more effective
taller than huge improvements but I
think I left the game the prom is
Niantic honest I mean they were a little
slow to react to the phenomenon like
they didn't address a lot of the issues
people were asking for until way later
and even now like I would argue you know
the key features that you're looking for
like the player 2 player battle never
showed up right that was I think the one
element one dimension a game that would
have helped with the longevity right
like I couldn't fight you I could fight
you right without like our pokemon
trainer on Pokemon and
bite each other that just never happened
one thing that was at least predicted
when Pokemon go came out that I don't
think really has come to pass quite yet
is this concept that AR was going to
explode
thanks to Pokemon go I really don't
think that there have been that many
uses for a are okay I would disagree
because I feel like that helped set the
road like snapchat filters and look at
what Google Apple what all these guys
are doing what they are now like it's
not a coincidence like a year after that
phenomenon like everybody is talking
about AR apples like money or when they
talk about a are kid they talked about
how Pokemon go would look so much better
with a so I would say it definitely
helped I don't think I mean I feel like
snapchat probably has a bigger impact a
longer lasting impact Pokemon go come
out a wider wider a short term impact
I'm getting people to understand
appreciate
I'm curious we have a lot of fantastic
international listeners and you say the
tauros was us exclusive I don't know
what the I know there are exclusive I
don't know who's got what but I know we
have listeners in South Africa we have
listeners in Jamaica Jamaica India and
I'd like to hear what if you have caught
whatever your country's specific like oh
really I thought that was okay then
let's generalize it what was your
favorite Pokemon Yukon I know a CJ
Spiker says he's running a 7 day streak
and I don't is that current or was that
just your your best streak I'd Mel say
every player is like her two days what
oh you were pretty good I don't know no
I remember you had way more Pokemon than
me at one you know I should have had
Joan on cuz she still plays yeah yeah
she still gets hooked on those streaks I
I don't know which is like I think
that's an added layer of the game what
are the strikes
I probably stopped playing before I
think it's like the bike as you every
time you like every day you catch a
Pokemon like you get some yeah which is
a classic
yeah for mobile games for a while there
I was trying to hatch eggs on my walk
but my dad a plan was just obliterated
so I had to step down on that one ah
being the chess is the best he's got
with the Charmeleon oh yeah that's a
good find a couple of people are you
know P oh that they never got a Pikachu
because well I turned it back on during
the holidays oh yeah lucky you
yeah Danny Green as always our boy Danny
Green did someone drive a silver spike
into the Pokemon and see that it finally
kills it off it's so thriving it is old
yeah still doing pretty well I don't
know I I'd come back if they would give
us a more gameplay more akin to the
Gameboy game like you said if we had
user battles or something like that that
could be fun make new friends instead of
just like trying to out catch each other
you're you're right to that it was just
a repetitive game yeah I'm sorry on
extent I thought it became a phenomenon
is a little surprising I would always I
would argue though as someone in the
chats making fun of their inevitably
long loading screens I would argue
though most these mobile games are
repetitive by nature right like clans or
clash Royale yeah it's very repetitive
right after like the gameplay is cool
for a little while but like after a
while it's just couture I remember I
played that snake game for a while what
was it called like snake io or something
like that
there was a Nokia 3310 no no no there it
was on the iPhone and uu it was it was
you would play the snake game against
like a hundred people in real time and
you would have to like eat them and it
was it was a pretty fun game but it was
also by the way apparently social
repetitive it was meant to be fairly
like a trade battle is going on soon I
don't know what that means like this
this is the first time I've load the
game in a while there is a star unit on
here me raid battle near us yeah I know
there I mean there's a few people in the
chat pointing out their big events going
on over the place and thank you
pointing out that there were no
exclusives in South Africa what's up
Jesse yeah yeah that's I you would think
they would didn't brace that more
wouldn't you like I guess get you to go
get you globe-trotting get a deal with
like Delta you know Pokemon go they did
with different stores sprint had one
when they launched their new Pokemon
they didn't realize was like you don't
need to go into the store to activate a
poky stop like you just walk right by it
which so they thought this was gonna
bring in a whole bunch of traffic but I
don't know you don't need to go into a
Sprint store you know a Sprint customer
well I had to go to the store bullfrog
says raid battle run for cover I don't
know what is that even what is the right
battle disconnected from this I think
it'll be interesting to see to when the
next mobile game hits this big this was
really they thought Mario was going to
be a playing bejeweled yeah but it was
really like a rare awesome summer thing
and it was confluence of things where
people were out for the summer or
available to actually play the game it
became like a social phenomenon that
doesn't happen all the time like I kind
of put a similar in mind set with I
remember Dance Dance Revolution and how
that was the first big deal to get kids
up and moving and getting physical and
they were great going back to their cave
a success stories about people who
legitimately shed a lot of weight and
got into better health because of the
game cuz it was fantastic exercise now
to a lesser degree Pokemon goes just got
to walking but that's a start
that's huge and I mean I'll give him
total credit for that but I did just get
bored with the game is it I mean it's a
lot of other it's not quite no just I
would say like Angry Birds is probably
like the last real mobile game like the
killer app there everyone was playing a
game Jesse says it's a fad like fidgets
spinners
they just Spears are they soul thing
people using them I don't know I don't
know Alfred is super into them so
so this was also now that now we were
talking about like our Pokemon go
memories I remember like going to
Madison Square Park and during like the
height of Pokemon go you would see like
groups of people congregating around
yeah that was like a really rare thing
to happen with games where where we're
seeing like walking down like my
neighborhood in Long Island like seeing
two police officers just was so cool
strike up a conversation with them like
hey guys caught actually talking kind of
yeah yeah yeah there was this shared
experience even more people are still
talking about how they'd love to see if
we could actually duel against other
users but at the same time ink and
graphite is asking us to talk about
Pokemon duel I don't even know what that
is
baekpa Kondos a it's either console game
works for the des Eaux was it a new game
game yeah it's all I think it's in my
head is like is that a new mode in
Pokemon sorry guys were Pokemon goes
like basically the extent of our
pokemons knowledge like Alfred is
actually more into Pokemon right we are
he's not here played the original
Pokemon RPG that was it no oh I like
this advice from svet he says uh frisbee
golf was the best way to hatch eggs
that's a good point
this gets you to constantly running in
circles right just don't well you don't
have to look at your phone hatch an egg
you just have to keep moving it just has
to keep knowing that you're in motion
and have your the app open and right
he'll your data yeah so here it is get a
Wi-Fi routed out to your back yard and
play frisbee golf frolf same stuff I
guess I mean the egg thing was probably
the most beneficial because that made
you consistently yes you had to walk a
set amount of distance sometimes you can
camp and just waste Pokemon to come to
you it's true but the eggs were the most
yeah it was really I would just start oh
yeah it's like getting a kid geez like
I've got
pidgeys already know did another one so
before we put this godforsaken topic to
rest what did what was Shawn saying is
the future is going to hold for this for
this franchise uh we don't you know more
the same more the same my antics not
super forthcoming with a lot of future
plans yeah one would expect that they
would do spin-offs and they probably
should have by now especially like after
they made such a big splash with the
first one and that's certainly a
possibility so going into the future so
this wouldn't be Niantic necessarily but
let's talk about some potential
spin-offs where they could go with
Nintendo mobile gaming since they're
slowly but surely kind of embracing that
I know that there's a few people
mentioning Animal Crossing I wonder how
that could translate into an AR type
mobile games how could they do they'll
de it would it just be another runner no
I think I mean if you look at the trend
of games that they're launching that was
a traditional JRPG really was a Fire
Emblem the mobile one oh I haven't seen
the mobile yet there's a motor version
Fire Emblem but it's more it's a little
bit more card based okay on my personal
wish list I would love to see a Metroid
a our game on mobile in a similar
fashion where you could just like shoot
down Metroid's and you're in your local
vicinity that would be how cool would
that be and that's just locked down to
two Nintendo and there's lots of other a
arte because those busters you know
already had the back the foundation for
that game already existed so your
Ghostbusters idea I think would be
pretty awesome and would get people to
go to like the New York Public Library
to try to catch stuff trying to catch
slime go to Central Park in the hotel
yeah yeah like all the major all the
major no landmarks get you bonus points
how cool would that be but I mean that's
that's again we're in New York so sorry
everybody else but I mean if they
franchise it out you could get
they go to your local firehouse period
go to your local Eiffel Tower no big
deal yeah I think they'd be pretty cool
I also like svet keeps giving us great
pointers on how to scam the Pokemon
system he says the hatch an egg you
could tape your phone to a ceiling fan
and turn it on for an hour but you're
like movie one stationaries thought I I
now want to try that it sounds like a
pretty good dog I would I'm now I'm
tempted to like if I don't know it just
to try it yeah all right
we're almost at a time if anybody's got
any questions about robots should we
talk about the the I hate package real
quick cuz we got we had to kind of short
sheet then that's a good one yeah yeah
mostly I would just recommend checking
it out
Terry does a really good job of bringing
up anecdotes sort of colorful
descriptions of sort of the issue
this is definitely an overview story
there's there are more specific stories
the hit specific points to the next four
or five days we've got about five
stories in the hopper and this timing is
pretty good seeing how like the whole
CNN things in there prominently but the
whole CNN reddit reddit or redditor yeah
the quick apology and now it became it
went like again so quickly so what a
mess yeah oh it's a mess as always all
of the links to our mentioned stories
will be in the show description down
below yep
real quick before we go Chris Gonzales
and vinas and more than a few are
suggesting duck hunt or a mobile AR game
yeah that really is a no-brainer that's
really I think it's the same idea that I
had with Metroid I'm just more I guess
bias towards Metroid because that's what
I grew up on but totally duck hunt yeah
as long as there's a cheat where you can
shoot the dog not that they don't love
dogs I love dogs I I can't bear the
thought of injuring any real dog but
that pixel dog can go straight to hell
I know that is an annoying
dog you're right yeah but I love that
idea and that would happen
Nintendo we know you're watching get on
it we have a bunch of lovely people who
actually are watching and on that thank
you we do thank you it's time for our
biggest break yet after we've done the
show for a little over a year well over
about a year and a half almost now
fortunately yeah we just had too many
logistical complications yeah so we're
taking a summer hiatus yeah and we will
be back on the 24th whether we've earned
it or not is up to you yeah too much but
yeah we did we are pre recording a
handful of episodes about the episodes
for some filler noise to break it up in
between there they're fun they're timely
yeah so check it out and yeah there are
no Q&amp;amp;A s for those even though you can
pretend they'll be posted in video &amp;amp;
audio form for you to consume at your
own leisure yep and then I'm not know
let's take a break so we start singing
boys to imagine we watch out yes that is
that how the break begins it's so yeah
if you like a the--you so hurt here
