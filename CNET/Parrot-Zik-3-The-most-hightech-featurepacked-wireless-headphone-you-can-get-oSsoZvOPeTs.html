looks a lot like the z2 but has been
improved in some significant ways this
new model which also features active
noise cancellation and is probably the
most high-tech feature packed headphone
you can get cost $400 the biggest change
is on the outside are the new colors and
textures including croco and over
stitched effects also for those of you
with big heads the headband has been
enlarged in an effort to improve comfort
on the feature front that touch controls
in the right ear cup remain as does the
removable and replaceable battery which
provides about 7 to 8 hours of battery
life with both noise canceling and
Wireless turned on that's not great but
battery life does improve if you listen
at more moderate volume levels or turn
off noise canceling the headphone now
has a wireless charging option though
you do have to buy a compatible Qi
charging accessory to use it the noise
cancelling smartly adapts to your
environment and there's a high quality
wired USB listening mode for those of
you who just don't think Bluetooth audio
streaming cuts it the headphone pairs
with a companion app that allows you to
tweak both the sound and the amount of
noise cancellation and check how much
battery life you have left you can also
download preset equalizer settings from
a variety of artists I personally don't
like playing around with all the digital
processing modes and some of them can
make things sound a little weird but
thankfully you can turn everything off
and just use the default EQ setting
which is fairly well balanced
I had a few initial hiccups with
updating the firmware and pairing and
repairing the headphone but once I got
everything working properly I was
impressed with the Zeke 3 it's one of
the best sounding Bluetooth headphones
with good detail and strong bass and the
noise cancelling is very effective it's
not quite as comfortable as boses
bluetooth headphones or the Beats Studio
wireless but it's still a comfortable
over your headphone and one of the best
options for those looking for a
bluetooth headphone that also offers
active noise cancellation
