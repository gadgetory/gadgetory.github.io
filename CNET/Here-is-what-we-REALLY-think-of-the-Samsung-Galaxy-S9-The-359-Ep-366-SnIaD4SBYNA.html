we're in post bomb cyclone recovery mode
it's episode 366 of the 359 podcast I'm
BBJ and your host today are Roger Chang
and dan freakin Ackerman all the way in
from the blizzard that's right you made
it out from the snow it was a big Trek
yeah was it how it was it hard for you
though was just kind of raining
yesterday yeah actually it was way worse
for us we had no power all last night
Ben Fox Truman are normal who would have
been our normal host today is out
because he still has no power in his
home
so yeah still there's it's there's still
some shaking out to do a lot of a lot of
dirty grimy snow on the streets oh yeah
path to the snow dogs being walked use
your imagination Roger what are we
talking about all right so we're we're
devoting the entire show to the galaxy s
9 the reviews are out so we're gonna
break down everything for you
Jessica Colcord isn't here obviously but
we're gonna break down her review and
really talk about the nuances both Dan
and I have had a chance to play with the
phone so we're here to answer all your
questions about the GS 9 so without
further ado again giving big questions
leave them in the comments section Brian
will pick up the best we will get to
them in 3 minutes and 59 seconds from 3
to welcome to the 359 I'm Roger Chang
and I'm Dan Ackerman galaxy s 9 reviews
are out and so what's the verdict our
own Jessica dual court says the phone
works two steps forward but one step
back so a couple pros the camera is
pretty decent it's it is definitely an
upgrade design is great and it obviously
has the latest specs and decent battery
life there are some cons though the
camera the big boast of the camera is
low-light photos it's unclear whether or
not they're actually that great
especially in those darker conditions
they're brighter but they may not be
clear the AR emoji and Jen and I
disagree about this but AR emoji for me
was completely half-baked and then
intelligence cam the facial recognition
system is not as secure as face ID yeah
I got a pointless yeah it's a it's the
retina scan and if that doesn't work it
switches to the regular face
camera which is not as advanced his face
ID for Apple's advanced not secure is
the biggest point of that correct
because it doesn't have the 3d sensor in
the front camera and so I want to get to
a are emojis which you know I think it's
probably the most interesting feature on
the new feature on this you have to say
that's the most interesting feature
means it's a bit of a stretch as an
upgrade right right so you know I
disagree I look like I said I think this
is a bit of a half-baked it doesn't work
as well doesn't really read your facial
gestures although well and it explicably
gave me a man bun which i think you'd
look at with a man but I don't think I
do
I think we have to try I think we have
to do our test this for a while but what
do you think of the AR emoji try I
thought it was a lot of people not that
I thought it was better than people said
not great it's not a replacement for the
an emojis from Apple that do the really
great face tracking it doesn't do really
great face tracking because again it
doesn't have that 3d special sensor on
the front but I thought it made some
pretty good versions of me and some
other people once you tweak it a little
bit you can have some fun with it I
liked it it makes a little kind of
stamps the little gifts dance yes yeah
I'm alive I did a live test on CBS this
morning where I did a very you know when
you do a live tech demo on TV man you're
taking yeah so nerve-racking we did live
a are emojis of Norah O'Donnell and John
Dickerson and and me uh and they all
came out pretty good now we could have
spent more time tweaking them later but
the fact that it does it so quickly
right I think it's kind of cool well I
mean look that's those are fair points
this is hopefully this is just like
version 1 and they'll get better over
time hopefully with software updates but
you can see the video here like where
we're trying to sow it and there's the
man bun I do not look good like man love
it no no and how does it even know it
cuz it only looks at the front of your
face it just it just guess randomly
generated and guess there's a mic a man
bun guy so there you go I want time with
a camera as well obviously you know
their big focus was on the idea that
this is the camera reimagined right some
of the big things it has the industry
first dual aperture mode an F 2.4 stop
for daylight photos F 1.5
for nighttime photos did you get a
chance to try out some of the kind of
low layer and you know you can let more
light in and make a brighter picture
that doesn't write freeze necessarily
there you know the resolution or the
sharpness of the photo but more than
more than that that's it's kind of cool
to see that in action if you see a super
close-up shot yeah but the fact that the
dual lens camera is only on the larger
of the two phones yes I think I think is
them is almost the bigger photo story in
a way what the big feature they've been
touting you don't get if you get the
regular right well just to be clear
though that dual aperture setting is on
both it is on both phones it is just
it's basically the shutter to closes and
shuts a little bit tighter we tried this
out actually in Barcelona in a bar at
like 1:00 a.m. 2:00 a.m. dark setting
really the optimal setting for a
low-light photo test the photos were
definitely way brighter than the iPhone
10 but I know it's the quality the
clarity of the photos were not that
great a little bit fuzzy a little bit
yellow like when you push real film and
it get more grey right right so you know
it's basically a toss-up I would say and
I think this is justice conclusion like
if you have a gs-7 basically have a
two-year-old phone or older this is a
pretty worthy upgrade right if you have
a phone that's less than a year old a
year old this is not especially if you
have the Galaxy s8 from last year this
phone looks the same it feels the same
it's such an incremental upgrade I think
these companies get caught in this trap
of the annual upgrade cycle where they
have to have a new product every year at
about the same time whether they need it
or not right alright so for more on
these stories check us out at CNET I'm
Roger Cheng I'm Dan Ackerman thanks for
listening I like your comment Dan about
how if you have to tell the movie and
then there's already something wrong I
mean Samsung was telling the camera as
sort of their main afraid but I feel
like the AR moji was like one of the
standout features from it was one of the
only the kind of bullet points you could
really put on it yeah and show people
exactly and Plus does anyone feel like
their high-end smartphone camera is not
good enough already at the point of such
diminishing returns yes even an original
pixel you know the GS 8 iPhone 7 even
the iPhone 6s plus like those are all
pretty good cameras right and so yeah if
you've got a fairly casual user what are
you doing with these photos and and they
already print great they already look
great online and they were too great in
photo
you know gallery
the exo marked the you know the hammer
rating firm I think gave the GS 9 she
has my plus one point higher score than
the pixel two which was not reigning
champions so and I think it's two points
above the iPhone and okay yeah but the
thing of it is like I think that doesn't
really matter unless you're a
professional right if you're a
professional photographer who wants to
use a phone to take photos and I can see
photographers moving in that direction
right for some types of tasks sure then
maybe that's the phone you'll get if
you're if you're a parent or a college
student or whatever the photos are
already more than good enough and have
been for years
yep I would say with in terms of
low-light photos that still is a real
issue with all camera phone I don't
think Samsung really solved it I know
they made a big deal about brighter
photos but if the photos are brighter
but they lose that clarity I don't know
if it's really worth with that sacrifice
I think we're this area for everyone to
improve this software wise in how you
tweak the photos after almost implement
I know when they take a photo with
either an Android phone or an iPhone
they use that little auto fix yeah on
every photo and it really does a lot of
great stuff but it could be smarter
right I think as camera AI continues to
improve you'll see much better benefits
from improving how it does those auto
fixes and Auto Corrections than in
making you know the resolution a little
better or adding more you know we've
already doesn't yeah the pixel we don't
need anymore megapixel right yeah maybe
you don't I say the only thing actually
we're talking about on this phone is the
mechanical aperture yeah I think that is
actually a cool feature we are not seen
that anytime before so it's let's tau
innovation where innovation is worth it
problem is it works automatically there
is a pro mode where you can you can
change it toggle it yourself but it
switches on and off automatically based
on situation and sometimes it gets a
ride sometimes it doesn't get it right
and so yeah it's look I yeah give them
prop for for adding something new to the
camera I just don't know if it really
helped all that much it's it's it's
tough to have a bunch of standout
features year after year we have upgrade
kind of the same type of phone and you
go like and last year's story we're
talking about this before the podcast
began last year story
brand-new phone completely redesigned
was coming back from the disaster of the
note seven it was four there was a lot
more to it beyond just the phone right
there was a phone there were the
features the new look
there was a story behind it this
comeback story this year it sort of like
well you know it's it's a new phone
doesn't really look the same does it
look the beginning of the year so we
have to have a new one so here it is
yeah yep
taking questions from the chat first out
shout shout out to Jason rebel eddo who
says he just ordered the brand-new Zack
Morris banana phone all right Jason
first one on the list but to be fair
though the banana phone is not the same
as Zack Morris phone does that poor soul
is like a giant brick oh you're right
you're right I said the banana phone as
a matrix phone yeah yeah I'm sorry sorry
oh did you insert the Zack matrix
reference or no Jason said Zack Morris
phone I mistook that and said banana
phone Zack Morris phone was like that
you were like a player giant the brick
phone the charging station yeah only
through my first half cup of coffee just
bear with me here let's talk about the
aperture again key V Quang it says is
the galaxy s nines dual aperture really
that impressive so let's expand on what
we talked about earlier in the
abbreviated podcast Jessica did do a lot
of shots I'm gonna try to dig some of
the examples out which I couldn't get to
quick enough because four minutes is not
enough time right so let's talk about
let's talk about camera yeah I mean
let's slide with the cam I mean the
aperture the idea that it could switch
between these two different apertures I
feel like physical change rather
software change where other cameras use
a low light mode where they basically
just brighten the photo they basically
change you know they do a digital write
tweak of it this is actually changing
the amount of light that's coming in
that's that's that's important it's
definitely very cool to see it in action
like when you when you kind of see it up
most you see the the lens kind of shrink
and then an expand based on the needs
just to know like Jeff in her review
Jessica note and I I tested the phone
but not extensively Jessica's obviously
spent a lot more time with it
she note that the notes that the
low-light photos are unrealistically
bright and blurry so that is an issue
that's going to be the trade-off when
you've got that lower aperture
well one of these motors was brighter
yeah professional camera like tools and
said
like manual focus like aperture control
all that stuff is best in the hands of
professional photographers who know what
it means and know when to use it and how
to use it yes when you just tack these
onto a consumer product you're gonna get
the auto set and when you have those
lower apertures your camera really needs
to be steady for this one right so
that's not gonna work if you're holding
your phone in your hands so that's I
think again I like I like this on
principle on paper it all seems really
great band practice doesn't really work
as well as Samsung would like sure sure
uh taking more questions from the chat
hold on and bringing it up right now
Oh Danny Green's asking how we how we
doing on they'll drop test that's got to
be forthcoming oh it's coming yeah we
don't actually have our own units to
drop yet so that's coming though we
would definitely be doing a drop test
who doesn't like to see destruction yeah
exactly from Matthew dacher is anyone
going to mention Android pee also what
does Android gonna do after Z oh that's
a great question we still have a couple
more letters couple iterations a few
more years before they happen so a few
but that'll come quicker and this is
gonna be like y2k all over again I don't
know maybe it'll just change the whole
naming scheme like get away from from
confection they'll go to national parks
right and mountains around California no
that's that's already been taken oh okay
because I've just been taken already
turns Android P I mean we don't have a
lot of information about it I mean I
think the most one of the most
noteworthy things is this allowance for
the knotch
mmm right it's supposed to make it
easier for OMS to create notches and so
Android will actually work around that
physical whatever little cut out cut out
right and so you know like essential
when they created their version with the
notch they actually had to like redesign
allows the software to incorporate that
notch and now with the new system of the
new version OMS will be able to just
basically just put out whatever notch
they want and Android will work with it
I think it's just interesting because
now we're seeing at least if you look at
all the rumors like Huawei LG one plus a
sous all these companies are coming out
with notch phones and it's like one of
the most I don't know love it or
hated features on the iPhone 10 like a
necessary evil right and was they wanted
you had to put that valley a design
compromise right and so now now
everyone's it's become it's gone from
like this kind of like glaring ugly
thing to a status symbol for a lot of
people because the iPhone 10 is so
expensive mmm if you have a notch phone
and means you've got a you can afford a
notch phone but it but at least in the
US market how many people are buying
phones from these other brands yeah yeah
yeah that's a good point I mean this is
I guess more from a global perspective
right particularly in places like China
where Apple still holds a lot of cachet
and now it's like the Apple brand is now
linked to a notch yeah and so everyone
else is building out not just phones
that's why you see a1 plus you see a
soos these are not hand makers that
handset makers that work in the US but
they do sell law phones in China the
Samsung have a big China market for
phones that's decent size effort for
these premium super premium phones yes
yeah yeah yeah but it's not it's not
anywhere I think they're getting they're
definitely getting beaten up by the
likes of like Huawei one plus and Xiaomi
in China A's but yeah seriously they
don't have notch they they keep mashing
the knotch so I don't know you have an
iPhone 10 right I do what do you think
of them I don't really notice it yeah it
kind of fades after a while right
although there are a lot of apps that
have not been optimized with a notch or
four the slightly different aspect ratio
that's right so so you do have some
problems in some feather I noticed that
early on it's gotten a lot better though
I've noticed so my apps have been
updated to take advantage that's the
magic of the Apple ecosystem there's
things just kind of get updated in the
background and you don't really notice
it has a same magic listen that's what
we're it's just kind of working
eventually he's like oh everything got
updated it's why everyone's on the same
version of iOS right we have such
fragmentation we're talking about the
right boy what does it matter how many
people are you gonna have that on their
phones that they bought very over in the
last six months or last year Android
Oreo is not very well it's it's a huge
issue when we tell people day in and day
out the single most important thing you
can do to be secure in your personal
digital devices is to make sure
everything is updated if you're on an
old OS well that's part of the problem
there is for a lot of these customers
like that is not an option being able to
upgrade to the latest opera
it's just not an option you you know
you're stuck with carriers mandating
more tests handset makers are just
sometimes they just don't want update
yeah so I'll tell you though a way
around this it's not an unsolvable
problem because we used to have this in
the computer space and I'll tell you
exactly what happened
any time you had a gaming laptop or
laptop with a discrete graphics card
from AMD or envy in it in a desktop you
could always go and download the drivers
directly from Nvidia but on a laptop you
specifically had to get updated drivers
from your PC manufacturers Dell or HP or
whoever else yeah several years ago they
they open that up they said you know
what we're not gonna do it this way
anymore
everyone agreed you can just get your
the Nvidia will make the laptop graphics
card drivers you can download them
install them you can have them done
automatically and Google's to some
extent does this now they've introduced
programs that were the security updates
go through like not the full operating
system updates but there are like
software patches things that are
critical for your phone to go through
certain phones but it hasn't reached
everywhere Android Market is so huge mmm
so fragmented that there are gonna be
phones inevitably that get stuck in the
past but if like the Windows market is
so fragmented too people have different
types of computers to spend years trying
to consolidate everything yes still not
really they've done a good job pushing
people towards Windows 10 parks because
it was free - yes upgrade but you don't
have to go to down there HP or anybody
for updates you can go to Microsoft and
Nvidia and whoever I just think it's an
exponentially harder problem for Android
there's so many more different devices
so many different more manufacturers in
different regions
it just it's it's a mess yeah it's a big
problem to get everyone on the same page
for a while exactly are we ready for
some more questions no but go on anyway
you guys are really getting into it
there first off I have to point out that
McKell so tatin says dan you sound like
Weird Al Yankovic oh that could have bad
I think that's good very good from
Carlos Martinez so what kind of
assistance is there on the galaxy s 9 Oh
unfortunately it's you know who big
speak XP I play experimenting in Bixby
it doesn't play as primary a role in
this phone as the GSA like there's no
dedicated Bixby pond right
I'm not I think the boys a program
though they're right I know but I think
the key is it's not something that talks
to you so much anymore as in it's sort
of a keeper of smart AI camera mechanics
yes like that translate stuff and the
recognizer yeah you basically you can
hold bixby vision up to it like a sign
with the foreign language and I'll
automatically translate it so even
though it says you know don't walk here
in Spanish it'll actually appear in
English for you so that's kind of cool
very Google lends life I think it uses a
lot of Google resources for that but
they've definitely downplayed big say
they've rebranded it without verbally
rebranding it and said oh it's it's an
AI camera helper box yeah it's less of
an active assistant horror of a passive
visualised specialized more passive kind
of works in the background a little more
they had a they had a feature they
talked about that was not ready yet and
I believe it's probably still not
launched yet where it could look at food
and guesstimate how many calories are in
that food no it did work we didn't work
yeah yeah we've been working pre-law it
I mean it didn't always recognize things
yeah it was yeah it it doesn't work
quite well yeah well it's still pretty
early yeah it's funny LG with their geo
their fee 30s mm-hmm cue has a similar
feature we were trying that out trying
the the AI vision I did know to
recognize food good not calorie wise I
think it recognized like one of my
colleagues is food as well yes he's a
doughnut and goes oh what's what's a
doughnut on average okay here's here's
an average for doughnut right if you
need a phone to tell you that I will say
impressively the the GS a galaxy s 9 did
recognize my gin and tonic as a gin and
tonic oh so not a vodka tonic kind of
impressive it was cotton Brussels like
how did it know that I usually don't
know am i coming through your social
media profiles and see which drinks you
tweet about most and created a drinkers
profile of you except I'm not
I don't drink gin tonics ever so like
that was an unusual drink that I had
knew you were in the mood for something
different that day maybe tell I'm
unaware
/ with that sooner than later for the
record I don't hate donuts but we all
know that they're not exactly healthy
expanding on Carlos since we were
talking about assistance anyways he
wants to know if we have any input down
the old creepy Alexa laughter no oh yeah
my didn't laugh yesterday yeah mine
didn't either I think Amazon's putting
out a fix for it
as far as I know I did not witness this
and I was neither did I yeah I ask Alexa
to laugh because we're people were
hearing but I just got one ha like that
and the whole deal was it wasn't
supposed to be like you couldn't like
call for right right who's happening is
my happy way maybe there are other
laughs when I asked for laughs I just
got a a fake laugh ha yeah that would
scare the crap out of out of my got more
than one so that's a horror movie season
on Black Mirror yeah from Rosanna Minos
the question is if the emoji avatar can
be shared with anyone or if it's
restricted to Samsung users only know it
yeah exactly the kid files but not lot
real-time you can make a little video
you basically record a little video or
something and then it's and then it's a
video got it from Raymond how bad is the
bloatware now the latest Samsung I used
was Essex and I had to get rid of it
because the bloatware was killing the
performance oh yeah disappointing your
carrier but I mean they've done a good
job pairing it back a little bit Darce
random stuff there's a random apps a lot
of duplicate of apps that are just fair
like there's also like Samsung feature
creep yeah where they have so many
different like Samsung branded apps and
there's nobody what ever you there are
so plenty of those I'm sorry yeah here's
a good question from Scott Maya picking
up on the point that Dan you made
why do Android devices take longer to
get the latest updates if there's
different manufacturers why is the OS
from Google well I mean Google builds
the OS and so it's different because I'm
at the gimped updates right so basically
every handset manufacturer tweaks
Android to their own specifications
Samsung to the earlier questions
has plenty of bloatware or different
software that it loads on to Android and
it customizes every every handset maker
customizes Android to some extent and so
those minor customizations make it a
little bit more complicated for them to
run an update a full update of the
operating system and then if you add
into the carrier right exactly then you
add in the carriers who also need tests
because they need to make sure that that
new operating system works well with
their network and really depending on
which carrier like Verizon particularly
is is very strict with their tests it
can take months to get an operating
system through that process that's why
you have such a disparity on when phones
get updates but you've got a pixel phone
that sort of like direct to you is
directly a Google phone those updates
come really fast but if it's a Samsung
phone which is heavily customised
there's a huge amount of work that
Samsung has to do as as well as the
carrier before can even get to you and
the carrier has to feel motivated to go
and do and support older phones and
stuff whereas with an iPhone no matter
who the carrier is you get your updates
directly from Apple yes that many
settings with that phone that is kind of
like the best sort of the unfair
advantage that Apple has because they
had that bad negotiating tactic from the
get-go
they're basically able to set the ground
rules like we're dealing with these uh
these OS updates directly to consumer
you guys stay out of it and that's why
you don't have like a teen team apps
like right on your iPhone exactly you
don't have like a TT branding on those
phones right bring back MapQuest hey
we're almost out of time but here's a
question from Jason again I did peel to
the s9 do we know what type of
headphones it comes with it's like a
step up they're not like just stock
headphones I think are the AKG yeah it
looks like now I don't know specifically
what models these are but I've worked a
little with AKG mics in the past and
I've been impressed with their work and
so clearly though phone jack standard
studio headphone - correct yeah they do
professional grade equipment with thing
that means pressing me most and this is
just on my own glance is that the cable
itself for the headphones looks sturdier
looks like it's really
and I'm less angle prone hopefully who
uses wired headphones anymore I feel
like we've moved almost exclusively to
blue 12 you do if you're an iPhone user
kind of have to yeah yeah listen the
only reason I still hang on to that
myself is just because I have a pair of
professional-grade mixing headphones
that I like very around with me and
they're not Wireless yeah yep
let's take one more do we know anything
about the battery life so far I thought
that was supposed to be one of the
strengths of the 845 chip yes so the
Jessica does tell that battery life is
decent you probably get a whole day's
worth if you're a power user probably
less than that but guess 8:45 Snapdragon
chip runs a lot more efficiently they
didn't make a huge amount of changes to
display or the which is a big battery
hog there so presumably the battery is
well and note that the larger phone the
s9 Plus has a bigger battery so we could
run longer yeah and interestingly those
845 chips are going to be in a bunch of
laptops this year yeah and they claim
that those laptops will run for like 20
hours because they're basically running
Windows 10 but on a phone ship yeah but
we'll see how they do performance wise
and we'll see how they do battery wise
I'm kind of interested with the specs on
that chip how warm the phone is going to
get personally is that something that
always irritated me I've had a couple of
different phones and the most recent
memory as I've been bouncing around and
I had a couple of them just heat right
up in my pocket here and they were older
they were older but when you start
putting this much yeah horse power and
I'm it's so it's not necessarily putting
horse power it's when you're using that
horse power through we noticed when we
were running erm oh geez the phone did
get warm yeah but if you're doing
regular things like you know browser the
Internet no it's not

phone now like if you're doing the
regular things you do on a phone not
making phone calls we are out of time
