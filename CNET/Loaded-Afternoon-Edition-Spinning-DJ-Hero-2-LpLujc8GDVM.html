and it's time to get loaded sony
launched a new line of vios some of
these have been out in Europe for a
while but the new US models include the
e-series it comes in a variety of colors
and sizes between 14 and 15 inches
there's also a new all-in-one
touchscreen l-series it comes in a
little over 21 inches with a
high-definition display and finally the
new p series which is the clutch size
version it has 3g and an accelerometer
so you can turn it upright like a book
all these are available for pre-order
today google is launching Maps preview
in gmail and google buzz this means when
someone emails you and address Google
will recognize that and show you the map
inside that email rather than make you
copy and paste it into Google Maps
yourself this is a labs feature so you
have to turn it on in the settings menu
it only works in the US for now and I'm
hoping it works when you create a
calendar event from an email as well in
other google mapping news you can also
send Google Maps straight to your ford
car in sync navigation system so within
Matthew just choose send and then send
yourself the directions in the car and
away you go and Activision has announced
DJ Hero 2 this is a follow-up to DJ hero
one with songs from dr. Dre Kanye
Rihanna lady gaga of course and more to
promote the new game Xbox Live and
PlayStation Store users can download a
few free tracks between june eighth and
June fourteenth the game itself will
launch in the fall with a party bundle
that includes turntables and a
microphone that's your news for today
I'll see you tomorrow thanks for
watching i'm natali del conte with Cena
and you've just been loaded</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
