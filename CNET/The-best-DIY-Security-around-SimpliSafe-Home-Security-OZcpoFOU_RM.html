we're taking a look at simply safe
winner of our editor's choice simply
safe is a home security option with no
contract that you install yourself get
the components in the mail you'll plug
in the base tower here and then you'll
stick up the rest of the components
using the sticky tabs on the back all
the devices communicate wirelessly to
one another so it's a very nice
attractive system you won't have to
drill into your walls you won't have to
wire anything special into your house
the only thing you'll have to plug in is
the base station and even the base
station has a power backup so if your
power goes out like now the base station
will still stay powered simply safe also
protects you with a cellular backup so
this tower here has got a SIM card
inside of it and just like your phone
it's going to be able to call for help
if you have any trouble at home now
packages will simply say start at about
two hundred and twenty nine dollars and
they go all the way up to over five
hundred they've got multiple options and
they've also got different options on
the fee you'll pay per month fees start
at $14.99 a month and there's also a
$19.99 and $24.99 option depending on
which package you go with you'll get a
different assortment of sensors and you
can add additional sensors out of cart
if you want to cover additional doors
windows or have an extra motion sensor
you've got contact sensors here motion
sensors you've got the keypad alarm
where you can type in your code and
activate the system or deactivate it
you've got the panic siren that's quite
loud
you've got a smoke detector you can add
that's we like that a lot and they also
have a carbon monoxide detector leak
detectors freeze detectors a lot of
really cool gadgets you can integrate
into this system for comprehensive
security now in terms of aesthetic the
design of simply safe might be a little
bit underwhelming but I have to say the
design of the system itself is brilliant
there are a lot of really really
thoughtful touches for the keypad for
instance you can program a code and
additional codes for house guests that
won't be able to access your settings
but then you can also program a duress
code and what this is is a code that
will see activate the system but still
silently call the police so if someone's
forcing you to turn the system off you
can punch that code in they'll think
it's off but the police will be on the
way you can control simply say from a
smartphone app or from their website and
both
those i thought were very well-designed
and offered you everything that you'll
need to control the system with ease it
is very easy to use it's very very
simple to set up if you want to
comprehensive security system that's
going to do the job well but you don't
want to dish out long contracts from ADT
or big expensive monthly fees I think 25
bucks per month for this system is
actually a very fair price one that I
feel comfortable paying for CNET I'm Rui
