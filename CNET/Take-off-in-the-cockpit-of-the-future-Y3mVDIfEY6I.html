deck of the future this is an
experimental dasa falcon we're honeywell
tests out displays and warning systems
to help pilots see what they can't
eventually pilots will be able to use
their voice to control a plane and even
take off and land vertically like flying
cars the point of all this is to make
air travel safer and more efficient for
pilots and passengers we visited
Honeywell in Phoenix Arizona to see this
tech at work 3d representation of the
airport in front of us now there's no
air liar out there that has this there's
no actually even this is no ordinary
flight display it's what Honeywell calls
Smart View synthetic vision or a virtual
representation of the world outside the
cockpit pulled from a database terrain
runway information and obstacles are all
shown on the pilots primary flight
display and we could turn on our
infrared camera I can see it search to
fill in details and it gives you it's
all about situational awareness it's all
about knowing where you are with respect
to train in this case but also traffic
small indicators like this arrow can
help reorient a pilot if they Bank the
plane too far to one side so this is 45
degrees a bank here so I've got a
recovery you know that helps me know
which way I need to roll back some of
this follow me oh it's amazing if they
roll the wrong direction you know
instead of pool you can be over speeding
the airplane over Jean the airplane
faster than you probably anticipate an
extended center line helps pilots land
on the right runway with audible safety
alerts when needed once the plane is on
the ground 2d and 3d maps make it easier
to navigate an unfamiliar Airport rather
than just following the signs coming up
to a taxiway like this you can see it's
hard to figure out which one is which if
you were given clearance to go on
Charlie 6 that's that one there and it
makes it easy for us to see it could
even be possible for air traffic control
to enter a taxi path for the pilot then
it automatically shows up on the display
that's where we're we're wanting it to
go right now those the infrastructure
doesn't necessarily exist for that but
we're set up for that all these tools
can help reduce a pilots workload during
the busiest flight periods of taxi
takeoff and landing synthetic vision is
already on some business jets from
Gulfstream but the first commercial jet
to be certified should be the Embraer e
2 then it's up to the airline to adopt
it Honeywell is also looking to develop
technology that might remove the need
for a runway altogether
this 280 pound megawatt generator is
designed for vertical takeoff and
landing to power flying cars so the
first application or the application
we're working on now is for DARPA we're
team with Aurora flight sciences and
rolls-royce it's called a lightning
strike vehicle and we're hopeful to get
this technology mature enough
by-the-bye about the april/may timeframe
to to go off and then demonstrate that
flight further down the road this
generator can support a vehicle carrying
around five people engineer's estimate
around five to ten years before this
technology is mature enough to be put
into production before departure voice
assistants are already in our homes and
cars but they're also coming to cockpits
brakes landing gear it's all there yep
it understands Australian pretty soon
you can take off unlike Alexa this pilot
assistant won't respond to general
questions pilots have to use a specific
cockpit control language to minimize
misunderstandings as we build larger and
larger vocabularies and put into the
neural Nets we can go up and get up into
you know maybe 10% word error rate which
is about 90 percent accuracy it also has
to work are the loud cockpit and engine
noise which is simulated here in the
test lab so it's a little noisy in here
Oh noise-canceling yeah that's much
myself
okay wonderful let's try and seize it
understand focus map
yeah we've got it software is not the
only tool that's being worked on at
Honeywell at the additive manufacturing
lab engineers are making aircraft
components cheaper lighter and quicker
than before in some cases a part that
might take six months to make in a
traditional caste process can now be
produced in two weeks with 3d printing
where we want to go with our additive
product line is where you take multiple
parts and assemble them in the printing
process so typically on a tube like this
you would take a tube you would bend it
you would smash it here along this and
then weld this on and this on but with
additive I can print them all as one
homogenous part for some components like
this rear engine mount the 3d printed
version removes 62% of the weight but
because each part has to be approved by
the FAA this technology is currently
used to print existing components but
testing is underway for new engines and
concepts to reduce weight and fuel
consumption potentially all these
developments could mean fewer flight
delays cancellations and most
importantly accidents Honeywell isn't
the only company working on these
technologies Boeing and NASA are testing
synthetic vision in 787 Dreamliners
simulators and voice control is also
being trialed at another avionics
company Rockwell Collins the flight deck
of the future could be landing sooner
than you think
