here at apple's ipad to launch event and
I'm holding the iPad 2 in fact I'm
holding the white version of the iPad 2
there's now two colors a white version
and a black version all the same prices
all the same capacities as last year's
but you're now getting much thinner
design a lighter design and also getting
a faster processors there's there's a
dual-core a5 processor in here it's
promising nine times the graphics
performance of the original iPad you're
also getting a few new features you're
getting a FaceTime feature for video
calling you get HD cameras on the back
and a VGA camera on the front Apple is
also announcing two new applications for
the iPad their own applications ones
iMovie for the iPad which was available
before on the iPhone and the iPod Touch
it's now coming to the iPad is the most
sophisticated version at least the most
sophisticated mobile version of iMovie
we've seen yet the other application
that Apple announced today for the iPad
is GarageBand this is gonna be a pretty
cool application out there for you
musical types does multitrack recording
virtual instruments a lot of fun we're
gonna see this thing March 11th so
having played around the iPad 2 the
little bit that I've had to hear I have
to say the thing I like about it the
most is how thin and light apples be
able to get the design having seen a lot
of their competitors this past year I
haven't seen anything that's gotten this
small and I think be able to preserve
that 10 hour battery life is a big deal
it's gonna be hard to be able to keep up
with that so for cnet.com I'm Donald
Bell showing off the Apple iPad 2</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
