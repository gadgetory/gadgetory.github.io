the house of Marley one foundation home
audio system so as you can see this is
an absolutely massive speaker system for
your home
it was here last year in its concept
stages but this I'm told is the finished
article it comes in two finishes that's
walnut and birch you're looking at the
walnut one right here the birch is going
to be slightly lighter this is a 220
watt speaker system with five and a
quarter inch woofers for a really meaty
bassy noise this one button on the top
cycles three modes and it has digital
and auxiliary inputs plus a usb on the
side it can also do stereo RCA in and
out which is pretty handy more
excitingly this speaker has airplay
which is Apple's wireless audio
technology that means that you'll be
able to hook up your iPhone or iPad or
iPod Touch and play music over Wi-Fi as
you wander aimlessly around the house it
could hurt your bank balance however
this speaker is going to cost $700 when
it comes out in the third quarter of
2013 if you're not a big fan of airplay
I'm told that a Bluetooth version will
be coming out a few months after that as
for sound quality first impressions are
that the speaker is very loud and
delivers a lot of punch when it comes to
bass it's pretty crowded and noisy here
though so wait for the full review where
we'll really be putting sound quality
through its paces Beats By dr. Dre Moe
started the musician branded audio craze
but House of Marley looks to be trying
to replicate that success they've got
some interesting stuff coming out in
2013 so we'll see how he goes on the
Westway 4c note and this is the house of
Marley one foundation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
