a first look at the brother HL 31 7 T
CDW workgroup printer is a black and
white LCD printer that operates a lot
like a traditional laser but its
long-term durability makes it a pretty
good option for IT professionals looking
for a long-term device so taking a tour
of it it's got a small basic design with
a tiny LCD panel on top and a limited
collection of buttons for browsing menus
and adjusting the print resolution but
my only complaint here is that the
display itself it sits flush within the
printer and you can adjust its angle
which means you're going to have to have
it below eye level just to see what's
going on so down on the front face
you'll see there's a 250 sheet main
paper tray and there's also a single
sheet manual feed tray on top of that
for a typically sized media like
envelopes and thick cardstock now this
is also one of brothers first business
printers to get into deep sleep mode now
this is a feature that's designed to
save your company money by using only 2
watts to save energy when you're not
using it and the setting menu lets you
adjust the amount of time it lasts until
it goes to sleep
you also get an auto duplexer on the
back to help cut media costs by
automatically flipping over and printing
on both sides of your sheets of paper
you can connect it to your network
through Wi-Fi or Ethernet or guests can
use Google Cloud Print or Apple air
print to output by proxy now there's a
link in the review to see that TVs
instructional video if you're unsure
about how those things work so it's
priced at 270 dollars retail but you can
get it at OfficeMax for about 200 bucks
so with impressive print performance and
speeds this is definitely a no-brainer
recommendation for offices that need a
dependable color laser printer you can
check out more details including speed
charts in my full review on CNET but
that does it for this video I'm Justin
mu you just took a look at the Brother
HL 31 7 T CDW printer thanks for
