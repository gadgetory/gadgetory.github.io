Samsung's stand at CES 2013 I'm taking a
look at the hwf 751 wireless sound bar
so this is a wireless sound bar as you
can see underneath here it comes with a
wireless subwoofer as well samsung says
it's designed to fit a 46 inch
television perfectly of course you can
use it with anything else it connects to
your TV using Samsung's sound share
technology now the company tells me that
that's a little bit like bluetooth but
hopefully without the lag so when you're
watching action on screen it should be
synced up perfectly so you won't have
any delay when people are speaking or in
big action scenes something quite neat
about this salvar is it has got an
accelerometer in the middle so it works
on two planes that means that if I tilt
the sound bar up the speaker arrangement
inside it will change to use different
speakers based on which way the actual
sound bar is pointing the controls
remain visible no matter what
orientation you're using the sound bar
in because this display on the front
when you tilt it up here you can see
your changes position which i think is
quite a nice touch as you can see in the
middle here this is a tube amplifier
system or valve amplified if you prefer
it's a bit hard to judge sound quality
in this noisy environment here at the
show but it sounds quite promising I can
certainly tell you that it goes very
loud fingers crossed that all the sound
technology inside here makes for an
excellent sound bar there is no price
yet but it's quite a high-end bit of kit
so if you do like the look of it your
best start saving now is going to be
coming out in the first half of 2013 on
the restoration seen out here at CES
2013 and this is Samsung's hwf 751 sound
bar</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
