into the spacecraft game vr is closer
than you think it's in your browser all
up in there all up in your browser and
the world's first 3d printed apartment
building completes construction but it's
not in LA so I'm still paying really
expensive rent prices wawa tomorrow
daily
greetings citizens of the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best geek
talk show in the known universe I'm your
host Ashley ask anna enemies always
punching the sky on a monday kill not do
you think that they can 3d print me a
new landlord ah the apartment that you
know that could be a very lucrative
Kickstarter 3d printed new landlord to
replace the one you have if you don't
like it I love so we got 3d printing
news we have VR news we do these are all
the things my favorite thing and space I
mean really we're only missing robots
but technically like we are robots got
it we are Cylons we're really well-made
Cylons spoiler you can have yes spoiler
alert guys all along the watchtower
playing in our heads on a loop all day
um all right friends all right friends
it's time to hit the headlines did you
know that bill nye is the CEO of a
nonprofit called the plant like
Planetary Society uh-huh I did not know
this either I just learned about this
today and I feel like I should have
known about it for a long time cuz I
love Bill Nye who doesn't who doesn't
love bill nye the science guy bill bill
bill bill bill I used to sing along to
that when I used to watch the show when
I was a kid I used to sing along it was
amazing okay so Planetary Society they
are going to build a spacecraft and they
are going to send it into space and this
is really awesome because what they're
doing is they are trying to make work
the idea of solar sailing so you can see
in our video wow that's how the sale
would expand from this object it's
called light sail that's what they're
naming it the actual device itself as
you just saw the size of a loaf of bread
so it is a very small bit of hardware
without the sales open so it's not
bigger than a breadbox no okay um so you
can use that for your 20 questions and
so what they're doing is okay solar
sailing is the idea that you can use
photons and beams of light and bounce
their force and speed off of these
really super thin sales in space and
propel a spacecraft around so the idea
is that over time as this thing travels
through space it would pick up speed
therefore potentially giving it the
ability to go quite far
okay right so um so here's what they
want to do uh the the actual sale this I
thought was very interesting is four
point each sale will be four point five
microns thick so there they are rolling
up the sales are wrapping them up and
packing them inside the actual device
and that is a quarter of the thickness
of an average trash bag a quarter of the
thickness yeah quarter so that is a
really really dairy sensitive yes thin
sale and they this device will have
electromagnetic rods to help right up
the craft based on Earth's magnetic
field and then they're going to do a
test flight in May and that'll be
launched on an atlas 5 rocket but what
they really want to do is after the test
flight they want to move on and send
another light sail into orbit on one of
space X's Falcon rattles so and then
there's going to be another spacecraft
that's actually going to keep tabs on
the light sail and see how it's doing
and check on it and come back so what's
the goal they what are they trying to
help the space the space program so so
um so the Planetary Society is a
non-profit that's dedicated to space
advocacy and exploration oh so they're
all about just sort of saying like this
can be done like they want to know if
true solar sailing in and of itself can
be done in space and how well can it be
done how well can they do it and for how
cheap so this is only gonna cost less
than four million dollars and it's all
privately funded so no taxpayer money no
you know it's totally funded by private
citizens and it will cost under 4
million dollars that is fantastic it's
busy exactly the kind of science like
space news that we would love yeah
because it's not just look at the sale
expanding I mean it's just it's really
incredible how large these sales are and
NASA has done things like this with
sales that expand as they get out into
orbit but this is something privately
funded and what is this happening may
they're gonna do the test flight okay so
we'll keep tabs on it will report back
when they do the test flight will be
ugly awesome let's super very cool and
people can donate to this charity then
getting over to a planetary system I'm
sorry Planetary Society yeah non mais
attack stood up
while your donation very cool so yeah
super super nice job Bill Nye yeah way
to go bill nine way to back up that
Street science guy named with actual
street cred love him is a hug for me
tell me about VR ok Hauser ok so I you
know I I'm big into VR and now AR um but
so everybody's been wondering like oh
you know with the Facebook acquiring you
know oculus and and all this V are
becoming popular how is just gonna bake
itself into our lives how does I'm not
just gonna be us dweebs might have
wondered that's right so well Moe's VR
so Mozilla stepped up and is adding VR
to the browser itself so now you'll be
able to through the browser use your
oculus and and explore things now like
content that's been made for personality
okay so so they've been working they've
been working on this for a few months
now and last week they added corvy our
support directly to their nightly builds
so basically oh that's the big deal
that's the big deal so core support that
was like a huge mm-hmm so basically I
have to do is install the most recent
build install add-ons to integrate it to
the oculus okay and then open a non Ã¨
10 window right so that's a non
multiprocessing window who so awesome
okay so it's a couple different things
but then but then after at that point
you can I guess developed for an
experience we are like that's in the
browser like what about content yeah
very easily very easily with a witty
awesome with Linux support firefox and
Android and Google cardboard oh they
that's what they that's all the stuff
they want to do yeah not just Firefox
you want to expand oh yeah that's the 1i
they want to go all over the place um
there's more resources and demos on Mo's
VR com site if you want to learn more
about that okay they have six projects
uh yeah on their site which is what
we've been watching these are some of
the projects from moes VR there have
this is a talk show you can't see
anything cuz it's super dark yeah but
they do that obviously they can only
show 3d by the the two images next to me
right but this is really heat crazies
like it's like they're now I almost
wonder you know like I always think
about things like playstation home which
was kind of a flop yeah but also a
really interesting idea in that can you
imagine them real I like Sony
relaunching playstation home with with
project Morpheus yeah where it's like
you're actually walking around in a
little plaza and talking other people or
cars i'm sorry but kind of weird but
exciting and it's really makes basically
yeah it's scare citing it's so scary
excited I've scare citing care setting
um so speaking of hashtags our hashtag
of the day today is T DVR browse and I
think the question is is that if you
could pick your favorite website or what
website would you want to experience in
virtual reality why seeing that Dutch
keep it appropriate ok keep it
appropriate internet because we know the
Internet has some inappropriate places
that lots of people would love to
experience in virtual reality now is not
the time nor place to name those website
yeah let's let's keep it keep it clean
clean p clean classy so what about you i
think i would love to visit i I've seen
like those prototypes of Netflix work
but I kind of love that idea of having
that Minority Report experience like
right in front of you on a screen where
it's like you're swiping through movies
and like you know expand oh yeah so I
would say IMDb cuz i love get diving in
IMDb and pulling up like trivia about
stuff so i'm watching the movie right
here and then like all of a sudden i can
like pull down the trivia and expand
that and read through it and then close
close it up and throw that away and then
pick up like oh like I'm watching
guardians of the galaxy like Chris Pratt
what else is he an O Parks and Rec okay
i'm gonna click on that and that's gonna
start playing like that's what i want
you'd never come out no that's y vr is
so scarce i'd i would go to the gorillas
have a website and because it's like
super super like their art see where you
basically walk through their studio but
there's hidden things everywhere so you
go into like one of the characters rooms
and then you'll find maybe like an
unreleased track in their trash like on
the floor can't change me where you can
okay pottermore good good change okay
yeah you made it we made me think of
that but this is this is what i'm hoping
will happen with this whole 3d edition
is that sites will start to put more
work into it and it'll it'll become an
experience when you go to a website and
experience and i think that's the big
man experience and then people will
start thinking about the digital space
instead of just
just being a fleeting thought where you
see one thing and then you move on and
then you close the window and move on
like it can just be sort of this weird
seamless experience where you just kind
of float through the internet and find
things and just keep moving yeah but not
just with one website so like people get
caught in the black hole of YouTube but
it would be for everything that you
visit which is pretty neat and also
again it's scary it's a little scary
it's frightening because it's like we
don't know how society is going to
handle having virtual reality like such
an intense experience yeah um but I'm
excited to see how people sort of evolve
and change with it and how just you know
society and general humanity reacts to
virtual reality becoming a really core
essential part of our lives at some
point just like the internet because
it's definitely not going away and
that's why a report on the fact that
it's it's actually it's here coming more
and more integrated yeah and people are
like actually adopting that's why i like
when mozilla that's big deal you're just
like okay and then also google is has
been working on something too i was
reading I think everybody's working on
yeah everybody there they are they're
changing glass they stop the Explorer
program we didn't report on that because
that was kind of a bummer but but on top
of that I'm kind of waiting to just see
what they're doing next with it which
they're working on obviously in Google
Labs so we'll see what's going on Google
last probably later this year okay this
next story has a lot to like yeah 333
printed oh yeah we're gonna we're gonna
get through this so wind Sun is this
Chinese company that's been making 3d
printed buildings for a while now like
three they've been um making like prefab
kind of houses and stuff so last year
they made this claim and said that they
we built ten houses in 24 hours using a
proprietary 3d printer that they have so
here we're looking at some of the
pictures right now of like this some of
their 3d printing and their their
structures which is pretty cool but now
now they are showing off a five-story
apartment building so it's a it's a
that's it whoo that was 3d printed
that's unbelievable which is pretty cool
so here's the deal with it it has so
many questions it's five stories high
and it's also got an eleven thousand
eight hundred forty square foot villa in
it so there's like not just little tiny
apartments the 3d printer that made this
it's actually an array so it is an array
of 3d printers it is too
I feet tall 33 feet wide and 100 the 32
feet long it's huge yeah and well it has
to be because it makes these giant
pieces in it in the facility that it's
housed in and then what happens is they
take the pieces as you can see these
pictures they take those pieces to the
construction site and then insulate them
and also add steel reinforcement and
everything to make sure it's up to code
otherwise it would be like a house made
of Legos so she come but they already
checked it out and they were like this
is fine people can live in this to code
uh arently to code like it's it's got
its it's insulated it's steel reinforced
so it's it's I would imagine actually
maybe in some ways better than some of
the prefabricated houses we've seen made
previously um this is the interesting
part to me is that the process
apparently according to them saves
thirty to sixty percent of construction
waste so no way so less construction
waste because you're you know exactly
what you're gonna need rights not oh we
bought extra you know we didn't really
know a fifty to seventy percent decrease
in production time because obviously
it's a 3d printer yeah so you're not
constantly making stuff and then also a
fifty to eighty percent decrease in
labor costs yeah so this this entire
like I think they said the whole
building was like it cost 160 thousand
dollars yet did you say how long it took
to make it uh I didn't I don't know if I
saw that um I would imagine it I mean
I'm sure it took them longer than 24
hours for ten right I just want to know
like compared to an action yeah I don't
know it would be really interesting to
see and I almost wonder so this makes me
wonder if um they have bigger dreams
they want to do skyscrapers and bridges
with this proprietary 3d printing array
which is pretty sure yeah sounds very
scary ya know that I against care citing
I think it's a theme of your aesthetic
show your side um I don't know that I
would drive my car across the 3d printed
bridge I would be really scared yeah but
in like ten years you're not gonna have
a choice I won't even be a big deal like
our children are and grandchildren god
grandpa Kol it's just a 3d printed
bridge nobody cares grandpa put on your
3d printed shoes and let's go okay
you're like your 3d printed Kanan let's
we um so yeah I love it I live in a 3d
print an apartment for sure I think I
would and they said that they were rich
they were able to do like details with
like all sorts of stuff in the building
like already pre printed which is pretty
cool so like molding and stuff like that
like you don't have to add that I think
that's part of the construction costs
you have to buy that stuff just print it
into if something goes wrong yeah and
then if something goes wrong in your
apartment like you get mad punch a hole
through the wall the three print a
little 3d printable punishment so you
and your management people aren't stuck
yeah it's good for you all right well
we're gonna take a quick break we're
gonna be right back with backorder
Hackett we have a little game we're
gonna play in with faculty are you don't
don't get scared look mischievous and
I'm excited and then we also have your
user feedback and of course our photogra
for the day so don't click away it's
tomorrow daily welcome back to the show
funny joke sharing a hilarious we didn't
say um okay so i went to pack self this
weekend mmm and not least the inaugural
XL pack south it was delightful san
antonio is a really interesting weird
city for those of you who live there
riverwalk is pretty cool you'd like it
it's like a river underneath all the
roads and there's bars and restaurants
mexican the mex okay okay that's coming
i have something Wow does that were
amazing shout out to Rio Rio restaurant
um but because i was at pack south i
found something that i thought would be
perfect for back at her hack and it just
started its kickstarter so let's do back
at her hackett oh you got some books
here we got some books okay so this is
actually a game it's a card game called
bring your own book Oh card games all
right so it's like a party like you
bring us to a party your cards against
humanity apples to apples type of thing
okay I'm jackal sorry so how it works is
you actually use physical books so
everybody brings a real book whatever
kind of book you want Prust michi chuck
palahniuk as I brought today Chuck
Palahniuk and okay so what happens is
there's a whole stack of printed cards
and there are two prompts on the cards
and the person who's the judge can
choose which prompt you use then
everybody opens their book finds a
passage that fits the prompt and then
the best one gets the card and the point
so kind of like cards against humanity
right okay so um but but they do it in
the actual game with if somebody finds a
selection they say I got it and then a
timer starts for a minute and everyone
has to find their stuff within that
minute we're gonna do it a little bit
differently I actually spoke to the
co-founder of the game and he gave me
some real printed cards like actual
production run cards that you will these
are the cards that you would get it was
just not yet it's not out yet cut so
let's try this let's do this ok so i
have apathy which is one of my favorite
books it has a lot of swearing in it but
it made me laugh really really hard oh
and then choked by chuck palahniuk which
is also one of my favorite authors it a
real it's soup you can take both of them
home okay perfect i will be one okay you
will you take apathy and i'll take choke
all right okay so we've got our book so
let's go
okay so now we have to find a passage
that it is the name of a beauty product
name of a beanie product okay all right
so I'm gonna look up maybe okay I got
one okay go mommy caricatures of the
death oh that doesn't sound like it's
somewhat what does it perfume the name
of a beauty product like that sounds
like it'd be a really weird face cream
oh god I'm out of mummy I need mommy
mommy yeah but mommy's for men is it
organic it's for my mommy is not organic
not organic okay so that's ok so that's
one and then the drawer would pick which
one they thought was what's best so you
guys are gonna pick which one was the
best out of that and then you you guys
are the are the judge here so we'll tell
you who wins I don't know how we're
gonna find out that because we can't
count every comment in the internet but
will feel the secret password to a
magical cave okay okay I got one okay so
you go ahead i had lost tsuj forever
mine is my memory isn't any good yeah I
feel like you should win that one just
on all right we doing one more so i can
get they get the idea okay this is how
weight on your supposed to switch boy
ever supposed to switch books after each
one okay and then here's here's the
other thing so the co-founder told me
this particular one is best used with
the end of one sentence in the beginning
of another sentence so just FYI dialogue
from a badly translated japanese RPG oh
boy all right ready so use what's the
rule for this is the end of one sentence
at the beginning of a next one usually
helps make it a little bit funnier okay
are you good yeah okay go uh it had come
too I already had salt haha brain-dead
loser dude that I can live with yeah
that one that one works okay cool so
what is this game call him okay it's
called bring your own book and you can
do the Kickstarter is on right now its
22 bucks to get the printed to pack but
if you're a little broke that's okay
because you can go over to the website
and you can you
request a download of the print your own
pack they have a printer on Patrick's
like cards against humanity um but this
is the full like printed deck that their
kick starting right now I totally backed
it I like I I love books I've lots of
books in my house and I also love games
like cards against humanity so this is
perfect yeah yeah it's a free seems like
it'd be a really fun party game yeah and
and and we need some more card games
that besides cards against humanity
here's my thing so with cards against
humanity it's like you just get used to
the same cards all the time bingo yeah
when you have people bring your own
books over stuff gets weird yeah it gets
weird you guys so I like actually
involves creativity to ya be a little
creative about it I just think it's
really cool so yeah bring your own book
I definitely definitely back it this is
probably one of the most like exciting
fun ones that it's fun it's super super
fun good job yeah thanks I was just he I
just happened to talk to him at pack
south and then that's it came up in
conversation that he was there showing
off his Kickstarter game and I was like
oh what is it and then he explained it
to me and I'm like I have to put this on
the show like it'll be on tomorrow
article yesterday like that's gonna be
on the show tomorrow um so yeah that's
what it is you can head over there to
bring your own book I dig it so yeah a
double-double bakit we highly double
back you um he's got to put that on the
box yeah don't put it on the box what's
a pull quote from us on the box um with
us going like like uh all right guys
it's time for your user feedback I
supposed to someone else's user feedback
I don't know um mom's user feedback
their moms user feedback I don't want
you watching that Ashley in that coil
that weird kale man doesn't remember my
no likely yes this is my oil like that's
a name coil um okay so last week we
asked you guys use the hashtag TD class
and tell us what class you would want
cuz Harvard did that class about space
exploration yeah yeah let's hear it
alright so Rob emailed us and he said I
would take a class in robotics so I
could help design and build companion
robots to help the elderly and
physically disabled Rob good guy Rob
yeah we're gonna change your meme it's
not good guy greg anymore it's good guy
Rob uh it would basically he wants to
build like a c-3po yeah type thing okay
I like that um Tony wrote us and said I
want to take a class on how to build
awesome killer robots hashtag dooms they
are okay Rob bad guys
you rob you need a yeah yeah this is
nope nope there's there's gonna be a war
between the like elderly helper robots
and the bad robots please I just want to
hug you looks like job and then Rick rug
doesn't said speaking of speaking of
Education a class about the history of
gaming new gen needs to know the era of
Atari and nes I like the history of
gaming oh yeah yeah that's what they
have to learn how frustrating those
games were I think how they built you is
a better person I think any person under
the age of like 15 should be forced to
into when you want a new console like
the Xbox one you should be forced to
beat like ghosts and goblins any yeah it
should you have to beat it exactly you
can't just play it and be like oh this
is really frustrating think it should be
like the draft like like in America you
get drafted but like you have to you
have to play a certain game like like
the wizard but mandatory I like that ok
and then Matt wrote to us lastly and
said i would like to learn how to pick
out clothes like kale and print out
replicas of his clothes hashtag printer
in a printer TD class you're looking
very patriotic today I just you should
have saved this for President's Day as
all I'm saying it's literally was not
ready for that cup blue pants and a flag
shirt look it's red white and blue all
day we ran out of the house and I was
like I wear shirt there's American flag
waving instead of Captain America
captain and I ran away hey buddy bring
back my patriotism his elderly help a
robot after you I'm all about 3d printed
clothing this I second that happens I'm
only wearing 3d printed click new shirt
every day shatter it build a new shirt
build a new shirt oh yeah when it yours
patch it with another chant like a
little link yeah 3 spill some ketchup on
it pull out that little piece 3d print a
new piece I like it all right guys it's
time for your very last piece of user
feedback which is of course as always
your phone tog refer of the day
alright so David L wrote to us and he
sent us a lot of pictures and I have to
