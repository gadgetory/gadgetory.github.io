mirrors parking brake seatbelts abs and
airbags regardless of their price or
type we may soon expect the same of
automatic emergency braking automatic
emergency braking will apply partial
braking and alert the driver of a
potential collision 10 automakers who
are responsible for more than half the
cars and light trucks sold in the US
have pledged to make the technology
available across their lives which
certainly points down the road to it
eventually being required now how and
when a EB goes mainstream will be worked
out with the US National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration and the Insurance
Institute for Highway Safety they're
consulting now and by the time they get
that done it'll be hard for all the
other car makers to stay out the u.s.
new car assessment program which
addresses standards from many systems
includes ten formal tests of safety gear
but automatic emergency braking is not
yet one of them as you drive collision
prevention assist is comparing your
speed to vehicles or objects ahead now a
EB is just another term for a tech you
may already know Subaru calls it
pre-collision braking system Acura and
Honda collision mitigation braking
system and Mercedes dubs at the wordy
Distronic plus with pre safe break but
all of these currently live in the world
of a nice-to-have option not common or
standard the way it works is cameras
lasers and ultrasonic sensors constantly
watch the space ahead of your car and if
the processor they're connected to
determines your closing on an object
moving or still too rapidly and seem to
be making no inputs on the brake or
steering the car will brake for you a
car that can see trouble
and stop itself to avoid it even if it
doesn't eliminate the impact it would
lessen its energy and if it appears you
cannot avoid the collision the system
engages the features of pre-safe to help
prepare the occupants the safety and
insurance communities have been falling
in love with this tech for a few years
making it the early darling of all the
active driver assist the IIHS has found
that cars with this basic tech are
associated with up to 35% fewer accident
injury claims they like paying viewer
claims you like not being involved until
a EB is required in new cars
it pays to double check if the one
you're considering buying as it anyway
