for cnet.com and I'm a little
embarrassed to admit this but I've been
on the hunt for really cheap headphones
or I should say inexpensive headphones
and I came across these Panasonic RP h T
21s on Amazon for four dollars and fifty
cents I actually got them shipped for
around four dollars and ninety cents
because I'm an Amazon Prime member so
these are headphones that cost less than
five dollars and I was curious to see
whether it actually sounded good and
we're comfortable to wear the joke is
that these actually are sort of
headphones that you might get on an
airplane that a flight attendant might
hand to you or as our cameraman who's
standing behind the camera right there
says these are something that came with
his walkman circa 1993 but the fact is
they are a slight step up from that but
they are really no-frills
they don't fold the earpieces do just a
little bit Bend and you can lengthen
them but apart from that there really
isn't anything else here there's no
microphone did you get an l-shaped plug
which is more durable than your standard
straight plug but it is slightly
reinforced that means you may not be
able to get it into your headphone jack
if you have a thicker case on your
smartphone you know as I said here the
real question is do these sound okay and
they actually are very decent headphones
for the money you don't get great sound
of course but there is a decent amount
of clarity a decent amount of bass it's
not going to blow your way or anything
but these are perfectly decent
headphones and they cost less than five
dollars out of the moral of the story
here is that cheaper is better exactly
but these do sound as good as a lot of
$20 to $25 headphones that I've tried
and if you just want these for workout
headphones for a casual listening they
work perfectly well and of course you
don't have to worry too much about
leaving them somewhere now you can step
up to another Panasonic model that
actually folds up off or slightly more
bass that'll cost you a little bit more
than ten dollars but for five dollars
this model is certainly very good for
the money and this is the
our pH t21 for panasonic I'm David Carr
