do some trick I have here the Samsung
SSD 840 Evo and now is the Samsung 850
Pro I read it now is the Samsung 850 Evo
that's right the ladies solid-state
drive on the map if you're wondering
what kind of trick that was well it's
called I have all three right now do you
didn't think so the new Evo 850 Evo
right here is the upgrade to the 840 Evo
but it's also very similar to the 850
Pro because is also used the new 3d Land
flash memory which produces more storage
space or less cost here's how explain
that last time I traditionally you know
the memories step string up like my arms
right here are placed on a surface just
like that but on a Samsung where they
actually lift it up in a vertical
position so come on over as you can see
now you can put more in the same real
estate of the surface like the Lauren
that's our intern by the way there you
go
I did a great job there on top of that
the new drive he also support turbo
right technology which you a portion of
its start memory here as the fast buffer
to boost is right speed and you can also
use the Samsung magician software to
turn the drive to work in the rapid mode
that further boost is open performance
the software also allows for changing a
lot of the drive settings and features
such as provisioning or secure erase or
updating its firmware now unfortunately
the software only works on Windows so if
a Mac user you are pluck the drive
itself however work with Macs to
basically it works in all application
where a traditional standard hard drive
like this one or this one here is being
used now in my testing the new drive
here did very well almost as well as the
580 pro that makes it such a great deal
because it's a lot cheaper it's
available in four different capacity
from Haren 20 gigabyte to one terabyte
cost between $100 and $500 you can
expect the street price to be even lower
if I'm on this one and check out my full
review at cnet.com you know just go get
one because you deserve it and if you
want to do a trick I did earlier make
sure you get the 850 bro and the 840 Evo
- oh it's just oh it's kind of too late
for you and that's because I'm down low
and this has been the first look at the
Samsung SSD 850 Evo so to stay dry</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
