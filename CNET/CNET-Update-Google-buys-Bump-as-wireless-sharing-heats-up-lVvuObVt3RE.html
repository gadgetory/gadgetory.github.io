joins the early upgrade Club I'm Bridget
Carey and this is your cnet update quite
a few apps are making headlines for
starters Google just purchased bump it
was one of the earliest smartphone apps
to get lots of buzz because of let users
wirelessly share contacts or photos with
someone else by fist bumping phones
together what's interesting is that
although bump was a popular download
when it launched in 2008 it's not
something people use much or talk about
now there's no need for any awkward
phone bumping when files can be
transferred with NFC or with cloud
storage services but you can expect
wireless file-sharing to come back into
the conversation this week with the
release of iOS 7 on Wednesday the new
air drop feature lets users share files
with other nearby iOS devices along with
bump Google is also getting the flock
app it was created by the bump team for
groups sharing photo albums and on the
topic of file sharing the cloud storage
service box is evolving to be more like
Evernote it's adding a new tool called
box notes and it shows when other users
make changes to text in a document but
it'll be several months before you can
try it the feature is still in its
testing phase and remember Twitter music
well if you don't twitter is hoping to
spread awareness of its streaming music
service with an app on spotify it's like
a shortcut to twitter music within the
spotify application and you can also
find Twitter music playlists on the
streaming service are do on Friday right
as the new iphone launches Sprint will
be offering a new type of early upgrade
plan called one up it lists customers
pay for smartphones or tablets in
monthly installments and upgrade after
every year by trading in their devices
team level was the first to offer this
type of plan 18teen verizon also offer
early upgrade plans where customers pay
more to get a new device after a year
but sprint looks like the better deal
customers pick up a phone with no money
down and pay for it in monthly
installments sprint also lowers the
monthly service charges by fifteen
dollars compared to those with its
standard two-year contract plan
so if you pay off the phone and you
don't upgrade unlimited talk text and
data costs 65 dollars a month slightly
less than t mobile's unlimited plan
sprint also is getting competitive by
offering hundred dollar discounts on any
phone for new customers that switch from
a rival carrier a new two-year contract
is required but it would mean the iphone
5c is free that's your tech news update
but you can get more details on these
stories at cnet com / update or follow

York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
