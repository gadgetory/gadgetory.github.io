high-end looking mid-tier devices with
its a series this is the a8 and the a8
plus you'll notice that in terms of
design they look strikingly similar to
Samsung's flagship phones like the s8
and the note 8 with the same glass back
and metal framing they also have what
Samson calls the infinity display even
though they're not quite as edge to edge
as the note 8 and the s8 it's HD plus
Super AMOLED screen which is slightly
bigger than the previous a series this
one is 6 inches and the regular a is 5.6
they also have the incremental changes
you'd expect from the next in a series
like a better processor and better
battery life even though the a8 plus
will have the bigger battery but the
main focus for improvement has been the
camera and I'm not talking about the
rear camera what I'm talking about is
the front-facing camera now these phones
are designed with younger consumers in
mind who perhaps are more interested in
selfies it has a dual front camera 16
and 8 megapixels similar to what we saw
on the note but the note had it on the
rear you can achieve the same live focus
effect that we saw on the note 8 which
uses the two cameras to create that
blurred background effect and it's
equipped with Bigsby assistant
unfortunately the a-series does not
launch in the US but it will be
launching in other markets starting in
January the a8 will cost roughly 499
euro while the a A+ will cost around 579
year</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
