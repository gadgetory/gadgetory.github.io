buzz report the show about the tech news
that everyone is talking about this week
it's a big huge internet fight verizon
and the inevitable iphone speculation
and the most insane animal fight you
ever saw but first it's the gadget of
the week the gadget of the week is the
Playboy holiday special the publisher of
the iconic magazine will release 56
issues of Playboy dating back to
nineteen fifty three in digital form
you'll get more than 100,000 pages of
articles and 650 issues all on a single
ultraportable 250 gigabyte hard drive oh
she's that hard drive and now for the
news this week a huge fight exploded
over streaming video content on the
internet in one corner there's comcast a
humongous Internet service provider on
the other corner there's level three a
humongous internet backbone provider
which a few weeks ago agreed to host and
deliver netflix's streaming video to
comcast and other ISPs now near as we
can tell the exchange went like this
level three was all like hey comcast
this streaming netflix stuff is wicked
popular we're going to need to send like
five times the traffic to you that we
used to because we have that whole free
traffic sharing agreement and then
Comcast was like um that's going to clog
up our internet tubes and bandwidth is
expensive you're going to help pay for
this and level-3 said um nope to which
comcast replied sucks to be you then and
our customers haha and then level three
was like media comcast is violating the
neutrality in truth it's your basic
money related baby fight and regardless
of who's right and who pays whom there's
one thing you can bet on you and me will
almost certainly get stuck with the bill
one way or the other well in other big
internet fights this week the
whistleblower site WikiLeaks unleashed a
massive data dump of confidential US
State Department diplomatic cables
everyone in every government condemned
the leaks and various hackers even
launched denial of service attacks
against WikiLeaks until their web hosts
amazon finally took them offline an
interpol went after the founder Julian
Assange over sexual assault charges that
kind of keep appearing and disappearing
the whole thing is just
crazy and shady and morally ambiguous as
hell and then here's the thing mainly
the big reveal was stuff like how
Libya's Moammar Qaddafi has a voluptuous
blonde Ukrainian nurse with him all the
time one cable said Kim jong-il was
flabby and old and then Silvio
Berlusconi is apparently a total Putin
butt kisser I guess maybe the thing that
WikiLeaks wanted the world to know is
that global diplomatic relations proceed
with all the seriousness and dignity of
The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills
thanks for that guys in gadget news the
Microsoft Kinect system is the surprise
holiday shopping hit of 2010 with 2.5
million units sold in less than a month
Sony's PlayStation Move appears to be
moving much slower and it certainly
doesn't have the same buzz because once
again look at it can you say marital aid
we've been through this Sony she said
marital aid verizon will launch its LTE
based 4g network this weekend faster
data speeds for everyone well for 38
major markets and 60 major airports
verizon says you can expect download
speeds up to 10 times faster than 3g for
now pretty much only on USB modems data
plans start at fifty dollars a month for
five gigs of data or eighty dollars for
ten and verizon says it will start
rolling out 4g devices in the middle of
next year and no i'm not ignoring the
device everyone is wondering about 4g
iphone oh my god oh my god oh god and
finally let's have a look at what's
clogging the tubes this week it's the
crow vs cat vs cat street fight which
had almost two million views just five
days after it posted on youtube check it
out
see without the music that's just a
plain old cat fight video but with it
scene 4 mortal kombat it just goes to
show you the power of a musical score oh
she's let's score and that's the buzz
report for this week everyone I'm Molly
would thank you for watching the gadget
of the week is the Playboy hard drive
the publisher okay okay all right I can
do this oh ok mm-hmm I'm five year old
seriously all right 32</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
