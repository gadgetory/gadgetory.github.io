Apple unveiled a 7 inch tall smart
speaker that uses Siri it comes in black
and white and costs more than twice as
much as the competition one Apple home
pod will set you back three hundred and
fifty dollars but Apple is saying that
you're gonna get better sound out of
this speaker than you would from the
Amazon echo so you can turn it up
without distortion and this has the same
chip inside as an iPhone so that's a big
brain for a speaker it uses those smarts
to adjust sound to fit to your
environment it knows if you put it
against a wall and it will direct the
sound accordingly with Siri you can ask
it to play your music similar to your
interests or ask questions about the
song or artist and add a track to a
playlist it still does all those other
typical assistant things like getting
news or set reminders and control other
compatible smart home devices but if
you're feeling creeped out by having six
Internet connected microphones in your
home Apple says all Siri commands are
sent anonymously with end-to-end
encryption but Apple has so much more
coming this year beyond a speaker here's
a quick breakdown of the biggest news
announced at WWDC that's Apple's annual
Developers Conference going on now the
next version of iPhone and iPad software
is going to support augmented reality so
app developers can make programs that
use the phone's camera to make it look
like virtual objects are sitting on
tables in the real world
Iowa's Leben is coming in the fall and
with it you'll be able to send money to
your friends in the message app photos
and videos are better encoded to take up
less storage space Siri is going to
sound less like a robot and can make
more suggestions based on your habits
the control center shortcut has a new
layout to change settings so if you
found 3d touch irritating before you'll
have more reason to be irritated when
you have to press deep to access these
new options but maybe Apple can save
your life but do not disturb mode while
driving will temporarily block out
notifications that only lit urgent
messages through when iOS 11 comes out
iPads are going to have a new keyboard
on the screen where you can
pull down on keys type numbers and
symbols there's new file system to
organize your stuff and fingers can do a
little dance of swiping and selecting
multiple things and dragging them
between apps if you use the pencil to
scribble notes it can now search through
your handwriting and use the camera to
scan your documents into the Notes app
the next version of the Mac operating
system is called high sierra and it has
a few little performance perks Safari is
going to block videos from auto plain on
websites like maybe this very video you
happen to be watching now Apple watch
owners will notice new face designs and
more Syria minders to scroll through on
your wrist along with you ways to log
workouts and listen to music plus you
may find yourself at a gym in the fall
with equipment that can talk to your
Apple watch and sync data with NFC a
force there are also new computers on
the way the iPad pro now has a 10.5 inch
screen the tablets were responsive it
starts at about $650 and will ship next
week macbook laptops got a refresh with
new processors and better graphics the
imax they also got a boost and Apple's
most powerful Mac computer is now an
iMac pro it starts at about five
thousand dollars the 5k display and
better cooling than a typical iMac
because it has to handle some heavy duty
processing power I'm Bridget Carey
that's the highlights but for more
details on everything from WWDC head to
