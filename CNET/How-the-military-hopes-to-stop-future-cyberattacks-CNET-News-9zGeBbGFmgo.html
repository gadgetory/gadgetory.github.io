the future of cyberattacks and what's
the military doing about it we visited
West Point the Army's prestigious 200
year old military academy to watch the
annual cyber defense exercise dubbed CDX
a yearly competition among service
academies to see which teams can protect
their servers from NSA hackers people
are starting to realize that we built
all these things that we're not relying
on but we sort of built it out in front
of the idea of security and so things
are kind of getting away from us and now
we need to take some time to kind of
Ratchet it back in and figure how we're
going to manage this really complex
world we build the West Point team spent
months creating a server that could
handle email file transfers and other
services for thousands of simulated
users for several days the group of two
dozen cadets huddled together in a
computer lab to guard their systems
against exploits from the NSA
cyber is the new frontier always
learning new things always developing
new things and being able to protect
something that's so important in our
everyday life is definitely crucial a
scoreboard was projected in the front
showing how well army was faring against
competing teams with grades based on how
well each group maintains its network
naturally the army team streamed their
activities live on Twitch the top team
takes home this big shiny trophy this
year though Army's big rival Navy one
we're also here to visit the army cyber
Institute which is a new think tank here
that asks all the different questions
about what the future of cyber defense
may look like we met its director
Colonel Andrew o hall he talked about
the Army's efforts to predict potential
ways the country could face an attack a
concept called threat casting now that
internet connections are just about
everywhere with threat casting you're
trying to put yourself into what the
attack surface would look like in 10
years because we know the attack surface
is going to be huge he went on to
describe a series of potential cyber
threats we may face in the future
such as a personal care robot being
hacked and harming its owner or a hack
on a dam that causes a catastrophic
disaster Pulse think tank is also
considering the potential of some pretty
sci-fi concepts like augmented soldiers
and autonomous drones one of the main
efforts we've been doing is trying to
figure out how the army will bring cyber
and cyber effects to the battlefield
I don't know if it's terrifying or
comforting that high-level army
officials are thinking about robot
attacks and Bionic soldiers ensure cyber
attacks may worsen but efforts like
these should help the military prepare a
little more for what's coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
