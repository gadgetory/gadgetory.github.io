shopping season is upon us you're
probably looking for that great budget
pick some sort of super cheap laptop
that can get everything done not cost
too much it used to be called a netbook
and then netbooks went away then there's
the Chromebook and chromebox may not do
everything you need now it looks like
there are finally netbooks for the
Windows 8 era in fact the Asus
Transformer book t100
is a prime example of that this runs
full Windows 8 has a very netbook like
design and it can transform into a
tablet with the press of a button right
here this whole handy dandy concoction
will cost about 379 you might even get
it for less if you look at a Black
Friday sale or two it's a really good
deal and it approaches the rock-bottom
prices that you used to see in netbooks
all over the place now is it worth it
well you know that's up to you how much
do you want to spend I can tell you this
it feels like a netbook which is both a
good and a bad thing in the sense that
it's very portable the battery life is
super strong about 10 hours of battery
life thanks to a new processor that's in
here that's an atom bay trail processor
that's a quad-core CPU and it is a step
above the previous Atom processor
providing mostly that battery life boost
a little more performance boost and you
know this thing actually outperformed a
more expensive larger laptop that
Toshiba had the Toshiba click that we
reviewed recently so you know in its
territory pretty good value but again
this keyboard is cramped it's plastic
you feeling it's not backlit and the
trackpad is small not the greatest work
environment in the world but it's there
if you want to get your work done and
there's a USB 3 port which is one of the
new Bay Trail editions so so faster
throughput there everything else you're
gonna have little mic reports all over
this tablet kind of standard tablet land
there with your micro USB your micro
HDMI a little slot there from memory
storage headphone jack and a super
plastic a huge finger magnet I mean
fingerprint magnet you know this is not
something you're gonna want to show off
but it's functional in the home it's
probably better in
this laptop forum then has a tablet
another nice plus this charges via micro
USB so you even though it comes with a
charger you can easily find another
lying around and that's pretty much the
story of this runs Windows 8.1 so you
don't have to deal with Windows RT
always a confusing landscape and if you
have under four hundred dollars to spend
and you're looking for a do-it-all a
little portable it does a lot more than
a Chromebook because it has a better
much better offline storage and you have
the full Windows support plus Microsoft
Office student edition is pre-installed
take a look for it it's a pretty good
pic not a phenomenal product but we hope
there are a lot more of these types of
netbook plus devices that hit the market
soon I'm Scott Stein and that's a look
at the very budget-friendly
