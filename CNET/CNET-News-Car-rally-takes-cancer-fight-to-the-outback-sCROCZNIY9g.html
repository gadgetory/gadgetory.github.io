really crappy cars drive from Perth
across the Kimberley up to Darwin to
raise money for the cancer council Jim
wild has worked on the software
development for what they're calling the
connected car hi doom hi okay can you
tell us a little bit about who's behind
this project ok so it's deep end and its
sister agency nomad it's who I work for
so we're a digital agency in Surrey
Hills refocuses and what is the
connected car um well basically we
wanted to be able to track the entire
trip as they got a guy's driving across
Australia now traditionally there's very
little mobile signal in the outback so
2g 3G 4G it really doesn't work for
large parts of the journey satellite
broadband is ridiculously expensive and
as we're doing this for charity we can
we can fund that so actually managed to
find a way of sending short messages
through satellite on the Iridium network
using short bursts data so we came up
with a protocol of our own to actually
talk to the car and send messages back
so we can we can find out things like
the car temperature how fast they're
going and we can send the messages back
saying when people are pledging to
change the tracklist or to say turn the
air conditioning on enough so this idea
started with your team leading to
communicate with the car but it seems
like it's evolved into something that
the people at home can get into as well
absolutely i mean we wanted it to be an
interactive experience so we set up a
website rally the future calm delay you
where people can actually go and they
can pledge they can do things like pick
a track on a spotify playlist or like i
said they can turn the air conditioning
on or off or they can just send the guys
a message going hey guys you're doing a
great job here's a donation and likewise
get some feedback from the car find out
what's going on six are going to get
into any trouble with the engine
temperature for example we will know
about it hopefully before they do and
the guys raised 1.4 million dollars
overall is 150 cars involved so last
year was massive we want to try and
smash that this year so
yeah it should be a great event</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
