sales strike back I am Bridget Carey
this is your scene that update you
survived Black Friday and Cyber Monday
now get ready for Green Monday that's
right there's another day of online
sales and it usually falls on the second
Monday of December at least 10 days
before Christmas
eBay coined the phrase several years ago
to mark that this was the busiest online
sales day in December so yes Green is
not an environmental thing it's for the
color of all that money just rolling in
now since it's such a hot day for online
orders you're gonna find stores
advertising deals to lure you in Amazon
Best Buy and Walmart have begun teasing
that they're gonna have green monday
deals the discounts may not be as
dramatic as Black Friday but it's still
a good time to nab a few gifts and not
have to pay full price
the next big day to look out for is free
shipping Day on Friday December 18th
that's six days before Christmas Eve but
if you're doing shopping in-person at
Walmart stores the retailer is offering
a new way to pay Walmart is jumping into
mobile payments with Walmart pay it's a
feature you'll find in the Maine Walmart
app you don't need a special NFC chip in
your phone like with iPhones and
androids when you're in line at the
register you're gonna scan a QR code at
the register and that's it the charges
are processed to your card on file and
the receipt is in the app it's a gradual
rollout only some stores are going to
have the feature now but it should work
at every Walmart by Midway next year
future holiday shopping may be less
stressful for another reason
self-driving cars can do all the zipping
around town for us and aside from Google
and Apple there's a new tech giant
tinkering in the space Samsung
Electronics says that it's creating a
team to develop parts for self-driving
cars but the South Korean company didn't
go into much detail also the Chinese
tech giant Baidu has announced it's
successfully tested a driverless car on
roads in Beijing by do is like China's
Google and the company used a modified
BMW 3 Series for its self-driving test
and it was able to navigate a variety of
complex road conditions that's it for
this tecnique
update and there's more at cnn.com from
our studios in New York I'm Bridget
