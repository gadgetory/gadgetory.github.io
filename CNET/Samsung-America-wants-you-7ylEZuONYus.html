Donald Trump tweeted this message to the
South Korean company on February 2nd
saying we would love to have you now
this hasn't come out of the blue his
tweet was in response to a Reuters
report saying Samsung may invest in a US
manufacturing plant it would build home
appliances Samsung already has a chip
factory in Texas and invested over 17
billion dollars it's also partnered with
Global Foundries at their Factory in New
York but a location for this room at new
plant hasn't been decided
Trump's been pushing companies to invest
more in US manufacturing he's already
announced a deal to keep carrier in the
US and said that import taxes may be
raised on foreign goods and it's not
been an easy ride for Samsung appliances
in America the company had a voluntary
recall of 2.8 million top loading
washers at the end of 2016 because of
injury risks but Trump seems to be a fan
of the company as he's been using a
samsung galaxy phone to tweet despite
earlier reports that he handed in this
device for a lock down phone that was
approved by The Secret Service for more
