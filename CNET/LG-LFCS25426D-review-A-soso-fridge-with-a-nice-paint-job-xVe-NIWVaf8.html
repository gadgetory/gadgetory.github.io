of the nicest looking bargain fridges
I've ever tested the suggested retail
price is $1,900 but I've been seeing it
for as low as 1,300 which is a very good
deal for an entry-level French door
fridge let alone one that can pass for
something higher-end
that means that this fridge is almost
purely a design play it's a refrigerator
built for people that don't care about
features and just want something that
looks accepted ly high-end without
breaking the bank I have no problem with
that approach and honestly think that it
makes for a pretty good pitch but the
problem here is performance just look at
the heat maps from our temperature tests
at the default setting of 37 degrees
you've got multiple orange hot spots
throughout the door shelves and even one
there in the main body of the fridge a
hot spot or two in the door is one thing
but those main shelves really ought to
stay below 40 degrees
now you can dial the fridge down a few
degrees but that makes it a little more
expensive to run and even here at the
coldest 33 degrees setting we still got
a hot spot in the door inside you've got
twenty five point four cubic feet of
total storage space maybe just a bit
above average when you're talking about
a French door that costs around $1,500
bottom line if you want a black
stainless steel fridge for as little as
possible this is one of the first
options that'll come up and it looks
good I can forgive a lack of features if
you're getting a discount and in this
case the Price is Right the performance
however is not and for that reason I
just can't recommend it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
