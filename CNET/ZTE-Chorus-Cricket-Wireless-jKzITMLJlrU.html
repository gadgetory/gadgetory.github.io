here to show you guys the ZTE chorus by
Cricket Wireless now the phone isn't a
smartphone per se but it does sport a
familiar Android Gingerbread UI and it
has a 600 megahertz CPU it also runs on
a 3G network it has a 3.2 inch resistive
touchscreen display I won't go into the
details about how that works but I did
find that I had to push really hard on
the screen just to get any response also
typing was particularly difficult I
hadn't use the tip of my fingernails
just so I could gain some accuracy on
the keyboard on the back of the phone
there's a 2 megapixel camera that can
record video as well but there's no
flash there's also this glossy shiny
finish that easily traps fingerprints
and a subtle speckling design that might
not be for everybody on the front
there's a big music button you can press
to access move music a music service
exclusive to cricket customers here you
can search and download millions of
artists albums and songs on major US
record labels
unfortunately the songs you download
can't transfer to any other device and
once you stop paying your phone bill
your songs are done
I found Lou's music interface to be very
cumbersome and difficult to navigate but
once you get the hang of it the fact
that the phone is so closely integrated
with your music is pretty neat this
phone is available online for purchase
on Cricket Wireless or other retailers
like Best Buy for $49.99 again this is
the ZTE Korus and I'm Lin from CNET</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
