pixel 2 XL are a bit of a contradiction
in some ways they fit right into the
latest phone phrases but in other ways
they but the trend and yet still at the
end of the day all the hardware and
specs you think are important in making
a premium phone aren't even what the
pixel twos are about it's important to
note here that the main difference
between the two phones are mostly size
and screen related and neither of them
are more advanced than the other the
pixel 2 is smaller with a 5-inch display
and the pixel 2 XL has a sharper 6 inch
screen it also has a bigger battery to
accommodate the larger display moving on
like that Apple iPhone and Motorola MOTO
phones the pixel twos don't have
headphone jacks if you don't already use
wireless headphones this can get pretty
annoying to have to carry around a
dongle all the time
second the pixel twos have squeezable
sides similar to the HTC u 11 just give
it a quick squeeze and Google's digital
voice enabled assistant launches finally
the phones fall in line with its
competitors by being water-resistant
they can be submerged in about 3 feet of
water for up to 30 minutes so you won't
have to worry about an accidental
dunking at the same time though the
pixel 2 and pixel 2 XL go against what
everyone else is doing - in a time where
thin bezels are in the pixel -
especially has thick bezels this is
likely due to the dual audio speakers
moving to the front but it makes the
phone look a little less slick and a
little more dated compared to its
competitors more importantly though
unlike a lot of premium phones these
days the pixel twos don't have dual
cameras Google says it doesn't really
need it and that the phones still pack a
great camera and the reality is it's
true the pixel 2 has a fantastic camera
I tested the phones out at the Auckland
Zoo and my photos came out great the
phone's portrait mode feature uses a
combo of algorithm training and a
special depth mapping image sensor to
create dramatic bouquet style images
with blurred backgrounds Google also
added optical image stabilisation
for steadier photos and video recording
the results are pretty impressive like
the original pixel last year the pixel 2
is still excellent at handling low-light
photography and Google added an HDR plus
enhanced tool that processes more
exposures so your trickiest photos come
out evenly lit there are also fun jiffy
motion photos you can take that's
similar to the iPhones live photos but
other than the camera the pixel twos
main draw is its software and the fact
that it's so deeply integrated with
Google's ecosystem and vast search
database ok Google what's your fruit
bats eat assistant works with a whole
new slew of Google devices like the
pixel buds which has an in-ear
translation feature that's exclusive to
pixel 2 you'll also get prompt OS
updates from Google and there's google
lens lens works a lot like Samsung's
Bixby vision app calling up information
about objects and the world around you
if you wanted to know more about an
album for instance just take its picture
and lens will identify and show you more
information about it it works on art
landmarks books and on business cards to
auto populate a context card it also
sometimes though not always accurately
work on other sorts of things too but
you have to make sure the image is clear
and pretty recognizable for lens to
register it yes and in this case it's a
type of tortoise lens is available in
the pixel too first in the Photos app
and then later in a system but it'll
roll out to other Android devices
afterward with premium phones gaining
more parity with one another and
competition as fierce as it is the pixel
to and pixel to excel rely on Google's
brand cachet ecosystem and software
services to differentiate themselves in
the end goggle pulled off another solid
phone and with the help of its fantastic
camera the pixel 2 is the best choice
for anyone looking
something other than the Apple and
Samsung mainstream</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
