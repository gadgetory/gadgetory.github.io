Tommy we haven't shown Windows Phone
Belov yet but this battle is all about
the new kid on the block it's a prize
five punch out between Nokia Lumia 920
and HTC Windows Phone 8x our judges for
this fight are senior editor Brian bad
boy Bennet senior editor Jessica the
people's gold court and you know who
really named home now we'll take all
three judges scores and it averages them
out to the nearest tenth each round the
final prizefight score would be an
average of all rounds using the same
system it's a five round throwdown round
one is design the Nokia Lumia 920 brings
a retro poppy art feeling with its
unique body shape and design and it's
4.5 inch 332 pixel per inch display that
pops but this is a surprisingly thick
phone when you hold it with a slippery
surface and a heavyweight now HTC is
Windows Phone 8x brings a much sleeker
and slimmer profile with its smaller 4.3
inch screen but makes up for it with a
slightly higher 342 pixels per inch
display its curved backside has a soft
touch feel to it and it's also more
comfortable to hold the Lumia 920 might
have a little more personality but we're
giving the ATC 8x a 4.7 and the 920 of
for next rounds controls a user
interface both phones bring a similar
layout with volume and camera buttons in
the same location now the Lumia 920
decided to put its power button in the
center on the side which can feel a
little odd since it's on the same side
as the volume rocker now we preferred
the power button at the top on the HTC
8x both phones bring the same Windows
Phone 8 software with its smooth and
modern tile interface then I'm a big fan
of and it's horizontal screens when
you're inside of apps plus you'll also
have the ability to customize the size
of tiles and then pin them to your home
screen now don't knock it if you haven't
tried it but we're fans of the clean and
refreshing windows
we're calling this round a tie at four
and after averaging two rounds the 8x
leads four point four to four next round
of kickers
this is really the round with the Lumia
920 separates itself from the HTC 8x now
Nokia brings the most advanced Windows
Phone 8 device to date with its wireless
charging capabilities a high screen
sensitivity feature that allows you to
use the screen without any specialty
gloves and a glare reducing screen
filter that isn't just a gimmick plus a
suite of Nokia apps and services that
add more value now Windows Phone 8
brings Bing search that's easily
accessible and can use your location
listen to music or scan barcodes for
results but as an operating system
Windows Phone still has to play some
catch up with the absences of a default
voice navigation a camera panorama and
really more than anything it's missing
some of the top apps that you'll find on
other platforms
it's the Nokia Lumia 920 that really
the table and against of five and the
ACC Windows Phone 8x gets a four round
for is web browser multi media you'll
see a theme here but it's Nokia that
really tries to bring something more
than the basic Windows Phone experience
web browsing is exactly the same with
tabbed browsing and the ability to pin a
favorite sites to the home page and the
Windows Phone store offers apps games
and music but the video selection is a
little sparse
now the HTC 8x brings Beats Audio
enhancement technology but the Lumia 920
brings better camera quality when
comparing similar camera shops it's a
larger screen and glare reduction filter
makes a difference and it's Nokia Music
app that caches songs for offline
listening and the Nokia Drive app give
it the edge here the Lumia 920 gets a 5
and the ACC 8x gets a 4 doctor averaging
four rounds nokia is taking the lead
after trailing the final round that
decides malt is called quality and
performance both of these phones bring
the same processor operating system and
4G LTE connectivity and we were happy
with a snappy responsiveness of the
operating system now the Lumia 920 also
brings 32 gigs of storage for $99
compared to the HTC 8x with 16 gigs of
internal storage for $199 call quality
always varies depending on multiple
conditions but audio quality was solid
for both phones so in the final round
we're giving Nokia the edge one more
time with the 4.3 and the 8x of 4 so
let's average out all 5 rounds and in a
battle with an ATC Windows Phone 8x jump
to an early lead the Nokia Lumia 920
came back strong could not be stopped
and take this price bite 4.5 to 4.2 and
is your prize fight winner Windows Phone
continues to get better and better and
you guys can bat 2013 will be a
make-it-or-break-it here i'm brian chong
spacewalking
we'll catch you guys next time for
another PI's fire</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
