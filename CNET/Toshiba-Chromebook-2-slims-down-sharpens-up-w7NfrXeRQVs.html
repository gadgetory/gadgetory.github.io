look at the Toshiba Chromebook 2 earlier
in 2014 we saw the Toshiba Chromebook
that was a 13-inch Chromebook running
Google's Chrome OS the first 13-inch
model we saw it was a you know fairly
chunky sized 13-inch laptop but it was
inexpensive and had a big screen well
now they shrunk it down the Chromebook 2
has the same 13 inch screen but actually
in a much smaller looking body the back
of the lid is flat rather than curved
it's got some cool angles on it it's not
a heck of a lot thinner but it actually
feels like it is because it's a flat
body versus a slightly rounded one the
thing that really jumps out at me about
this new model is the screen you can get
an optional 1080p screen it's an IPS
panel so you get really good off-axis
viewing like this there's a standard you
know non full HD panel available as well
but I really like the look of this one
audio they've partnered with Skull Candy
much like other PC makers partner
without their audio companies to get
some tweaks to audio software and even
audio hardware in here and that's
something again you don't see really on
the lower end of the market all that
much we're gonna see this probably in
October and it starts at 249 for the
regular ngon HD screen and at 329 for
this full HD screen and that's
definitely one of the better-looking
displays I've seen on a Chromebook or
even a sub $500 laptop in awhile I'm Dan
Ackerman and that is the Toshiba Cobell
2
