kid or a tech loving adult stuck in a
state of perpetual adolescence a
remote-controlled toy is a surefire hit
I'm Donna Bell and this top five I'm
counting down my favorite
remote-controlled toys that are new for
the 2014 holiday season starting things
off at number five the hex bug vex
series
I think these qualify as an educational
toy at least you can spin it that way
these are DIY snap-together versions of
hex bugs Greatest Hits including my
personal favorite the strong beast
prices range from fifty to ninety
dollars you don't get that instant
gratification of preassembled toys but
it's a great option if your little nerd
is more of a Lego proto engineer type
and number four nip by wowie
this is a self-balancing mini robot that
responds to gestures or can be
controlled by an app or even just roam
around on its own
giving your pets an anxiety attack he's
cute he can carry your drink he's ninety
dollars but it at least gets you in the
ballpark of your own personal r2d2 for
number three I'm going with the powerup
3.0 using a lightweight motor and a
Bluetooth connection powerup keeps an
ordinary paper airplane up in the air
for minutes and steers it around using
an app it's $50 and you need a big open
space to appreciate it but come on an
app controlled paper airplane that's
awesome
coming in at number two the Sphero ollie
it sort of looks like a motorized can of
soup but it's really cool you can race
it around using your phone as a simple
remote or turn your phone sideways for a
set of stunt controls that make the
whole thing go nuts it's not cheap at
$99 but it's extremely portable and the
battery charges over USB which brings us
to the number one new remote control toy
on my personnal 2014 wishlist the parrot
mini-drone jumping sumo this guy is
controlled by your phone over Wi-Fi for
extended range and is blessed with two
superpowers first is the power to jump
into the air second is the power to spy
using an embedded video camera that
streams to your phone
it's a little pricey at $160 but being
able to navigate this thing around with
the floor I view and scare the crap out
of people by jumping up at them that
just sounds like fun so there you go
five new remote control toys for 2014
that make me feel like a kid again
