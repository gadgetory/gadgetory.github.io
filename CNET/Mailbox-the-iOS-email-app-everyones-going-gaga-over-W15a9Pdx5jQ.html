Steven and today we're going to check
out an app called mailbox for iOS 6 and
later mailbox is a third-party email app
for gmail though other email clients are
reportedly in the works developed by
Orchestra it currently has a waiting
list of more than 740,000 people so if
you do decide to download the app to
date you won't get it until way later so
why all the hype well mailbox is a
minimalist approach to email that
emphasizes swipe gestures to organize
all your messages in the app there are
five zones where emails can go swipe to
the right to send a message in the
archives own long swipe it to the right
to trash it completely to put an email
aside in the snooze zone in order to
revisit it later swipe to the left I'll
explain what this means soon enough if
you want to file a message in another
category long swipe it to the left this
will launch your different email
categories or lists that you can
customize mailbox starts you off with
three labeled to buy to read and to
watch now back to this news function if
you get a message that you want to deal
with at another more convenient time you
can choose when it will pop back into
your inbox again options include later
today this evening someday or a specific
date and don't worry you can set what
each of these terms mean so you know
exactly when these emails will come back
to you you can quickly access all these
zones from the menu icon on the top left
you can also customize your settings
like adding another gmail account
customizing your signature and creating
new lists from the settings menu other
features include seamlessly attaching
photos to your email and reordering
messages into any order you want though
for some reason this works if you thi
only one gmail account to mailbox there
are a few things missing however for
example you can't select more than one
message at a time and if you use labels
in gmail which I do you won't be able to
see these categories in the app the app
is available now for free at iTunes just
be ready to wait in that long line
everyone's been complaining about again
I'm Lynn and this has been mailbox for
iOS
