gonna take a look at Apple's new editors
choice winning iMac so this is the
27-inch version of Apple's new iMac and
this model particular is the 1999
version with a few upgraded specs it
comes to 2,600 bucks with all the
upgrades but we find it's definitely
worth it considering how fast it is and
how good the screen looks now one of the
first things Apple mentioned about the
new iMac is its new thin design so from
that angle you can see this bezel here
it's about five millimeters thick and it
really looks like this is a
revolutionary new display now we keep
going here
and you'll see it's actually not quite
as thin as Apple made it out to be this
is big bulge here in the back and from
front to back the moderate is actually
about two and a half inches thick now
it's certainly not a behemoth but it's
also not the sort of razor thin display
that Apple put out there and of course a
stand up feature with a 27-inch iMac is
it's a giant gorgeous display so this is
27-inch screen and it's 2560 by 1440
pixels resolution that puts it among the
ranks of the highest resolution apples
also really tried to minimize the
reflections you get from the glossy
bezel apples had some pretty good
success here it's not entirely a
reflection free but it's also better
than some of the other high of 27 inches
we've seen now behind all those good
looks is the fastest all-in-one that
we've tested so it has a 3.4 gig Intel
Ivy Bridge Core i7 CPU a 2 gigabyte
NVIDIA GeForce GTX 680 X and mobile
graphics chip eight gigs of ram and what
Apple calls its fusion hard drive in
this case that's a one terabyte standard
mechanical hard drive as well as a 128
gig solid state drive merged into a
single drive volume so those are all
very high-end components and make this
the fastest all-in-one that we've ever
tested there's four USB ports here and
that's actually USB 3 which is a nice
upgrade from the previous USB 2 iMac
here you've got a couple Thunderbolt
ports we've seen those before and
finally there's an Ethernet jack so to
get at the memory you have to remove the
power cable and you can see in the
socket here there's a little button and
the idea is you push that button and
this panel comes down and that's where
the memory sits
problem is that button is really hard to
push your finger or mine at least this
too big to get in there to push it as
far as it needs to go so I've been using
a pen kind of drive the button up in
there
and eventually the panel pops off just
enough you can get your finger in and
pull it off now rounding out the
features on the new iMac there's two
microphone inputs up here the hard to
see but they definitely improve voice
fidelity when you're making calls now as
I mentioned our iMac review unit comes
with a lot of upgraded parts that puts
its price pretty high up at about $2,600
it starts at 1800 bucks though so that
makes this system really pretty
competitive given that you still get the
Core i5 CPU a standard terabyte hard
drive as well as the big display now
there are some points of inconvenience
with this system the lack of a direct
HDMI input and no optical drive means
you have to jump through a few hoops if
you want to use it for home
entertainment but especially for serious
users that need a high-resolution screen
and all the performance you get with
this system this is an easy
recommendation so how much Brown this is
