unless you do it for a living
well the scheme is to cause an accident
with an innocent person and make it that
innocent person's fault syphilis schemes
is to pull in front of an unsuspecting
driver on slam on your brakes any
vehicle that they know is going to have
insurance on our partners at state farms
say FBI figures indicate these crooked
collisions cost insurance companies some
twenty billion dollars a year and you
know who ends up paying that now stage
the accidents start off looking like
accident accidents but here's some red
flags to keep an eye out for that make
all the difference
everyone in the other car complains of
neck and back pain even though the
collision was minor lots of witnesses
come forward at the accident scene right
after it happens those could be plants
the driver of the other vehicle offers
to find you a great repair shop doctor
or lawyer now boiling a stage accident
is a lot like avoiding an accident with
a particular emphasis on space around
you you see the scanners will try stuff
that involves being close they'll come
up behind you
now comp right in front is jammed their
brakes on or the wave you in for a lane
change and then come right in and clip
and then it's off to the insurance claim
luckily personal technology mobile
devices can really help you in the event
of and right after a staged accident use
your smartphone to take lots of photos
of the car damaged license plates
insurance cards and ID's even the other
parties if you've got a panoramic photo
feature use it to document the entire
scene sketch out what happened while
it's fresh in your mind or use an app
like State Farm has where you can enter
the accident report digitally right then
and consider installing a drive cam in
your car that always records a few
seconds before during and after an
accident impact</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
