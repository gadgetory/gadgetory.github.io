to hit myself in the face
trust me I'm not doing it on purpose I'm
wearing a completely wireless full body
haptic suit called Tesla so what does it
do first of all it's nothing to do with
Tesla Motors it's actually a two-piece
suit that uses electricity emulation
systems to create sensations on the skin
or calls muscle contractions like when I
hold my arm out and it comes flying back
towards me involuntarily the Tesla suit
has 68 haptic points on the body so I
can feel the force of playing a game in
VR oh oh train my muscles to learn poses
so am I gonna feel like am I gonna get
home and I'm gonna be bruised from the
experience you you will never get
bruised okay it's exactly we were
affecting the actual muscle we're not
we're not printing a punch per se we're
fixing the muscles so in tracks
naturally so everything the suit does is
a natural body's reaction anyway to the
brains signals we just reverse that the
reverse engineer that basically and
we're applying that to our bodies so the
brain understands that something is
going on and it's natural so basically
it's exactly the same as in real world
before I try a demo in virtual reality I
get to feel what the sensations are like
in isolation very light in my right arm
oh it's going all over belly and
my arms I can feel it Oh shocking my own
this is fun it's like oh okay oh okay
that wasn't that was intense was not the
strongest that's not the story oh my god
okay come on I'm ready I'm ready
Oh
oh wow
it's making me laugh I don't know that
that's the desired effect but that's Wow
that's uncanny so if I was like to hold
my leg limp like this could you get it
to kick a little it just feels strange
it's testing my balance now it's time to
combine the Tesla suit with a VR headset
I'm interacting with a range of objects
in this room and feeling what it's like
to hold throw or get shocked by them how
does that this feels very interesting it
feels like sensations running across my
wrist and then a little bit on my bicep
like pins and needles
oh it just exploded oh this is a bad oh
wow I put my arm out and it feels like
it's getting the sensation from the fan
Wow and I can kind of see my virtual arm
- yeah so it's not super strong oh our
the closer I get it's actually pretty
strong if you pull the arm up and down
that's that's your different powers
oh so this is adjusting the intensity of
the sensation that I'm gonna feel so if
you played the music and adjust that
alright I'm gonna play the music and
then I'm gonna okay I'm feeling the bait
I'm feeling the vibration okay I'm gonna
increase the intensity
alright this is I can choose the
sensation you cannot leave like oh I can
play the sensation right wind or light
rain okay scroll down you've got the
middle arrow there
light snow loads of sensations they're
normal touch normal massage okay now
we're talking alright here we go oh it
feels like oh it feels like every one of
those massage chairs oh that was cool
that was that was quite relaxing
actually
HUD front kick he goes nothing oh okay
it it wasn't that hard but I did feel it
right here
hot explosion oh do I really want to try
yes I do myself what is wrong with me
while the tesla suit isn't available to
buy just yet the company is working with
b2b gaming and production houses like
Sony Pictures Television and if you're
thinking it might have another use case
you're right the adult industry is also
on the list
that was my experience wearing the Tesla
suit thanks so much for watching beta
test make sure to give the video a
thumbs up if you liked it and ring the
bell to subscribe alright
that's cruel like I'm trying to defend
myself and you're making my arms vibrate
so I can't hold it steady to make sure
you're a cruel mad
