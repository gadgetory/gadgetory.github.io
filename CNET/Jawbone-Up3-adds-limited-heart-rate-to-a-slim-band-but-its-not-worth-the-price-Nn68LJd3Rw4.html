Fitness watches with screens like the
Apple watch and pebble and others
they're also a fitness band some of them
don't have any screen at all and the
jawbone bands are an anomaly in that
regard the new jawbone up 3 which is a
premium product at $180 has no screen
it's meant to be worn casually than the
last bands the jawbone up24 was like
that too it had this easy stretchy
design looked low key and a lot of
people like that and these new ones are
like that too except the band is a lot
harder to put on the clasp really takes
some effort to get it on just right once
it's on you can wear it around
everywhere you can even wear it in the
shower just don't wear it swimming and
the up-3 brings something new to the
table which is heart rate tracking it
doesn't do it with any blinking green
light that a lot of these do is using
bioimpedance there are metal studs
inside the band and once it makes
contact it's meant to measure electrical
impedance to measure heart rate and
potentially down the road look at stress
levels hydration and skin temperature
what it does right now is just resting
heart rate so if you go to sleep at
night you'll find out what your heart
rate is but you can't use it for
exercise you can't use it for readings
throughout the day you can use it for
slightly better sleep tracking a lot of
bands up heart rate tracking basis
Microsoft band Apple watch Fitbit charge
HR so heart rate is not all that
exciting and this one does less for $180
I would recommend going down to the
hundred dollar upto which skips heart
rate tracking but I love the jawbone up
app it's awesome has great coaching has
social elements and ties them with a ton
of features I like that the up app
coaches me but I want it to coach me
more and you keep having to go back to
your phone to see what this is buzzing
you about it'll vibrate to tell you you
go to sleep or to send alarms to you but
other than an indicator to tell you
whether your walk mode or in sleep mode
that's pretty much it there's a little
bit of a notifications flash but it
feels archaic compared all the little
displays that other bands like this have
I mean you couldn't put a display on
here to send basic information to this
the up three gets a solid seven days of
battery life and it's easy to charge
with a little magnetic dongle that's
included
just don't lose that dongle thumbs up to
the jawbone up app not so excited about
the features on the up three right now
I'd suggest waiting unless you're dying
to explore the potentials of
bioimpedance down the road I'm Scott
