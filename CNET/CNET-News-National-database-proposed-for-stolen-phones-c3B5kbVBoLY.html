teaming up with the US government to
create a database of stolen phones so
thieves can't use voice and data
services on those devices will be able
to take highly prized stolen instruments
and turn them into worthless pieces of
plastic here's how the database will
work if the number is identified as
stolen then the carrier will recognize
when the phone is when the phone call is
made that the number is invalid and
invent a call from being made this news
comes too late for San Francisco
resident boondi Dickinson who had her
iPhone stolen two years ago when eighty
percent of street crimes are about i
phone thefts their laptops like you need
to put a law in place like this San
Francisco police caught the thief but
never recovered Dickinson's phone it not
only took away my sense of security
because this guy came up to me and
tacked me but I did lose one of the only
piece of technology that I actually
really like experts say this database is
a win for consumers but you still need
to take precautions thieves can still
access your phone's data if it's not
password protected if you have an iPhone
or smartphone with a lot of photos with
a lot of data loaded on it this doesn't
prevent anybody named from actually
getting into your phone the four largest
carriers are expected to create
individual databases in the next six
months the FCC will then merge them into
a central database over the next year in
San Francisco I'm Kara Tsuboi cnet.com
