this is a review of the TTL l40 fhd f12
ta is no secret that the two most
important things to people buying a new
TV our price and size they want the
biggest panel possible that fits within
their budget and this brings us to TCL a
chinese brand that caters to people who
want a decent size for not very much
money the l4d fhd f12 ta is a 40 inch
television which is apparently an
internet shoppers favorite due to its
350 dollar price tag as you could expect
for such a cheap TV it's low on features
it's not an LED doesn't connect to the
net and angry birds well forget it
however it does feature three HDMI ports
and a USB port that reads mp3s and
picture files of external disks styling
is a throwback to 2005 with a two-tone
scheme but at least the remote looks up
to date even if it's difficult to use in
the dark because all the buttons are
sort of the same picture quality is just
possible the TV really shows its budget
origins in its lack of true black levels
and a color palette that goes a little
bit wonky when showing anything but skin
tone but it's 350 bucks we wouldn't put
it in the kids room but we're sure
granny would love it it may be the
cheapest TV we've seen in a while but
it's a whole lot better than the
insignia connected TV we saw last year
and it's half the price I'm ty
pendlebury and this has been a review of
the TCL 40 inch television</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
