Monica's church has been serving the
Los Angeles area for more than a century
but it's their use of high-tech
live-streaming technology that's now
helping the parish reach people as far
as Germany and connect distant family
members for special occasions it isn't a
substitute for coming to a funeral or
coming to a wedding but it does keep the
connection of people and for people that
cannot do it it's a wonderful
opportunity the church's first live
stream on Christmas 2012 got 20,000
views now they stream a weekly Sunday
Mass that gets around 2500 views they
also show a mix of weddings and memorial
services we've buried all kinds of
different people of different lives of
faith and stuff because we're the
largest church in the city of Santa
Monica so it's a place where people come
over the years a lot of people have
asked me if their there was the capacity
to livestream the church has full
cameras - around the Ulta and - under
the reacquire loft
they are either stationary or robotic so
there's no camera people roaming around
during somber events it's really
unobtrusive so people don't feel like
they're on camera they don't feel like
something is intruded upon what is a
very difficult day a volunteer director
in a control room switches the camera
view and adds graphics for the
livestream broadcast it's not as easy as
holding up a phone to Skype or FaceTime
st. Monica's has considered everything
from syncing audio to bandwidth for HD
streaming some of the legal aspects you
are going to have to consider are the
consents for the people entering the
church usually you need some kind of
general sign posted letting people know
that the mass is being filmed the church
charges a small fee to cover the
streaming costs for funerals and
weddings but it says it doesn't profit
from it in Santa Monica
