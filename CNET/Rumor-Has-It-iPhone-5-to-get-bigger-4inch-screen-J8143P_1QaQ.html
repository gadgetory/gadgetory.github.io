Dreyfuss and welcome to rumor has it the
show where we round up the week's
hottest tech rumor and vote on which
ones we think will come true and which
ones are pure fantasy but the best part
is that you yes you can vote too so pay
attention will explain how in a minute
let's check out our first rumor citing
well-placed sources the register is
reporting that Microsoft considered
acquiring nokia before seeing its books
and running away if this is true then
seeing the books was like the blood test
before the wedding turns out
unfortunately nokia has syphilis which
sucks not just for nokia but also
microsoft who'd be super psyched to
suddenly own a major phone maker to
crank out windows phones microsoft and
was like I still love you so let's just
live together bummer on to our second
rumor Google's senior vice president of
mobile and android Andy Rubin may be
jumping ship to go to a small start-up
called cloud car clown car cloud car
it's a fancy-pants taxi for rich people
then Rubin quickly took to Google+ to
deny it you never know when people start
abandoning ship nobody wants anybody to
know anything luckily by running to
Google+ to dispel the rumors people
still don't know anything because who's
even using google plus exactly even
Rubens boss isn't on google+ it's like a
tree falling in the forest our third
rumor is from our friends at Wired who
are reporting that Japanese newspaper
nication boom decided to start a rumor
that the wii u will cost around 400
bucks nintendo spotted that report and
was like um no that article is based on
nothing more than sake and lies but
here's the thing nintendo just tell us
the price already you are seriously
asking for this gross speculation by
being so tight-lipped what's the deal
gross is right excuse me four hundred
dollars that seems super overpriced
maybe that's why nintendo so
tight-lipped they're embarrassed yes now
for our big rumor since iOS 6 is
confirmed for the fall we can assume
when the next iPhone is coming out but
we don't know what it will look like
The Wall Street Journal sites asian
suppliers who say iphone 5 will have a
bigger four-inch screen because Apple is
already buying up the parts maybe to
accommodate the new 3d maps so now it's
voting time for you and for us will the
next iPhone have a bigger 4-inch screen
I say nay a bigger screen could mean a
hit to battery life and now that I'm
going to be facetiming over a cellular
network my battery life is going to be
struggling enough I don't think this
will happen and plus I just like to be a
contrarian oh man I say yay yay yay the
iphone 4s looks tiny compared with big
android phones and though Apple will
never in a million years make a phablet
gag they do need to enlarge that baby a
bit to keep up so obviously yay if
you're watching on cnet cast your vote
right now using the thumbs up thumbs
down right next to Emily's head in the
cnet interactive player see it it's
right there you have the next 30 seconds
to vote so go and in the meantime we
take the questions to the streets of San
Francisco do you guys think that the new
iphone is going to be bigger um I
wouldn't have thought so no no no no and
do you agree yeah do you think it's
gonna be bigger may be slimmer a bigger
in size yes um no I think it's gonna be
bigger probably wayna no I don't think
so I prefer to be larger because I'm I'm
a big person well it seems like the
people on the street really don't think
so so let's go back inside and see what
the cnet council thinks the cnet council
is composed of five Cena experts who
cast their votes anonymously opinions
org estimates expressed by the cnet
Council are not an endorsement by cnet
or CBS interactive obviously because
these are rumors folks and the cnet
verdict is yay the iphone will have a
bigger screen the cnet council was
unanimous five out of five Cena editors
said that the next iPhone will have a
bigger screen whoa how did you guys do
hopefully better than I did okay that's
our show everybody tune in next week for
more rumors in the meantime if you've
got a comment a rumor or just want to go
