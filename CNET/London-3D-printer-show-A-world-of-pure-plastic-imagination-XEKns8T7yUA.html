from the 3d printshow in london where
some of the most exciting jaw-dropping
and futuristic tech is being shown off
let's take a look for the uninitiated 3d
printers work by taking data from a
virtual computer design model then
building that model slice by slice into
an actual object items built using this
process can be incredibly detailed and
if you print one piece at a time can
even feature moving parts here on show
today is some seriously impressive
printed marbles including musical
instruments toys and even items of
clothing where do you see this
eventually going fashion wise do you
think in 10 years time we're all going
to be walking around wearing plastic
clothes and rubber trousers well maybe
some of us the streets of London but
hopefully not everyone I think it's
going to be integrated both in direct 3d
manufacturing so in 3d printing but
probably as is already being used for
something okay so in Winchester design
you know see what it looks like talk
about it and then put it into
manufacturing the flexibility of 3d
printing means designers can really go
to town there are loads of very unusual
styles on show here I've noticed
especially when it comes to jewelry so
you designed this ring how exactly did
you design it what software did you use
am i used a program called poser first
it's an animation program with
pre-generated human figures and they're
from that I shaped the hands which
clasping a ball of human hair
whereas smooth it out makes it look more
organic more human rather than ridden
with polygons so I managed to get it to
not look so digitally this technology
isn't just for hobbyists it's even
finding a home in Hollywood meet Iron
Man's mask and articulated gauntlets
so tell me about the glove how exactly
has this been made so this is the glove
from the second movie from Iron Man 2
so we revisited and tried to change the
technique from the first movie so we 3d
scan Roberts hands and then
took the design and wrapped around his
proportions and came up with all the
articulation and then we broke it down
and printed it out on an object that was
then cleaned up metal etched and
basically nickel-plated and painted from
there and fully assembled and it's a
functioning gauntlet glitz and glamour
aside there's plenty of evidence here
that 3d printing has scientific
applications as well this incredibly
detailed physical model of an ancient
cat skeleton was created by scanning the
animals mummified remains meanwhile full
3d body scans like this one give a
clearer picture of someone's physical
makeup something that could come in
handy when designing prosthetic limbs so
what are some of the advantages of using
3d printing for prosthetics I think it's
a the essence of form fit and function
fit because you get a perfect fit from
scan to print form because you get to
restore symmetry for people which
emotionally we find is equally as
important as the physical function and
finally the performance lightweight
durable high-impact allows people to
play football to run to climb to really
restore meaningful way of life so what's
the future of 3d printing well amazingly
from what I've seen it looks like it
could be objects that designed
themselves so if I'm not mistaken a
computer actually designed this object
is that right yes this is correct this
is designed without designer interaction
the geometry was created by a topology
optimization algorithm from a set of
load criteria and what happened was the
computer basically decided where to put
which element of geometry resulting in a
sort of biologically looking component a
trait shared by this 3d printed concept
house which was also designed by a
computer algorithm so this thing doesn't
like any building I've ever seen but
you're saying that this is actually a
concept for a house yeah this is the
very first prototype for a completely 3d
printed house we wrote our own algorithm
that is able to arrange material on
I'm almost like in nature it's almost
creating kind of bone-like structure
that it's extremely lightweight because
it's it's actually using the same
algorithms of nature
it almost yet it's actually almost
building itself yes what does that mean
for architects in the future I mean we
are we are kind of playing playing with
the algorithm and curating the algorithm
we were obviously still in charge of the
algorithm it's it's not taking over yet
yet yes if that's not an omen of the
robot apocalypse I don't know what is
for more on 3d printing check out CNET's
and let me know what you would like to
see crafted by robots in the comments
