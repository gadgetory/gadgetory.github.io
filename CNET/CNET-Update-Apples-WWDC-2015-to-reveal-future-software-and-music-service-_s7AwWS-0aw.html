software I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your cnet update are you ready for
another Apple event the Apple watch
isn't even officially here yet but Apple
has set the date for its next big event
June eighth is the start of WWDC that's
the conference for Apple developers it's
when the company shows off new mobile
and desktop software but we may also
learn about the rumored paid music
streaming service that Apple has been
working on since it acquired beats music
but it's not just a new music service
Apple is also redesigning the main music
app on iOS Apple released the preview
version of iOS 8.4 to beta testers and
with it the music app has a new layout
for browsing your music or streaming
iTunes radio meanwhile Apple is also
making a bigger push into healthcare the
company announced a partnership with IBM
to help healthcare companies analyze
patient data collected from the Apple
watch IBM is using the computing power
of Watson yes the same Watson made
famous from jeopardy to create the
Watson health cloud it'll store share
and analyze patient data Apple will
integrate wats and based programs into
health kit and research kit and while
IBM uses the cloud to improve health
sodastream is using the cloud to improve
bubbly beverages a new product called
the SodaStream mix is coming out next
year and it'll allow you to carbonate
any liquid at home you can't do that
with today's SodaStream machines if you
try to carbonate anything besides water
it could break the machine and create a
mess because it's only calculated to
make water fizzy but this new version
can recalibrate itself for different
liquids and it can download the
programming over the internet when it
comes out in 2016 you may be able to add
some sparkle to that wine at home the
internet connection also makes it so you
can share your settings and concoctions
with friends in other news it seems some
details of Google's upcoming wireless
service have leaked out a report from
android police describes details of a
leaked app called Project Phi it acts as
a control hub for your google
airless plan you could pay bills check
data use typical stuff for managing a
plan but the app also includes a way to
pause or suspend your service or close
your account so you could sign up and
change an account without ever needing
to go to any store it's all within the
app the code also suggests that you
would pay for data by the gigabyte and
calls and texts would be free in the US
google has officially said it is working
on such a service perhaps we'll learn
more next month during Google's
Developers Conference on May 28th it's
just a week before apple's event that
