nook tablets with full access to android
apps the nook HD and Nook HD+ have been
updated with the google play store and
the chrome web browser nuke users can
download it from the barnes and noble
website and it will be rolled out to
devices in the coming days through a
Wi-Fi update this really helps the note
compete with Android tablets since
before the Nook limited which apps it
allowed on the tablet but Google Play is
more than apps nuke owners can also
purchase music movies and other ebooks
right from google play that also means
you can download the amazon kindle app
and put it on your nook it's wild at
Barnes &amp;amp; Nobles letting users access
competing bookstores but it becomes a
more attractive product by giving
consumers more choice acer just

aspire r7 with a 15 inch screen that's
mounted on this floating hinge called an
easel where you can move and reposition
the screen to where you want it acer

smaller windows 8 tablet hybrid that
mounts to a keyboard cover expect to see
more of these smaller windows 8 tablets
in the coming months the first plane to
fly on solar power day and night took
off friday from California it's wingspan
is as long as a jumbo jet yet it only
weighs as much as a car this historic
flight will be a slow journey it travels
at 40 miles an hour and two pilots will
be taking turns flying twenty hours at a
time in this 5 leg trip across the
United States and it will eventually get
to New York's JFK Airport in early July
Google just made it easier to schedule a
calendar event over email now in gmail

to go to outlook.com to access it 3d
printers are getting more exposure as
