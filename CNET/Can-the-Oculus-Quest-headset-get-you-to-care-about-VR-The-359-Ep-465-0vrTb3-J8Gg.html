Scott Stein oculus unveiled its let's VR
headset the quest it is a sleek
standalone headset with fewer wires and
cables and full motion tracking Scott
what do you think is this is this
finally I get VR into the mainstream
well it's gonna take more than that to
get VR into the mainstream but I think
has there been a lot of attempts but I
do think this is a real exciting step if
you want that ready player one feel in
the real world this is finally the
untethered and full motion VR experience
we haven't had both of those before
last year oculus go was it was a
standalone but you had to stay in one
place it was really oculus day and yeah
I'm I guess I'm pressed by the fact that
there are no wires at all even with the
the handset controls the there there's
no like power pack there's no like a
wireless connection it's like this is
full standalone right yeah and it looks
impressive in that sense I tried an
early version of this back in March
before it was called oculus quest and
it's the headset contains everything
compared to something like magic leap
which has a belt pack yeah and it's
still pretty bulky um head gear it
really does seem very self-contained and
the controllers look very similar to the
oculus touch controllers on PC they're
full motion they have analog stick
buttons they should allow what they call
full hand feel or or motion you know
it's like but that's important because
it you can finally reach out and you
could also move around in spaces yeah
and and it can sense and map and track
what your room's dimensions are huh do
you know what the the distance of
movement is is there like it's a couple
feet or is it long well the distance of
movement is is potentially infinite as
far as like it will just keep mapping
out I think they mentioned 4,000 square
feet as you move through the actual
range is probably going to be more like
a couple of meters and we still have to
see but a lot of those tend to be an a
it can only really see a few feet ahead
let's say but we don't know it's using
for wide-angle cameras around the
headset to do that inside out to do six
degree of freedom tracking right and
that's how it tracks the controller is
kind of like Microsoft's VR headsets on
Windows now and it's supposed to really
kind of pick up the slack and have
motion sensors and the controllers that
can
help when it goes out of range we'll
have to see if there are any gaps in
that tracking but it looks promising
the other question is obviously the
other big VR system the HTC vive they
sort of made their names like the big
full motion tracking system a lot of
wires in that system fairly expensive
what do you think will HTC respond or is
this sort of you know does this put the
vibe in a bad position I think everyone
will respond
HTC does have its own focus VR headset
and a lot of these are using similar
chips apparently the the quest is using
I think a snapdragon 835 to find out
more but it's a mobile processor again
last year's Google Lenovo Mirage solo
which is developing six degree freedom
tracking is 835 the vibe focus is 835 so
there's a kind of a class of mobile VR
right that I think will start evolving
oculus is gonna get through the gate
first on this and has a really strong
relationship with software developers in
the library
that being said only 50 games that
launch for this apparently so you know
naughty gigant I mean it's decent but
it's not a gigantic amount how many of
them will carry over from the rift will
the port be easy what about all the
oculus go titles which there are
hundreds and what's the killer app right
I mean there are some already out there
but we have to sort of see if those are
enough are there any killer apps really
I mean I think you know I don't play
beat Sabre but I think you know I think
that like like rhythm fitness games are
becoming really popular for people if
you've used them I think tilt brush and
and art games are art apps like medium
or great but they hadn't really said
they're making that but I think if you
could create on the fly but I mean you
really have to be into those particular
things I don't know if those aren't
necessarily drawing new customers just
for those all right moving on to the
iPhone 10 are you wrote today this is
really the phone that we should be
waiting for what why is that I think the
10 are really prefer so it's affordable
it's a ittle more affordable it's it
starts to 750 and everything we know so
far I haven't haven't reviewed it and I
don't have one yet but it uses the same
processor yeah it uses the same image
sensor and an isp all the camera tech
that's in the 10s so that sounds like
all the basic stuff you want the
battery's supposed to be better so
that's already been listed as having the
best battery life so that all adds up to
a great equation the LCD display is not
OLED but apples LCD displays already
look really good right and it doesn't
have a dual camera but you know pixel
two did fine and you know I think
sometimes you just need a single camera
is that enough to spend all the way up
for just a dual camera on the 10s will
there be any other surprises and there's
no 3d touch but most people don't really
use that anyhow right but it sounds like
a perfect you know not too crazily
priced new iPhone and that is something
that I think a lot of people want
alright we don't have time to dive in
these topics buzz but please check out
our site an explainer piece I wrote on
5g we've got a look at how NASA is
reinventing itself after six decades and
we also wanted to wish lastly a happy
birthday happy 20th birthday to Google
alright for more of these stories you've
seen it I'm Roger Cheng I'm Scott
Steiner thanks for listening really a
minute okay I lost track of my tracking
here you go
I lost my six degrees of freedom track
you hear that chat only a minute and a
half over that's not that we're saying
we're talking in the chat about how it's
good to be above average because M
somebody's asking what the runtime was
and like oh it's it's three minutes and
59 seconds often times more than that
so I'll take it but yeah keep sending in
your questions and comments we'll get to
those here in just a second James wants
to wish Scott well after his what looked
to be painful fall yes thank you
how you feeling my knees are fine for
now good for now it starts to get rainy
we'll see oh yeah feel it in my knees
all right so let's talk about VR and
maybe a little bit of AR since they're
just kind of you know caddy corner yeah
each other yeah Michael Brown says I
wasn't really sure what the oculus quest
headset was I think VR is forever going
to be a specific community I don't see
it becoming more what you take away in
that guys that's a really interesting
thought about I don't know what it was I
kept thinking about this afterwards and
I was thinking is it starting to get
really confusing you know you're gonna
have to oculus headsets available one
year after the other
oculus go in oculus quest those sound
pretty similar to me yeah what does
everything go and quest and they're both
standalone so in the differences that
there has not been a standalone headset
that's allowed you to really move around
and control things like a PC VR headset
but you're right in essence a lot of the
equation and even the games are gonna be
similar way again on PC so for people
who've already made up their mind about
just the idea of VR is not for them I
don't think this is gonna change things
but the price at 399 sounds great it's
like it's a game console normal not too
crazy price compare that to magically
won it you know $2,000 so you know
that's like that's a big gap in terms of
what in that same for developers
magically that's a totally different
proposition but still you're you're now
at a point where VR headsets used to be
$1,000 $800 now you're an all contained
400 but I don't know I don't know if
it's too many things too quickly and
there's still a lot more to come that
these things still want to be so we're
not even at a final point yet right the
look that the issue has been the issue
from the beginning is
selling VR is impossible unless you're
there in the store trying it out for
most people they kind of read about it
but it's you don't really get to
experience it and I don't really it's
also kind of a for me it's a novelty
like I spend 15 minutes in it I'm like
I'm good good I don't I don't know if I
need to spend a thousand even four
hundred dollars for system like this
yeah yeah it's two hundred is like I
thought last year with the go or this
year time is moving fast yeah at or slow
time with the go is a $200 Amazon echo
type price so it kind of gets into this
like impulse purchase not really but I
feel like it just slides in the door
$400 is not an impulse purchase no and
also there is a question for me about
battery life we don't know about that
yet and you know the thing about the go
is it's a lot of quick five-minute
things try it a video you're done it
sits on the shelf for a while maybe you
try something else but a lot of the
games that they're talking about for our
rift games for the quest Moss great game
on psvr and other platforms they also
mention the climb they mentioned a robo
recall these are games you may want to
play for a while
and if the battery life you know on the
go is about two hours if the battery
life on this is about two hours or less
then you're suddenly gonna say oh I need
to recharge and is that gonna be weird
you know so that's another thought too
yeah a lot of thoughts yeah you're full
of them full of it a quick disclaimer we
know that there's been more than a few
people who are having a hard time
getting the right notifications from
YouTube we don't really have any answers
on that so we do apologize on behalf of
YouTube but this is kind of out of our
hand it's an algorithm thing why our
loyal subscribers aren't getting
notifications about when we go live is
completely beyond us but we keep
pressing them for answers
so either way thank you we love you
thank you for your patience we'll keep
trying to figure this one out on two
more questions
Gabriel is asking how much is this quest
doohickey 399 yeah so you know more
expensive than your average game console
more expensive than a Nintendo switch
these are things you might randomly
spend money on for entertainment I think
we'll go random I feel like if I'm
buying a switch I'm like I'm
intend to buy a console yes so you said
this is not an impulse purchase at all
no but I mean random in the sense that
they're not like if you buy a phone if
you buy a computer these are things that
you use in your have a purpose you know
you're getting sort of a gift for
yourself in a lot of ways yes which it's
great but you go like I'm gonna spend
money I'm gonna get it I'm gonna get a
thing it's gonna be fun so in that sense
in your in your fun bucket you have that
is there we go that's a messy sounding
fun bucket you got you gotta think about
$400 for the for that and I also don't
know there's another big question how
integrated is the VR ecosystem with all
the ACEF in VR that's out there it's a
part of the VR is the idea is you want
all be on the holodeck together and we
don't really know how much that's gonna
be the case or even how much Quest is
going to be connected in an easy
seamless way to rift and go owners even
from oculus as eco system it's a little
bit quite a little bit I know quest
owners be connected to other questions
yeah then you have to like you know
quest owners support group yeah thank
you fine a quest owner oh this like this
like high class middle class low class
here that's either dating after that
there might be come up we got a club
yard right now vendor vendor I mean
there I think there are not a ton of
dating I've not certainly not explored
any dating apps in real life or well
actually one of our one of our former
interns Rose story about VR VR dating
service yeah it was creepy yeah it was
creepy
so actually side note I went into I
watched the keynote yesterday in VR did
you yes I didn't write about it although
someone who I saw in there wrote about
it in VR maybe I will also do that it it
was for the first time it was streamable
in venues which is oculus --is mobile
attempt to mix a live stream with an
audience of avatars hmm so when you sit
down I tried it out it was like being it
kind of feel like being in a virtual
press conference the stage was very
nicely blended which was video and then
there were these 3d risers all around me
that I was sitting in and they're all
these little cartoon goofy avatar
me type things so there's a 360 cam or
180 cam like at the front of the event
so it's like watching a stream but with
the added peanut gallery so you could
change your seat and I hopped around
people were muttering and talking you
could you could really yeah you could
mute that or you can keep that in or
change the level so I kind of enjoyed it
and then someone goes to the virtual
audience like you couldn't you couldn't
actually see the like the live audience
behind No
so total replaces the live audience and
you cannot interact at all with what's
being streamed so there's no future of
like a comedy show that we're like take
audience recommend right right we're
raising questions right over less sure
they had not conquered that but someone
next to me said Jett Scott and I was
like hey and it was so Oh someone else
in the virtual conference yes someone
else next to me the avatar was a writer
for MIT tech review Oh Rachel mat-su
yeah great yeah yeah great yeah we were
chatting for a bit she wrote a whole
story about her experience streaming it
and mentioned running into someone which
was me and she mentioned you the story
she measured me by name she's probably
being generous about that and just
saying like I met a fellow tech
journalist pal and we talked a bit but
she was saying her eyes got very
fatigued I had a problem which was that
I'm covering for breaking news on Quest
the moment the breaking news happened
you've got kidnapped an offer I couldn't
file I have no actual laptop yeah so
what am I gonna do I'd take it off and
then it disconnects and actually threw
me bazzetta you ran into the other
office to look at the the other feed yes
yeah yeah and I was scrambling and
yelling and and yeah for for journalists
it's actually like the worst thing to
immerse yourself in Essex yeah stay in
this where you have no ability to
quickly respond or tweet Shockers would
love that
in our system forever don't don't do
anything where you can respond or react
so that is the downside the biggest
downside to me with the VR right it's
actually not that bad for a quick peek
but it is fatiguée yeah there's a little
bit to that point like yeah that's why I
mentioned like 15 minutes and I think
because that's kind of the max for me
because my eyes do get tired yes really
quickly on these things then uses worth
a try if you have a gear VR an oculus go
it's entertaining it's an interesting
step I think they do a couple of
interesting things but it's clearly like
very beginning of trying to figure that
out for those of you requesting an
episode of the 359 TVR no go to hell
who did that no we did 360 that's kind
of you or no it's not it was it calls
359 360 no no I'm either way editing
that kind of thing awful awful so yeah
we're not doing that
what kind of games are available on the
quest said I had a pretty robust launch
list like 50 titles right Scott yeah but
they didn't say what ones yeah but they
said it should be 50 ones they've listed
I think they're only a handful that I
know about I mean they had a tennis demo
on the floor I was not at oculus connect
colleague Ian share it was and got to
demo stuff and there'll be more hands-on
experiences from that but they announced
robbery call moss the climb were three
notable games and the ILM xlab announced
Vader immortal is the name of it it's
like a Star Wars series set in the kind
of rogue one shadows of the Empire type
of my conflating things now it's
definitely road one ish period yes I
think over lap with rogue one no so I'm
thinking about there's a name of the
voice it's so points of your experience
as much time but I believe it takes
place on the planet that Vader like
that's where his fortresses for Mustafar
yeah so I dunno Star Wars I swear I just
don't much of the I don't know what you
the extended universe to be fair with
all the rules about Canon and continuity
now it's tough to keep up yeah I know
the main movies so that is gonna be
coming but it's like a three-part like
it's unclear whether that's a game or a
movie or a series ish thing
it's like episode 1 is that gonna be
like each piece is an hour or half an
hour of content is it like kind of a I
don't know croaking up in a chapter yeah
I'm a little skeptical of serial type
things like that because I don't know
what the long term play value is but I
mean ILM is always doing AR and VR
things so there they have their ex lab
has its its feet and a lot of emergent
technologies its cooled
see as a presence it's unclear what that
what that means but that'll be there too
and I just think you need to throw a lot
of games at it that's why speaking of
the switch if you're in my game call
total game console anytime a new
emergent technology comes out you just
got to keep funneling it with games I
mean it's as simple as that the switch
is great because it has amazing games
that they keep bumping into it so
they're gonna need to put a lot of great
games and apps in a quest at a at a
crazy rate I think to make it appealing
so speaking of games what have you been
digging lately what do you hope is gonna
come to the quest just curious so
there's a few people who have tried
games in the chat they're kind of like
yeah look warm - an op-ed any any good
recommendation Scott to really kind of
hook somebody I liked what what was it
called hot something hot super hot super
hot yeah I perhaps a green light into
the matrix I think if it hasn't already
been announced I bet that's going to be
and I'm sorry if I haven't seen that if
it's been listed yet that seems like an
easy one to bring on board in the sense
that a NRO just seems that go be well
designed for that in fact I tried a
bullet time type game demo for four when
it was called Project Santa Cruz that
was along those lines that would be
great I think again any of those Fitness
rhythm games there is one that's been
announced as well that is coming that is
was the name of it I'd feel terrible job
stalker who is is the creator of it is
working on this whole fitness platform I
think that Fitness games would be really
interesting because you're untethered
yep you could put this on and you could
do all sorts of cool exercises and there
are people who have lost a lot of weight
and found that to be a really good
cardio C option you tried the Santa Cruz
prototype like how bulky was it on your
head could you move around was it yeah
not bulky at all hood like flop around
your head cuz that would be my concern
with no I was very impressed by the by
the demo that I tried the headset and it
looks similar from photos I saw a
connect the head side is a little bit
bigger it's a little bit bigger than an
oculus go right but it's not giant
it's it's along the lines of the rift I
don't know I don't think it's any bigger
than
vibe certainly well yeah but the vibe is
v is big it's big yeah it's much smaller
I think than the vibe it's more compact
with the head straps it types an audio
through the side holes that are like
oculus co actually provides some really
nice headphone free spatial audio the
controllers that I tried did not have
the full analog button okay
implement they mentioned there was a
transition to that originally they were
touch pads which were not nearly as
useful so now I think that there are
they moved to much more an oculus touch
type thing but the controls and
everything else felt great I tried it in
a room that clearly was best lit for
this demo right and I saw the even on
the show floor not - it's not conspiracy
it's just kind of like wandering I saw
markers and things on the ground like
like taped up zones mm which certainly
could help tracking I mean that's still
an unclear thing they said they tested
it in lots of conditions but Microsoft's
VR any of those camera based tracking
especially when it's in the headset
sometimes it can lose the thread yeah
sometimes the tracking can get a little
funky and the difference you know any
small hiccup will not be a fun
experience so that still remains to be
seen but you know I so far it looks like
the real deal and it is the most
exciting I think it's the most exciting
development I've seen in VR since the
rift hmm and the vibe because it's
finally thing you could put on and
really move right right right it's not
yeah you don't have cables dangling and
techno we were around you and again I
want to say last year it wasn't last
year it was May of this year that I
tried out oculus Scott what made of
March to May oculus go and Google's
Lenovo Mirage solo if you're a Google
person in your student VR that's an
in-between zone right now
Mirage solo was one standalone headset
that's bulky and also $400 and the thing
there is that it was only three degree
of freedom not full tracking Google is
developing experimental six degree of
freedom tracking for that I think what's
gonna happen is that come next year
whether it's a full real Google product
or another company makes it they'll be
there as well
Slater with full-motion in VR because
they're basically illness there it's
just that I think that they're building
it out so if you're interested in these
types of things just know oculus won't
be the last one okay but it might be the
best right there you go right we are out
of time but some things to take with us
on the road don't answer them right now
just because we wish we had more time
but we'd never really do when it comes
to this and what we see comes down the
road from it take into consideration how
is we are gonna compat things like
fatigue and dizziness and eyestrain and
battery life what is Facebook gonna do
with any more increased data coming in
from oculus headsets will we see more
concerts what is the next big step and
are we gonna see VR and AR combat each
other somewhat like Betamax and VHS did
back in the day that one I'm
particularly interested in to see where
it goes
but yeah those are all concepts for the
road we're out of time we're out a week
thanks everybody for joining us and
Roger you I'll get him out here yes 359
is available in iTunes tune in stitcher
feedburner google play music through the
podcast the Amazon echo of course Tina
calm we'll see you all next week bye
folks have a great we have a great
weekend thanks
