phone constantly display notifications
but don't want your battery life to
drain away in hours if so the yotaphone
might be up your street it's an Android
smartphone with a regular 4.3 inch LCD
on one side and an e-ink second display
on the other having two screens might
seem like a bizarre concept but it's not
actually a bad idea ink displays aren't
backlit like lcds and don't constantly
refresh so that use only a tiny amount
of power instead of having your battery
destroying LCD screen always showing
notifications you can instead see them
appear on the rear ink display which
remains always on the second screens not
just for notifications either you can
view your Twitter and Facebook feeds use
it to display photos to personalize your
phone and use it as an e-book reader as
you would with an Amazon Kindle
certainly an interesting idea but the
yotaphone is far from perfect for while
the e-ink display is pretty poor quality
making small text look fuzzy and it has
a nasty habit of showing a faint ghost
of the previous image every time it
refreshes crucially though there's very
little software that's designed to work
with the second screen yotaphone has
access to its own ebook store but it's
woefully under stucked and more popular
services like kindle or Kobo won't work
properly on the e-ink screen your
Facebook and Twitter feeds can be shown
by a yota phone's internet hub
application it shows a very basic feed
which you need to load up on the main
screen before flipping around to the
back which is the rather clunky process
I also found the fees wouldn't
automatically update with new posts
there's a Notes app that will show up on
the back which I found quite handy for
keeping shopping lists permanently on
screen while trawling the food aisles
the rest of the phone isn't going to
excite mysterious tech fans among you
it's screen has an acceptable 1280 by
720 pixel resolution as an underwhelming
1.7 gigahertz dual-core processor under
the hood and it's all wrapped up in a
rather chunky plain looking body there
are no physical navigation keys on the
front instead you make your way around
by performing a series of gestures on a
touch panel beneath the screen
it's not an ideal solution as you of
course need to actually remember what
each gesture does I also found the panel
to be a bit unresponsive forcing me to
repeat the gesture more carefully on
numerous occasions on the back of the
phone is a 13 megapixel camera the 02
phones really ink screen provides a
handy way of being able to always see
notifications or read ebooks without
destroying your battery life as a
concept I'm definitely sold but the poor
quality of a display the lack of
third-party support the second screen
apps and the underwhelming specs
all-round means this attempt just isn't
up to scratch if your phone can use a
better quality e ink display and work
much more closely with developers its
next-generation device might well be
worth checking out I'm Andrew Hoyle for
cnet and this is the yotaphone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
