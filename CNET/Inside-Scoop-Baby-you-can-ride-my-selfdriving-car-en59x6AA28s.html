samhita joining me as seth rosenblatt
senior writer for cnet set thanks for
being with us thank you sue me okay so I
got a little bit of setup here so
imagine never having to worry about
whether or not you're going over the
speed limit or having to look for a
parking space that is part of the
promise of self-driving cars and today
Google which has been working on a
self-driving car project for a number of
years now gave a handful of lucky people
the opportunity to ride in one of these
autonomous vehicles Seth was one of
those lucky people I was actually one of
those lucky people as well what were
your thoughts it was you know it was a
unremarkably remarkable right you know
like we were talking about earlier the
most amazing thing to me was this moment
where the car is driving along there's a
bicyclist in the bicycle lane just ahead
of the car and the car sort of nudges
over just a little bit in its own lane
anticipating that the bicyclist might
need some extra room incredible I mean
human drivers don't do that yeah the car
that I was in did the same thing except
a bus was taking up the entire lane next
to us and so they refer to it as nudging
they also do something the cars also do
something really cool called blind
spotting which is they actively make
sure that they don't linger and stay in
other cars blind spots we check our own
blind spots mhm were you not used to as
drivers thinking about whether or not
we're in somebody else's blind spot it's
a it's a very unusual thing and having
the self-driving car be safer than the
human driver I think appeals to a lot of
people one of the there are some
limitations that way and one of them as
you may have noticed this as we are
pulling out of the parking lot here the
autonomous driving feature is not
engaged it's engaged outside of the
parking lot because the car can't quite
handle parking lots yet not quite yet
and and one of the interesting
limitations about the car is that Google
is redoing their entire mapping system
so google maps which you know and love
for navigation is not being used in
these vehicles they're creating an
entirely new maps because these maps
in them man-made objects such as traffic
lights and stop signs and it's not just
that there's a traffic light speed
limits isn't it's not just that there's
a traffic light in the map it actually
can tell you how high the traffic light
is above the ground because as the car
approaches it it needs to know where to
continuously look for the red or yellow
or green circle um tell us what it looks
like inside because we do see that
obviously there's the lidar and the
sugar and the radar sure um and you see
that that's spinning movement that tells
you it's scanning the environment I'm at
a very high rate but inside the car you
see a couple of different things so you
mentioned the computer right so the
co-driver has a laptop sitting on his or
her lap and it has a a special lidar
generated map of the area and so you can
see vehicles and pedestrians and and
basically everything that's not you
shows up as a red box or rectangle you
show up as a green box and it's really
sort of interesting seeing the world
passed by in real time in this wire
frame scenario there's also a built into
the car is the kill switch which allows
the driver or the co-driver to disable
the autonomous driving instantaneously
and I'm sure in your ride you must have
experienced this every once in a while
the car would kind of make an
announcement crosswalk or I know that
you only know that actually only
happened once or twice except for the
manual engage right you know it was
again it was so unremarkable it was the
most perfect short little drive that
I've ever taken it was just a ride yeah
but we shouldn't get too excited about
this because who's gonna be a while we
don't know when it's gonna show up and
has google mention anything about
whether or not you know this is gonna
make it to market at a definitive time
in the future they have a timeline they
want to see it in the row on the road
somewhere or by 2017 so it's only
another three years for us when you
think about the fact that they've been
doing this for five years that's really
amazing so this has been you know by the
time we gets the 2017 it'll have been an
eight year project
they've only just now just recently
started doing city road testing which a
year ago they weren't doing your up
until a year ago had been really freeway
only testing so this is something that's
taking them a really long time to
perfect well when you're asking people
to trust a car with your life and your
family's lives I I can understand why
they want to perfect it right I'm not
complaining yeah Seth thanks so much
thank you soon for inside scoop I'm Sumi
