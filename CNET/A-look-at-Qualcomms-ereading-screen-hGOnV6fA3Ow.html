d all things digital conference with
catherine rights of qualcomm one of the
things that Qualcomm's showing at the
conference is the mirasol which is kind
of a hybrid of you know some of the
things we like about ink and some of the
things we like about traditional
displays it's got kind of the battery
life of eating but can play video and do
color some of the things that we really
like about traditional screens yeah you
got it exactly so it's a bistable
technology which is similar to yank but
what we're showing here which is
different is that it supports color and
supports video so this is just ereader
mock-up and again it's a bistable
technology so it's using almost zero
power and as we know displays are a huge
consumer of battery on devices so if we
can enable a display that doesn't have a
backlight we're gonna have longer
battery life which is key now Qualcomm
itself isn't looking to go into the
reader device thing you guys are looking
to partner with device makers that want
to use this screen tech exactly exactly
so and I think about Paul said yesterday
on stage is that there's most likely
going to be an e-reader that has a bear
salt display at the end of this year at
the beginning of next year great and so
I mean in terms of what enables these
these are instead of sort of traditional
silicon chips these are microelectronic
machines or little tiny mirrors that
basically turn on and off that is
exactly true it's it's a bistable
technology so their mirrors that go up
and down and we can control its kind of
this distance right here so just
depending on the opening different
colors are projected back out so that's
how we create the different colors and
is sort of the idea that the cost of the
screen would be similar to other screen
cost yeah I think that's probably about
right great thanks covered you're very
welcome thank you inna</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
