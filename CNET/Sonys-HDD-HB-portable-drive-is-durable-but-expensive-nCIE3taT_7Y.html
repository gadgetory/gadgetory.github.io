relaxed innovation these days well this
external hardrive would be eight for one
its name is H D D which is short for
hard drive
it's like naming your puppy da it comes
with these silicone protective case here
desire in a way that you can stack
multiple units on top of one another
while allowing air flow in the middle
however it has just one Thunderbolt port
here and that means you will be able to
use more than one at a time
especially while traveling seen all
laptop has only one at unabled port now
the drive is preloaded with this setup
software that you have to do a full
installation once done oh it does is
format the drive and it doesn't even
support formatting the drive into X fact
which is the file system that the drive
come with out of the box
exFAT allows the drive to work with both
Windows and Mac seamlessly now note that
both Windows and Mac have a built in
formatting tool that are much easier to
use and we support for more very systems
and there's more not this blue indicator
light here is a bit too big and it's
been to write some I love that but I
fight annoying especially when is
flashes during operation for more check
out my full review etsy.com
I'm don't know which by the way is a
very creative name for a man and this
has been the first look at the sony HDD
