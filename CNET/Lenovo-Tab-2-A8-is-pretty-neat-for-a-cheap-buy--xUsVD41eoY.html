spend the selection and quality of
tablets available to you isn't great
however if you just need a decent model
that will work fine for casual use this
budget-friendly Lenovo is a nice pick
I'm DMR Blanco and this is a first look
at the Lenovo Tab 2 8 8 the 8 inch
tablet sports a rather simple design
with the smooth matte finish on the back
that feels nice
the edges are flat giving your fingers a
stable place to rest when holding it and
it's pretty light making it comfortable
to hold it features a 1280 by 800 pixel
resolution screen which is low for
today's standards but common for an
inexpensive tablet like the Tab 2 a8
texas sharp and readable and HD video
looks fine though colors appear a bit
dull the Lenovo Tab 2 8 8 features to
dull be powered front-facing speakers
they're not incredibly loud and they
lack bass but when utilizing the
built-in dolby app you can optimize the
audio to sound as dynamic as possible
it's most noticeable when watching
movies because background noises and
dialogue sound crisp and clear the sound
also moves between the two speakers or
headphones if you're using them and it
creates an immersive experience
the Lenovo Tab 2 8 8 runs on the latest
version of Android lollipop 5.0 and it
houses a 1.3 gigahertz quad-core
MediaTek processor 16 gigabytes of
internal storage one gigabyte of RAM and
a micro SD card slot performance is
smooth for most tasks though it's not
incredibly fast image-heavy websites and
large apps take a few long seconds to
load
considering expects this isn't
surprising however if you're simply
checking email streaming a few YouTube
videos or lurking your social networks
it's not very noticeable like most
tablets the Tab 2 8 8 packs a pair of
underwhelming cameras there's a 5
megapixel rear camera and a 2 megapixel
front facing camera both take washed out
photos with fuzzy focus and the quality
is overwhelmingly grainy starting at 129
the Lenovo Tab 2 a8 is what we consider
a budget tablet
there's really nothing spectacular about
it besides its low price tags if you
need a tablet for basic tasks and you
like watching movies it's a good choice

review for CNET i'm Xiomara blanco and
this is going to first look at the
