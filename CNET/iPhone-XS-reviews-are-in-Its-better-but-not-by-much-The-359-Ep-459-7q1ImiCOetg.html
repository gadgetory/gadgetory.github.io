everybody thanks for joining us on sea
nuts daily live news podcast show we
call it the 359 unless you're watching
it on a slightly larger screen with no
other discernible improvements in which
we call it the 359 10s max ooh zing
that's a good thing you can take a guess
as to what we're gonna be talking about
on episode 459 today but to do so we've
got been and we got Scott at least
mm-hmm yeah ouch
geez that was another thing that you
just three at least just kind of floated
in there didn't ya there's just
something okay
Brian's getting punchy from too many
iPhone podcasts which I understand hey I
understand if our Brian I feel the same
way a little punchy okay yeah so we got
product we got forget about me we got
the iPhones tennis so let's um so either
way as you can tell from the headline
we're going to be talking about the 10s
and the 10s max will also throw in a
quick story from CNBC that reported
yesterday about more Alexa enable
products that are expected to come out
later this year including a microwave I
thought they made all the Alexa products
I mean all the world already exists all
of them have been made but either way
send in your questions and comments
Scott is here to take all of your iPhone
questions if you have any yeah and yeah
without further ado let's get to the
podcast and we'll see you in three
minutes and 59 seconds from 3 to welcome
to the 359 I'm Ben Fox Ruben I'm Scott
Stein so Scott has come with us today to
show off the iPhone excess and excess
max my mistake tennis tennis max I make
sxs max it'll be called X I'm gonna keep
screwing up the names but either way so
everyone did why don't why don't you
start us off with something easy give it
give us your first impressions what do
you what do you think of these phones
are they interesting are they fun what
are you thinking the design give us give
us like kind of the elevator pitch sure
well so I think last year the iPhone 10
came out in November it was expensive it
was not a phone everybody got and it was
an elevated part of the line
clearly Apple is expanding that line out
and I think these feel a lot more
polished they feel faster there's a lot
of tweaks throughout they don't
introduce any one new thing and I think
that's the thing if you're looking for
something new technologically it
definitely is a faster processor the
camera is better in a couple of key ways
you know faster LTE but you do all those
things really add up to something that
you need right now yeah thousand dollars
and it's $2,000 a thousand for the
smaller one or the normal one and the
max is $1,100 so that is a lot of money
that's laptop money and you know if you
have a ten just upgrade to iOS 12
because it speeds it up and in fact iOS
12 speeds up a lot of old phones iPhones
so think about that think about whether
you want to wait to because this isn't
even the last iPhone this mean the 10r
is $250 less than the 10 and 749 it's
coming out end of October I do not have
it to review yet and it has the same
processor probably better battery life
it just doesn't have dual camera but it
does have a lot of the same feature it
has the smart HDR which ended up turning
out have a real impact on on preventing
things are being overblown in photos and
it also has the same processor mmm so it
doesn't have the OLED display but if you
have an iPhone 8 or one of those models
using LCD it's a bigger display it has
face ID and it could be perfectly fine
for you all right so I want to tick off
a handful of important elements here so
features to me is an important thing to
talk about for an S year so we were
discussing this a little bit before the
podcast one year for an S year there was
touch ID another year there was Siri I
think 3d touch was another one 3d touch
was another with with this year there
wasn't like a feature for them to like
really hang their hat on and say like
hey here's the new thing that you can
really get if you buy this product right
and there wasn't a thing to really dive
into in the review to say here I can
show this off per se and it makes it
challenging a lot of the potential here
it's totally potential they talk about
the a12 processor being used for AI and
machine learning and it benchmarked
faster on you know benchmark tests but
that happens every year and the AI gains
what's really impossible to tell what
that means or how that's going to play
out it's all conceptual really for the
for the user
looked a lot better but if you have to
be a really into AR I don't know a lot
of people who's in they are right but
you know there's that the camera gains
are I think modest but but did matter
particularly its they're smart HDR claim
which I don't think would matter and me
as much actually ended up producing it's
a it's a faster focus more light gets in
the Kin to the lens and it also
prevented everyday shots like a lamp in
the living room it had more detail to
bread it from me blown out because I
felt I had some blurry or slightly blown
out photos on the iPhone 10 I didn't
find them as much but still there's a
lot of other cameras out there pixel to
is great and it's often considered the
best camera and in a new pixel is
expected to come out so last question so
you know that's question I wanted to get
to to we're related to this is if you
have an iPhone 10 from last year is it
at all worth upgrading to one of these
phones no I don't think it's worth it
because I think you should update to iOS
12 which improves the performance of a
lot of iPhones try that out and already
it's made a difference on the iPhone 10
model that I've been playing with and
see what that's like and if you have a
plan that's gonna upgrade you
year-over-year automatically and digit
money doesn't matter to you somehow then
you know sure update but I think for any
normal person who's spending money that
they really care about just stick with
your phone be happy you got the iPhone
10 it's a really good solid model these
are more incremental upgrades yeah and I
think have you been waiting for a phone
like an iPhone 7 there's a really good
time to upgrade however because that's a
little bit cheaper yeah but suppose you
were away for that 10 are that's the one
so we're really caught with one shoe
dropping on these so iPhone reviews so
we're already out of time but I do want
to get to one quick other story we
wanted to mention from CNBC they
reported yesterday that Amazon is
planning to release at least at least
eight new Alexa enabled devices this
year including a microwave exciting I've
always wanted an electorate to call from
across the room they cooked my corn I
know I you know there's too many Alexa
devices I guess if you're looking for
one smart assistant to control your life
like a Ray Bradbury novel yes do you
want everything Alexa but I just think
about 10 years from now like will that
platform hold or where you be buying all
new connected who knows who knows if you
want to read more about these stories
check us out on CNN I'm Ben Fox
Reuben I'm Scott Stein thanks for
listening
riveting stuff as always guys I'm five
minutes
gahafer good job good job good job not a
good job to Apple onboard how is always
did you want me to talk about the
potential of augmented reality and
computer vision because I can really
entice you no but we have a few great
questions coming in from the chat as we
always do by the way don't the max at
all so sorry
I don't care AOL MSI 55 I'm not sure how
to say that one out loud let's talk more
about the camera they want a full blown
camera review and we're not gonna have
the ability or time to really do that
right now sitting here but Scott tell us
more about the camera if there's
anything that got improved it's probably
the camera right yeah and use the word
bouquet as much as possible book a book
a book a book I didn't say that all
during the podcast I should have said
book it yeah let's start with that okay
but I'll just say it a few more times
camera look everybody's looking for
camera upgrades all the time cameras
could always get better on all phones
the landscape has gotten to the point
where there are a lot of great cameras
on these iPhones there are two big
things that Apple talked about one was
the smart HDR and I'll get to that in a
sec
the other was adjustable focus bouquet
effect so that whole that portrait mode
effect which a lot of cameras have now
which creates blur in the background
apples now has the ability to adjust
that eventually be pre adjusted big deal
you might say if you have another
Android phone that already does that
totally fair because a lot of them do I
think apples claiming that theirs is
more advanced in the way that it does
things and really simulates what a what
a professional camera can do
I just know using it it's nice to have
the adjustable effect apps already have
that effect though and sometimes the
effect look artificial also I don't use
portrait mode that much hmm I'm just not
it's a separate mode to me launching
that mode and finding the right distance
to take the photo is usually a step too
far
you just take a photo of someone it's
already if you get close to them it's a
portrait or does it need to be doesn't
need to have soft focus so you were
gonna get too smart
HDR as well as a starting a are I think
is much more fundamental they're saying
that you know it creates better hgr so
you say okay well ever
got HDR on my phone automatically
especially with the last generation of
phones which is true just just add the
word smart to it is more instantly
smarter
I think it's a it's a confusing topic
that they brought up and the more
interesting things and they talked about
the fact that the sensor was larger
let's in more light that also means it's
connected to how fast the ISP is and
also that the focus is faster so I just
found that the the that was doing less
weird focus adjustment which I was I've
been finding last couple of I phones so
I was taking faster photos and then
every day I use it as an everyday camera
our deeper dive tests are still coming
but if you're just taking it around the
house outside I found that again with
bright light and darker areas or if
you're in your home and there's a lamp
on as a classic one I took a picture in
my home with a lamp on with the iPhone
10 and if you look at the area around
the lamp it really just feels like a
white blonde against the wall you'll see
it now on this one it brought out a lot
more detail around that area which is
great and similarly it looked like some
other areas like a pillow in a room
that's like my terrible lighting in my
living room the pillow looks crisper and
has better detail whereas before it may
been a little blurry so that's the type
of stuff that's in smart HDR is that a
reason to upgrade no nope but it is it a
better camera yes so it's like are you
better off with that then you were with
the previous model sure but you know I
think people looking for a reason to
upgrade year over year that's not a
reason and I do think Apple had a
quieter debut on the camera fine but in
a phone looking at all of its features
it stood out as one of the more
interesting things to me that I noticed
in the phone yeah because this phone
didn't you have if you have an older
yeah I have an older iPhone and this is
true with a lot of these models you're
gonna notice a significant a substantial
increase if you do upgrade yeah but from
last year no not as much there are a lot
of other tweaks I mean there are things
like you know Apple promised across the
board little tweak so the OLED if you
see if you put it right next to last
year's OLED it looked to me both
brighter and a little more vibrant
but still I mean it's like it was
already great last year this is like
maybe a tiny bit better it's not a
reason to upgrade but I think it's been
improved
the speakers they claimed or better and
again it's like oh I was listening to
them side by side and going like there's
a little Emperor's New Clothes feeling
of like what is really changing but I
even tried with like my wife and I
listened to it they're both fine and
loud the new one is a little bit crisper
sounding but it's like all these things
you kind of get to and you're like yeah
you know it's not changing anything in
any drastic way things like this the the
screen apples not making any claims for
drop resistance so beware you know the
full drop tests are coming but the
iPhone 10 shattered really easily
they're saying that glass is more
scratch resistant we'll have to see over
time as we use them I believe that it's
Corning Gorilla Glass 6 is what they
were at least hinting at yeah on stage
but either way according represent let's
uh resistance is a lot better but you
know oh yeah let's go yeah let's get
some more question I was a lot of stuff
we talked about camera and I started
getting into everything oh good that's
what you do Scott that's well yeah
Joseph cows do you guys think that these
phone prices are just getting too damn
high in general or overall no totally
yes they're so high I kept pointing that
in the review one of the subheads iPhone
10's max was gonna be like I've owned
ten dollar dollar sign I think that's a
really good point as far as what you
were saying like you're spending so much
money and this is I'm stealing this
point from you you said this in your
video is that you're spending so much
money it behooves you for most people
unless you're absolutely like enamored
with the excess Max and need to get it
immediately sorry 10s wait wait for the
10r
yeah so so you save money it's seven
hundred and fifty dollars which seems
much more reasonable when you compare it
to like the way more expensive models
that go up to like fourteen hundred
something dollars yeah but there's no
more money going back to the original
question that's still more money than
what was it six hundred and fifty
dollars for the base model iPhones not
that long ago so right it seems it gets
left up a lot and it's completely left
the realm of I mean those are subsidized
- a long time ago like when you got to
the two hundred dollar iPhone when they
would claim it's $200 but really that
was like hanging it for two years
down the road but still mentally you
there was a period of time when phones
were like more of an impulse purchase
you're like I'm just gonna go out and do
it even up to $600 which is like a
expensive game console plus but then
when you're in the thousand dollar range
you're well beyond impulse purchase like
there's no one that is like a crazy
night at the casino that is like that's
again you know that's something that you
don't just spend that amount of money
even if it's subsidized into something
you could justify the monthly fee but
like as a way to go but it's a lot of
money the tencel just fine anyway so it
may be the situation customers are
voting with their wallets when it comes
to this type of thing and I personally
think that the prices are too high but
as long as people are willing to pay
this amount the prices will continue to
stay this high Samsung has you know kind
of said uncle and they said oh we tried
to price our s9 at around $1,000 and
people pushed back so they decided
they're gonna maybe try to lower prices
a little bit more but we all know Apple
they're they're gonna raise the price as
much as they can because they have a
loyal fan base that's willing to pay a
significant premium yeah 10 was an
introduction of a whole new price tear
and it stayed the course now and even
added a bump up so you know looks like
that's a continuing ongoing experiment
to see how far the price can be pushed
they also feel a little more like luxury
phones even down to the finish like the
Apple watch has the stainless steel but
also the aluminum model now so do the
phones so there's an aluminum middle
grade phone and then the top-end ones
boasts stainless steel so it feels to me
a little bit like part of it is you're
paying for features and part of as
definitely you're paying for luxury and
I think that that's what's the hard to
split up a little bit with those phones
I don't like that move I want it to just
be utilitarian yeah which they're
claiming they're doing with the 10r
you know but that's a $750 yeah but
that's an acceptable amount if it does
all things as promised I feel like
that's okay I'd still like a better
display on that one and I think that you
know but we will see it looked really
good in the demo room but that was for
all of like a height 40 minutes you know
we
around like a crazy person yeah more
question
yeah we're questions I just wanted to
take a comment from Nick here he says
he's making 60 K a year pays mortgage
but isn't about to shell out a thousand
bucks for a new phone I'm with you there
dude I got off a train myself I was fine
with him for a while I enjoyed my first
couple of iPhones I had fun with them
I'm not married to any feature of any of
these phones one way or another so I
ended up jumping to the galaxy s 8
active just because of the battery life
and the durability because I like to
throw my phone when I get angry at
people um James fever do you think the
price will come down on X Han next year
maybe but you know the fact that it's a
it's a bad sign for that one this year
the 10 once again debuted exactly the
same price an apple does tend to keep
its phone lines previously they kind of
kept them at the same territory they
didn't creep up too much they tried to
do that on storage amounts I feel like
the 10 or whatever places in the future
is gonna stay at that thousand dollar
price and they're gonna have these you
know they'll have a second-tier kind of
like the iPad pro and the iPad mmm so I
really want them to drop in price but I
feel like they're gonna try to get away
with it with the if there's a permanent
10r type phone that stays a little below
that and then they try to say are you
interested in spending a couple hundred
more yeah the other thing to consider
too is carrier deals so a lot of
carriers do you see the opportunity for
like a new iPhone to try to snag new
customers whether you're switching from
buy one get one free yeah like Verizon
to AT&amp;amp;T or vice versa or what have you
so I would look out for those and that's
that's at least an opportunity to try to
save a little bit of money there's also
a lot of trade in opportunities to
whether you're gonna do a trade-in with
the carrier where they're gonna
sometimes they'll actually just give you
the phone you know as an upgrade those
are often you know really useful you
could also try to sell it yourself on a
place like eBay so there are a couple
ideas there but it makes it a little bit
more difficult every year when I
obviously price something for $9.99 as
like the starting price you would have
been a difference
like Apple definitely seems very very
connected to the trade in philosophy and
the idea of like you're gonna get value
back and so then it's gonna need you to
get the next phone but then you have to
be in the cycle where you're always
getting a new phone like you're either
you're like the new phone person and
you're like selling your old one you're
training if you're not part of that
cycle you're getting a whole new one
from scratch and and this price is real
and I just think it's like a lot of
hassle and I think that's part of the
attempt to steer people into this like
buy a new phone every year so you can
always keep trading them in and keep
playing that game yeah when they still
have value all right probably say it's
like oh it's only X hundreds of dollars
it would be interesting to see what the
iPhone tens resale value is though
because they basically discontinued the
iPhone 10 and they turned it into the
10s motion I don't think that's gonna
materially impact or not it's it's not
I'm not really sure I think it'll still
be good because it there are only so
many of those phones but it'll never
take some sort of a hit yeah
that's such a duck I don't even know I
don't know the answer I was like I have
a good combi good I during the next
question I'll go on eBay and see how
much iPhone tens are selling especially
if the model someone has right now
you're a point where like there's wait
lists for things so if someone might get
frustrated and just get a 10 from before
and go yeah I just got a deal on it I'll
take it that might go like it's gonna
honestly be a really good way to save
money so definitely keep an eye out for
that I'd yeah yeah I just want to bring
up another comment from a user
Incredible Hulk saying that where they
live in India the iPhone 10s max 64
gigabyte model is upwards of $1,500
that's US dollars translated into in
India I don't know about money sorry
that's ridiculous like talk about the
first world problems now that aside
let's let's take a step back and let's
say you're mr. moneybags and you are
just in the Apple ecosystem your life or
you love it good for you where is the
cutoff you to quote unquote upgrade from
a 10 to a 10 s whatever seems silly and
pointless what about the eight what
the seven where's that point where it's
like okay that's a valuable time to jump
good question I haven't written my own
story on this but I've mentally mapped
it out I think I think if you have an
eight I don't think this is a fantastic
upgrade for you unless you can really
justify it somehow in a way that feels
like you'd really be pushing it you
weren't gonna pay for the ten last year
why would you pay for it this year
exactly that's exactly it
unless like someone again just like swap
them for you and some magic deal or you
had a lawyer you got an incredible
promotion at work right way to go you
won the lottery
but the eight has the same processor as
the ten and again kind of like the ten
are this year to these phones the eight
had a lot of the same internals as the
ten so you're getting in internally
basically the same phone just the ten
had a better design or an improved
design maybe like the eight design
better depending but so so I think it's
the same proposition the seven it does
fit that like this would be a good
upgrade for the right price I mean I
think iOS 12 really changes the equation
this year again Apple we're just testing
that more and looking at it but I mean
iOS 12 aims to improve a lot of the old
phones so upgrade your phone iOS 12 I
feel like I've never been more into
upgrading a phone to a new OS just for
that because if your phone suddenly
feels faster and you can get another
year out of it that's everything because
it means you can delete my yeah
yeah wait wait a year if you can really
think about whether you need it if your
phone's fine my wife uses an iPhone 4s
whoa yeah that is not recommended my god
okay it's gonna die any day it's how
your embrace no battery like this she
says it's fine but I think it's like
pretty bad at this point she replaced
the battery at some point though no
that's amazing it's amazing so she's
like yeah you should write a story I'm
sorry Joanna I said you should write a
story that just says my wife still has
an iPhone for us I know I'm like drama
to it and an iPad to Sochi
and this is like buyer this a better
choice I'm not like yeah
I'm not you know this is she's into this
so she was driving and suddenly said she
lost directions like the GPS wasn't
working or like that's probably gonna
happen things like you're running some
version of iOS that I don't even know
anymore like it's actually is not
upgradeable you shouldn't get the new
Whole Foods yet
you got me vide yeah my wife is working
on an iPhone 6 with a cracked screen so
sir our home bridging the gap between
technology I'm bringing home the new fun
toys and she's using the 2011 stuff yeah
I just be funny she's trying to navigate
and it's a map from like 1982 right so
if you have an iPhone 4s you should
upgrade to this year to definitely want
to or at least consider yeah but if you
have a said I think 7 is the a good
upgrade but wait for the 10r again these
are premium phones the 10s see if the
10r is right for you it probably is nice
alright we are gonna try to get through
a bunch of questions here at the end
because we've been rambling waiting
around
let's talk about face ID has the face ID
been significantly improved is it a
measurable notable improvement or just
like it seems like it's kind of better
and multiple questions coming in about
having more than one face to unlock the
phone let's talk about that sure so more
than one face to unlock the phone as
part of iOS 12 that's like an alternate
appearance so you could do that with
with with last year's iPhone 10 I
haven't played a ton with that but it's
basically you're it's like a fingerprint
you're writing a second face so that is
nice to have it still stays in one it's
not multiple accounts it's multiple
faces to access your account for could
be good if you're helping take care with
someone or if you've got a kid or way
okay it could be a million reasons for
that face ID is faster it didn't change
I've had a rough time face ID in some
ways over the past year because it does
not work sometimes meaning that maybe
your hands too close or your hands on
your face and it's if you held it up
perfectly each time it works but when it
recognizes and when it does and as
quirky Apple didn't change the angles on
the true depth camera this time so it's
not like you're gonna be able to get it
on a better angle unfortunately distance
is still the same it is faster that's B
because of the processor and the again
that that neural engine that they talked
about which is it's just faster
recognition iOS 12 also improves face ID
on the 10mm so I don't think the gap is
all that great it is faster and it
helped out but it's still similar as far
as the proposition but I still think
it's like anything that's better is good
it's not a reason to upgrade but it's
making the face ID proposition for
logging and better I'm still not wild
about that proposition because I just
thought touch ID was really fast for me
and one-handed and
you didn't have to look at the phone
nice even more commentary on monetary
conversion in Canada the 10r is starting
at a thousand in Brazil it's listed at
twenty five hundred after conversion
since after conversion after conversion
but still that's whoa wait
you're gonna pay 2500 American dollars
correct for the phone in Brazil correct
that sounds horrible
that's a nightmare you should fly well I
guess that's where you would do consumer
gadget tourism and you just fly to the
US and that's the thing yeah like the
flight would be less right come visit us
you just get a trip to the truth buy a
bunch of iPhones some healthcare and
then turn around yeah yeah yeah as
well.we sinks our international audience
for keeping us well advised from sir
enjoy while we're talking about the face
ID let's talk about the front-facing
camera did you talk about any possible
improvements there what can you know on
that for our good friends for enjoy
Scott sure front-facing camera again
it's got that same smart HDR going on
and the portrait mode improvement for
the for the bokeh and some you know that
adjustable stuff um it's it's good it's
it's it's um it's not like a gigantic
leap so that's your answer to everything
yeah I know is that is basically that is
basically this phone yeah um even even
the 12 will get to the chip in a moment
but um or hopefully we will so that's my
thought on the camera the proposition
hasn't really changed much from it but
the photos are all looking better and to
the point where there are some shots I'm
taking that I go these look really damn
good but I thought that last year too so
I mean phone cameras have been game to a
great point
they're not at a point where I would
drop to the floor and I would say how is
that even possible they need to make
just a shot they need to make this phone
fold the phone needs to fold that's the
next step I know some songs working on
this we'll see if it actually comes out
soon I just add something about the chip
I think I think we lost Brian no no I
was just fixing a cable real quickly oh
that's fine adjust your cables working
on my even with jiminy change you need
any beard trimming or anything yeah yeah
I could do some beard trimmer give any
laundry you need to make me feel free
Incredible Hulk says we need to get a
hold of Tim Cook we'll get him on the
phone right away no I got Tim Cook I was
just talking to him so you know I talked
to him like every single day no I mean I
do not talk to Tim Cook every single day
is a funny great was a fun joke that I
saw on Twitter which you know was joking
around about the Amazon microwave if
Apple created a microwave which granted
I'd be terrified to know what the price
was instead of be the time instead of
the timecode button set of time cook
button they would just say Tim Cook
which I enjoyed my killed he's like a
great superhero though like a
time-traveling Tim Cook or something
like the time-traveling chef there's a
lot of thoughts there yeah the digital
crown could be your microwave control
ooh a haptic you could say I want to see
that video right I want that Johnny I've
a beautiful haptic digital microwave
crown sure well you know somebody just
asked me today about at CBS n Vlad had
asked me would Apple ever make a pro
camera and I started to think to myself
that wouldn't be a bad idea you're like
no I just feel like if they're investing
all this into the cameras and the
sensors and they are aspiring to high
design like a Leica who knows no there's
nothing to corroborate that's a total
random speculation they're gonna start a
TV network they can launch a camera line
they could design they did more than
anybody else to like harm pro cameras by
making by getting your smartphone camera
closer and closer
that's them to a pro camera you
cannibalize it and then you replicate
that you
you know that that's a Amazon do that
right Amazon has built Alexa connected
yeah Scott have you watched John
Carpenter's The Thing a few too many
times I you know now that you bring that
up I need to watch that again don't I
you cannibalize and then replicate yeah
sounds like a familiar plotline I I do
love that movie i like david bernburg i
mean that's a yeah it's my wheelhouse
everybody like I feel like the only
natural way to end the podcast now is
for one if I still like explode into a
monster and eat the other one suddenly I
just turn into an iPhone tight-ass
I just frame it up and do like that fade
out with knives and McCrea McCreery and
just like try to figure out which one of
you is the thing spoilers its
telegraphed if anyone's ever seen the
movie you can figure it out huh we
already look very similar so I feel like
in the end the replication has already
occurred hi I'm glasses beard guy and
I'm from New York welcome bumbum all
right we're almost out of time let's say
a couple more quick questions sure how
much time have you spent with the 10r
James is curious about portrait mode
with only one lens on that guy totally
so I can tell you a little bit about
that I've been barely any time with it
cuz it was basically as I ran through
the demo room so I've not done any
significant testing but the interesting
thing that came that I dunno about that
portrait effect lens is apparently it
will only work on human subjects this
also sounds like a Cronenberg flatten
these subjects nobodies is true it's
right now it's trained as far as the AI
to work to work for to recognize people
because it's using AI to make that
decision so that could be a real deal
breaker if you're looking to do portrait
effects on say plants or with anything
else dog or a dog I don't know how that
plays out but that's apparently the case
we still have to vet that out more but
this is from this is via Apple on that
so you know Google the pixel to pulled
off a lot of portrait effects with all
sorts of things using one lens maybe
that changes over time maybe there
updates but I do think it's not going to
be the same thing and also that foam
will not have some of the extra portrait
modes like portrait lighting mm-hmm that
that the headshot mono effect which I
still don't really like because I feel
like it clips out in a weird way in it
really does it doesn't create like a
really clean amazing shot all the time
sometimes you will get it other times
you will not and even talk about the a12
if anyone wants me to do you want me to
talk about the a12 Versailles make it
quick because after that we want to come
back to iOS 12 okay just a hot second
just the the chip promised advancements
I will say in the benchmark tests I've
done so far
geek bench for it didn't see a gigantic
speedgame just FYI sometimes you'll see
like doubling I didn't see that it did
have 50% graphics improvement on 3d mark
that is per what Apple claims so if
you're in a games you know they had more
AR stuff we really still very Mason well
between that and then all that neural
engine stuff which is the extra
processing the AR apps I tried again you
have to be really into this really
looked a lot better the video is
smoother the placement better the
resolution was better even without being
optimized it was at the point where like
my kids saw a centipede like emerge from
the floor in via AR and he was like ooo
that's creepy and he's seen ER before
but it it just a little more unnerving
and realistic so what's a centipede
it's a centipede that's true yes era
tops but to like pull it off a lot of AR
and you probably agree with me on this
one is more cartoony yes because that's
it's it's just there's a lot of
processing behind it so that's
interesting that they've improved the
chip to the yeah to the point that they
don't have to do that as much and it's
gonna be much more prevalent speaking of
iOS 12 in iOS 12 in Safari and other
places like there was a demo I tried on
this phone I've used a lot of a are a
ton of they are they put a sneaker on
the table like an all birds saying is
that's cool and I was like trying to
turn it and then I reached her home to
try to grab it to move it for the next
shot and I kind of fell for it but that
was oppressive because I I don't usually
do that and I'm not trying to over blow
that moment but it does get to the point
where I think last year that happened to
that what you see through the screen
starts to look photo-real and I think
that is an impressive improvement but
you have to really be an AR that metal
that matters to Apple down the road as
they may be but it matters to retailers
too so that's more my wheelhouse is yet
if you can make it really photorealistic
for high-end shopping and you kind of
create make your living room into a
personalized mall yeah that's what
that's what a lot of
retailers are trying to test out right
now so the concept of doing that with
this phone it sounds like the technology
is there or the hardware is there but
foundationally a lot of the software a
lot of the augmented reality still needs
to catch up yeah and I think Apple is
definitely building more towards they
are and we can imagine if there are
glasses which have been reported that
Apple has to figure out some way to
advance AR in a lot of ways so those
chips matter to them face ID matters to
them for future products it may not
matter to you the person is buying a
phone but I think it's those
technologies are what Apple is trying to
follow oh I just we have a commenter
that said those AR glasses in Brazil are
gonna cost twenty million dollars what
so yeah start start now yeah you'll be
paying for them forever all right we
almost got to hit the road here but from
APEC Scott can you get feedback on iOS
12 for the iPad pro is it worth an
upgrade don't want the big iPhone 10 so
does it remove some of the great iOS 11
features he's asking essentially should
he just stick with the iPad and get the
operating system upgrade there as
opposed to jumping onto a new phone Oh
interesting well it's kind of a
different proposition there isn't a lot
that's really made for iPad in iOS 12 I
don't think it hurts to try it out I
think the processor improvements are
just to help all iOS devices but it was
it was almost not discussed by Apple
that being said Apple has not released a
big iPad update this year other than the
entry-level one and we're expecting a
new iPad pro maybe somewhere in October
or something there could be another over
there's something up there's got to be
something coming now if they do that
maybe there will be additional updates
in iOS that will take advantage for
those new iPads it's really hard to tell
so I think it's kind of the same
proposition right now but this this
screen is not is not nothing like an
iPad replacement to me it's good for
reading and video where's the screen o
other acts bingo but to me this this is
a big screen it's nice for video but
it's not the same thing as using an iPad
if you're talking about doing work on it
so I'd say maybe stick with your iPad
and play around with it mm-hmm and wait
and see what comes I like that answer
hey one just kind of came in late here
I don't know how much you really talked
about speed in your written review we
didn't really kind of glaze over it much
here on the podcast today
and I haven't had a chance to watch your
full finished edited review but as far
as data speeds go yeah what kind of
smart or what kind of speed test have we
done and what can we really take away
from it we've got a hardcore weather one
in the chat pointing out that it's been
proven upwards of possibly two times as
fast on data providers yeah so Apple
provided a verizon sim I've got 18 T
which is awful where I live in New
Jersey and like god-awful to the point
where I realize now I have to switch but
so everyone is I test it with my AT&amp;amp;T
service and didn't see much of a game
but also wasn't getting serviced Verizon
runs really fast in my community on the
iPhone 10 I was getting 170 megabits per
second which is really fast to me the
new one got 270 so that's a big leap and
that is a lot of speed my home Wi-Fi is
85 megabits per second so that was great
to see I do think there's no 5g on this
but 5g is still developing an apple
waited on 3G and it usually waits on on
now where I remember 3G didn't come out
for a while on the iPhone I'm sure a 5g
iPhone will emerge in the meantime
you're gonna see really nice speed gains
on this your data right data that is
that is a that is a that's the okhla you
know speed test run of just trying to do
data speeds Allah I do too so we'll do a
lot more of those tests but so far very
anecdotally it is really promising but
if you're waiting if you're waiting for
a big speed gain on a phone you might
want to hold that for five G phones yeah
you might you might wait a few years you
might yeah that's unproblematic the
mobile hotspot Puck's 5g are expected to
come out later this year I wish whoever
was here to confirm me some time but and
there's arguments as to whether that's
actually real 5g or whatever the future
standard for 5g is gonna be so we need
to talk about it what could be a while
we also didn't talk about dual sim but
that's
activated on these you're gonna you're
gonna Brian's gonna go into a coma if we
talk about do you sleep on dual-sim one
thing about dual-sim that I can tell you
if you're talking like in one of these
phones apparently if you get a locked
phone the both Sims will be locked to
that carrier just FYI so if you were
thinking about traveling and adding
another carrier get an unlocked iPhone
10's so that's information that's
something that that's new so you can add
ECM and nano SIM anyway that's sinha
info cool sage advice from scott
caesar's been really really patient can
you just talk a little bit about the 120
Hertz display on the 10s so it's not a
hundred twenty Hertz that's the thing
that people are misinterpreting confused
about yeah that's the touch sensitivity
response so the 120 hertz displays are
on the ipad pro which is like that
buttery smooth like called true motion
so these are not that if that helps you
understand that improved touch
responsiveness is what they are
referring to so it there you go so it's
not like it'll it'll basically the
displace scrolls at the same same way
that it always had before it's slightly
more responsive
yeah the touch responsiveness is what
they're what's responding faster the way
that it samples and looks for your
finger and kind of like mmm is actively
looking for for your touch that's like
they're keep improving that but there
you go cool alright boy oh boy oh boy
such great comments and questions still
flooding in about like about USBC Isom
we see it all guys but we are like 10
minutes past what we're supposed to do
we'll be back with more I'm sure because
we can't not 10 hours gonna come out in
October so we'll have many we're gonna
follow up absolutely sorry
and don't forget it and don't forget the
Apple watch we have to go that have fun
Brian have Brian alright right you
signed up for this I know there are a
lot of products coming in October it was
just a few weeks away oh yeah anyways a
lot
we're a tech website as always Scott
thanks for being on you really fantastic
advice legitimately not just poking you
there
but yeah thanks everybody for joining us
Ben you want to take us on out of here I
haven't done this in a while but I'll
try the 3:59 is available on iTunes tune
in stitcher feedburner google play
google podcasts the amazon echo did I
miss anything and cnet.com oh great CNET
comms unit and using a line from you and
that's information thanks everybody
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
