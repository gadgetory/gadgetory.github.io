number crunching I'm Bridget Carey this
is your C net update folks I don't know
about you but there was so much Apple
news poured down our throats so I'm
feeling a bit of an apple hangover today
with two new iPhone success models a
giant iPad pro a new Apple TV new Apple
watch colors and bands we're now
digesting it all and I'm getting a
little heartburn over the fact that the
iPad pro keyboard costs more than the
Apple TV excuse me mmm tastes like pink
iPhone well there's some news that was
buried under the shiny new gadgets like
how Apple now has its own iPhone upgrade
program with apples program you can get
a new iPhone every year and it comes
with Apple Care Plus protection which is
an insurance program and that covers
repairs the iPhone is unlocked you just
choose among one of the top four US
carriers but you're not stuck with that
carrier when you get a new phone you can
switch it up you have to make payments
for a year that's 12 months before you
can trade it in for it the next model
now depending on the model of iPhone you
pick you'll pay anywhere between 32 and
45 dollars a month and this is only
available inside of an Apple Store so if
you really want the iPhone 6s and 6s
Plus on day one with this upgrade plan
you'll have to make a reservation at
Apple's website first thing on Saturday
to pick it up and buy it in store on the
25th of September now the era of the
two-year contract is coming to an end
some carriers don't even offer to your
contracts anymore with monthly payment
plans many people rather just trade it
in for a new phone every year or you
know you can hang on to your phone until
you pay it off and then save money with
a lower service bill t-mobile is
undercutting Apple on a similar upgrade
deal instead of Apple's $32 a month plan
t-mobile's jump upgrade program starts
at $20 a month and t-mobile let you swap
out a phone up to three times a year if
your gadget thirst cannot be quenched
with just one phone a year t-mobile
promises that if you don't like the
coverage they'll refund your first month
of use or you could just keep paying for
the phone and take it to another carrier
so if you're planning on getting
iPhone 6s do your homework on service
plans before pre-orders begin at
midnight Pacific time Saturday September
12th and don't forget you have to get
some money by trading in your old phone
for an iPhone 5s in good condition the
online site next worth is giving about
one hundred and seventy dollars
Apple is quoting about the same and AT&amp;amp;T
says he'll give one hundred and thirty
five dollars that's it for this tech
news update you can keep up with all the
latest at cnet.com from our studios in
New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
