means there are about 2,500 stores
sawing the device the number of
developers in the program has grown to
85,000 and those developers are in 110
countries and the number of apps and
airspace which is our App Store have
doubled from 75 at launch to close to
150 today one of the things we want to
talk to you about is an app that we are
building ourselves called free form and
it is intended to bring my co-founder
David Holtz's original vision for the
company which was maybe I can use my
hands to create and sculpt clay on a
computer in the same way that a
five-year-old can create something out
of clay in minutes with with real clay
in real life maybe we can we can we can
create an experience like that things
like like the graphical user interface
you know which is like Windows today
they tend to come with some sort of
creation tool so like there was like
Microsoft Paint that a lot of you know
maybe people don't think is the best
painting program ever now but for its
time it was like that first thing that
people used you know and that was a
really good experience and it was sort
of an important part in sort of the
history and so we're sort of making
something like that and that sort of one
of these first steps to sort of letting
people create with this platform that's
what I think they're really excited
about is that it's a you know people
take knowledge getting more more
powerful but it's not it's not getting
easier to make things with it
so now I'm sorry just cutting into it
and I'm cutting into it in this sort of
direction of my finger so you can see
it's sort of sculpting in the wind the
way that I'm drawing and and this is
really interesting because this is not
something that I have to really learn
how to do this is something I can just
do and then I can go ahead and I can
kind of move up here maybe I'm going to
maybe I want to paint so I'll go ahead
and I'll pick a red color I'll go ahead
and I'll just start adding some paint
maybe I want to paint up here at the
same time I'll go ahead and I'll paint
up here at the same time you know up
here here's what sort of a more
complicated thing that a lot of modelers
do they'll sort of paint two places at
the same time that
the other thing that we're announcing is
a preview of the next-gen version of our
tracking so when we launched the leap
motion three months ago it launched with
the world's most accurate finger
tracking and and it is still today the
only technology in the world that can
track ten fingers and it has it's
incredibly responsive and you're able to
build amazing applications like 150 apps
that are in airspace today but there is
a next-gen version of the tracking that
builds upon this that we've been working
on internally for about a year and it
really takes things to the next level
the new tracking it takes it sort of no
longer they no longer track sort of
fingers as sort of independent entities
its attracts this finger is actually
this finger and this hand is actually
this hand and so it lets you do much
more nuanced things that maybe involve
multiple hands multiple fingers or just
in things and positions where really you
know the device might actually be able
to see it very well but that becomes
less of a constraint now when you
understand the objects as a whole well
one thing that we really want to do is
to save us everywhere that there's a
computer so we've announced partnerships
with companies like HP H embed the
technology and in laptops and computers
today but in the future we want to leave
to be and things like tablets and phones
and even form factors that might not
exist today like head mounted displays
or 3d holographic screens or or whatever
the future holds so that there are a lot
of exciting things and hopefully we can
be a part of them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
