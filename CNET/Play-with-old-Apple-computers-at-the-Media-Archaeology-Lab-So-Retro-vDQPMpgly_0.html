opened up played with tinkered with and
researched I think there is something
about the tactility of the computers
that really appeals to them you know the
keyboards have a really firm
responsiveness and you can actually hear
the whirring and the crunching of the of
the disk drives
my name is Lori Emerson and I'm director
of the media archaeology lab the media
archaeology lab is a place for hands-on
experimentation teaching and research
with tech that goes back to the late
19th century through the early to late
20th century the lab started in 2009
when I decided that I wanted to see what
difference it would make to have the
original computer that a Canadian poet
by the name of BP nickel he used an
apple 2e and wrote it and basic this is
actually a so-called manuscript version
of it that his widow gave me for better
for worse at some point I thought it
would be great to start bringing in
Commodore 64's into the lab just to
compare the other contemporary computer
to the Apple 2e and then the lab just
kind of blew up from there and I started
making friends with people on eBay and
convincing them to give me the things
that they were selling online instead of
me buying them from them it's really
interesting watching students react to
computers in the lab because they they
walk in and they will usually
immediately gasp and giggle and then
they seem to be overcome with a feeling
of nostalgia but it's nostalgia for an
era that they didn't live through so
it's curious and I can't quite figure it
out
for one thing with the Apple Macintosh
it really becomes clear that Steve Jobs
is trying to force the public to really
accept this new graphical user interface
and force people to become comfortable
with using the mouse because the
keyboard is unusually small because it
lacks arrow keys
I get a lot of excitement over the
computer that was in Legally Blonde the
iBook the clamshell for me what's most
exciting about the iBook clamshell is
the fact that we've got it set up with a
phone line that we can get on the
internet using the iBook and we can fire
up Netscape from 1997 and just see what
happens so that's really thrilling for a
lot of people and for me as well right
above these computers we have a really
extensive collection of software so
students researchers people from the
public can come in and play text
adventure games from the late 1970s and
1980s I think probably the Apple 2e is
my favorite
Apple has taken the Apple to refined its
design and added some of the most
popular features available on personal
computers the result is the Apple 2e
it's just so sweet I love the the
whirring of the drives when you when you
start it up and the and the cute beep
and I love the fact that I can pull it
out and take the lid off and even I with
a PhD in poetry can figure out how to
swap boards in and out and that's really
what's really thrilling for me
so we do have a lot of apples in the lab
but I have them more as a out of a sense
of criticality than a sense of
admiration
they're here to mostly get people to
think about how things were and how
things could have been and how things
still could be in with the design of
computers
