welcome to the Apple by for everything
good and bad inside the world of Apple
let's get to the show in for those of
you that have been begging for iphone 6
News but we have a whole bunch starting
with the report from Reuters that
displays for the next gen iphone could
go into production as soon as May with
Japan display LG and sharp all tapped to
make the screens they report the rumored
4.7 inches likely to be produced first
while the 5.5 inch version could be
delayed several months due to
manufacturing difficulties now both
screens are expected to use the thinner
in cell display technology and it makes
no mention of a sapphire based display
also everybody loves Foxconn me and
images posted on web site Weibo show a
purported iphone 6 under testing at
Foxconn fake or not the images and
schematics here appear to show a
slightly protruding camera component
with a thinner iphone body and the big a
is also in talks with chip maker Renesys
electronics to acquire them for their
smartphone display chips burn asus SP
drivers the division that are trying to
acquire is the leading producer of
drivers and controllers for small lcds
and their tech is already used in the
iphones current LCD screens to improve
both its sharpness and battery life
probably a good thing after Samsung's
Galaxy s5 was just rated by display mate
for having the best smartphone display
ever tested now it still remains a
mystery how Apple is planning to use its
sapphire manufacturing plant in Arizona
will it be for the iPhone or the iWatch
or for both well Apple Insider reports
that the united states patent and
trademark office recently published an
apple patent for oleophobic coating on
sapphire now that's the oil repelling
coating apple is touted in the past and
first introduced with the iphone 3gs
which did not stand for three grossie
smudges now it's a multi-layer process
with a base sapphire layer a transition
layer that Bond's the surface layer to
the base and finally the oleophobic
coating on the top but with iphone
displays rumored to be in production by
other manufacturers in May the Sapphire
plant could be just for the iWatch you
know it's just an idea
and there are plenty of iphone 6 concept
out there to drool about so take a look
at this one based on Japanese magazines
Mac fans published alleged schematics
for the next iphone now iPhone rumor
mill artist Martin Hajek took the
schematics one step further and created
his own 3d iphone air renderings they
feature a thinner body rounded edges and
a rounded body itself but don't get too
worked up this isn't the real thing but
it might be really close to it and we're
still expecting the iphone to drop
sometime in the fall all right now
competition is always a good thing to be
aware of and this recent week was a big
one as Amazon officially unveiled their
fire TV streaming set-top box that
includes a remote with a microphone for
voice controlled search automatic
recommendations gaming and claims that
it's three times as fast as an Apple TV
with its quad-core processor and two of
these are am all for 99 bucks now
there's also a bluetooth game controller
accessory for thirty nine dollars and
they'll be developing their own games
but I don't think Gary Busey is going to
convince me to buy this if you're like
me you're like talking to things hello
laughs Oh Carrie see but it's
frustrating when things don't listen
especially high tech things you know
he's really not going to convince me to
buy anything
now it's a product that I like it does
different things and it stands out from
the pack if you don't already own a
streaming box so we'll see what kind of
response Apple has an microsoft build
recently held their own keynote in San
Francisco and they unveiled the new
windows phone 8.1 and the biggest
addition is their own voice assistant
Cortana after the famed halo artificial
intelligence who was the emotional hook
for Master Chief oh come John
heart now Cortana will not look like
this on your phone that's too bad but
one thing she already has on Cirie is
the ability to operate with third-party
apps actual apps and not services and
that's one thing that Apple has still
held back from its developers but if
you're showcasing a new windows phone
hardware Nokia don't promote a phone by
pretty much ripping off the same exact
commercial for Apple's iPhone 5c that's
just stupid and that's not even a
commercial worth ripping off so here's
Nokia's or naki is for you purists and
here's apples and that's a bad apple
alright guys that's going to do it for
this week's show you can email us at the
apple bite at cnet com or tweet me at
brian Tong thanks so much for watching
and we'll catch you guys next week for
another bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
