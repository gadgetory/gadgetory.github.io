you might remember Phillips slim style
LED with a flat design and a unique bulb
shape
well Philips actually has a new bulb
coming up this month it's taking the
same approach the Philips Slim style Bea
Arthur T is going to work as a
floodlight to cast light in one
direction as opposed to the
omnidirectional light you get from the
original sim style so this is good for
recessed lighting setups overhead
lighting things like that the slim style
BR 30 LED uses nine and a half watts of
power to put out 650 lumens of light now
in our test we found it was a little
less than 650 close but not quite so
kind of on the inefficient side it's
about 68 lumens per watt maybe a little
less if our readings are correct but
still 16 it's not bad and this bulb does
fine it's gonna save you money compared
to an incandescent BR 30 or even a CFL
BR 30 however just like the original sim
style LED we found that this bulb buzzes
and flickers quite a bit when you use it
with dimming setups take a look at what
I'm talking about right here we've got a
dimming setup using a dimmer switch
that's designed especially for LEDs even
there you can notice some flicker with
the BR 30 and if I hold my microphone up
to it you'll hear a little bit of buzz -
now watch what happens when I switch
over to this rotary dial dimmer switch
from about 10 years ago this model is
designed for incandescent only and it
works with the slim style but the
flicker gets really bad even worse than
before
almost looks like a strobe light in the
end though it might just come down to
the price the philips loo style BR 30
only cost $13 and that's a lot less than
you'll pay for other comparable VR 30
LEDs from brands like Cree and GE so if
you're looking for a good value that's
gonna cost a little less and you're not
using it with a dimmer switch I think
this could be a good bulb for seeing
that I'm right Crist</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
