gonna open this xbox1 X right now to see
what's inside
join me okay let's see what we got here
oh there's a GameSpot pass and gamespot
gold advertisement and code that's very
nice see what else we got the console oh
it's heavy
oh it's heavy okay and also in the box
we've got what I'm guessing is
accessories controller an HDMI cable
just make sure this is the controller we
all expect it to be and not some special
one yep it's that it's a it's the same
old controller that you know alright
moving that to the side HDMI cable power
cable real nice and thin and small no
brick
very good we can put that to the side as
well let's get to what we came here for
the console itself the Xbox one s X they
are a good thing X and s don't sound
exactly alike okay so the Xbox one X I'm
not I'm not joking this is heavy
I would I would drop it to show you the
weight but that's not gonna be good
oh well this is a really nice sleek
machine even if it weighs 35 pounds
I'm not joking how heavy this is dude
come here and feel bright he's serious
he's really struggling with that right
now that's a heavy Xbox one X all right
on the back HDMI is the ins and outs
that you've seen on every Xbox one
standard stuff there is an optical audio
and I guess it's only because the power
Brooks built-in but there's I don't know
that's why that's how heavy graphics are
that's how heavy graphics are all right
let's see what else it stands up real
nice lovely on the front pretty minimal
design disk tray on the side there there
looks like an IR blaster port a USB push
button for turning on and off and there
you have it it's a really slick looking
box it might be a million pounds but man
is it tiny and a lot smaller than I
thought it would be I did see it in
person but now holding it in my hands
kind of surprising how just that tiny of
this thing is even though it's so
powerful and what's this on the side
that is adorable
hello from Seattle hello although this
thing was definitely made in China
alright here's what's in this little
white box like I said power supply real
kind of smile profile there HDMI as well
and that's it here you have it the Xbox
one X and it's accessories it costs $500
on November 7th and I'm going to be
doing a full review so check that out
very soon thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
