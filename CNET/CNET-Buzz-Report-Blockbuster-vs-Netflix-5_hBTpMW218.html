I'm Brian Cooley in for Molly Wood who
is busy with a real time critical
message deployment in other words she
just called in sick first the gadget of
the week the gadget of the week is
Bailey okay sick hi whatever here's the
real gadget of the week the speaker I
pig iPod docking station yep shaped like
a little piggy who spent too much time
at the trough you stroke the years to
adjust the volume the little mouth
lights up and the eyes belly and ears
all contain speakers how stupid don't
they know super lucky kitties
forward-facing ears accommodate tweeters
in a way that creates a much more
accurate soundstage blockbusters doing
its damnedest to stay irrelevant again
this week announcing it will soon be an
online service on tivo's this will be
the first time you find the internet
movie blood rivals Netflix and
blockbuster on one box but there the
similarities end netflix streaming on
tivo great blockbuster streaming on
tebow a rental fee Netflix pioneer DVDs
by mail blockbuster still operates 4,000
stores based on the idea that deploying
a 4,000 pound car to go pick up a one
ounce plastic disc is a good clear piece
of thinking and Netflix as well as TiVo
both pioneered new media delivery models
blockbuster pioneered well chasing
company's that pioneered new delivery
models you'll be hearing lots of new
promos for HD radio on your local
broadcast stations that's because
industry research this week showed that
most people don't understand they need
an HD radio to hear HD radio they think
they're already getting it Wow if all
those listeners think no improvement in
quality sounds good they're going to
flat-out faint when they hear the real
thing
it was easier back in the day they gave
us clues when color TV came out it was
real easy to tell you weren't getting
color this HD radio things kind of
slippery and finally one of those
stories that makes your local six
o'clock news anchors crack their makeup
as they bend their faces into one of
those looks of fake Ernest joy after 21
years in a wheelchair a paraplegic man
in California has a tingling sensation
and movement in his legs again Kristin
and he's now walking cured by the bite
of a brown recluse spider our Tom
Merritt kicks off team coverage sorry
interestingly the buzz online is that
this story may be a crock you see you
don't really find brown recluse spiders
in California speculation is the guy's
legs have probably been healing
gradually on their own and it took an
insect bite of some kind to get him back
into a hospital where the staff noticed
I'm happy for him but for all of you who
are about to drop a brown recluse spider
down your pants hoping for a tingling
sensation and movement stop that's the
buzz report I'm Brian Cooley molly's
back next week
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
