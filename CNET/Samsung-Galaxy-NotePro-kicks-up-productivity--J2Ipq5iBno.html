cnet here at CES 2014 in Las Vegas or
I'm taking a first look at the very
large Samsung Galaxy Note pro this is
definitely part of the galaxy note line
as you can tell by the stylus that flies
out from its little cubby hole and also
by the leather like backing and the
stitching here around the side that is
molded it's actually plastic but it does
have a soft touch finish that's really
important when you've got a device this
big that you need to grab without it
slipping between your fingers this is
definitely a two-handed device the
Galaxy Note pro comes in black and white
colors as for the screen this is 12.2
whopping inches of LCD with a resolution
of 2560 by 1600 pixels that is a 4
million pixel hall and that's going to
make it very bright and clear however
the smaller versions of the pro series
that don't have styluses the 10.1 and
8.4 inch screen versions will have even
sharper resolutions one of the first
things that you're going to notice is
the brand new layout Samsung is calling
this the magazine UX so everything you
saw before on previous notes is gone
instead you have this sort of three tyl
home screen situation where it's divided
into your personal screen your
productivity and working screen and then
your social networking screen everything
is customizable you can get rid of two
of the screens if you really want to but
you've got to have at least one Samsung
has really tried to amp up productivity
for this device and the other tablets on
the pro line for example you've got some
office productivity apps you've got the
multitasking on this large screen format
you can open up to four appt windows at
a time and you can open up two instances
of the same app so you've got a calendar
and you want to drag and drop or look at
different days on the calendar you can
do that another cool feature and
probably one of my favorites from the
short time that I've had with the device
so far is the virtual keyboard which
looks a lot like the desktop keyboard
you've got tab and control buttons you
can use shortcuts and there's a very
very slight bit of haptic feedback if
you're the kind of person who likes to
know when you've pressed a key
for a closer look at some of the apps
we've got microsoft office suite you've
got remote pc so you can file share with
different files that are on your
computer wherever that happens to me you
also have some samsung apps like a
meeting and you've got WebEx support in
addition there are preloaded apps like
evernote dropbox bloomberg businessweek
the new york times and a bunch more this
is an Android device running 4.4 kitkat
right out of the box so it is nice and
up-to-date there's an eight megapixel
camera on the back and a 2 megapixel
camera on the front it is LTE supported
there's also 3G support so there are
some regions that don't have LTE you'll
be using 3g but it is connected in terms
of storage you'll have 32 gigabyte and
64 gigabyte versions with a microSD card
slot that will take up to 64 gigabytes
and external storage there are also
three gigabytes of RAM on here
underneath the hood you've got a two
point three gigahertz quad-core Qualcomm
Snapdragon 800 processor which again
could vary by region we don't have any
prices or pinpointed availability yet
however you should look for this device
to come out and its first market in q1
Samsung is definitely going pro with
this that means there's going to be a
very premium price tag for the tablet
Samsung is trying to get you to even
more put aside the laptop and use a very
high-end tablet that can handle
productivity not just watching videos
and playing games although you can
certainly do this on the pro lines too
I'm jessica's all court for CNN this has
been your first look from CES of the
Samsung Galaxy Note pro</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
