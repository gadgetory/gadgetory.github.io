market a few years ago the Kia Soul
turned out to be the surprise homerun
they sell as many of these things as
twice the xB and the cube combined so
when you go to refresh this car you
don't screw around let's take a look at
the 2014 Kia Soul now the main headliner
how they laid this car out is not so
much in a change of the overall look it
still looks like a soul to my eye but
the dimensions are quite different
around the wheels there's another inch
this way that's the wheelbase but six
more inches this way that's the track
and that gives this guy a much more
planted less tippy look which if
anything polarized folks negatively
about it that was it they seem to have
really cured that now inside a big
difference in the cabin quality of the
new soul used to be pretty Spartan and
squared off in here look at this all
organic shape snout whether you like
that or not I think looks a lot better
lots of soft materials with a better
kind of a quality to them and a
completely different look dominated by
this big boy an optional eight inch LCD
in here you can have UVO eServices
that's they're connected platform then
among other things lets you flick
through things like a smartphone and
kind of toss the screen up and down as
opposed to those clunky page up page
down interfaces you normally see in cars
on that screen of course could be
optional navigation I see here it's
gonna be SD card based also I think it's
a first for kia at least for the sole
pandora integration there as well so you
can control your pandora stream from
your phone here put the phone aside and
top-trim models have another LCD screen
an enlarged LCD between the gauges to
give you helper display stuff like just
the latest nav instruction or currently
what you're listening to on the media so
this car is definitely going upscale if
you load it up another thing I've
noticed and why do you ask about this
how's the room you know I'm pretty tall
six - I am in driving position right now
and I'm looking back and I see quite
reasonable back seat legroom I could sit
behind me in this car just FYI I also
have put a bigger hatchback here which
was another gripe about the soul and now
you can get into what space it has more
readily that goes with that additionally
spacious back seat up front the engines
are not big
but they're very high-tech a 1.6 or a
2-liter direct-injection gasoline for
now pricing and availability on this car
are still somewhat up in the air third
quarter in showrooms don't they all the
price down as they get closer to that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
