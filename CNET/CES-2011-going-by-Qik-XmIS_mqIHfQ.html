Show it's Friday January seventh I'm
Natali Morris coming to you from Las
Vegas this week it's time to get loaded
here is dell's tablet offering here at
CES 2011 the dell streak 7 it's an
Android tablet that has a 2.2 gigahertz
NVIDIA Tegra dual-core processor so it's
got some guts it's seven inches and it
will run on t-mobile dell already does
have a 5-inch version of the streak that
hit the market last year skype announced
that it is acquiring quick the mobile
video streaming service skype did not
discuss how the service would be
integrated but i'm guessing that mobile
video chatting and streaming are top of
mind the deal is said to be worth 100
million dollars Polaroid announced a new
line of cameras and printers designed by
the venerable product manager lady gaga
the new grey label product line features
sunglasses with a camera embedded in
them because why the heck not and a
camera that shoots both digital and
Polaroid images there's also a printer
that's small enough to travel with that
prints your photos over bluetooth
straight from your camera verizon has
been showing off a home broadband and
energy usage monitoring service here at
the show it's called home monitoring and
control it will roll out in new jersey
this quarter and then more broadly
throughout the country later this year
it will let you monitor your home
security and your home energy online for
what they're calling a nominal fee reald
announced a universal 3d glasses system
one of the biggest drawbacks on 3d in
the home is that the glasses for one
system don't necessarily work for the
other until now reald has not given
their product a name yet but it relies
on active shutter glasses input from
various TVs they hope to begin
production in the second quarter of this
year and in non SI es related news Apple
launched its Mac App Store on Thursday
and in its first day it saw over 1
million apps downloaded this is the
store that brings iPhone like apps to
the desktop it has over 1000 free and
paid apps available and finally a few
silly things out of the show first off
you've heard of motion-controlled gaming
but how about I ball controlled game
a company called Waterloo labs is
showing off just this very thing it uses
the motion of your eyeballs to control
things on a screen and the dream bots
are also worth looking into they are
little body massagers that wheel around
your back and dig into your very sore
muscles with four studded wheels at
something I will have to check out later
that's your news of the day but CES is
of course not over and cnet TV has a lot
more great coverage for you so be sure
you stay tuned to cnet TV or Cesc netcom
for more comprehensive coverage of the
show I'm Natali Morris for cnet.com and
