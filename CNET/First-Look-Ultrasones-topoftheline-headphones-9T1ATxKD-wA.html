CNET and this is your first look at the
ultra sone signature Pro headphones the
first thing you're gonna know about
these is that they're not targeted at
the average music listener
they cost $1,300 which makes them one of
ultra sones top-of-the-line models with
a pedigree that does reflect the price
this is definitely a headphone built for
audio files that demand the best sound
aesthetically the signature Pro does
have a handsome design with glass
trimmed ear cups that contrasts nicely
with the rest of the materials most of
the rest of the parts are black matte
plastic but the leather ear cushions and
soft headband both exude a really
professional appeal and yes I said the
sides are made of glass but the company
tells me that the headphone can actually
withstand multiple ten foot drops and
the bill does not flex or creak like
cheaper on ear headphones and these come
with two cables a five foot wire with a
three-and-a-half millimeter plug at the
end and a longer 10 foot wire with a 6.3
millimeter connector for studios now the
port below the left ear cup is where you
plug in the wire and that also has a
locking mechanism that prevents it from
getting ripped out of the socket ultra
sound likes to brag about it's s logic
plus technology that bounces the sound
of the drivers off your outer ears
instead of jamming them against your
eardrums that produces a more open less
direct sound than other circumaural
headphones
CNET steve guttenberg put these through
his listening tests and found them every
bit as precise and accurate as the
marketing claims he even goes as far as
to call the sound transparency addictive
though that still is neutral enough so
that it takes the shape of the music you
pumped through the drivers the signature
pros also sound impressive on iPods as
well as at home through a headphone
amplifier it's dynamic punch and
spacious sound space come across full
with limited sound leakage and Steve's
overall opinion is that they're actually
worth the price if you're shopping for
full-size headphones to compliment
nearly any genre of music you can check
out all the details including comparison
tests and our full review on CNET but
that's going to do it for me
I'm Justin U and we just took a first
look at the ultra sound signature pro
headphones
