difference namely being that it's
running Ubuntu it's the BQ aquaris m10
abun 2 Edition tablet and it's got some
tricks up its sleeves so unlike Android
or iOS this tablet is running Ubuntu
which is a very gesture based operating
system so if you're not familiar let's
give you a quick tour so for example if
I swipe down over on the right here
that's you've how you can quickly get to
your settings and if you swipe in from
the right that's where you can see a
multitasking view of all the apps you've
got running and quickly switch between
them so far so good but the really
impressive stuff comes when you plug in
a keyboard because then this tablet
automatically switches to a desktop view
where instead of getting this tablet
style full or split screen apps things
become windowed much more like a
traditional desktop so the idea there is
that you really do only need one device
to serve both as your tablet and your
laptop I think it's a really cool idea
although of course because it's running
an operating system that's not so widely
used to say Windows or Android you might
not have as many apps to choose from the
other specs are pretty standard this is
a 10.1 inch display on the front that's
a 5 megapixel camera for video calling
or selfies on the back that's an 8
megapixel camera so I'd be surprised if
this tablet is going to take on the
heavy weights like Microsoft and Google
but it is something a little bit
different and I do really like that
converged operating system idea anyway
that's all for now for check out
cnet.com slash
them much more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
