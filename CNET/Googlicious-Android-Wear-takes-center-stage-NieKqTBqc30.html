google issues for all the Google
goodness that we can pack inside of a
show and this week it's all about what
we're expecting and maybe hoping to see
at Google i/o this week it's the googs
big keynote that's really a launchpad
for the latest OS and new platforms this
year at i/o wearables is about to get a
big boost with Google's Android wear
platform that they teased in March Cena
sources say Samsung plans to introduce
its first Android wear device at
Google's developer conference that will
be similar to their gear watch this time
running the big G's platform LG will
also announce their long rumored and
teased watch and sources say Motorola
could be doing the same now the Moto 360
is really the only smart watch that I'm
remotely excited for so far because it
actually looks like a watch come on just
look at that thing now LG and Motorola
both claimed earlier in the year that
they would be shipping Android watches
by the end of 2014 so this timing would
be perfect and I'm just excited to see
their idea of how a SmartWatch interacts
with your phone the OS design and the
functionality with Google now that feels
like the perfect platform to deliver
SmartWatch information up to this point
now smartwatches aren't the only
wearables don't forget about glass we
may not see any major news here google
held a one-day sale for glass in the
u.s. to regular consumers and it's sold
out even with its $1,500 price tag now
it just went up on the play store in the
UK recently from 1000 pounds and if you
want to style it up the Diane von
Furstenberg line of designer frames are
now available starting at 1800 intended
for ladies but you know guys will buy
them all right I'm just hoping we'll see
some of the amazing ways developers have
used glass up to this point as well also
the health and fitness face has gained a
lot of buzz with wearables as well and
according to Forbes google plans to
launch a new health platform at i/o
called we will fit allowing consumers to
track health related data through
fitness devices and a nap the report
also says Google will announce
partnerships with third-party device
makers that will be able to work with
fit there's no indication if and when it
will be integrate
into Google's next Android OS or if it
will be a standalone app now Apple and
Samsung have both made strong pushes to
include health tracking even if it
really hasn't taken off just yet so it
makes sense for Google to get on board
we've also talked about the next Android
OS and pass chosen there's no doubt
we'll see something here at Google i/o
reports around Android have been
centered on bringing a total redesign
with their project called quantum paper
that's targeting creating a cohesive and
comprehensive design for Android across
all different devices we've shown some
of the redesigned icons and we're
expecting this year to still bring some
new features but really focusing on a
fresh new look and feel and they're
still another nut Google is trying to
crack and that's the living room
multiple reports as far back as April
point to a complete facelift and
philosophy change for Google TV it looks
to be rebranded Android TV and it's more
about finding entertainment and content
quickly instead of trying to create a
new TV experience and it will be more
similar to Roku Apple TV and Amazons
fire TV now the focus is a new simple
and clean interface with apps and games
Lloyd developers shouldn't be too
difficult and screenshots of the
concepts show some of the standard names
we're used to see now Google found some
success with their super affordable
chromecast stick that can take content
from web pages or your phone apps and
display them on your TV it's not known
if the chromecast will end up taking on
this new Android TV look and feel but we
expect to hear all about this at i/o as
well also the smart home is another
space that Google has made a commitment
to they acquired nest labs this year and
in a deal independent from google nest
recently acquired Dropcam the web
connected home security cameras for 555
million dollars in cash now what does it
all mean but we probably won't see any
of this at i/o but Ness is clearly
moving to expand beyond just a
thermostat and smoke detector and is
looking to become a real name in the
smart home space with home security and
video monitoring and the one hot piece
of hardware we want but shouldn't expect
to see at i/o android police reports
HTC's volantis the next nexus tablet is
8.9 inches with a 2048 x 1440 resolution
and will have a zero gap all aluminum
body and
turtley it's being referred to as the
nexus 9 and it looks to possibly replace
the current Nexus 10 android police is
confident with our Intel including
screenshots and internal specs with an
Nvidia Logan 64 bit processor 2 gigs of
ram 16 to 32 gigs of storage and an 8
megapixel rear and 3 megapixel
front-facing camera it's expected to be
a launch device for the next Android
operating system that will be something
sweet starting with the letter L but
again we aren't expecting this at Google
i/o but running pure Android this thing
looks sweet so there you have it tons of
stuff to look forward to at Google's
developer conference and you can watch
it happen all live right here on cnet
with our live coverage starting at eight
a.m. pacific time and we'll be taking
live calls live tweets and myself in the
gang we'll see you all there alright
that's going to do for this week's show
email us at Google licious at cnet com
or tweet me at Brian Tom thanks so much
for watching and we'll see you next time
for some more of that Google Isha's you
