thrillers and of course shoot-'em-ups
you'll find all these next generation
games at this year's e3 conference but
it was so neat that made the biggest
splash finally taking the wraps off the
sleek PlayStation 4 its first console in
seven years playstation 4 won't impose
any new restrictions on the use of pia
for games players can sell loan or trade
their games and the ps4 will play older
playstation games two ways sony is
taking direct aim at microsoft's new
Xbox one we've had a great relationship
with the consumer and I think they've
responded with tremendous loyalty it's
obviously a model that works well for
them and why change something isn't
broken as far as we're concerned
Microsoft highlighted a slew of games
here at e3 13 of which will be available
only on xbox one forza motorsport 5 lets
your avatar race even while you're away
a feature enabled by Xbox one's
always-on connection which has raised
privacy concerns Connect is a great
device it captures information and
allows you to control but it stays local
doesn't go anywhere and you're in
control of that information the
competition here between Sony and
Microsoft is stiff but the bigger battle
will take place later this year when
holiday shoppers try to decide whether
they want to go Xbox or Playstation 4
the xbox will launch in November for
five hundred dollars and Sony alluded to
a holiday release for the PlayStation at
a cheaper price of four hundred dollars
Nintendo isn't expected to announce new
hardware but the maker of wii is
updating some of its family-friendly
titles another potentially serious
competitor is mobile gaming how do you
compete against such a ubiquitous device
like the iPhone or an Android phone I
mean it's really really difficult so the
companies that you see here at e3 are
really really trying to puff up their
feathers so to speak the result
big-budget blockbusters but is bigger
better that's for gamers to decide in
Los Angeles I'm Sumi das sina com for
CBS news
