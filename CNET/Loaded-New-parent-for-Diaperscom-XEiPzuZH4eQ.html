del Conte and it's time to get loaded if
you're a parent you are probably
familiar with diapers.com it's great
amazon knows that too they just
purchased the parent company for the
site for 540 million dollars diapers.com
is a really great site that sells more
than just diapers basically all things
baby and they have free next day
shipping just like a lot of other amazon
products i think it's a good fit and i
know way too much about diapers these
days google is testing a product that
lets you record google voice calls from
within gmail you have to set up google
voice within your gmail but if you do
you can now record the calls that you
make in your inbox once the conversation
is over that call will be saved online
for you to access in your google voice
inbox as far as using it to incriminate
someone i'm assuming you still have to
get your callers permission for this or
else the call is inadmissible in a court
of law right you know how facebook asks
you to sign up to your gmail account in
order to pull friends for invitations
yeah google doesn't really want you to
do that anymore Google change their
licensing so that Facebook can't do this
that doesn't mean you can't add contacts
from your gmail it just means that you
have to do it manually you can still do
this automatically with hotmail and
yahoo mail the blackberry torch is now
only ninety nine dollars and it comes in
two new colors you can still get the
black one but you can also get it in red
and white the ninety nine dollar price
tag does of course come with a contract
on 80 a Chinese company is said to be
announcing the first color e-ink display
of course there are color ereader like
the nook and iPad but those are LCD
screens the Han Vaughn ereader will have
a 9 inch color touchscreen and launched
in China for about four hundred forty
dollars it will have Wi-Fi and 3G if you
have facebook friends that you want to
quit wait until november seventeenth
jimmy kimmel the talk show host has
declared november seventeenth national
unfriend day on that day we are all to
remove friends who we really don't want
to be our friends anymore not very
subtle but i'm sure that would be very
satisfying
here's someone you shouldn't unfriend
the Queen Her Royal Highness launched an
official Facebook presence today on
behalf of the British monarchy it isn't
a personal page so I doubt she'll be
doing any mobile uploads or liking your
photos it's a portal for receiving
updates from the monarchy which is less
fun and here's a good idea for a
stocking stuffer the ipod nano watch
band kind of nerdy kind of cool the
heck's man costs twenty-five dollars and
it lets you snap the new nano right into
it and wear it as a watch you can find
it at shop hex calm those are your
headlines for today I'll see you
tomorrow I'm Natali del Conte for
cnet.com and you've just been loaded</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
