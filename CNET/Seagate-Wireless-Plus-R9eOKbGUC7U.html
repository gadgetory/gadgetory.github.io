wireless plus from CK this is a mobile
hard drive that comes with a built-in
battery and a built-in wireless access
point so it can connect multiple devices
to it and stream content from it
basically like a wireless stores
expanded for your smartphone or tablet
now this is the second unit of the same
type coming from Seagate replacing the
Seagate satellite that came out more
than a years ago this actually have a
lot of improvement however for one it
now has come with one terabyte store
space double and it's also have a much
longer battery life of 10 hours at the
same time is still very compact we kind
of feed on your palm now similar to the
previous device this one comes with a
air for both iOS and Android devices the
app allows you to stream content from it
be it video photo or even document but
now with the wireless plus actually can
upload the photo and video you take with
your phone onto the wireless plus so it
worked great as a backup also now the Y
displays come included with it USB
thuringer adapter to make it work like
an external hard drive when plugged into
a computer it also charted batteries but
it also come with a regular charger the
wireless plus is available now for $200
but make sure you check back after CES
for the full review of it once the games
don't know and this has been the first
and very pretty look at the wireless
plus from CK</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
