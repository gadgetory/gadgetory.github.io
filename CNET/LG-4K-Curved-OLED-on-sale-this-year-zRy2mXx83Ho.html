of dreams but now they're finally ready
for prime time on the Questor a fuzzy
net here at CES 2014 taking a look at
LG's curved TV effort so in terms of
amazing TV technology this set really
ticks all the boxes for one thing it's
4k which means it has an incredibly high
resolution it's OLED which is a screen
technology that started in mobile phones
but it's now emerging into televisions
and it's really vibrant it looks really
incredible and finally it's curved so
the screen itself has a slight curve to
it LG thinks that's going to make
watching movies or sports feel more
immersive the model I'm stood in front
of right now is a 77 ensure fair but LG
has also made 65 inch and 55-inch
variants if you don't happen to live in
the world's biggest house these TVs are
going to be available later in 2014
there's no price for now but expect them
to be very very pricey the picture
quality is gorgeous and with a TV this
incredible it seems a little cherish to
pick floors however this curved screen
stays curved and LG has just revealed
another TV a concept TV that is curved
but can also go back to a flat position
that might be available next year so if
you're thinking of this I wonder if
maybe it might be worth holding off here
and seeing if you can get the one that
gives you the option of curved or flat
I'm the quest right to cnet's here at
CES 2014 check out Cesc netcom for more
