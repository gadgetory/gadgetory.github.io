welcome to the Apple buy for all the
good and bad inside the world of Apple
now right now I'm somewhere laying down
and oiled up on a tropical island but we
aren't gonna leave the Apple biters like
you without a show plus we also have a
killer giveaway we're sticking around
for so we're making this a short but
sweet email show where we take your
questions and also read some of your
more interesting ones
now Andrew Walker writes in and says is
now a good time to buy the MacBook Air
because of all the rumors of a 15 inch
will the existing models get a spec bump
now Andrew if you're looking for a
15-inch laptop I would just wait to see
if the rumored 15 air is something you
really want it's not for everyone
laptops will last you a lot longer and
you don't have to upgrade them every
year so if you're in the market for one
my advice is to wait for the exact model
that you want and for sure we'll
probably see spec bumps as well now
Elena James writes in with I just got an
iPhone and I'm annoyed by having to jump
into my settings all the time is there
an easier way to do this like Android
does now Elena I'm happy to tell you
there is and this is probably one of my
new favorite things a UI and visual
designer named Jeff Rodrick created the
Lynx and polished icons that will get
you quick access to your specific
settings so I have to do is just go to
the webpage vrdr CK dot me slash
settings on your iOS device and you'll
see an arrangement of icons for the
services we use the most now once you
select something like Bluetooth all you
have to do is either install the
shortcut or just add that specific page
to your home screen if you add it as a
home page screen you'll have to launch
it a few times before it works but after
that voila it will jump directly to your
iOS settings and it'll look good doing
it
I know awesome you guys can thanks me
later
now Alex Breen writes in and says can
you make the full version of foxy lady
Alex were working on it and we also
received some awesome snail mail from
you guys right here in this mailbox
after I asked for it now I'm gonna look
inside and our friend Tyler Gannon he
sent us this amazing card from his
iPhone directly to us who knew and then
Mario Arg Wetty he sent us this Steve
Jobs button so thank you so much you
guys are so kind
except uh where did this half-eaten
Apple come from well it's no good all
right let's take a break with something
we still constantly get asked all the
time how do I move I tune into an
external drive immersive Donna Bell has
the answer to that is your itunes media
library hogging up too much space on
your computer I'm Donald Bell and I'm
here to show you how to run your iTunes
library from an external hard drive if
you have a massive iTunes library filled
with music movies and podcasts it's not
a bad idea to offload that content onto
a separate external or internal hard
drive but transferring that library
isn't as obvious as dragging dropping
your iTunes folder onto a new drive it's
not hard but to do it right you've got a
lot I Tunes do the work for you to get
started open iTunes and make sure the
drive you want to move your library to
is connected to your computer and ready
to go next go into your iTunes
preferences on a PC you'll find this on
under the Edit menu and for a Mac it's
under the iTunes menu click under the
Advanced tab and where it says iTunes
Music folder location change the
location to a folder on your external
hard drive next make sure the copy files
to music folder option is checked this
ensures that any new content you
download or rip into iTunes gets
transferred to the new location after
that hit the ok button now you're not
done yet there's one more big step to
take before iTunes really starts moving
your library to the new location but
before we commit your computer to what
could be a few hours of transfer time
let's take a moment to do some general
iTunes housekeeping delete any old
podcasts you're not listening to or
maybe some movies or TV shows you never
plan on watching again there's probably
a lot of clutter in your library that
you don't need to waste time copying a
couple of minutes here could save you
hours of transfer time when you're ready
to make the transfer click the itunes
file menu then go to library and select
organize library you'll see a window
with options here for consolidating and
organizing your library check them both
if you can but the critical one here is
the first option for consolidating files
this is gonna take all the files
referenced by iTunes on your computer
your movies your music your audio books
podcast TV shows and it's gonna copy it
over to the new location on your
external drive it will take some time
and remember it's not deleting the old
files
it's just copying them to the new
location if you're feeling confident
later on you can move your old iTunes
media files on your local drive to the
trash can
after the transfer is complete then
check again to make sure everything is
still working and then permanently
delete the old files watch out for
deleting your local iTunes
ITL or XML files lo as these might still
be used for your playlists and ratings
once the dust is settled and all your
precious iTunes content is running
smoothly from the external drive you can
finally pat yourself on the back unless
the drive is powered off or disconnected
iTunes will remember to load your music
library from the external drive every
time it launches without the drive
connected iTunes will temporarily revert
back to the internal drive and function
for things like streaming podcast or
internet radio or downloading stuff from
the iTunes store but you won't be able
to play your library content without
connecting back up to the external drive
for cnet.com I'm Donna Bell helping to
give your iTunes library some extra
breathing room thanks Donald now we also
have tons of you still writing about
this one
Lionel asks the colorful case you use on
