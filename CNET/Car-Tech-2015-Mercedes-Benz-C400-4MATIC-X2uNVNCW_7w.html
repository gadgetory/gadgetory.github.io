Mercedes c-class and I bet it wasn't
very nice
you can unload because they've redone
this car in a major way let's drive the
C 400 4matic all-wheel drive in this
case to check the tech the c-class used
to print small and kind of affordable
now it prints a lot of presents and begs
the question did you just get a big
raise the front end is longer the rear
end is short and tidy and in the middle
is a whole lot of s-class flourishes the
vehicles four inches longer overall half
of that went to rear seat legroom by the
way LED headlamps up front those are
standard a trend was starting to see on
mid market cars as of 2014 the big pano
roof up top that's not standard but I'd
spend the money it's big and very nice a
c400 with all-wheel drive is pushing 50
delivered we're gonna add 2,700 for
multimedia that gets you navigation
camera bigger screen you want all that
hood is nearly $1000 we'll check that
out in a moment the aromatic adaptive
suspension brings a lot of agility to
this car for $1,200 nearly 3000 for
adaptive cruise that'll stop and go Lane
centering sensing for forward cross
traffic alerts that's interesting an
active blind spot tech and a great big
panoramic roof is 1,500 all in we're
about 58 5
now in here is where you really do a
double-take this is a c-class this is
kind of an s-class beautiful cabin I
love this kind of waterfall console
design they're using now and the Ergo
for the way your hand hits it really
comfortable and nice all these C's are
going to have a floating LCD up here
this is the larger one with nav a
smaller one is based they all
unfortunately have this big thick horsey
bezel around it if it weren't for that
it would really appear to float in
midair what a shame it's controlled by
the knob down here we've seen before but
this is standard nap a touch pad that
also has a click function you can use it
for all kinds of pinch and zoom moving
back and forth just about any natural
gesture you want also there at least
three and sometimes five ways to do
almost anything in this car like look at
a radio station find a station selects
media enter a destination they got too
many layers going on but you will find
something you like please say the house
number voice command is optional by the
way generally though very good and very
fast HD radios handled unusually well
surfacing all the stations at once and
not making you dig and notice that
Burmaster audio previously a mega dollar
option is actually standard on this C
400 surprised by that these are all
automatic transmission cars you this
little dainty shifter over here in
current Mercedes style and down here
you've got your agility control which
gives you a lot of drive modes from eco
to comfort to sport to sport plus to an
individual setting where you call the
parameters very much reminiscent of Audi
Drive select and of course you've got
the now almost ubiquitous paddles on the
wheel before a collision tech won't stop
the car but partial brake the blind spot
and lane-keeping tech are very much into
we've giving you either a vibration
warning or moving the car back into the
lane or out of the way of other cars it
can also sense cars that are overtaking
you and predict if they're going to be a
problem
inside our Alabama born-and-bred c400 is
a German engine a three liter v6 with a
turbo on each side the numbers are
really good 329 horsepower 354
pound-feet of torque
I like that kind of ratio all the C's
have 7 speed automatic s-- our 4matic
means all-wheel drive zero to 60 in
sport plus mode is well under five
seconds mpg is okay considering the
performance twenty one city twenty nine
highway you bet it kills them they
couldn't crack thirty let's go for a
ride first off let me tell you a little
story about an engine one that I'm in
love with this little v6 is great it's
silky it's liquid the power is right
there right when you want it this is a
great motor the transmission is a class
below it not a bad gearbox but it's not
up to the engine in some of the fast
shift modes I find this car very
possible and handleable even though it's
not an AMG it's not in that BMW
tenseness though it's always a
comfortable car the head-up display is
good but not quite perfect it gives you
speed and either compass or nav I would
like to also see a drive modes for
comfort whatever and a gear position
indicator in there that'd be really
handy the quality of the rendering is
really good but the execution is a
little blurry and the windshield seems
kind of wobbly as you move your head
around the thing changes shape and gets
distorted that's not good in some this
is the most I've enjoyed driving an on
AMG Mercedes in years light bright and
precise
