of iOS 8 I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your cnet update Apple's iOS 8 will be
available to download Wednesday but
before you upgrade your iphone or ipad
you'll want to prep your device and make
some space for the software last year
the iOS 7 update required about three
gigs of free space to install now it
didn't actually eat up that much space
it only took up about 700 megabytes but
this time around you should expect that
you'll also need about three gigs free
to upgrade start by deleting unused apps
photos also take up lots of space so
you'll want to transfer them to your
main computer and you can also use a
service like iCloud in case there's any
major problems during the update you
should make a backup of your files and
contacts you can do this with iCloud
over Wi-Fi or by connecting your device
to the computer and using iTunes you can
get more instructions on cnet and if you
have an older product such as the iphone
4s or the ipad 2 you may want to avoid
upgrading last year some iphone 4 owners
complained of performance issues when
they jumped up to iowa 7 now with iOS 8
comes new notifications you can respond
to events reply to messages and interact
with alerts right from the lock screen
and the drop down menu double tapping
the home button shows your recent apps
but now it'll also have shortcuts to the
people you've spoken to most recently
with icons of their faces across the top
of the screen and you could just tap
their face to quickly call or message
them if you have a model with a
fingerprint scanner like the new iPhone
6 or the 5s the touch ID security system
can be used by other apps there's also
more of a focus on having a hub for your
health data with health kit there's also
a home kit for controlling
internet-connected gadgets in your home
the keyboard is more adaptive to the way
you talk and you can send audio clips
and maps of your location as messages to
your friends photos also get new editing
tools when iOS 8 arrives you'll find a
walkthrough of these features on cnet
you've heard quite a bit about Apple pay
but that will only be available next
month for those with the new iPhone 6
models with the NFC sensor and for now
that NFC sensor can only be
used for Apple pay other apps can't make
programs to use that sensor for other
things and while we're on the topic of
cleaning up your memory it's also good
to review your Facebook settings for
outside apps facebook updated the app
settings page so you can easily see
which programs have access to your
Facebook friends lists and other key
information you may be surprised to see
how many apps connect with your Facebook
account and for security you'll want to
delete the apps that you don't use
anymore that's your tech news update be
