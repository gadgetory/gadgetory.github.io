little bit lonely and you're never
coming around Ben Fox Ruben and Roger
chat a little jokes yeah yes as brian
has teased we talked a little with the
Eclipse offering a little bit some
advice and tips so many Clips tips Clips
tips yes but before that we'll be
talking about Nokia 8 and whether or no
Kia can make yet another comeback I feel
like we've talked about okay come back
so many I'm I'm going like so there's no
key aid as well as the essential phone
which you can now order mmm so without
further ado if you have any questions
leave in the comments section we'll get
to them in 3 minutes and 59 seconds I'm
still finishing up comes a protect it's
ok yeah I'm actually glad we're gonna be
talking about so today yeah cuz and
other stuff I love though right alright
it's good to get back to get back to our
comfort zone yeah the core yeah the core
of what the 359 has been about which is
just talk about phones that aren't the
iPhone as if we ever talk about the
iPhone people get very very angry
that's true we're sheeple and pretty
hard she balls yeah tell Tim is that
check in the mail you all ready ready go
alright here we go let's get this
podcast recorded will be back to join
y'all in the chat and take your comments
and questions and here we go in three
two
welcome to the 239 I'm Roger Chang I'm
Ben Fox ribbon no keys back sort of
finished startup HMV global yesterday
unveiled the nokia 8's Cena has all the
details check it out it's a sleepy phone
it's got the power of what no keys
calling dual site
mmm-hmm this is the ability to
livestream video with the split screen
using both your front and rear camera so
basically you could you know get the
person's reaction as well as what you're
seeing right call their generous holida
both
a both II both II why did you say sort
of what Nokia is back but only kind of
well it's not really the Nokia company
right this is a Finnish startup that has
bought the licensing rights to you the
Nokia name so yeah yes the Nokia brand
is back but Nokia's a company this is
different Finnish startup is called hmd
they're also behind the return of the
Nokia 3310 the candy bar feature phone
that was the hit of Congress right so I
would like to give a shout out to this
finished startup that I know almost
nothing about to say that great job
you're actually getting some heat and
some attention yeah to Nokia and for
people that have been interested and
excited about the Nokia brand now they
actually have something to talk about as
opposed to like some also-ran phone that
has you know runs on Windows yeah and so
I mean look Andy's Andy oil looked at
the phone you know his first impressions
this is definitely it's a beautiful
phone sleek kind of has that it's very
simplistic looking has kind of slick
curves cool colors three thirteen
megapixel cameras one of them only
shoots in black and white right so kind
of there they didn't mince words they're
definitely going after a younger
generation here they want people who
wanted to take selfies live stream who
live on snapchat so who loved doing both
these whatever give you the credit for
us yeah all right next up is the
essential phone you know this is phone
that Andy Rubin has shown off no
relation a lot of hype around it you
could finally order today in fact you
can pre-order on Sprint or you could
order through essentials website as an
unlocked phone I just remember Sprint
has some of the exclusive is the
exclusive US carrier partners again you
can get it from a couple of other
websites I think if you want to go to a
store to buy you the carrier you have to
go to spring so essential also it's a
$700 phone as opposed to the Nokia eight
six hundred dollars so you know the
iPhone is somewhere in between for the
base model you try to you you kind of
had
and then in my hand hand your hand and
what you think of the knotch hardly even
noticed it because like when Andy Rubin
handed it to me
I had like only a couple seconds with it
okay and he only gave us the lock screen
so we weren't able to like open his
emails and be like all right who is he
who is he talking to but it looked like
a sleek phone but frankly it looked like
any other Android phone so it's going to
be tough for them to break into the
market everybody knows that and we'll
see how they're able to do it alright
lastly we can't not talk about the solar
eclipse on Monday the total eclipse
actual total eclipse not the heart not
in New York but not here in a lot of
other points in the path of totality
there's that sort of runs come diagonal
across North America mm-hmm so we've got
our guy on CNN so definitely check it
out obviously we recommend getting
proper glasses do not stare the solar
clear that stare at the Sun if you're
using a phone by the way you know you
can you should use a filter on the
phone's lens as well don't use autofocus
mainly focus on the Sun mm-hmm don't use
flash good tip just enjoy yourself all
right so for those stories or more
chickens on vicina I'm Roger jank I'm
Ben Fox Ruben thanks for listening does
anybody remember the shoe box trick yes
I remember whoever did it and it didn't
make any sense to me even back then like
I was told don't stare at it but if you
stare through this tiny little hole
which has no filter protection you'll be
fine
I thought the hole was meant to provide
some sort of like you were supposed to
look at like a cardboard piece that the
whole action
yeah the reflection yeah I've heard that
as well like it's supposed to like cast
reflection so you could sort of see what
the silhouette would be even I don't
remember the last time there was a solar
eclipse because us decades oh really
yeah yeah like I remember like the last
time we talked about it was I mean
you've been in elementary or middle
school and we were talking about the
shoebox track yeah so now they've
obviously improved the technology where
they have overly expensive
that may or may not work but be warned
there are and see those guys for the
deal are phonies there are phony glasses
out there that aren't certified and that
can hurt you it can actually hurt you so
we do have info on the glasses that you
should actually purchase that I would
argue are grossly overpriced well it is
it's a pinhole projector mm-hmm that's
what it is then we were kind of talking
to do that about this right before the
show
what was the five pack you were
reference there's a five pack that you
can still find I looked at it I looked
at it on Amazon to go in on a five pack
yeah I pack for 30 and then spend like
$18 a shipping myself back it's it's and
the five pack for $35 it was one of the
more reasonably priced things that I saw
you can get like what it's just that is
there's a lot of gouging cardboard
glasses with like a little filter a
one-time-use thing that's it's really
like there's there's a lot of like
hucksterism that's going on so are you
gonna get the glasses if I can convince
some other people to go in with me maybe
I could probably build some here we quit
some of the Navy the lens filtration we
have that would be kind of Awesome and
very seen Eddie yes I would turn very
DIY of us all right it's time to jump
into the chat imagine Sagi says any
plane engine soggy any plans on bringing
the 3310 to the US we haven't heard
anything
kinda cagey about it I think they wanted
to but it really depends on US carrier I
think they really want to work with the
carriers to kind of get these phones
here so people will actually buy in a
meaningful way it's a tough sell going
to kind of like hey uh do you want this
get awful tea for candy bar phone that
runs on 2g network can you sell please
yeah they will set up probably upgraded
at least a 3G right because aren't we
should at this point most those phones
require an LTE radio mm-hmm so because
they want to get everything on a 4G so
that so they could start actually taking
the 3G spectrum and moving that up so my
hope I'm with imagine soggy on this one
in that it was such a big splash at
Mobile World
is that I hope that it does come to the
u.s. I think that it is another great
opportunity for people to buy something
that is completely different as opposed
to you know like all these different
flagship phones that that's often
interchangeable look that said I don't
know how I'm a little skeptical on how
well I would do in the US because I know
in Europe in other parts of the world
Nokia's huge net has been a huge name
consistently in the u.s. Nokia brand
kind of faded I don't know like yeah
like they fell way they faded way faster
here in the US because they didn't have
great carriers for them because they
just their smartphones just didn't catch
up to everyone else's people still I
totally hear you but people still
remember the Nokia name did you have a
Nokia phone yeah I think that we've
talking about this on the podcast before
I think it might be great for kids yeah
I'm great for people that want to like
unplug from you know staring at their
phone all the time that's that for me
like I wouldn't mind a phone like that
just carry around the weekends yeah
basically like when you're on vacation
yeah when you're telling people like hey
I can't be reached via email like
literally why that's right I've got this
candy bar phone that only allows me to
play snake yes that's it it would be
great if it caught on because when I'm
walking around in the city people are
literally almost walking into me every
single day if anything that problem has
just gotten worse where people just
think that it's okay to like walk and I
spend a lot of time gauging what's going
on if somebody's staring at a phone and
I can tell if they're like panicking
they're trying to figure out a map
they're tourists in the city yeah cut
him a break
if somebody's coming at me and they're
like a mom with a stroller or dogs or a
big heavy thing hunch I'll casually move
out of the way and be courteous but if
it's homeboy fiddling around
in the office one day be like guys this
is homeboy he's been doing all the bad
thing alright let's go back into the
chat yeah Mike right well first I want
to give a shout out to Joseph del mundo
finally watching the live 359 for the
first time welcome my cry asks will it
have fingerprint now he didn't specify
if that was a Nokia or essential phone
I'm gonna say the Nokia 3310 we gotta
look it up really quickly I believe that
they do have a fingerprint sensor on the
fujian could you clarify do you met the
Nokia eight or the essential phone yes
please Mike right and that will that
will give us time to see that all right
you'll find out we got a question from
Oscar so Samsung obviously needs to
bring something to the table with the
note 8 what surprise feature do you
suspect that's a great question and yes
we are expecting the note 8 to be
revealed on Wednesday yeah this is this
is really like we're getting into the
heated time of all the flagships getting
revealed I mean I don't I don't have any
advance information but I um I would
hope that you know you know the biggest
differentiator for the note for a while
has been size right so I would hope that
they do something with the s-pen anymore
whether it's you know there's been
rumors about voice controls or some sort
of mic on it maybe there's like a
speaker or yes yeah so maybe they do
something with the s-pen because that's
right now that's the only real
difference differentiating factor
between them every other like jumbo
phone you really think that that's gonna
get people like super excited nothing in
the line no there's gonna be some people
are gonna way in life of the no date I
mean it's not I know but like a
variation on the pen to me doesn't sound
that exciting you have to remember that
I'm worried about their they want to
play a little safe right note 7 oh yeah
the note 7 is a super feature packed
phone and you know look at the
consequences right they probably want to
they probably want to hold things back a
little bit but you know no the one note
line has definitely a tradition of
introducing innovations of features that
are ripple down to the the Galaxy S line
it's a fine line you gotta walk I mean
Samsung are noted innovators and they
cram so much into a single phone and
they might have gotten a little too big
for their britches and they had to like
backpedal just a little bit I know
there's varying degrees of response to
that but then you got I Apple on the
other side and they haven't innovated
anything in a long time I'm not playing
safe and that's kind of coasting and
they still make a fine product I'm not a
ton of money and they make a ton of
money so I mean it's what where's the
risk how much is the risk well I would
still like to see a fingerprint sensor
that's integrated into the front of the
phone I think yeah right and I don't
even know if this time around and I
think it's coming I think the question
is is whether the iPhone is gonna have
it either that I think that's the big
question yeah but yeah with the no date
I guess as Roger who is our phone genius
yes it's probably good I had to look at
the answer but just to clear the nokia
does have a fingerprint sensor in the
front okay thank you back to the chat
Joseph Joseph recollects I remember
having a Nokia flip phone and the
awesome feature was on the side there
was a button that flipped the phone open
for you yeah I forgot that that was the
candy bar one didn't they have like the
razor phone I remember this was raising
the me that like opened up like this
like I was jumped out oh yeah instantly
yeah he made one no keep the one that
was in the matrix was the Nokia one yeah
I don't know if that was sold in the
u.s. though so like cuz I was like yeah
that sounds awesome and I like went
looking for it I really couldn't find it
I vaguely remember having a phone like
that after watching The Matrix okay
opening the phone every single to the
bottom of the phone like wasn't anything
was like a simple gate cover right and
they like slid in I there may have been
a keyboard yeah that was the deal like
the keyboard was under the cover the
cover would slide down right like mm-hm
so it would kind of curve so it looked
like a kind of like a traditional phone
right and you could answer the phone and
just say like neo this is loco
so that was that's probably that was not
the matrix line I was I was thinking you
would say it's my favorite it's a great
line
all right Oscar says I like this idea
the S Pen should have a touch sensor
that would control the phone even when
it's not touching it so like you're
saying that you can like air paint kind
of like in vro or like Minority Report
sort of fish kind of I refuse to watch
that movie
what's pretty good why do you have this
conversation with Bakalar many times I'm
not gonna watch that movie I like the
Tom Cruise okay it's a great movie I
mean he is rather grading we can all
agree really I like Tom Cruise okay
imagine soggy asks how do the front and
back camera work the final image the
video at the same time on the new Nokia
phone okay so that's a pretty technical
question how does it work technically or
how does it look I think he's also for
more of a response to the quality of the
results the quality of the video I don't
know yet we haven't our colleague in the
UK got his hands on the phone so we're
still going through the we've got a
first take up we're gonna have some
video of the like the split-screen look
so you can see that look good but you
can't really tell you know how sharp the
resolution is from that video you have
to just sort of hang on until the review
comes out mmm all right so let's go back
to the Eclipse and this is just on my
own personal curiosity I myself am just
kind of geeky but very uh knowledgeable
about astrology not astronomy sorry sure
sorry sorry you've proven your point
yeah so in in in the article we got many
recommendations from your guys personal
perspective what is your top tier in the
article that will be in the link in the
description and as far as your best
solution to watch the Eclipse on Monday
I think the glasses yeah probably the
coolest yeah as otherwise you're you
know kind of not even looking know like
those are those are from like that's
like the decade old technology the
problem was
decade decades yeah but it was fun back
in the day as a kid that was like a
project in science yes totally yeah the
problem is is you're you're definitely
overpaying for these eclipse classes
that you're not gonna need unless Brian
build them unless Brian builds them so I
would say like look if you're if you're
really interested than it is worth the
money because when's the next time we're
gonna have a total eclipse in the area
probably I mean that's a thank you
paying for like the one once in a well
quasi once-in-a-lifetime experience for
some maybe twice at best so I mean it's
gone like a couple of bucks not too bad
it's a commemoration it's just a
commemoration you've done a shelf and I
stared at the Sun as we speak get him
here now I don't know we should we
should at least rally the office I bet
we could find a few others okay thanks I
hope everybody else enjoys their time
with the Eclipse on Monday good luck
we'd love to see your results thank you
if anybody gets any good photography
going on tweeted us and I think that's
about it to wrap up the week yeah good
luck again please don't stare at the
clips they're just gonna instinctively
as they're trying to shoot with their
phone just kind of look up for a second
nobody you're like you know what I'm
just a bunch of knuckleheads out there
they're not gonna listen to me okay all
right that's it for the week yeah wow
what a wonderful life
what a wonderful yeah well looks feel
like they think you saw her hurt here
chuckles I was seen at our podcast is
also available on iTunes
TuneIn stitcher SoundCloud feed burner
and Google Play Music see y'all next
week oh thanks
