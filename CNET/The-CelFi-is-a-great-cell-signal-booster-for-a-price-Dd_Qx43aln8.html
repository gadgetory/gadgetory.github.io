conversation with somebody faraway and
special and poof it got disconnected
it's just another cellphone story really
but now there's a way for you to save
that long-distance romance of yours if
it's worth it I'm dumb no and this is
the self I from the next DVD now the
name is self i and not selfie selfie the
thing you do in hope to start a romance
and this thing here helps you mint in
one got it
so what is this well this is a cell
signal booster and it comes with two
units the receiver right here or the
window unit now you want to put this
units where the cell phone signal such
as by the window of your top floor you
can see it come with this bar right here
to show how strong the signal is ideally
you would put where there are full bars
but just one bar is enough the second
divot here is the booster or the
coverage unit you want to put this one
as far away from the first one as
possible because the further it is the
larger the coverage is gonna be but not
too far away because then the two cannot
sing so how far it's fun as it turns out
the two of them here connect to each
other using the same frequency as five
gigahertz Wi-Fi and that means you can
put them between 150 and 300 feet apart
basically as long as you see this green
icon here on the second unit that's mean
the two are not too far away now note
that it takes up to two bit for these
two to sync so it might have to wait a
bit during the setup process and that's
all we have to do to take advantage of
the cell fire in my testing it actually
worked really well and boosts the cell
signal a great deal for example I'm here
in a middle of building actually deep in
the ground and take a look at this this
t-mobile phone here still show full bars
very impressive now you know the self AI
works well but it's not profit far from
it for a few reasons
first is only work with GSM carrier and
is carrier specific so in the States you
have to buy it either for AT&amp;amp;T or
t-mobile or buy to to work with
and secondly why it works really well
with voice for data it does not support
4G LTE now it's not a big deal because
we're inside
chances are you have Wi-Fi what's the
big deal is also my final complaint
about this one is the price is very
expensive costing somewhere between $500
and $600 now for an office it's not a
big deal because it actually worked
pretty well because it support up to 60
user at a time but for home well we have
to really think if talking to that
person is worth the investment and for
more the self I've here check out my
full review I said calm I'm ever I get
it for myself
no way because always better to say I'm
sorry I got disconnected when you
actually want to hang up on people take
my word for it that's because I'm dumb
no and this has been the first look at
the self I from next deeply</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
