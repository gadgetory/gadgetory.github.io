a look at the brand new HP envy 14
spectre last spotted at CES 2012 now
unlike most laptops which are fairly
generic looking gray boxes occasionally
get something that breaks out of the
design mold a lot of the time these
really inventive designs things like the
dell adamo XPS or the acer iconia the
laptop with the two touch screens
instead of a screen and a keyboard other
just a little bit too quirky to really
catch on over the company's behind them
don't support them long enough and they
just kind of fade out of you at least in
the case of the spectre it's off to a
good start because at CES in one our
computers in a hard work category best
of category and it generated a lot of
buzz at the show largely because besides
being one of the first 14-inch ultrabook
laptops which just means that it needs
intel's definition for what a thin
powerful ultrabook is it's very unusual
in that besides the glass all over the
front of the screen there's glass on the
back of the lid and even a glass wrist
rest that runs all the way across here
and incorporates a touchpad now on top
of that there are few other cool
features like beats audio which a lot of
HP laptops have and even in NFC or near
field communication antenna which means
that if you take a compatible Android
phone which they're not that many right
now and you download this HP app you can
then just place the phone right here and
connect to the laptop and share data and
playing around with it right now I can
only share web pages but eventually
hopefully you'll be able to do contacts
and phone numbers and all kinds of other
information maybe even photos now you
may be asking yourself self why would I
want a glass clad laptop isn't that kind
of dangerous and yes that element of
danger kind of makes it a little bit
exciting but at the same time this is
corning gorilla glass that is the same
glass that's on products like the apple
ipad and it's a fairly scratch resistant
and shatter resistant I still wouldn't
go push this off a table and you know
hope for the best but you do end up with
a very cool look and when you close it
has a very nice slab like feel from the
back while if you look at it from the
front you'd almost think maybe it's a
you know 15-inch macbook pro it's
actually a lot smaller than that it's a
14 inch screen in something that's
us to kind of a 13-inch body which means
that it feels a little bit dense and
heavy compared to what you think it
would feel like when you first touch it
the one part I wasn't super crazy about
it's actually this glass wrist rest here
it's fairly comfortable under the palms
of your hands but at the same time it's
got this abrupt drop off here it's just
like a big slab a glass right there I
will say multi-touch gestures on the big
click bad are some of the best I've seen
on a windows laptop so far the biggest
stumbling block to the spectre seems to
be its price it starts 1399 which is a
lot more than just about any other
ultrabook and for that you only get a
standard core i5 cpu 128 gig SSD no
fancy graphics or anything like that you
can get pretty much the same specs and
the 13 inch ultrabook that may not be as
fancy for like 8 99 maybe a little bit
less if you shop around that said the
experience is a lot of fun the the
design is very unique its eye-catching
it's just a great laptop to carry around
in use you are however paying a design
premium but a lot of companies including
Apple and maybe even Sony have gotten
away with that for a long time there's
no reason the HP Spectre can't either
I'm Dan Akron and then is the HP envy 14
