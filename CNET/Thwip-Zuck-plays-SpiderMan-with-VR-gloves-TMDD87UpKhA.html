the future Facebook founder Mark
Zuckerberg shared some behind-the-scenes
photos of the oculus research lab in
Redmond Washington which Facebook owns
and among the photos we see Zuckerberg
wearing gloves that work in virtual
reality
he wrote that he was able to shoot web
from his wrist just like spider-man but
it wasn't all just whipping around he
also said the gloves let him type on a
virtual keyboard so why is Zuckerberg
showing off new VR gloves in a Facebook
post about his little oculus field trip
maybe because the day before the tech
news world was flooded with headlines
about how interest in oculus VR may be
in trouble
Facebook is shutting down hundreds of
oculus rift demo stations at Best Buy
stores across the United States
the oculus team says it's due to
seasonal changes but a Business Insider
report pins it on a lack of consumer
interest with some stores going days
without anyone trying out the headset
seeing your hands and virtual worlds
would be the next big leap that would
get people excited about virtual reality
right now everyone has to use game
controllers oculus has been working on
getting your hands in the VR world for
some time now it acquired the hand
tracking company pebbles interface back
in 2015 and that technology could be
what's incorporated into the gloves that
Zuckerberg was wearing I'm Bridget Carey
and you can stay plugged into all the
news in this world and the virtual world
