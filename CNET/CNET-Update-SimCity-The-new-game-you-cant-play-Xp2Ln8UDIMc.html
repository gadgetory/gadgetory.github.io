Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update it's been about a month since
blackberry showed off the brand new z10
smartphone you know the one that's going
to save the company but we still don't
know when it will go on sale in the US
that lack of information could be
slowing the momentum blackberry built up
after unveiling it in January right now
bloomberg is reporting that AT&amp;amp;T could
be selling the z10 on march 22nd and
we're all expecting the keyboard model
the q10 to come out about a month after
that the z10 has been on sale already in
Europe and Canada and early sales seem
to show it's off to a good start but
blackberry could have problems competing
with its App Store as users won't find
some popular apps like Instagram Pandora
YouTube and Netflix disaster has struck
the new SimCity since it launched on
Tuesday players of the game have been
hit with error messages and random
disconnections and it's all because the
game requires you to be logged online to
play and Electronic Arts servers can't
handle the high load of players you
could always play simcity offline before
but EA is now requiring an internet
connection to protect against software
piracy EA has temporary disabled some of
these online multiplayer features until
it can get more servers to handle the
traffic fans have waited 10 years for a
new SimCity game and this is turning out
to be a very messy launch for those of
you with a nuke keep your eye out for
free books and apps every Friday nuke
free fridays I've always featured a free
ebook but now those with the note tablet
can also grab a free app the real estate
app trulia is a tool for searching for
available properties and it added a new
way to hunt for your next home if you
click like on a property the app will
offer suggestions with photos of other
places that look similar it's like
blending the concept of Pandora but with
homes in a previous update I've reported
that tweetdeck apps are being
discontinued and will soon stop working
that means it's time to teach yourself a
few new apps to manage your twitter feed
for iOS users tweetbot is very popular
but it's three dollars a free app is
HootSuite we
has a similar experience of using
columns to browse like you can do on
tweetdeck you can sign into multiple
accounts schedule posts track stats and
you can also sign into other networks
like facebook and foursquare android
users you should check out plume it's
free and also let you make custom
columns to follow and tweet line which
is also free has clean navigation and
perks like autocomplete for user names
and a list of trending topics that's
your tech news update you can find more
