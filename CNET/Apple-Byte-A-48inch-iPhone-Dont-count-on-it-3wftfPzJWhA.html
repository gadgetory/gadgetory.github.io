Tong here it's all the good and bad
inside the world of apple and i'm back
and baked like a fresh cookie from the
oven like a snickerdoodle now apple just
announced their recent earnings report
for the first fiscal quarter of 2013
that covers the holiday season and it
was another record quarter posting 13 21
billion dollars of profit on revenue of
50 4.5 billion dollars now they sold
47.8 million iphones compared to 37
million in the same quarter last year
22.9 million iPads were sold versus 15.4
million last year but I max dropped from
4.1 million compared to 5.2 a year ago
and the big a blamed the lower sales on
iMac supply constraints now the record
numbers still did it beat Wall Street's
high expectations but Tim Cook addressed
the supply chain rumors that Apple may
have cut iphone 5 orders on weak demand
for the product Cook said because of the
complex supply chain and its multiple
sources it's really impossible to
interpret a single data point and make a
general assessment about the overall
business he also danced around the Apple
TV question again now the iphone rumor
mills have been making sure to keep it
in the headlines with recent talks of an
incoming 4.8 inch screen iphone called
the iphone math according to the
translation in the china times and come
on guys the name iphone math makes total
sense to now russian website Apple
digger even went as far as to create a
video render of what the larger screen
iphone would look like and look at that
it looks really good but then reality
hit and digit times one of the sites
that started the rumor is now
backtracking that claim and is now
saying that Apple only plans to launch
two new four inch models in 2013 a
next-gen 5s and an iphone 5 that is
cheaper to produce with possibly a
plastic body and that's if you believe
that story or not now in more future
plans from Apple according
a chinese website called my driver's a
foxconn insider has revealed that the
ipad 5 will sport a new design with the
slimmer side bezels of the ipad mini and
chamfered edge corners but brian what
does that mean well Jamie chamfer refers
to an angular cut referral in
woodworking you might refer to it as a
beveled edge thanks charlie now you guys
could have guessed the big a's plans and
we said the same thing when the ipad
mini design was revealed setting up the
future full-size ipad look as well also
reuters reports that production for the
regular ipad screen has nearly halted by
sharp core as the man has shifted over
to the ipad mini it also potentially
points to a different screen moving
forward for the next gen full-size ipad
all right now we don't have an app of
the week this week but this is an app
you guys should all be paying attention
to it's called mailbox from the
orchestra team it's launching for free
in the coming weeks and it's an all new
take on accessing and using your mailbox
it has this really cool swipe
functionality that allows you to keep or
trash emails and the best is a snoozed
email feature with a left swipe that
then lets you deal with specific emails
later for a time that you set so you can
focus on what's important and if you're
at zero mailbox type of person this is
we're checking out now i'm super amped
about this app and you can reserve your
spot in line for the roll out of this
free app at the link you see here and
learn more about the mailbox app all
right to the quick bites an apple
insider has discovered job listings on
apple's website looking for a new
engineer to test the next version of iOS
is new api's and frameworks and we know
iOS 6 saw the least amount of change in
Apple's mobile OS has a lot of catch-up
to do these days and in a little fun
story from the past verizon had plans to
make Siri and Android exclusive on all
their Android devices on their networks
until Apple swooped in to purchase Siri
the story in The Huffington Post says
verizon actually signed a deal with Siri
in two thousand nine months before apple
bought the company there were also
unreleased commercials made by the big V
2
show serie as an Android feature now
that probably worked out for verizon
with Google's top-notch voice
recognition but are you the Apple biters
still even using Syria regularly let us
know at the Apple by to cnet's comment
will read your thoughts next week and
finally you know we like to monkey
around here on the show but check this
out the Smithsonian zoo along with 12
other zoos is participating in a program
called apps for apes now it's leveraging
the touchscreen interactivity of the
iPad to enrich the lives of apes and
captivity 10 apps were identified as key
apps including music drawing and game
apps and koi pond was one of the popular
apps what a coincidence because my
favorite app is koi pond now this might
sound familiar from a previous story but
they've taken it to the next level and
their hope is to tap into the creative
outlet of the Apes minds and one day
even connect orangutang across the
continent with facetime have you guys
seen Rise of the Planet of the Apes you
don't want to do that and yes but those
are you rolling your eyes earlier
monkeys are different than Apes because
they have a tail where apes don't but
they're both primates I didn't know that
see you learn a lot when you watch the
show all right that's going to do it for
this week's episode and it's good to be
back with my family you the Apple biters
email us at the apple byte at cnet com
or tweet me brian Tong and we'll read
some of your responses next week thanks
for watching and we'll catch you guys
next time for another bite of the Apple
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
