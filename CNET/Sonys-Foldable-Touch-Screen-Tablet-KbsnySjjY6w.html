I'm taking a first look at the Sony
Tablet P the first thing you'll notice
about the P is that it has a dual screen
hinge base design that allows the tablet
to be compacted like a clamshell
each screen measures 5.5 inches and each
is capable of high brightness output
once compacted the tablet fits nicely
into most large pockets there's a low
res 0.3 megapixel front camera and a 5
megapixel back camera while the OS
displays over both screens some apps
like the Android Market will only
display in the top screen which is a bit
frustrating with some apps like the
Marvel Comics app either watching on a
5.5 inch screen or over both screens the
problem is this small space between the
screens making the full screen
experience less than seamless the same
goes for Android games in most movie
players however the Sony movie player
and photo app make good use of the
screens by separating controls from
output the PIA includes limited
PlayStation Store support with access to
some PlayStation 1 games the games we
play from the store are well implemented
placing most of the controls on the
bottom screen with the game on the top
the peas battery is removable and
there's microSD memory expansion up to
32 gigabytes the P is available for $400
if you sign up for a two-year contract
with AT&amp;amp;T this gives you access to its
HSPA+ network however I don't recommend
getting roped into a two-year contract
with any tablet off-contract is
available for 550 bucks if you're
looking for something just a little bit
different in an Android tablet dual
screens and a compatible clamshell
design does fit the bill it's really
cool-looking I love the way it folds
also the removable battery is useful and
a five megapixel back camera takes
pretty detailed pictures unfortunately
the PlayStation Store is limited and not
to mention an old game selection isn't
exactly killing me with anticipation and
while I appreciate that novel approach
to design it's not implemented
seamlessly and there are just better
tablet solutions out there
and around the same price or lore check
out the full review for more details
once again I'm Eric Franklin and this
has been the first look at the Sony
Tablet P</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
