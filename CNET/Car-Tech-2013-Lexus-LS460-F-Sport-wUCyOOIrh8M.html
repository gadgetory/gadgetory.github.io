flagship luxo sedan don't go together in
your head but if you spent much time
with this guy they might get a lot
closer let's drive the 2013 lexus LS 460
with the F Sport Package and check the
tech
now with this LS an F Sport trim whose
Lexus going after clearly not BMW they
don't even do an m7 but that leaves the
s-class and it's AMG version and of
course outies eight in the S trim Lexus
has always been known for a very fine
touch on precision and luxury and nuance
but are they still top of the stack on
tests inside all Lexus and especially
the LS scream high-tech in a 1970s
Japanese way which I offer is a
compliment lots of buttons and indicator
lights crisp high-tech gauge faces a lot
of blue lighting and a vaguely masculine
touch the same things I might say of a
technics quadrophonic receiver you
navigate the lanes of this big wide
screen with this the Lexus remote touch
controller I'll be honest the novelty of
it has worn off for me since its
introduction a couple model years ago
and I now find it fiddly and imprecise
under my hand at least it's just a lot
of overshooting when I'm trying to
cursor to something so of course you can
fall back to voice command which is
generally excellent in this LS in terms
of comprehension but kind of old-school
and that it generally requires button
and beep parsing for each part of an
address for example enter an address
enter an address
searching California say only the city
name or say change state San Francisco
San Francisco rear cam is standard but
front cams all around cams and a
variable view rear cam don't show up
here again somewhat dated media choices
however have all the modern hits am/fm
HD with tagging Sat radio USB plus iPod
bluetooth streaming and of course an
optical drive on top of that you have
lexus version of Toyotas groundbreaking
Entune apps here they call it inform
Yelp open table Pandora
Bing I Heart Radio and Facebook Places
the latter I think is unique to the
Lexus side and probably the least
relevant 19 speaker 450 watt Mark
Levinson audio is a Lexus hallmark but
it remains an upgrade on the LS 460
Lexus was a pioneer in fancy rear cabins
and on this one you can get shiatsu
massage rear seats with butterfly
headrests recline dedicated rear heater
and air purifier but all that second row
luxury in a car that isn't a
long-wheelbase doesn't make a lot of
sense to me do an L Lexus of course
builds engines that seem to come out of
the Rolex Factory and this one's no
exception even though you can't see any
of it
4.6 liter v8 no tricks no blowers no
turbos no hybrid 386 horsepower 367
foot-pounds of torque gets this guy to
60 in 5 point 4 seconds that's moving
four thousand three hundred and sixty
some odd pounds and still delivering
1624 mpg everything goes out through an
8-speed automatic and either rear wheel
drive like we have or all-wheel drive
option
away in the ls you're totally aware of
the smoothness of it right there with
Audi it's one of the smoothest
engineered cars out there they've dialed
out almost all the noise vibration and
harshness that the auto industry goes
after as a basket of bad guys on the
other hand and therefore has a certain
softness almost we were just driving the
BMW 750 against this car which we've got
another video on head-to-head and this
is much more of a finer softer lighter
input type vehicle even though it's
meant to be a very Sport trim version
with this F package now like many cars
in its category we've got a couple
sports settings a normal setting a
couple of comfort settings you may not
find a huge difference between the ones
that are in one end or the other like
the two sports mm you know I could use
one
same thing for comfort but it's all
software so why not give people more
features that they'll pay for even as an
F Sport the power is somewhat buried in
this LS until you go looking for it and
you still won't mistake it for an M car
when pressed and in sport mode with
manual shifting and the lowered adaptive
suspension doing its firmest the big
Lexus still feels like a fine car in
performance mode more than a serious
performance car that's also luxurious I
actually think that makes sense
certainly for an LS no head-up display
or night vision available here blind
spot tech though is standard as is lane
departure control and collision
avoidance that can flat stop the car at
up to city speeds if it spots something
out there that you don't
alright here's my take on the LS 460 in
the F Sport trim it's a hell of a value
72 8 was base I threw every option at it
16 thousand and change for the
ultra-luxury package and I barely got
over eighty nine thousand compared to
the Germans that's a steal the LS 460
export slots a notch below AMG and
manager didn't mean that's it's a nicer
performance flagship and foremost it's a
smarter buy in terms of MSRP and
depreciation Lexus has the best app
system in its class buy one of these
because you like precision comfort and
performance but when the AMG car pulls
up alongside you at a light wave him on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
