episode of 359 podcast and it's a big
one it's 150 money Brian and I am here
with Roger Cheng Han Fox Rubin and
welcoming guests rich nieta hello good
morning everybody rich by the way who
comes from our San Francisco office and
is on his first cnet podcast ever north
podcast first pot yes ever ever yeah and
congratulations yeah hello 359 I'm happy
to be here well do the five people that
are watching I was gonna say heaven
thank you too generous oh we've got it
we've got a busy day as usual we're
gonna be talking about Google's intrepid
I guess it's alphabets treppe up drone
plan may hate that we have to keep
saying alphabet is with a clarify that
it's google's parent company that always
bothers me that's future words i don't
need that throwing every time a Google
Strohm plan we're gonna be talking about
Pokemon go trying to make a comeback it
makes ice for the 150th episode we're
talking about Pokemon go yeah cuz we
spent so much time many we should talk
about Samsung but we're not surprisingly
i'm the lastly we'll we'll talk about
apple music hitting another milestone
for subscribers so let's let's get into
it as usual you have any questions leave
them in the comments section brian will
pick out the best and we will answer
them or try try try ok let's get this
recording underway and here we go in
three two welcome to the 359 when we
talk about the top tech news of the day
and only the crap you want to throw in
I'm Roger Tsien I'm Ben Fox ribbon with
us we have special guests crack Google
and social reporter rich never hey
everybody how are you so rich you
actually wrote a story about Google's
drone efforts today why don't you tell
us more about its crazy plan sure so the
story is about Google or Google's parent
company alphabet thinking about opening
it opening up a delivery market place
called wing marketplace and they've
talked two partners apparently and some
of them our our whole dominos tom knows
dogs and whole foods so pizza via drone
everybody so the idea here is that they
don't have to go and build
drones do this whole infrastructure
Google's going to do it for them and
these companies are going to sort of
rent the service is that is how it works
they didn't even go through that much
detail okay save they've they've talked
to them apparently this is according to
The Wall Street Journal right i mean it
feels like a smart plan there's like so
all these companies they're not tech
companies right like dominos isn't gonna
be they're not gonna go invest in drone
technology so that's true why i use
google as sort of the framework when it
is important to mention though that
anytime I talk to analysts about drones
because I cover amazon so I do look at
their eyes runs yeah their eyes well at
least over the phone where they're like
there's there's so much regulation
around there yeah that really doesn't
seem very likely in the u.s. maybe it's
more possible in other areas well its
partner like this is uh this is part of
alphabets xunit right which is all about
moon shots all right crazy project yeah
and this is a crazy project for sure but
expecting something like this next year
I don't know what do you to note is that
Google is already testing out burrito
deliveries on Virginia Tech's campus so
it's like via drums yes yeah nice
delicious which chipotle hahaha
excellent all right next up are you
still playing pokemon go nope silence
well developer niantic is hoping to
reignite your interest and it's in
lusting a unlikely partner December
twelfth it'll actually release a number
of new pokemon mhm and that day the same
day sprint boost mobile stores and I
guess radioshack sprint stores will all
become pokey stops and Jim's thrilling
right oh my god i deleted oh c'mon go
did you really i still have an iphone i
I the problem is is that i really don't
like it when people are nearly walking
into me when they're walking down the
street yeah i'm looking at their phones
and i didn't want to be that guy anymore
I really liked where you then go yeah
when I was playing pokemon go on my way
to like Grand Central every day I'd be
you know swiping and catching pokemon
and all that other you know I make fun
of Pokemon go cuz it's kind of it has
fallen off the top charts but it is
still a top 10 grossing game or grossing
app and when I was out in LA last week I
actually ran into a bunch of
who are still playing yeah really i was
gonna ask like when's the last time you
see me I what have it my wife still
actually some plays she's it's not the
Phenom it used to she's representing
team valor well still uh well done yeah
what's up I don't know how she doesn't
know how she finds time alright lastly
Apple music hit another milestone by
surpassing 20 million subscribers that's
three million more than it reported in
September's a good amount of growth good
momentum definitely is further evidence
that you know streaming music in this
kind of all on demand model it's all the
way to go yeah waving I I think that
services like this are really going to
be what Apple's future is going to be
like as people keep holding on to their
phones and their tablets and their
desktops a lot longer so are you guys
either subscribe to music service I
don't I subscribe to Spotify okay yeah
so I mean I feel like a lot of people do
that's still but the number one
on-demand streaming service out there
it's more than open door actually
unveiled the details of Pendor premium
its service which is planning to launch
early next year for ten dollars a month
just like all the others lastly you
wanted sorry for more of these stories
check is on cnet Roger Cheng I'm Ben Fox
Rubin I'm rich neva thanks for listening
and we're back hey yeah right wonderful
dismount fur also done almost almost a
clean one yeah no cough I did no coughs
that was good yeah yeah yeahs to our
viewers a little bit of context rich was
he was had a bit of a coughing fit this
morning I was having a little worried he
was gonna back you through the pockets
but you got it mean if you're clean look
at that Bravo sir yeah mm-hmm for first
podcast shut up did a shout out to her
friend Michael representing Jamaica in
the chat today yeah which Michael this
is a Michael Forsythe oh hey man we have
two regular Michaels and yes I know
Michael Forsythe good man uh best best
question we've had in the chat in a long
time Oh what if a bird grabs your pizza
hmm oh yeah oh wow good question like a
big bird like a bird of prey like like
I'm actually a magic big bird by
watching it right
just whack that drug that's guy with a
baseball well like that's something that
that uh in the article mentions Google
grappling with which is like how to
logistically do it like this the drone
land does it like lower the pizza down
right when they're doing with the
Chipotle yeah I think that they are
doing like some sort of like lowering
grapples yeah or whatever how does look
out how do you by the way how does that
work on campus if you're if you're in
view your dorm can look can you open
your window and like not yet to go down
side frankly that you would be but I
like in your window I gotta go really
likes it like the dining hall ah what
about what about snipe drones Michael
wants to know if there are gonna be
thieves who will build drones
specifically to hijack your pizza who
hijackers are really really good sounds
like a really really bad new movie
concept they're gonna know cuz Michaels
Cowboys on the bushes trying around a
train will build another drone to
protect no refrigerant really like this
all drove escalation yes that's that's a
good point but then you know giant birds
will show up and then I'll Jack
everything this is just Purvis probably
isn't gonna work even though right I
kind of personally I even you got past a
huge amount of regulatory hurdles which
there still are yeah there are a lot of
logistical problems I still I i do like
personally love the idea of drones like
I think it would be really cool in the
future if we did do this I think it
would change a lot of people's lives
yeah and I think like just buying
anything online and then getting it
literally within half an hour sounds
like a fantastic idea so I think it's
really cool that Google and Amazon are
working on this but like I'm very again
personally skeptical i mean i could see
this i could see the sound like the
burbs or sort of like we're rural areas
yeah necessarily a big city right cuz
there would be really really difficult
to do it in like a major city but but
I'm suburbs I could totally see this
happening it's definitely one of those
like future tech concepts that is out
there that could seriously change
people's lives right well I think the
accessibility implications there yeah
they were Google first started out doing
this and their focus was disaster relief
oh yeah but they scaled back and sin has
just okay
now so they went for like a noble effort
to like pizza how dare you how dare you
have a snowball okay it says very noble
I'm just waiting for that really really
lame movie though where they had like a
high-speed drone chase instead of a car
chase oh that's the circle budget it's
coming out in a couple months oh my god
nevermind yeah the circle it's at dave
eggers movie Oh Dave Eggers book that
they're turning into a movie and toward
the end of it you can see this in the
trailer so I'm not giving anything away
I think about nice two runs chase drones
attack a truck so it's like drones
chasing a truck it's kind of close I'm
picturing something more like will
ferrell and i always forget the actor's
name but dr. Steve Brule and like a step
brother sequel oh yeah and they're just
chasing each other with the drugs I drew
like their control with the phone right
after each other yeah steripen posing I
could get you let me let me go on the
record saying i would definitely watch
yeah we're gonna fry part of that yeah
hey a little off topic but somewhat
related Robin the chant wants to know
what is the best grocery service online
or app oh oh there are antal um there's
one that I i have used amazon everything
fresh prime pantry myself I'm pantry is
another one but that it's limited so I
mean there's fresh direct with fresh the
rack there's peopie we tend to use yeah
you use fresh direct yeah good
experience so far pretty good I mean the
thing that it is fresh directly out for
all these incentives or every once in a
while Ike free shipping or whatever and
we just we don't we're not regular
customers we basically wait for like the
coupon to show up surely all right now's
the time to order and then we like we
stock up that might be the best way to
make a recommendation is like who's got
the best coupons right now but its
cycles citrus thing is it's a good
question online really hasn't disrupted
the grocery market quite yet known fresh
direct and pea pod have been around for
a while I did not do that um so we'll
see if something big changes there I
mean like our drones gonna help with
that but there aren't that many options
like prime fresh amazonfresh isn't it a
lot of markets and neither is google
expressing some soup yeah let's do it
too now right or they partner well
there's into the card is it yeah right
all right yeah yeah it's the carts
another one yeah they're not I don't
think there any of them are not
maybe instacart is but I don't think I
feel like ins card is quazy national
like you can find them in a lot of
places i don't know i don't use
instacart but that's another one so I've
only useful prime pantry when there's
something exclusive or we're down there
like Serge no cooler dunkaroos the kind
of stuff you can't find in lowes junk
aru's yeah wow I haven't thought about
those in years thank you well I thought
about surge in the ecto cooler cuz of
Brian thank you for that nostalgia bomb
yeah God dunkaroos alright switching
gears uh talking about music streaming
again um personal preference does
anybody here use google play no but I
know I know go reporter now Spotify user
as well so I I really i only download
stuff and learn like listen to them like
listen to this you don't even stream
music do you know i mean like i used to
be still visit if you know how Kate I do
not know be pretty cool not even my by
know that you're like really cool a nice
cool you bought album cassettes cool
cassettes have made an unfortunate come
back have they real really yeah yeah
it's a cool collector thing again I'm on
top of that space box and they suck
their hands down the absolute worst
recorded me tomorrow sir it's the first
time and recorded audio we took a big
step backwards in just a gala do
something hitch thing you know what I
get absolutely I use Amazon music all
the time cuz I yeah yeah yeah I do for
uh for kids music right oh my god
they're very good nice like the very
family or it's the only reason why i
don't use Spotify scuzz the I'm in the
fridge here so I get ads every whatever
half hour mm-hmm so they'd like you
don't want to play a bunch of kids music
on so it's like hey like clubs or
something subscribe Spotify whatever
like yeah well the thing or try Bobby
barman needs to be fire uh fine-tuned a
little bit yeah I think it's pot pies
that I've been on it for so long then I
hey okay all right I pay too yeah and
I've got it curated yeah how i like it
and it'll be hard i would you be
interested like heavy did you ever use
pandora mm-hmm so would you be
interested like Pandora's pitch when
they are launched next year is that this
is more personalized you live i guess
there's curated recommendations that's
something that would interest you or
your like
not really okay I know I know I know
yeah yeah they've got him they've got
him basically I mean like it would take
a long time for a pen door and actually
figure out what it is yeah eggs if it
was cheap rich rich I know it's not
fortunately the way these deals are
struck they're all ten all right ten
dollars or more which is why I think
it's interesting that Apple reached 20
million subscribers because they came in
it a little bit later like a couple yeah
well he got exclusives they do have
exclusive yeah boss I mean look they had
that built-in installed base for a long
time that's true the Spotify has
branched out to different avenues as
well they have video now they do
podcasts right they have their own
private sessions that they host that
they record in house kind of thing
excuses live tracks and that kind of
thing i use google play myself for my
own personal collection so that's where
I've clouded my music to keep forever
and ever because I've lost more than a
few hard drives in my time as well
recollecting bye yeah and I like Spotify
because that's where I venture around me
like oh this is new this is worth
subscription price to try something new
I'm not going to be out anything here
cool i mean if i really really like it i
go buy it I know absolutely forbidden
right it's crazy buying stuff is
forbidden and x minus baseline physical
music oh that is like I still do it do
it well whatever huh people still do
that I'm sure there's billions of
dollars or digital music sales I mean
knowing I exist I exist if nope if you
look at the market share like it turns
it is reassuring it's all right past
like more people pay for streaming
services on-demand streaming services
versus individual soundtracks yeah I
don't actually like music discovery so I
find yeah I did I lie to do I and then I
stick with them so it actually makes
sense for my life to keep buying single
songs but alright we're running out of
time but switching gears back to pizza
again they want to know how to maintain
the temperature of the piece and I got
imagine that the drone has a compartment
yeah just like you I almost had you up
in horn it's gotta remember it's got
that specially designed by scar we both
remember the oven that keeps the pizza
warm I can all I can only imagine like I
mean the integrated bag has been around
for decades is very easy to have a drone
with a built-in sort of insulated case
so more importantly more importantly
though how do they actually drop off the
p
there's a thing make a gentle landing on
your doorstep or does it air bomb it in
with like an inflatable power right so
that's what they're deciding it gotta be
a gentle landing right I would much
rather see like oh just be just fine the
sky everywhere than that it's all good
night like is everywhere following it is
this blouse bomb outside Nancy's here as
if coming straight from God that's the
dream that this that is pizza speaking
of the circle this is our friend Michael
Brown speaking of the circle why is
Hollywood obsessed with AI or Big
Brother attacking civilians uh I mean
good movie i make a good movie that's
see the terminator like that's an
awesome movie I didn't really make a
movie where like technology just solves
everything because that would be super
bored I mean there was like her right
and does it hurt I didn't watch that yet
Bobby I'm told there's great so let me
there are movies that explore if you're
gonna fight the system but the
electronic system right yeah I think
that that's a more compelling narrative
that's the thing is this the obligatory
part and the podcasts where you talk
about Wes world who good point yeah no
way yeah why not yeah blessed world West
world westworld was a good concept to
kind of maybe push that forward and say
AI isn't the problem no that's our and
that was the best part of the show that
it made you sympathetic to the host
right right humans are spoilers no
spoilers evens are terrible that's not
spoiler ok bearish or so yeah and I mean
that's that's way a show were flipped
the common narrative on it on its head
right where you are more sympathetic to
the AI the house as opposed to I think
it's Michael makes a good point though
that um you know kind of the the well
has been poisoned a long time ago by
Hollywood oh yeah about how AI and
robots are bad that was already
described to us like what was that 15-20
years ago probably even when I Hollywood
books and every every medium is right
exactly which is why I think it's funny
that now that we have robots the
manufacturers go out of their way to
make them all look cute and adorable so
that people aren't terrified by them so
that's that's why we have pepper and you
know i right Google's like Google
robot car looks like a smiley face at
the head right yeah it's two really a
lot of attention Google assistant is
like the least friend like name wise
branding losses yeah it's just so
generic that being said if I was
murdered by pepper that would be really
scary because it would just ice like a
girl in my face it would be so fun to
watch actually it would strangle me well
smiling the whole time alright well
that's probably a good place to leave
off helen is not a very beloved home
except that that perfectly caps off our
150th episode talking about the ends to
mine so by fiber rope or more
importantly keep your eyes to the sky
for forthcoming pizza bombs there you go
there you give you like a that you saw
her here tricks on cnet our podcast is
