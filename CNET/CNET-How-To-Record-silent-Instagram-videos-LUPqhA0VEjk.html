I've been playing with the new Instagram
in Instagram videos for about a week now
and I have to admit I kind of missed the
old Instagram you'll fly it Instagram
there's nothing against videos here I
just don't like all the audio and hiss
and unintentional dialogue that comes
with them so got to thinking how hard
would it be to record silent Instagram
videos and it turns out is harder than
you'd think there's no built-in mute
button in Instagram there's no way to
actually mute the hardware for your
iPhone or for an Android phone so how do
you do it well you could try covering up
the microphone with your finger or
plugging in a headset and covering up
the microphone on the headset but the
best-case scenario there you're gonna
get some muffled audio you're still
gonna get some audio worst case you're
gonna get some distortion from your
finger rubbing on the microphone then I
thought what if you got a pair of cheap
headphones with the microphone built-in
that kind of that have the special
three-banded mini jack on the end you
could just snip the cable and eliminate
the microphone right well it turns out
that worked at least it worked on my
Samsung Galaxy Note 2 when I plugged in
the headphone jack
it was enough to override the internal
microphone and just having that little
nub plugged in at the top allowed me to
record video silently unfortunately on
my iPhone the iPhone needs to be able to
detect a very specific electrical
resistance in the cable in order for it
to work properly and cutting the cable
in half defeats that so I gave up on
headphones and I tried another adapter I
had at my desk this thing is called iRig
it's a little adapter that allows you to
plug in your guitar or any kind of line
instrument cable into your iPhone and be
able to do recordings you can find these
or adapters like these for around 10 to
20 dollars and when you plug it in it
has the miraculous effect of overriding
your iPhones microphone leaving it mute
so long as you don't plug your guitar
into here now I know it's not pretty but
it's a workable solution you can take
around with you if you're serious about
this whole silent video thing
another cool thing about using this is
that you have an external input here
that you could run an audio source into
and record that into your Instagram
videos so if you wanted to have Guns and
Roses be the soundtrack of all of your
Instagram videos you could do that with
this adapter although I suspect the
lawsuit you get from Axl Rose might not
be worth the effort so there you go
that's how to make silent Instagram
videos the hard way now if you've got a
better tip for doing this let me know
over how-to cnet.com and if you're an
Instagram or Facebook employee
please make this video obsolete by
adding a microphone mute button to your
app I'm Donald Bell see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
