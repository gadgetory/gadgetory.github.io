producing man-made lava and
demonstrating lava flows in their own
backyard the research project is called
the lava project and was recently
featured in a video for National Public
Radio using a large bronze furnace they
melt up to 800 pounds of balsamic gravel
the same material that makes up most of
the Earth's crust buell the gravel is
cooked for days at a time until it
reaches a temperature of over a thousand
degrees and liquefies as a lava pours
out of the furnace is at a temperature
of about 1,000 35 degrees and takes
about a day or two to completely cool
down it is during this cooling stage
that Bob Misaki is able to create his
art pieces while the lava is still
malleable check out more about the
man-made lava in the krave blog post are
