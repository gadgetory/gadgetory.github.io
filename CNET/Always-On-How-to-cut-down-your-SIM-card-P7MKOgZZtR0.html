might have noticed that the SIM card is
shrinking a little it's helped some
Micro SIM format and a lot of
international phones and even things
like the iPad an iPhone use this format
it looks like a SIM card it actually has
the same chip as a regular SIM card but
it's just smaller so if you want to open
yourself up to a wider variety of phones
from overseas or you want to unlock your
iPhone and use the service provider like
t-mobile you'll have to get this Micro
SIM format but if you already have a
regular-sized SIM you can just cut it
down you can take it to a carrier store
and they'll do it for you or hello you
can do it yourself
so let's go ahead and do that you'll
need scissors double-sided tape a
template like this which you can find at
the link right here and your SIM card
that you want to cut down so to get
started we'll cut a tiny piece of
double-sided tape and we're going to use
this to stick the template to the larger
size SIM card
all right now we'll stick the template
right on top this is great it makes
things a lot easier all right I think
that looks pretty good now what we have
to do is cut it out we'll just follow
along these dotted lines you want a pair
of good sharp scissors boom okay okay
now we need to cut off that little
corner
there you go so let's peel off our
template all right
oh and I realize there's one more thing
you'll need a file now I'm at TechShop
so I'm using this super profile but if
you have a nail file at home just use
that you just want to soften up the
edges a little bit you can fix your
nails a little bit while you're at it I
think we're good to go now let's see if
it works
pop out the trades my iphone all right
line it up here we go
perfect it fits perfectly so let's go
ahead and put them the iPhones all right
it's in and I know it works because my
iPhone isn't telling me that there's no
sim card installed all right and if you
ever need to put your micro sim back in
a phone that requires a regular-sized
card you can just use one of these
adapters they cost a couple bucks online
okay if you have any tips send them to
me on twitter at sharon back or always
on at Cena comm okay Molly I know that
you went to t-mobile to get your sim
card cut but now you know next time you
can do it yourself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
