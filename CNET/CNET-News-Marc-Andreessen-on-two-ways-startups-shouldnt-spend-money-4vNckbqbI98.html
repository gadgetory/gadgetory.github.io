areas one has to do with tweet storms
everyone has to do with this app and
what's going on in SF today so let's
talk about San Francisco first and about
you and I have talked about this in the
past the culture around tech here in San
Francisco and how welcoming it is to the
tech community or not yeah so I mean
look I think it's primarily still a good
news story like I actually don't think
there's a huge backlash I think there's
a small backlash and I think it's a
backlash worth like acknowledging and
we're dealing with and I think it's
great you see people like Marc Benioff
you know really stepping up and you know
doing just like miraculous thanks for
the city I think there's a lot of ways
of detecting industry in the tech
community can give back and can help
kind of bolster the social
infrastructure at Bentley but i think
it's primarily good news story i think
there's a whole broad cross-section of
very thriving very happy tech companies
in san francisco i would go long
personally if i were in real estate i
would probably go along berkeley and
oakland and then i would also go along i
think the east bay i think well for sure
pleasanton but i would also go along
like hayward and Fremont I think the
valley is going to build out to the east
over the next 10 or 20 years in a really
dramatic way I think also over time that
will relieve some of the pressures in
San Francisco but your latest tweet
storm was about the fact that startups
need to be a little bit more cautious
about how they're spending their money
and I guess my question to you is since
you are an enabler of startups for one
of the enabler of startups what is the
takeaway we should be taking from that
that they're not listening to management
advice about how to be prudent and how
to grow successfully from their advisors
who I imagine our representatives of
your firm and others that are on there
or are you backing the wrong people who
don't have the experience what does it
take way yes sir time will tell what I
will tell you is the conversation that I
brought into the public is the same
conversation we've been having with
their companies in private and so it
literally its exact same thing if you
ask any of the CEOs we've been talking
to in our portfolio they'll all tell you
that's what we've been telling them for
the last at least the last several
months if not the last few years and it
really is Leah grew the book early a lot
it really is a discussion about risk and
discipline so the general theory of how
startups are supposed to spend money is
that as you spend money you reduce risk
and basically you spend a certain amount
of money you take a certain amount of
risk out and then you spend more money
you take a certain amount of risk
and what just happened is the amount of
money in the environment is just now so
big and by the way a big part is so much
money has not arrived from outside of
entry capital so so many hedge funds and
private equity firms and sovereign
wealth funds have shown up in the valley
with huge check books and writing giant
checks to a lot of these companies the
good news is many of these companies are
growing and doing very well we just feel
generally there's just an attitude that
has been developing that basically says
we can spend ahead of the reduction of
risk and not in every company right this
is a very you know situation is very
specific for every company but just in
general we feel that the discipline
about risk is mainly lost problem with
that I mean one is just the cash burn we
think is just too high at a fairly large
number of companies but part of that is
as the consequence companies are hiring
too many people too fast the problem
with that is it's not like you don't get
a high quality company out the other
side if you hire too many people too
fast right because you screw up the
culture like you hire too many people
you can't assimilate them and then by
the way at some point you'd have to do a
layoff and ran one of the things that
I'm completely convinced of is layoffs
are always the fault of the people who
did the hiring right it's like you
shouldn't done hiring then enough just
lay off and so the way to prevent
layoffs is to not over higher why do you
think you had to make that conversation
public if you are advising your
companies as an advisor that's kind of a
secret sauce message that you want to
share with your your group of companies
that you're taking successful that's
very nice as a PSA to the tech industry
but I'm just curious why you felt you
had to do that kind of a PSA and not
keep it within the what's an
industry-wide issue it's not anything
that's can find our companies during a
particular set of companies as an
integer right issue and it's sort of
it's a race right the like for example
an example be too fancy offices right so
if the expectation gets set that in
order to recruit you need to have the
world's fanciest office then every
company is going to need to raise money
to go build a fancy office if on the
other hand the expectation is no we're
not in this for the fancy offices are in
this to build you know real substance of
real technology and it you know go back
to the Amazon model it doesn't matter if
our desk is you know a used or on a
couple of sawhorses all right then the
burn rate across the entire industry is
going to naturally be lower and so
there's kind of ratchet there's a
ratcheting affect what happens I think
so I just felt like just talking to our
companies was not going to have the same
effect as taking the conversation where
broad so too much cucumber water that's
very dangerous way way too much cucumber
water yes hey all right well thank you
so much for your time really
