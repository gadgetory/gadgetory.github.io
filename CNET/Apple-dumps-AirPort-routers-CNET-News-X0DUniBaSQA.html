line of networking devices they have the
Express which is just a wireless n
router they have the extreme which is a
wireless AC router that supports Time
Machine backups and the time capsule
which is half router half storage device
if you want to backup your data all
three of them are currently being
discontinued man we don't really know
exactly why they are discontinuing it
but the writing's kind of been on the
wall for the last few years they haven't
updated the hardware in about five years
and earlier this year they started
selling the Linksys V lock mesh Wi-Fi
system in their stores and online which
is the first third-party router they've
ever sold also the new ax wireless
standards coming out next year so if
they really wanted to stay in the router
game they probably are gonna have to
develop new hardware anymore you don't
have to really worry because Apple said
they'll still continue to support it
with firmware updates for the next five
years you actually can buy another one
or you can buy one if you don't have one
already because Apple is selling off the
rest of your inventory right now however
I wouldn't really recommend it because
there's a lot of other better routers
out there right now especially with
newer hardware a lot more features for
about the same price if you want to
replace the Express or the extreme you
really can get any new wireless AC
router out there a lot of the newer ones
will have better features faster speeds
you even can check out our best wireless
router section which will show you which
ones worked best for us now the time
capsule that one was half router have
storage device so you're gonna have to
figure out how you want to backup your
data in the future you can either use a
regular external hard drive which you
can just plug into a Mac or you can get
a router that supports network storage
Seagate and Western Digital are two
pretty good options for this then if
you're a little more technically savvy
you can try an AZ device these have a
lot more features or a little more
complicated a little bit more expensive
Synology is a great brand to try they
have a lot of options for you and if you
really like the remote access feature
some of the regular solid-state drives
and hard drives will come with software
that allow you to do that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
