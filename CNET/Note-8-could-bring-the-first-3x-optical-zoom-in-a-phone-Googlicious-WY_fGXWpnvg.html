welcome to Google Isha's for all the
Google you can think of the no date will
be officially announced on August the
23rd but while we wait new details are
leaking out now the note 8 will bring
Samsung's first dual lens camera system
for their flagship phone line we haven't
heard much about it until new info was
just released by Samsung
electro-mechanics who is believed to be
the supplier from the note 8 and tool
lens camera now in a breakdown on the
website specifications for a dual lens
camera component show off its
capabilities like optimal image
stabilization and HDR support but what's
really interesting they also show off a
quality comparison between a 3x digital
zoom and a 3x optical zoom this is
likely the first smartphone to feature a
true 3x optical zoom we've only seen 2x
up to this point you know what that's
pretty sweet now another feature is
perspective shift and since an image is
taken from two slightly different angles
you'll be able to slightly change its
perspective by rotating your phone it
will also bring even better low-light
photography with a system Samsung calls
super night shot because you have to
call it something catchy 2 sensors are
better than one and will be able to pull
in more light in darker environments now
during the recent earnings report a
samsung executives said the note 8 will
feature more advanced and richer
multimedia functionalities this back
setup now none of these features have
been confirmed but August 23rd is just
around the corner cameras have become
one of the most important parts of the
smartphone and this all looks good for
note 8 fans now flip phones aren't dead
especially in Asia but would you go back
to one of them with the same features of
today's phones
well Samsung's SMG 92 98 has been leaked
out on slash leaks and check out this
sleek flip phone with a 4.2 inch display
a 12 megapixel camera and a fingerprint
scanner don't plan on seeing this in the
US any time soon but it's still pretty
cool to see a high-end flip phone that
has staying power alright a report from
gadget 360 says Samsung is working on
getting their Samsung pay platform to
non Samsung phones the big difference
compared to other services like Apple
pay or Android pay is that you can use
Samsung pay on both NFC payment machines
and
the older magnetic strip based ones it's
really been this way from the start
now according to the report Samsung is
in talks with other OEMs about making it
available on other high-end smartphones
which obviously points you in the
direction of LG Google HTC and other
Android manufacturers okay a recent
video by on leaks and my smart price is
now showing off the pixel 2 in both of
its sizes it's a follow up to the first
renders that we're put out by Android
police a few weeks ago now the video
makes them look about the same but the
pixel 2 is expected to come with a 4.99
inch display and the pixel XL 2 is
expected to bring a larger 5.9 9 inch
display we're still just a few months
away but this is something to keep your
appetite satisfied until then now in
other Android news bluetooth battery
indicators may finally be coming but it
won't likely happen in the initial
Android o release the current battery
status of your connected devices has
been a longtime Bluetooth standard but
Google hasn't taken advantage of that in
stock Android xda-developers has found
that it will be coming to a future
update but hopefully we see it in
Android 8.1 and we won't have to wait
for something like Android 9 for it and
the Google clock app yes it adds an
update for a darker theme there's a new
icon and support for the coming Android
oh the new dart theme is less harsh on
the eyes when waking up and version 5.1
is now rolling out to devices on the
Play Store alright that's it for this
week you can email me at Google issues
at CNN or tweet me at brian tom thanks
so much for watching we'll catch y'all
next time for some more of that Google
inches
you're delicious</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
