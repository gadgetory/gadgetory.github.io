to the US as part of the Elantra line
speaking of lines check them out I'm
reading a little bit of almost Nissan
Leaf kind of Archie Billo eNOS
to the wheel wells and the fender arches
gives it a very contemporary look maybe
a little bit polarizing in fact I
understand that some of these highly
stylized Hyundai's aren't selling so
well in Korea where they like things in
the home market to be a little more
conservative looking but that said I
think a lot of folks in the u.s. like a
little more style a little more salt on
your food basically now we're looking
here at a sedan with four doors but also
it's got a hatchback utility in the rear
and a lot of cargo space there with the
fold flat cargo area so it's not a
compromise as a cargo carrying car it's
really quite capacious for a vehicle of
its size a nice little touch here from
the luxury part of the world you've got
LED strips for the running lights not
for the headlights at this price class
we're seeing a lot of engines here that
we won't get in the US because we're the
European show but the one that I would
expect to see is a 1.6 liter gasoline
direct injection that's what I see
inside this one and shooting for that
magical 40 because nowadays 40 is the
new 30 when it comes to mpg also is
noticing interestingly enough in Europe
you know get nearly as good a warranty
on Hyundai products we get 10 years
100,000 mile here they're just getting
the old standard five years so be glad
you're in the US</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
