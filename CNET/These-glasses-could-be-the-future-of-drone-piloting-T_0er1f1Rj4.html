BTW 300 smart glasses let's take a look
so let's start by explaining a little
bit about how these work now hidden in
these panels on the side here are tiny
OLED displays you can see a disembodied
version of that tiny tiny screen just
here now the image from those panels is
bounced around the front to these
squarish looking areas here and what
that means is that you get a hovering
transparent screen in the center of your
field of view when you put them on
that's a little harder unfortunately to
show on video but I can say that when
you're wearing these things the image is
pretty impressive it's very sharp and
there's a pleasant transparency to the
image as well it feels very futuristic
this is minority report style tech so
there are bunch of different
applications you could have for this but
what I think is possibly the most
exciting is the idea of using it to
pilot your drone so if you have a drone
that has a camera you could pop these on
hook it up and then when you're flying
your robot around you'll be able to see
what it sees which makes it easier to
frame up those amazing shots it's going
to be out late 2016 now unlike some
other smart glasses once in the past
like Google glass I don't think these
are really intended to be worn around
with you every day it's more like you
would put them on when you're going to
do a specific task and like piloting a
drone on the front here that's a
5-megapixel front-facing camera inside
it's powered by an Intel Atom x5
processor and it's running Android
version 5.1 to control what you see on
screen you'll be using this remote so
they're not especially stylish I have to
say but every year these things get
slightly skinnier slightly slimmer
slightly better looking so yeah look I
think is positive for these augmented
reality glasses that's all for now check
