s4 the samsung galaxy s4 is slimmer yes
stronger last hole yet more to see it is
simply amazing we plan to roll out the
galaxy s4 with the 327 mobile operators
in 155 countries starting from the end
of april the galaxy s4 is only one
hundred and thirty six point six
millimeters long x 69.8 millimeters wide
and at a mere seven point nine
millimeters it's mind-blowing ly thin
and weighs only 130 grams and yet the
screen is now a full 5 inches in other
words there's less to hold and more to
see and this is full HD Super AMOLED
screen it's unbelievably sharp that's
441 PPI and we developed a new and
innovative molding technology that
creates this beautifully unreal
polycarbonate material into stunning
colors black mist and white frost the
finish and craftsmanship really are
something to see in fetal and this
kryptonite case polycarbonate still cool
and it's only it's a totally new and
upgraded user experience that you get
from this interface you can see how
great it looks here I mean it's got such
an incredibly slim and finely crafted
look and see how thin it is there and
check out what happens when you hover
your finger over the lock screen this is
all part of the new user experience
upgrade and a new visual effects engine
it's so much more alive than ever before
and when you land that this beautifully
laid out home screen the pure black bar
at the top is gone
and it's been replaced with a graceful
translucent effect the point is to more
subtly blend all that key indicator
information like battery level and
signal strength with the rest of the
information on the home screen nice I
love the layout the photo gallery it's
got a real hip magazine look and feel to
it yeah we've really spent a lot of time
perfecting this look and feel but let's
not forget what's under the hood
starting with connectivity and the fact
that this is set to go out as a 4G LTE
device to be clear that's category 3 100
MPs downlink and 50 mbps up link up to
hexa band I'm probably the only one in
the room who doesn't know what that
means so what that means is the galaxy
s4 will support downloads at 100
megabits per second and uploads at 50
megabits per second go ahead as mr. shin
mentioned before will launch this phone
with TD and FTD dual-mode LD LTE a
little bit later this year and it
supports Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac and also
Bluetooth 4.1 right we've also got
an infrared LED so our remote control
function so users can control their TVs
with the galaxy s4 and enjoy Samsung
watch on which gives you access to TV
programming as well as aggregated video
on demand services while we're here
let's talk about the cameras yes the
main camera on the back 13 megapixel and
the front facing is too so all of your
shop shots will be sharp colorful and
true to life and we've got some great
features on the camera that we're gonna
get into in a moment as for memory and
storage the galaxy s4 will ship with two
gigs of LP ddr3 RAM it's got 16 gigs
gigabytes of storage built in with
options for 32 and 64 and of course a
microSD slot that will give you space
for up to 64 gigs more and then of
course there's an array of sensors 8
sensors in total including standard ones
like those you see behind me plus two
new ones infrared gesture and
temperature and humidity it's a lot of
sensors we wanted to give users a device
that will really understand what's going
on around them and give them useful
information that can enrich and fulfill
their lives but now all that gadgetry
has got to use up a lot of power we're
constantly upgrading the operating
system to find efficiencies but the main
thing we did to make sure that you can
make it through your day is build the
galaxy s4 around a 2600 milliamp hour
battery and it's removable so there's no
shortage of power</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
