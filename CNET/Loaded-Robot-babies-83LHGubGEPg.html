during government uprisings Secretary of
State Hillary Clinton will detail the
new policy later today it said to
address things like circumvention
services with help to get around
national firewalls and training for

their email from surveillance and not a
minute too soon given what is happening
in Iran HTC unveiled five new phones and
its first tablet two of the phones are
what they are calling social networking
phones so their phones with an emphasis
on Facebook and Twitter they are the
chacha and the salsa the other three new
phones are new versions of the desire
wildfire and incredible the tablet is
called the HTC Flyer it's a 7-inch
tablet with a stylus running Gingerbread
not honeycomb which is Google's
tablet-optimized operating system all of
these phones also run Google's Android
operating system Facebook has partnered
with Gemalto to launch a SIM card type
program that lets you perform Facebook
functions without a dataplan Facebook

that you can approve friend requests or

FAA may someday lift the ban on cell
phone use while flying new legislation

Transportation Committee that removes a
provision that bans mobile phones and
voice over IP calls while in the air the
Senate has not seemed eager to pass this
law they think that the airline's

want to hear your cell phone
conversation while on a long flight
please keep to the texting and the
instant messaging the Internet

government may seek to block this domain
from being awarded the Bush
administration did not allow xxx to be
awarded and the Obama administration may
not allow gay either Arab countries have
also said that they would not let this
domain through cnet has a very
interesting interview with sites about
this application you can find that at
news cnet com researchers in japan are
making a japanese baby robot the robot
is called affetto it can make baby like
expression so that scientists can study
how adults interact with babies because
you can't experiment on real babies I
guess and previous prototypes were not
cute enough these things are pretty cute
but I don't think I would make the same
silly faces to them that I do to my own
baby or at least I don't think I would
