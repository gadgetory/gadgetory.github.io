got a really short haircut and here's
what's happening this week on scene at
scrape wha this week we have the
opportunity to try out a new kind of
restaurant in San Francisco called Itza
which just opened this week a few blocks
from cnet Studios the restaurant
ordering process is completely automated
and your food is presented to you in a
small cubby that has a see-through LCD
screen that displays your name alerting
you that your food is ready it's a
pretty unusual way to get lunch so
here's a quick walkthrough of how the
restaurant works alright guys so I'm
going to go and order something and see
how this whole process works so first
thing going to do swipe your card slowly
to get started and will swipe my credit
card so here's all our menu options and
I know that I've been looking at the
menu already so i know that i want the
burrito bowl so i'm going to go ahead
and order the burrito bowl and i think
i'm making a drink why not why not gonna
drink let's see let's get a smart water
add to bag
push check out here's my total 1003
continue confirm my payment I'm going to
even have an email me a receipt email
hotmail.com and finish so now I guess we
just wait and see my name pop up on the
screen there it is steven BTW all right
let's go stand over here and wait so my
order is up and number six where's
number six here it is tap it twice
alright
mmm that looks good actually all right
let's go try it lets going to try this
out alright guys so that is the dining
experience on pizza I'm going to open
this up and try it out so thanks for
watching crave
oh you was the very tech savvy and very
easy to order actually and it was it
look really fresh and yummy I think it
was awesome to impress a high technology
yeah I loved it put innovator I can't
wait that hopefully the future we like
this no I'm not sure pretty excited
about that Stephen Colbert and the
popular traffic app waze have partnered
up to help you get from point A to point
B in a fun and comical way that was a
big one you have reached your
destination I'm surprised to be honest I
wasn't paying attention that makes two
of us on September first users of the
free community based traffic app have
the option to select Stephen Colbert's
voice to direct them on their journey
along with the occasional comedy and
cute comments you would expect from the
late show host I love ways I use it
wherever I go post office tattoo parlor
Bank tattoo parlor liquor store tattoo
removal clinic heavy traffic reported
ahead traffic my least favorite kind of
jam the promotion runs through September
22nd and then Colbert's voice will be
gone youtube user gas turbine 101 has
built a massive flying by so it looks
like it's powered by hundreds of quad
copters the flying contraption is called
the swarm named after the 54 propellers
that propel the man I'm going to assume
is from the UK based on the sticker on
his aircraft and his accent forgive me
if I'm incorrect according to the video
description the craft has 54
counter-rotation propellers sixth group
control channels with hobbyking
stabilization and can lived 160 4
kilograms and can fly for about 10
minutes
a few months ago gas turbine 101 posted
a video of an unmanned test flight from
a distance but now he's actually inside
the aircraft which looks terrifying
don't try this at home alright guys that
is the show thank you very much for
watching as always you can find all
these news stories to see that's crane
blog I craved on cnet com make sure you

trackers for finding lost items do you

understand award shows
this arena tomorrow it's gonna be a
completely different set up some concert

explain that crosses my mind love it

that night the stage is gone
