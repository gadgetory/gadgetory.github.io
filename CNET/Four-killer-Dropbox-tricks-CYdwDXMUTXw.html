cnet.com Dropbox is one of the great
cloud storage tools like sugarsync or
SkyDrive that lets you sync files with
any computer when you put a file into
your Dropbox you can access it on any
other computer or mobile phone lots of
people use it for project management as
a virtual thumb drive or as a way to
share files with friends but today I
have four new ways to use Dropbox on my
Facebook page I asked you guys to give
me your best tips and I'm including a
couple of those two to get Dropbox go to
Dropbox comm sign up for an account and
download the desktop client you'll
automatically get two gigs of storage
free and you'll start using it right
away to upload files to your Dropbox you
can upload it through the web client or
drag it into the Dropbox folder on your
desktop but a very clever way to get
things in your folder is by emailing it
go to send to Dropbox comm where you'll
get a special email address you can use
to email attachments to your Dropbox so
if my friend sends me an email with his
new mix and I can't save it on my iPhone
because it doesn't do that I can just
forward it to my unique Dropbox email
address and it will automatically get
uploaded to my Dropbox folder another
company got creative and built a tool
that lets you upload target links to
your Dropbox for instance if a
restaurant has a PDF of nutritional
facts on their website you can copy the
link paste it into URL droplet comm and
it'll be uploaded to your Dropbox so
it's nice you can find a link and upload
it that way or email attachments and
your files will be waiting for you on
another computer or phone whenever
you're ready you can automate things
even more with this awesome trick no
matter where you are you can use Dropbox
to remotely start downloading torrents
to show you I'll use utorrent but the
steps are similar for other BitTorrent
clients too so what you have to do on a
Mac is open utorrent and go to
preferences then head over to downloads
and check automatically open torrent
files found in and browse to select your
Dropbox folder on windows go to
preferences then
directory's check the box next to
automatically load torrents from and
select your Dropbox folder since torrent
files can be big set them to download
somewhere else on your hard drive just
remember that if you use this trick your
home computer needs to stay on and
running utorrent but now you can start
torrents no matter where you are
for whatever legal purposes you like of
course like I mentioned lots of people
use Dropbox as a virtual USB Drive and
since you really can't forget to take it
with you it's a convenient solution for
accessing your documents but Lifehacker
points out that since it's not the
default documents folder you might
forget to change the target folder to
your Dropbox when you're saving
documents so why not make Dropbox your
default Documents folder on Windows 7 or
Vista right-click your Documents folder
select properties and then on the
location tab you can specify the new
file path click move and then select
your Dropbox folder on a Mac open up
terminal and type CD Dropbox then type
this command which will create a
Documents folder in your Dropbox that
automatically syncs with your desktop
and other computers and on my Facebook
page Jason Wong reminded me that Dropbox
will save all versions of your Docs for
30 days just go to the Dropbox web
interface hover over a file and click
the arrow to view previous versions of
it and finally Xavier left a message on
my page explaining that you can use
Dropbox as your own Photo Stream with
the Android and iPhone apps you can
upload photos from your phone directly
to your Dropbox or take photos within
the application and view them anywhere
and you can even make a public photos
folder to share with friends and family
by now though you might be wondering if
two gigabytes is enough for all these
tricks two gigs is good for most but if
you need more storage don't forget that
Dropbox gives you two hundred and fifty
megabytes for every friend you refer but
don't start making fake email addresses
and inviting yourself Dropbox is a
little smarter than that if you have any
more tips let me know on my Facebook
page and visit how to see Netcom for
more how to's first seen it I'm Sharon
Vaknin and I'll see you on the interwebs
