there on the market but very few of them
have a hand crank on the back hi I'm
Sarah Mitchell from Cena and this is a
first look at the eaton boost turbine
4000 this is a portable charger with a
4000 milliampere hour battery that size
battery can charge nearly any modern
cell phone and most small tablets eaton
calls the boost turbine pocket size but
it's too bulky to fit in most pockets
you're better off toting it around in a
purse or a laptop bag the device itself
has a brushed aluminum finish on one end
there is a standard USB and micro USB
port plus a power button and LED
indicator lights to charge a cell phone
or tablet you plug the included cable
into the USB port if you need to charge
the boost turbine you can plug the cable
into the micro USB and connect the other
end to your computer or a wall outlet
adapter which is not included if you
press the power button once it will turn
the battery on and begin charging
whatever gadget is plugged in press and
hold the power button and the LED lights
will flash showing you how much battery
is left in the boost turbine my biggest
gripe about the device is that because
the power button is recessed below the
surface of the outer case it's really
hard to press the boost turbines most
noticeable feature is its hand crank you
need to rotate the crank about one or
two revolutions per second to generate
enough energy to charge the battery
eaton says that one minute of cranking
will give you four minutes of talk time
given that the boost turbine 4000 is
heavy and clunky it's not the most
portable gadget charger on the market
still with enough power to charge many
smart phones and a hand crank to top off
the battery the boost turbine is a handy
gadget to keep around for when your
phone dies and the power goes out you

look at the eaton boost turbine 4000
