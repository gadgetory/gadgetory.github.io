and blackberry fans listen up feast your
eyes on BlackBerry's latest creation
that's right we're now taking a first
look at the long-anticipated blackberry
q10 so what's so special about the
blackberry q10 well if you love
BlackBerry devices and I know there are
many of you out there who do this gadget
promises to meld all the comfort and
speed of a superb fiscal keyboard with
the new blackberry 10 operating system
the q10 uses a shape reminiscent of
previous blackberry bold and other
curved models it's flat has rounded
edges that are comfortable to cradle
even one-handed and sports that iconic
QWERTY keyboard plenty of people can't
live without in fact the cute ends
keyboard has been pumped up and expanded
up to thirty percent larger than earlier
blackberry keyboards that's possible
says blackberry since the layout isn't
curved but rather straight there are
four rows of keys separated by handsome
steel frets to above the keyboard is the
cute ends 3.1 inch OLED touchscreen
which features a resolution of 720 x 720
pixels it lacks the Christmas brightness
and impact of today's super phones with
much larger screens still blacks are
deep and viewing angles are wide above
the display is the large notification
light a blackberry staple along with a
2-megapixel front-facing camera on the
left edge is a micro USB port plus a
micro-hdmi port on the right is a thin
volume rocker and play pause key up top
is a power button and 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack the phone's back side
houses an 8 megapixel main camera and
LED flash also placed here is the
removable back cover that hides a
removable battery microSD card slot and
SIM card slot I definitely like the
covers rubbery soft touch coding in
addition to the q10 sturdy black
aluminum ring that encircles the device
a dual-core 1.5 gigahertz processor
supported by two gigabytes of ram drive
the cute ends blackberry 10.1 operating
system with it come blackberry 10
features such as the blackberry hub to
see all your messages in one place and
we plow through them faster multitasking
and special keyboard shortcuts called
instant action you can say type tweet
and the phone will smartly begin gearing
up to send an update via Twitter the
same works for emails to the phone's
camera is the most advanced to grace a
blackberry device yet with an eight
megapixel sensor the camera app now has
an HDR mode something the z10 lacked at
launch there's a Time Shift Feature as
well which takes multiple shots at once
and lets you choose the best image I'm
