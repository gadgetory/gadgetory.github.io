her money as rumors heat up about an
apple echo competitor coming this summer
a report by kti security analyst Ming
sequel published in MacRumors states
there's more than a 50% chance that
Apple will announce its first home AI
product at its Developers Conference in
June and start selling by the second
half of the year Apple Siri speaker
would be marketed as a higher-end
version of the echo with a subwoofer and
better sound system which also means
higher price tag more than the $179
you'd pay for an echo long time Apple
leaker Sonny Dixon also tweeted about
the series speaker last week saying it
would run a variant of iOS and carry
some sort of beats technology and
earlier rumors had pointed at a
potential camera on this device that
would be able to identify individual
users to adjust the room to their
preferences and adjust lighting and
music but even with all these extra
bells and whistles there's no hiding
that Apple is arriving late to the home
assistant game and would be playing
catch-up to Alexa and Google assistant
who have already carved their way onto
people's countertops</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
