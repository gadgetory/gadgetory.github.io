camera how about at how about at it's
the apple byte extra crunchy podcast
with your host mr. Bryant song there he
is you're really going off on that
season like really going on what up
everybody welcome to the show it is
episode 69 today Steven's a single 39
that's not a coincidence that's the
number of the show that is the number
the show welcome to extra crunchy this
is our show that kind of expands on the
video podcasts and updates you with the
latest stories what's going on the world
of Apple and we talk to you guys and
gals last week about how we wanted to
kind of touch base and really make this
show about the future of Apple because
let's be honest beach it's kind of like
the dog days of tech right now nothing's
really going on yeah there's you know
there's there's a lot of things going on
in the car space right now but nothing
else really I mean if there's this law
right if people yeah okay only apples
maybe potential March ish April then
we'll talk about if they even have one
like that but what we want to do with
this episode and we asked all of you to
call how many called how many calls did
we freaking get this time we have like
40 probably like in that boards of 50
calls or so a lot of multiple review
calls too which is nice thanks guys for
redoing your calls you know you still
just because people make the calls
didn't mean you so you think yeah yeah
yeah yeah so anyways we want you all to
keep on calling us at one eight hundred
61 62 63 eight that is our number for
you to leave your name where you're from
and really get your point we we're going
to include a bunch of the calls for the
show about the future of Apple but we
want to do first is at least just update
you really quickly with a few stories
and then we'll jump right into the calls
so just about what's going on in the
Opera world right now again nothing
major but they released the latest iOS
10.3 beta and the thing that people are
kind of talking about right now is the
fact that they brought find my ear pods
finally nice into this beta now we did a
video about it I got to play with it a
lot it's not going to be as how about
this it's not going to be as useful as
find my iphone
would find my iphone you have a cellular
connection you're always connected it
has a good proximity where you are you
also have the GPS chip that can kind of
at least be a little more specifically
where you're located with your air pods
you only have a bluetooth connection and
that Bluetooth connection has to be
active for you to know where your ear
pods are if you close the case you say
you have your headphones out and you put
them in the case and close the case that
severs that Bluetooth connection and so
it'll only show you the last time it
made contact so like if you drop your
dental floss if someone picks it up is
gone right so it's not gonna have a real
time tracker on there but I do think
it's better than nothing it does send a
little beep sound the beep sound gets
louder and louder as time goes on to the
air pods when they're out freely but
here's the thing ride beach the whole
point of people don't want to lose their
pods they can't just like stick them
right back into their little dental
floss like why would you just throw them
around somewhere yeah I mean that seems
like the the most obvious carrying case
for them right but i think i think
that's cool now I mean I had that
concern what am I gonna do if I lose my
air pods now there's some way we can
find them so I figured I better good job
Apple yeah I mean some people are like
complain oh it's not as good as the
phone but I just think it's better than
not even having anything so I'll give
them kudos on that I guess you know
we'll give them a little bit of a good
Apple a good Apple on that one also I'm
in other operating system use Mac OS 10
point well point for their getting night
shift mode we've seen this on the iPad
we've seen this on the iphone as far
back as a like iOS 9.3 the Mac itself
will be getting its own night shift mode
then that turns kind of a blue glow
light tint that were used to seeing in
our screens during the day it turns it
down so I kind of that yellow warm
yellow warmer he would you use the night
shift mode on your phones or do you know
for sure fully all the time all the time
that's awesome to have in a laptop
because you know everyone a lot of
people do work in their bed so that's
not a that's a good idea I have a rule
Beecham no technology in the bedroom you
know technology yeah that's a good rule
to have but it is yeah for sure they get
they get in the way so a night shift
mode is coming again these are
all in developer betas are non-public
baited yet so you won't be able to get
access to them but they will be coming
soon and then before we get to the
future of apple and kind of start
talking and riffing on that I just want
to let people know that as of today
seven years ago Steve Jobs introduced
the very first iPad oh wow very other
years does this seem like it was that
long yeah that seems like a long time
actually that's crazy seven years wow so
I put a video clip in there that I was
actually lucky enough to be in that room
that first time and I I do want to talk
a little bit about it because when the
ipad first came out it was one of the
first products that i can remember
looking to get i don't know i'm like a
lot mi late yeah it does look a little
Eon my hair is all over the place on
that one it looks like I'm dragon ball z
the ipad looks huge man maybe i'm just
small first one to maybe hundred
actually no you haven't changed a whole
lot your hair your hair is more that was
just chemo back then i was like that was
like while to evil so uh what I what I
wanted to bring back though is that
people's first impressions with the ipad
were actually really mixed like outside
of that room for me i was like oh damn
this is awesome like I want this ASAP
but everyone that watched the keynote
outside thought it was stupid really
that's interesting well probably cuz
they just didn't get it yet you know
exactly and it was one of the few
products where the sentiment was and
again it was the first apple tablet
we've seen other tablets before but you
know tablets kinda had a low at that
time before Apple put out their iPad you
have to remember netbooks are really hot
right the super cheap laptop yeah yeah
so apples like we're gonna do the tablet
our way we knew Microsoft baton habits I
don't believe they had a surface at that
point but at least they had tried other
tablets in the past and people were like
why do I need an apple ipad and then
people went to the store and once they
got their hands on it they were like I
need a frickin apple ipad yeah and then
the ipad although it is you know de clot
the tablet sales are declining it is one
my favorite apple products of all time
just because of how I'm very mobile and
how I consume a lot of you know I read
comic books all the time I'm on the go
watching movie is my favorites yes you
know why sex most sick a second favorite
apple product honestly you know why I
think the you know sales have been
declining because they made it so good
and it's like it doesn't break I saw my
three my third generation and it's fine
you know it's runs perfectly nothing's
wrong with it like I don't have a reason
to upgrade so that's my theory on why
the sales have been declining you know
it's true and also I think people there
that was that was the heyday of Apple
where people are literally buying
anything Apple made right yeah yeah
there was that point in time there's
probably like a good let's see I mean
people might be laughing like people are
still doing that yeah sure they are but
I think there was like a good five to
seven-year chunk of time where at least
in my brain I was going to buy anything
with an apple made I know I would see
friends who'd be like when's anything
coming out I gotta get it I have to get
it have to get it you know that was even
like on people on television like
comedians and stuff they were there
having the same kind of vibe you know
anything Apple would make their like I
need it I need it but that's kind of
that's kind of you know fizzle down a
little bit it hasn't my voice just
cracked but I'm analyzed that didn't
happen so I just wanted to kind of give
a shot out 27 years ago the ipad was a
first revealed to us and i love that
thing you know I talk about it so much
people are just like you'd type there in
most people's minds like iPads a lame
product I'm like dude is my favorite
product I like the movies that were on
the iPad that you were just showing
right here there's like up and it just
kind of data you know there's up and
Star Trek oh and the Michael Jackson
like right when you passed away oh man
that's that's funny so you know that's
that's kind of what's going on the upper
world really not nothing major nothing
bigger shaken or anything like that but
this show we wanted to really be about
the future of Apple and we felt like
letting you the caller's kind of drive
the show a little bit like even said we
got 50 or soaks yells yes and I know we
kind of try to keep it around 30-45
seconds and when you ask people to talk
about the future
they're probably going to talk longer
than 30 or 45 seconds but you know we
just want to appreciate all your that
call but let's just kind of start
jumping into it and it'll give us a
launchpad to talk about some of these
topics all right cool Jory played the
first one here yeah let's go for it
first one is from Francis and I don't
know if you're gonna be able to hear
this Brian because of the skype setup
but we'll see okay just I first wanted
from Francis and he is talking about the
future of Apple he's from LA here we go
hi guys this is francis from Los Angeles
I love the show I just want to talk
about the future of Apple they're pretty
behind in driverless cars do you think
they should make a good to buy Tesla and
they're behind in virtual reality and
looks reality as far as I know should
they make a bid to buy the start of
magic leap and also the iphone of
currently accounts for around sixty-five
percent of apples of revenue do you
think apple will ever have the level of
success have enjoyed another job Sarah
in terms of having other it's like any
finish thanks guys like yeah he's done
he's talking about a job Dara he just
finished right when you asked that
actually look like a job in Russian
hahaha so you know what I heard that I
heard the call first but then um just
you know what Li you just tell me one
ends cuz i did get to hear all of them
okay yeah yeah so yeah so no friends
thanks for calling yeah it's a little
tricky because i'm on skype today but
what a look when you talk about apples
plans for Tesla you have to remember
that recently Apple was trying to
actually do their own thing with smart
cars with autonomous vehicles and then
they pretty much completely bailed out
of it they stopped it a bloomberg report
so they pretty much scaled back their
efforts they were you know some of the
staff was getting reshaped and
reassigned people were leading the
division and apples now trying to come
up with maybe some sort of a system but
they're not doing their own car and the
thing about it is I don't look Tesla is
owned by elon musk he's not looking to
sell it to apple no cousins Tesla is
growing again they're not the most
profitable company but when you talk
about companies that remind you of what
Apple used to be like in different
spaces
tesla is one of those companies
definitely you see their solar panels
for roof roof yeah yeah I mean they got
their hand in a lot of different things
now definitely not phones and stuff like
that you know but they got cars they
have solar powered roof tiles space X so
they're definitely moving and shaking
big time they're they're doing all types
of amazing things it's not a necessarily
consumer product that costs under five
hundred dollars but that doesn't matter
you know Francis mentioned magic leap
this is the augmented reality headset
that is pretty much a live frog cat
masseuse own like is the most you know
it it's one of the most advanced I mean
I'm going to put them the thing is that
magically just so developmental that
microsoft hololens at least looks like
it could hit the market before you know
hit the mainstream market before magic
leap does but again magical leaf is
doing some mind-boggling stuff I think
what you see with Apple is they've
already committed to augmented reality
I'd I highly doubt they they get their
hands and magically I feel like someone
already kind of had investors have
already put money into matically been
Apple wouldn't be a part of that I just
feel like that I I could be wrong so
maybe someone can call in and let us
know but you know Apple is doing their
own augmented reality there's rumors
that they're going to release their own
augmented reality glasses by sometime
this year yeah we were showing a video
of that actually a couple months ago and
it looked really cool it did look cool
like if they just came in to design the
glasses properly the melt them know I
probably have a winning product you know
yeah it's hard accusing yeah exactly but
I still think it's hard to do glasses
because not everyone wears glasses true
true yeah yeah yeah it be sometimes
people have to get used to definitely
like no one's going much like the
SmartWatch industry people that don't
like wearing watches didn't all of a
sudden start wearing watches because I
know right so if you're not something
that's even now we're time out on your
face I think that someone that doesn't
wear glasses isn't gonna I'm not going
to start wearing glasses to look trendy
just because Apple made glasses you know
yeah are you going to start wearing
glasses just so you can check your email
and like get maps and stuff like that
too right I don't think so I mean unless
you're already wearing glasses and there
you let you know if the style factor is
good they're light they're not too
difficult to use
I could see people doing it you know
yeah and then on the other point Francis
that you mentioned will they ever have
the level of success from the job Sarah
I think people this is what's really
interesting about perception versus
reality because earlier in january of
the of 2016 apple had their most
profitable quarter ever in the history
of the entire company okay so that shows
that from a financial standpoint they
were the most successful that they had
ever been even during the entire time
jobs with that Apple they never had a
quarter of that profitable or that
successful monetarily right so when we
talk about that you know we know that
Apple decided to say okay we're going to
make to two different phone sizes we're
going to you know may make a lower end
super lower-cost phone and have like
three or four different phones and then
they start doing different things like
they decided to target the market
differently there's a lot of demand for
the Apple iPhone and a huge obviously a
huge audience that wants it but when you
talk about the level of success of the
jobs there I think you're more leaning
towards that idea or that feeling that
this is the most innovative company
doing the best stuff and right now I'm
not going to I can't outright say that
that is them back then they used to be
they hands down that's all everyone
thought about that's all anyone
perceived Apple but you know beach
you've seen enough of it it's a
different beast now we talk about it all
the time and now people are starting to
kind of get through people's heads that
we're not hating on Apple we're just
trying to tell you like look it's not
what you think it is yeah I mean there's
just you know we're seeing the same
thing repackaged over and over again it
seems right now there's not a lot of
forward movement in phones like you know
the technology is kind of almost
stagnant right now in phones you know
like what else they're going to do
besides put in some sort of you know i
don't know like star wars ii hologram
thing or so you know they have to have
you some new wand that's what you yeah
they have to do something really big to
wow us but i mean in in other industries
like you know we're talking about SpaceX
and Elon Musk's company Tesla his
company you could argue it's the closest
to what Apple at what used to be
whereas they're building new things that
are very you know high-end looking
they're also liked the design is like a
big element in Tesla and SpaceX and
stuff like that they're trying to make
everything look sleek and sexy so they
kind of have the same vibe going but um
but yeah I mean I feel like what else
can you do with the phone you know we
have to figure out something else cool
that we could do with it so yeah and all
these new product categories that people
are excited about virtual reality
augmented reality smart cars the virtual
home assistant Apple is trailing in all
these key areas right now as I speak so
I don't know if you know if you want to
talk about money fine they have the most
big out much ever they got they are
spending on like two hundred billion
dollars they needed to do something with
that so you know magic if they bought
magic leap that'd be a huge thing
because I hear magic we're just watching
chat rooms we're at we ask people what's
much magic leap doing what are they up
to you because that seemed like when
when they launched their product or
their demos or whatever they put online
that seem to get a lot more you know
interest in a lot of other augmented
reality things that I've seen other than
like Pokemon go or something yeah but
yeah magic leap seems pretty cool the
big hurdle for everybody including
virtual reality is like how are we going
to get everyone to wear this crap on
their heads like virtual reality seems
like last year was like everything's
virtual reality and at CES this year
virtual reality was still there but it
seems more like for an experiential
thing that's not people aren't going to
be using it all the time yeah you know
they're still trying to figure that out
right yeah yeah they still I think the
other thing though that worries me about
magic leap the most is everything that
people are excited about and that you
talk about we still only seen demo
videos on YouTube well yeah exactly you
know it's I darim it was either
Bloomberg or wire that did it behind the
scenes profile of the company and they
toured their facility and they still
wouldn't really show much and again I
know that their tech is awesome but it
feels like one of those things that when
are we gonna actually see something so
that's why when I earlier said hollow
lens feels like a product that's going
to come out that's more polished and
ready to roll although the tech and
magically does like mind-blowing we got
electrical
seen a few demo videos like I'm looking
at the magic of lean public demo we
haven't seen a public demonstration that
a wide audience has been able to try on
yeah yeah like right now I'm showing the
magically website and all the stuff and
it looks really cool you know but we
haven't seen any hardware or anything
that's going to make this possible you
know and that's that's the big thing you
know like what is it going to look like
is it going to be heavy on your head you
know that's not just big thing people
worry about and if the magic leap team
is laughing us at right now and saying
oh wait wait wait a second bro
definitely release something next week
then fine I'll take it all back yeah
yeah I'll take over we just haven't seen
anything but we have seen cool
technology like this where there's a
robot he's under a table and the tables
actually goes in front of the robot yeah
I know like they're doing cool stuff
like that using actual spatial things in
your space that are part of the
augmented reality so I'm really
interested to see how that goes you know
I mean I've been able to try on the
hollow lens then go to the psych process
of if you're a developer howdy and all
the depth sensors the hololens can see
the same things that for the most parts
that magically does again we don't know
enough about magically to know exactly
what it does but hollow lens I can
create a world I can drop a paper ball
on my table it sees it and the ball will
roll off on it as if it's a real table
that's awesome so a virtual ball so
again we'll go well we're going to get
back on track but we're just going to
have to wait and see what Apple has to
offer look the apples most innovative
product this year to me was the w1 chip
inside of the air pods like and that was
I want to sing this song with uh yeah
don't tell I got something cooking about
you guys but that would some apples most
innovative product this year everybody
to w1 chip in the air pods in the w1
chip is amazing but again there's other
barriers of entry to why people can use
their pods how they look if they're
really worth paying that much the
functionality and I do think they're a
good product I've used them so much now
but I'm like you know what this is a
good product but it's not a great Apple
polished product it's like they have the
w1 ship but they didn't really have
anything else so you know when I see
other people wearing airpot
I get jealous actually get jealous like
I want them i do want them but i cannot
i don't want to pay for of the too
expensive what you know man like they're
just you're too expensive that's the
bottom line but when I see people have
them I'm like I i wish i had that but i
just i know i'm not gonna pay for right
now no so it has been growing on me big
time man not last couple mom has gone on
I like them a whole lot more I just I
still don't like how they look but the
titans of w1 tip anyone that uses that
they're like dude this is awesome and it
is so you gotta give them props ok let's
go to our next call you know the shin of
should we go to that call with the dude
who talks about the air pods yeah yeah
ok I go I didn't realize it I forget he
we couldn't really understand his name
but uh he called him he wanted to say
like maybe this is the future of the air
pod you know like this is kind of what
he sees Apple apples direction going so
here we go hi Brian Heidi tumors is a
copy from Los Angeles and I'm calling
because I want to get your thoughts on
the article that I read in the Wall
Street Journal but was suggesting that
the airport should actually be a
solution to apples lack of foreign home
device because it would be in your ear
and you have access to Siri any given
moment instead of having to go to the
room where the device is located to you
know give the command so I was thinking
like maybe the earpods are to be more
than just a traditional bluetooth
earphones and I just want to be your
thoughts on that theory anyways I love
the show and it definitely makes riding
in a lurch I think a lot easier thank
you koo LA traffic brian is talking
about no I know exactly what I'm talking
about I mean I appreciate that our la
folks are listening to us because i'm
gonna start expresso that LA traffic is
brutal so you know when we talk about
the future of the air pods and using the
Moors bluetooth headphones i think what
is interesting about his suggestion an
idea is yes you know apple at least
right now it feels like they're trailing
in the smart home and i'm going to not
feel like I think they absolutely are
but you know you could use your air pods
like that one of the things about
technologies that people sometimes
forget they they like take the TV
because when you use technology in
different ways that also and you're
changing someone's behavior you need to
make them comfortable with that behavior
so for example 3d touch was like I'm
like oh this is awesome let's see how
they implement it do I use it all the
time I use it a little bit here and
there but it not not completely
something like Google glass people like
uh I don't like seeing some texting on
my face or your face so that's kind of
weird and it that was one of the things
that killed it right that social
acceptance either something like how
many times you see people really taught
you know talking to their phone like
Syrians you don't really see people be
so I I do it but when I do I like trying
to keep on my diary I'll be like sorry
said in long and so I think when he when
oh when this guy is talking about okay
earpods being kind of that that center
piece of that headset the thing is that
I where I have used the air pods I don't
want to wear air pods all the time so
like that would require you to have to
wear something in your ear all the time
I think the air pods is kind of like one
of those gateway behaviors to get people
used to the idea of having wireless
earbuds in their ears all the time said
you you and I have talked about that
movie her all the time of fellows right
yeah he has them all the time at
computer in his here anytime on a
constant conversation with himself on
his ear all the time yeah so and so that
way that's the future you want well yeah
I was like I was in the bathroom and I
was thinking about that guy's call and I
was just like it is kind of you know
it's it's humans moving more in the
direction of becoming cyborgs you know
like we have we're gonna have things in
our ears all the time so we can
communicate with a computer you know so
it is kind of interesting you know maybe
he is right on some some wavelengths I
think on some level I mean that they can
try and do that but for someone who uses
the Amazon echo all the time yeah the
fact that it's just in your room and it
can hear you because of the way it's
Mike's my tits you know the micro-ray
can pick up you know where you are in
your room while you're talking and can
filter out the fact that you're talking
while a TV is on and does it pretty dang
well like I don't have to be connected
to anything other than there's a speaker
my house true so that that in itself
they've all to me
II then Google home I mean they've
already kind of cracked that nut and
apples still like oh but you have an AI
assistant on your phone all the time I
don't want to have my phone in my
talking to my house all the time yeah I
really don't do you ever yell to Alexa
though from if you're like far away do
you yell across the house I think when
you first start using it you're not sure
you don't trust that it can be that what
happens right they're like my nieces and
nephews when the user for the first time
they like yell or they walk right up to
it and I'm like no no or you know even
Sean and she's like she never talks
normally to it so I'm like just
something normally and then when it
works and you're like whoa it actually
picked up my normal volume I said a
normal natural sentence and it works you
know I feel like around eighty to ninety
percent of the time then you're like
damn this is really cool right yeah yeah
so uh i think the earphone idea is are
the air pods idea is great it it could
potentially be that but again Apple home
kit we're still waiting for it to really
take off and it's all about that go
right now it's in the hole about the
echo yes I'm going to change mine just
so I can call it computer instead of
Alexa yeah tired of calling it Alexa to
be honest it's kind of nerdy I'm like
Alexa but if i say computer i think i'll
feel cooler actually I I'm gonna stick
I'm gonna still go with his start go
with when I started with the clinic I
feel like I'd say the word computer in
general talking more than I would say
the word you know what I don't want to
say it sure that off my car my fireman
if I do it all right you get the next
call yeah yeah okay okay next call was
from Randy who has some thoughts about
the future of Apple as well here's Randy
okay I got 30 seconds and go this is
randy from san diego love your show
always have always will okay that's
enough of that guys you're awesome
anyway am I excited for the future of
apples no all right in fact if I can't
get an awesome phone on awesome
something this year on stupid
everything you said about the Amazon
echo was spot-on everything at CES
amazing so I've been a big fan boy it's
not that kind of for me no more so
nothing know your thoughts on that later
wow he's jumping ship Ryan he said he's
jumping ship look III hear a lot of
people say that I don't believe it until
they like we've done a lot of live
streams and I've heard a lot of people
in that room say I'm gonna buy this I'm
gonna get that I'm like I'm like so I'll
be okay I'll prove it to me they'd even
buy nothing yeah by nothing I know I'll
get the next iPhone bro yeah it's like
the whole look back it up back it up and
make the purchase and do it then I'll
believe you but I think Randy's
frustrations is you know what we talked
about and I don't want to sound like a
broken record because I think look the
problem communities like oh I'm just not
excited about you know what they're
doing anymore or excited about tech
don't let one company determine that for
you like there are so many exciting
things in fact happening all the time
and look Apple can still surprise us I
don't know if they will this year I'm
not going to buy a pair of augmented
reality glasses anytime soon even if
Apple comes out with them and it's going
to be again their first mainstream
market attempt like this is a different
apple this is not the Steve Jobs Apple
that could all of a sudden come out with
a phone and blow your socks off come out
with a freaking iPad come out with an a
music service a digital music service
that took everyone off guard it was like
whoa like just wrap matter yeah this is
not the same Apple okay you just have to
understand that they still make great
stuff if you're in the ecosystem you're
going to love it but just look around
like everyone's doing so many crazy
things so I would just tell Randy not so
don't don't get jaded by techno like
technology is so fun like we're so lucky
that we're like you and I Beecham and I
have our jobs because of technology we
got a cow look at the studio minute Hank
policy okay that's stupid we're so
blessed and lucky and we never forget
that but at the same time like you
shouldn't get jaded by it like you know
when I criticize it it's for fun but it
is true like show us the best stuff
that's what we expect and if you're not
we're either not going to talk about you
or if you act like you're the best
you're not going to say it too so people
like to choose sides o'brien's they'd
love to be on a team you know well if
they look at my products they know what
team I'm on oh yeah humanity but it
doesn't mean I'm not
not the mascot anymore I might have been
i might have been the cheerleader nah
I'm what kind of like like on a
basketball team I'm not the superstar
rah-rah guy now I'm kind of like the six
men off the bench it's like all right I
understand what needs to be done here I
survey the floor I get it done but yeah
Andre Iguodala yeah there's really not
one company right now that makes
everything that you just have to have
exactly you know all those things to
work all together like everyone kind of
takes a little bit from everywhere like
it was everyone has a couple Apple
things people have a couple pc things at
work you need other things you know so
it's there's not one company just
killing it right now I mean that that
should be exciting to people right it's
like yeah yeah who would want one
company to literally dominate I did let
that happen in LA and I enjoyed it
thoroughly hahaha but still there were
other companies coming after them who
are innovating you know that just makes
other companies want to innovate and
build other stuff that's going to
attract other customers you know what I
mean so that's a good thing like that's
why America has laws for you know no
monopolies you know stuff like that like
we want competition we want people to
build new cool stuff so like luckier
let's just look at the landscape right
now if you had to go around the line of
who does the best of what look virtual
reality i'm gonna throw my hat at oculus
I think they do it I see there between
oculus in the front of the line I know I
know your life I know you're like dude
but that star without me we should have
yeah I mean that's the only thing i've
done so i can't really argue but uh you
know they're chilling there are
obviously cars cars huh aren't all car
manufacturers and i was at the detroit
auto show I'll my get every car how
every manufacturer has a self-driving
car now yeah like every single one but i
will be in tesla bro yeah tesla is the
hotness for sure i don't even have one
when I was a team Tesla okay totally I
see a lot I almost get hit by one daily
in San Francisco okay I think I've said
that before but yeah every day there's a
Tesla flying by me I'm like oh you know
you have a the virtual assistant they
all actually you know what's interesting
i'm not going to i'm going to be a
little politically correct here
they all do things differently and do
things well you know whether it's how
they're integrated but you know the echo
is going to be the leader right now you
just can't deny that it's all of its and
one of the reasons why you know people
talk about okay with the future of Apple
and artificial intelligence why is Apple
trailing right what what are some of
those reasons because it's not just like
Oh a company's trailing there's reasons
why okay so Apple introduced home kit
back in like two thousand season 13 or
14 let's i think around 2014 apple
introduced home kit and it was like oh
the smart home this is going to be it
and we've seen that Apple is like really
significantly lagged we just ramping it
up I mean they really had a lead start
they had Siri they had home kid in 2014
and all of a sudden in 2016 amazon just
kicked their butts right yeah what's
really behind that is that what works
for Apple when they were the number one
game in town with the iphone they
created this like made for iphone
program right and this was when you made
any third party accessories it was an
authorized chipset from Apple you paid a
licensing fee put in your speakers you
got a sticker on there called me for
Apple or made for iphone okay now let's
fast forward to 2016 2017 with home kit
apples like okay you need to follow
again kind of this procedure where you
need to be using the right types of
chips that work and our compatible it's
a combination like a Bluetooth and Wi-Fi
chip set as well as you know passing
these standards to be a home kit partner
well guess what Alexa did Alexa is an
open platform yeah they're like here's
the code here's the api's develop on it
we will approve you with as a workable
amazon alexa or whatever works with echo
in 10 days wow I had no idea it's not
valid like everyone's like how did so
many people get on Alexa they made it
easy now easy amazon will be the first
to admit even in like there's a reuters
article that just got published recently
but there'll be the first to admit and
kind of talk about how okay you know
Apple is really controlling it from the
standpoint of like you know maybe
dealing with door locks and other items
that have security camera this stuff is
more sensitive and they actually
outright admit like okay you know Apple
does have an edge from that secure
standpoint of like really being able to
control that partnership with the home
kit authorization but most consumers
don't care like they don't look into
that nitty-gritty they're like oh I use
the echo with my life I use it with my
thermostat I use it with my TV remote
the does my camera work the Alexa now
yeah I'm gonna get that right that's how
a consumer sink slowly yeah Apple loves
to lock everything down and I guess if
they're trying to do with Siri and
everything else in their home okay it
worked in the past yeah they were like
the only game in town or do they only
had kind of like one competitor you know
Samsung wasn't doing the same things as
them but now it's different like Samsung
is coming out with our own virtual
assistant from the creators of Siri like
advanced version of Siri called vivre or
viv yeah that Apple did it Apple wanted
to do their own thing with Siri the
company that created three was like we
actually want to do a whole lot more
created viv and now Samsung acquired
them yeah like that's crazy man you know
so these are these are these
relationships and these things that are
happening behind the scenes that have
made it an ultra-competitive environment
where Apple can't just be where the only
game in town haha jump on made for
iphone it's not like that anymore and
that's why you kind of seen them lose
momentum and also just fall behind
someone like Amazon do you think apple
will open that up you know like like
amazon has done and just make it easier
for developers i think apple is always
apple see from a standpoint of like
Apple having this identity in this brand
and this control and really there they
are right because they're saying we're
looking out for the consumer they are
right about that but also actually
looking out for themselves you know they
want to work with specific partners they
don't want Joe Schmo to create an app on
a like for example dude I have all these
like total janky apps on my Alexa
there's one called ocean sounds okay yes
I hear the water to give me right so
evident as garage made that I know he
will that kind of like how when the eye
first came out and there was all these
just random like crappy apps that's kind
of the same thing right i mean everyone
just building like whatever they're
throwing everything at the wall to see
what sticks they went down at that right
but that's what i want so i got fun i
remember i had a lighter from my iphone
it was so dumb but I had a lighter oh
right and so that was like hey we're
we're above this we're above this stuff
guy right that's how they approach it
and i get it and it does benefit you
know they're they're appealing to a
certain audience but dang when you're
behind you can't be that same way
anymore like her area amazon didn't have
a consumer product hit like an actual
product until this echo and now it's a
hit and other companies are hungry and
they want that space you can't be all
controlling when you're that when you're
behind in the pack you got yeah yeah you
got to be hungry and you know apples
going to learn what's good what it's
like to be hungry this year 2016 things
shifted I think 2017 they're going to be
hungry and hopefully it helps them in
the future let's get hungry let's get
hungry all right so he gets the nice
guys here's another call the next call

AT&amp;amp;T customers man yeah it's all about
