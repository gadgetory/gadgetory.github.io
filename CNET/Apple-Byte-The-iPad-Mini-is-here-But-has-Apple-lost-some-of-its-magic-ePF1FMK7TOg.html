welcome to the apple byte it's all the
good and bad from Apple's October event
so let's break it down now everything we
talked about last week pretty much
happened and can you guess what the
headliner was if you said the new mac
mini you were wrong now it was all about
Apple's new shiny toy the ipad mini so
let's take a look at our quick look with
Scott Stein hi I'm Scott Stein and today
has been iPad day the smallest in the
iPad line the iPad Mini has been
announced and this is gonna be available
on November second it is 7.2 millimeters
thin very very thin and feels extremely
light it's got a 7.9 inch display and it
starts at 329 now that's maybe higher up
than some of the doorbuster tablets that
are out there but it packs an a5
processor it's got facetime HD it's got
optional LTE for configuration starting
at four hundred sixty dollars and it's
got a thousand 24 x 768 display that
matches the ipad tues but the text seems
a lot more crisp and readable
comparatively because the displays a
little smaller it doesn't feel like a
Retina display but it certainly feels
readable for for email and feels more
readable than it would on an ipad 2 a
lot of people are going to want these a
for the price and be because the fact
that it's more affordable and it comes
in black when it comes in so in aluminum
with the field that sort of reminds me
of the ipod touch 5th gen and there were
idea smart covers that fit it as well
pre-orders start imminently and it will
be available alongside the new
fourth-generation ipad which has an
upgraded a6x processor so these two are
going to be available for the holiday
season and this seems to mark the
resetting of the next generation of the
ipad lineup i'm scott stein and mrs. a
look at the new ipad mini
thanks Scott now guys I'm not really the
target market for the ipad mini I know
there's a lot of you out there and it
looks pretty slick I expected a higher
price point than the ipod touch but
packing just an a5 processor and no
Retina display for a 329 price point I'm
not feeling that now they'll still sell
a bunch but competition is fierce with
quality 199 tablets in the 7-inch space
now Phil Schiller asked what can you do
with the ipad mini that you can't
already do with the ipad well this you
can hold it in one hand I can actually
hold the current iPad with one hand but
this takes me to the biggest surprise of
the keynote the ipad 4th generation we
expected an updated ipad with lightning
connector to be announced but no one
expected Apple would completely replace
its guts bringing an a 6x processor that
doubles its CPU and graphics performance
a FaceTime HD camera twice as fast Wi-Fi
and more compatibility of 4G LTE
networks this is a whole new new iPad
just seven months after the new iPad was
announced now Tim Cook called the third
gen their fastest and best selling ipad
to date now it doesn't even exist on the
apple store I know there are plenty of
you that feel burned by this shortened
life cycle I'm all for upgrades but this
fast we're thrown out the bad apple at
you now Cena reports that if you
purchase the 3rd gen ipad with in the
past 30 days some apple stores but not
all of them will allow you to exchange
them for the new iPad 3 s excuse me i
met the ipad for now pricing remains the
same starting at 499 pre-orders start on
the 26 and for those of you who have an
ipad 1 or even a to this might be a
pretty sweet upgrade for you and where
was iTunes 11 well apple says it's
coming in october just a few days from
now so maybe they're just messing with
us or november could be the new october
i'll write the new macbook pro 13-inch
with Retina Display made its debut
starting at 1699 for a price point with
no optical drive dual thunderbolt ports
hdmi and USB 3 these are sweet sweet
machines that
you'll pay for and they're available
right now but the biggest drawback is a
lack of a discrete graphics card now you
can switch over to for handling graphic
intensive apps and something the 15 inch
pro has that the 13 inch just doesn't
Mac minis get an update as well starting
at 599 with a quad-core processor option
thunderbolt and USB 3 the mac minis are
available now and you know what i like
to save the best for last and for me
personally it was the new imac who says
desktops are dead do you see how sexy
and hot that thing is well the new imac
just kills it with its do me baby design
featuring the display that's as thin as
five millimeters around the edges you'll
get all the latest connectivity and a
new fusion drive custom option which is
different from the typical hybrid drives
we've already seen on the market now
apples fusion drive stores frequently
use things like apps documents or photos
on a flash storage space while in
frequently used items move to the main
hard drive it doesn't cash or duplicate
the data like a typical hybrid hard
drive does now the 21.5 inch imac starts
at twelve ninety nine and is available
in november and the 27-inch model starts
at 1799 and will be available later in
december but the biggest difference
between the two is the 27 inches ability
to have for user accessible memory slots
that you can upgrade you won't be able
to do that with a smaller imac and i
like bigger screens because the images
are bigger all right let's get to our
kensington keyfolio give away over 500

i should say to get james attention like
saara bh who suggested i say hey Jamie
