associate Iturbe car Tech and GPS at C
net and I'm taking a look today at the
Magellan smart GPS now this portable
navigation device aims to bridge the gap
between hardware that fits on your
dashboard and the internet which is
connected to your smartphone that should
probably be staying in your pocket while
you drive
now the smart GPS is a five-inch screen
device aside from the capacitive touch
screen which is glass like you would get
on a smartphone there's not very much
different here from your standard GPS
device it's basically a touch screen on
a suction cup you've got your power on
the top and a bunch of connections along
the bottom here there's also an
interesting little capacitive home
button that you'll use to get back to
the map screen from anywhere in the
interface I kind of like that that's
hardware in that software you'll see
that they've devoted a large chunk of
the screen to these live updating smart
squares now you can show more of these
squares by swiping this virtual jog
wheel at the top - to the right or show
fewer of them by swiping to the left you
get four in the default state up to
eight in the full screen and as few as
zero
when you're driving it also shrinks down
to only show two so you get more map
display you got everything from fuel
prices to traffic flow data and
incidents and live updating tiles with
information about nearby points of
interest pulled from Yelp and Foursquare
when you flip out the full screen you've
also got things like weather updates
even an interesting little web browser
here I don't know if you actually want
to use that while you're driving but it
can be good for finding destinations
while you're parked now all of this
information is going to be pulled from
the internet via a Wi-Fi connection
that's built in so when you pull into
your driveway at the end of the day
it'll start pulling that information so
that it'll be ready when you get in the
car the next time and want to go but if
you have a web connected iPhone in your
pocket you can also use that here we've
got the Magellan smart GPS app running
on an Apple iPhone this is an early
alpha version that should
pretty indicative of what you'll expect
when the app actually hits the market
this summer it does give you a little
bit of interesting live data so if the
traffic jam develops while you're on the
road you got your data coverage right
here the app can also be used for
searching for destinations
you've got the familiar Live Tiles here
that the same ones that you'll see on
the device itself and you also have the
ability to search for destinations using
the web connections once you've got a
destination chosen you can either sync
it to Magellan's cloud-based me cloud or
my cloud service I'm not sure how to
pronounce that but it'll actually be
stored in the cloud that you can pull
down later using smart GPS device or you
can send that destination directly to
the Magellan smart GPS Hardware over the
Bluetooth connection for immediate
navigation the interesting thing there
is that you can start searching for a
destination before you even get in your
car or it's safe and then when you hop
in their car you can already have it
sitting there waiting to go when you're
ready to drive now the last piece of the
puzzle is Magellan online interface that
lets you access all of that my cloud
data from any web browser you can manage
your favorites or add destinations to a
wish list you can even organize those
destinations into a multi stop trip and
then optimize it so that you minimize
the amount of driving that you've got to
do the retail price of the Magellan
smart GPS hardware is about $349 that's
kind of pricey but the interesting thing
is that they're tossing that my cloud
cloud-based thinking in for absolutely
free the Magellan smart GPS app is also
free and that gives you some basic
destination searching you can open that
up into a much more useful navigation
app with some in-app purchases you can
check out the full review of the
Magellan smart GPS over on cnet.com to
see exactly how this thing works once
you get on the road till then I'm

taken a look at the Magellan smart GPS
