our home the home pod is just under 7
inches tall along the bottom is a seven
array beam formed tweeter pack that's
packed with seven tweeters each with
their own individual driver their
precision acoustic horns the drive the
audio from within and then out along the
bottom with tremendous directional
control and that'll become really clear
in a bit as we talk about how it works
it has a really big woofer 4 inch woofer
upward-facing with a large motor to move
a lot of air it's automatic basically
zation and dynamic software modeling so
that as we turn the volume up it's free
from distortion and all of this is
controlled by an Apple a8 chip compact
enough you can put it most anywhere in
your house you can put it on a table on
a shelf against the wall in a corner and
it intelligently and automatically
detects the space that's within and it
uses that information to adjust the
audio to balance it and take full
advantage of the environment and create
a very spacious sound the siri team has
worked very hard to adapt the domain of
music and siri to be even greater and
understand more of the questions we're
going to ask about music play something
new who's singing on this track
something I asked all time was playing
drums on this track and since series
built-in there and you can speak to it
well the teams also worked hard to make
it a great and helpful home assistant as
well we said the domain of music is
something Cyrano's really well in home
pod there are other domains as well
we've worked hard to pick the first ones
that we think matter most in a product
like home pods of course you can play
your podcasts but it can also do things
like give you news give you weather
traffic sports you can ask it to set a
reminder set a timer text someone with
messages and if you have homekit devices
set up your home you can speak to your
home pod and control your home kit
devices so for example for the home pod
set up you can say when do the Red Sox
play next going to beat the Yankees
trust me tune to NPR instead
and if you have homekit devices set up
you can say simple things like are the
lights on turn the heat up turn on the
air-conditioning bring the shades down
halfway
our team cares deeply about your privacy
so for example it has that magic phrase
hey Siri until you say it nothing's
being sent to Apple it recognizes when
you do say it and from that point it
sends an anonymous Siri ID in order to
help you with the command you're looking
for and of course that communication is
all encrypted we're really excited to
tell you that home pod is going to be
priced for 349 dollars</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
