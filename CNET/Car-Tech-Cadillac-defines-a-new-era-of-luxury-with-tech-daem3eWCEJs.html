New York Auto Show taking a look at the
Cadillac ct6 this is an all-new big
luxury car for Cadillac a car that
they've needed for a little while in
their lineup and they've designed this
from the ground up to be a very text
forward luxury vehicle they use
lightweight materials on the body to
reduce the weight so they can get away
with smaller engines Benjen choices are
a twin-turbo 3-liter v6 engine lab does
400 horsepower so that is the top engine
they also have a 3.6 liter v6 doing over
300 horsepower and a 2-liter
turbocharged four-cylinder engine which
i'm not sure they'll have in the US
market this car has an adaptive
suspension to improve ride quality it
also has four-wheel steering and you can
get it with all-wheel drive so this car
could be very nimble on the road when we
drive it will get a chance to try that
out now I've sat in this car and it
feels very good inside there's a lot of
nice luxury elements and that's
obviously what Cadillacs known for one
of the most remarkable things is a new
audio system from Bose called can array
which actually has 34 speakers built up
inside the cabin of the car all spaced
around to get maximum surround sound a
really immersive sound experience they
also have a new touch pad controller on
the console and a big 10.2 inch high
resolution screen for the cadillac user
experience all the cabin tech features
like navigation phone system and audio
I've used that in this car too and it's
very responsive much more responsive
than in some of the earlier cadillac
models that have used this system with
all these features the cadillac ct6
looks like it could be a very nice very
luxurious very comfortable car but it's
certainly a car that cadillac needs I'm
win kidding them here at the 2015 new
york auto show
