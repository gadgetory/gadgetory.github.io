yesterday yeah it was insane okay um
lets up with that drone though the
Millennium Falcon drew has it work

foam it's small I mean at first I feel
like that drone you'd play with it for
like 10 minutes and then you're like
okay it just floats her it's like really
cool the very beginning yeah but this
thing at least gives you some more
playtime and then I have nieces and
nephews are gonna love this if my
brother is watching he'd be like uh when
you're gonna give those to my kids come
on Uncle bry uncle bra hundred and fifty
a pop BAM boom hundred pic I got a scale
of one to ten how much do I like to bb-8
I think if you don't have nieces nephews
to play with it you might get a little
bored with it but the coolest feature
about this thing is that it has this
patrol mode on it let me see if I can
actually turn on right now it has this
patrol mode on it and then it just
randomly it goes around your room your
home if it has a you know even service
floor and like it doesn't necessarily
map it out but it knows where the limits
are like the walls it'll bump into them
and stuff so let's just are we sure you
mean right now homie yeah yeah we go let
me just get this thing let me get this
thing started and then just to show
people just have a little quick fun with
it and then we'll get out of here it

lightsaber controller what we had the
original I had the original um r2d2
action figure the Kenner one yeah and I
remember me my brother put it in milk
when we were kids and all the stickers
just peeled right off that thing's
probably worth hundreds of dollars in
mint condition okay so everyone that's
watching that has no idea what they're
because our people actually I realize
have seen this or heart are wondering
what's going on here this is our show
it's called apple byte extra crunchy and
what the whole goal of this show is is
that by the time the actual apple byte
show posts which is about a five minute
show and has fun a lot of new news comes
out some people want us to expand our
thoughts on what's happening or what we
think about certain issues or news or
things of that nature so that's where
the show is all about it's just myself
Steven Beecham our producer
extraordinaire just hanging out talking
and have an organic conversation with
you guys just having fun and talking
about the stuff you want to talk about
and you know we appreciate you guys
coming to chat and everything so there
are times where you won't hear all the
programming because this is again made
to be an audio podcast we just decided
to stream this because you know is why
we have the capabilities if only my mom
was watching we'd still stream this
right now maybe not maybe not we got
some people watching okay can anyone
identify what this shirt is come on this
guy represent you know this is freaking
Infinity Gauntlet chaka infinity Shaka
all right I don't know what that is you
know you liked you on Hawaii they like
shocked up oh yeah yeah i'm losing
what's what's Infinity Gauntlet oh ok
money I'm gonna okay because you will
know you'll know about this do you watch
the Marvel movies no I'll see the only
one I've seen is the Avengers the first
Avengers well then this is good so in
the Marvel movies at least the storyline
that they're following is there's this
there are these gems that are that have
different abilities or powers ones like
the soul gem ones the power gem ones the
space jam and they are all existing in
this universe this gauntlet is like a
glove that ends up all of these nights
ago so it's called Infinity Gauntlet now
just yielded by basically one of
Marvel's biggest baddies ever his name
stano's it's like a galactic I don't
he's not a god but he has godly powers
and so he's the big bad that all these
movies are intertwined and leading to oh
really ok but i love it because Infinity
Gauntlet was the series that got me
reading comics when I was a kid nice so
I saw the cover and it's like hits him
holding his glove out and then all the
superheroes and bad guys are like around
it off of like the reflections of the
gems and I was like what is that and
that's what got me in a comic books I
think it was like in fourth grade or
something like that fifth grade it's
pretty hot pretty hot infinity Shaka if
you wondering where to go light sleepers
net I just found this shirt online and
I'm like this is amazing and I got it
that's not what do it that's how I do it
ok ready to go let's go through it let's
go we gotta got all that Apple Apple
goodness all right what was that was
that I was a chat Simon chatting me
someone's chatting you Oh Nick
he's asking me if I have any guitar
pedals so what's up I might actually oh
man he's a rock star he's a snake okay
here we go yes sure got everything right
from the top of the CBS interactive
building in San Francisco it's the apple
byte extra crunchy with your host Ryan
Tom what's up everybody welcome to our
humble abode in the house myself brian
Tong the producer extraordinaire Stephen
Beecham you know everybody Apple by
extra crunchy it's all about stories the
news the happenings but we expand upon
topics we have new news from the regular
apple byte show we take your voicemails
we throw in some fun stuff this is the
show where we just want to talk and
expand more of and just just basically
be able to talk more than we already do
right yeah all the Apple stories that
fell through the cracks this week brian
Tong sweeps them up and presents them to
you i scoop them up and dump them back
out and sometimes and there's no stories
we'll talk about everything yeah it's
good uh biggest this is off topic but
Vegas hottest toy gadget everyone knows
about the force awakens yeah like toy
release which is insane and they're like
saying oh you got to go at midnight and
midnight did you go last night I mean I
don't know no did you order it on my
puter okay I'm line but just to honor
the force awakens a kind of set we had
to show off or at least talk about the
toy that everyone saw the bb-8 the bb-8
excellent moment iphone ios app also
works on android for the record we want
to make people aware of that yeah 150
bucks rolls around it's based off of a
Spearow rolling ball robot toy and now
it has the personality bb-8 pretty much
the next generations r2d2 for this
upcoming new trilogy r2d2 still there
but this guy is sake this cool so how
does the head stay on have you figured
that out do you have an idea I dunno you
know a secret to secret I was it's the
force it's the force it's the force the
force keeps the head on
crazy oh you could take it off okay
that's what I was wondering basically
it's magnetics yeah but also there are
these to like rolling balls on the
surface of here haha so it allows it to
roll with the day with the device so
there's a there's like it's a thing like
there's a hamster in here not really and
then there's a magnet on top that for
the most part stays on the top part and
this thing rolls with it you see the
variety variety video yeah they did all
talks very cute so you see the seen a
video we put out I watched that one like
yellow three or four times two thousand
one hundred two thousand one hundred
shares really for on facebook yeah from
Romania and I don't have I keep my
facebook lock down from my facebook
that's crazy I don't even know yours yes
not seen it I've seen it's like I'm not
even one of him but I was like what the
hell I never post stuff on Facebook yeah
that's not it's kind of insane as of now
two thousand one hundred shares Booya
very popular okay people are like what
the hell I came here for Apple by yes
nine star wars that Star Wars not Star
Wars bite the BB 8 byte by byte 80 all
right so uh we're gonna go over all the
new and latest stories stuff that we
didn't cover from last week but also
stuff that you we put some of these
things in the show most recent show but
we're kind of adding on more news more
stories to give you a bigger picture of
everything we're gonna start with Apple
TV we're gonna go down the line a lot of
people asked about why didn't you talk
about iPads last week well I pads were
kind of out of the equation but now they
appear to be back in the equation for
this keynote because it's going to be a
beast that Apple is pretty much
releasing everything they possibly can
here so let's just start off with Apple
TV news the latest Apple TV for right
this is their next-gen box the actual
hardware has been revealed again 9to5
mac has pretty much been coming up with
ninety percent of the stories here it's
insane how awesome their team has been
the apple TV will come with an a8 chip
not the a9 but in a a chip which is
vastly improved from there a5 processor
which is currently in the Apple TVs it
also have a black remote that'll match
the tone of the actual box the box will
be larger in size yeah it's just I was
just going to ask this one looks bigger
on the right yeah well they just filled
it up in Photoshop in this page
that's not the app okay that's just a
pretend okay it's just all so uh the
remote will have a touch pad area on the
on the top of it it'll have two buttons
but physical buttons below it which will
be for the Siri button to activate voice
control much like Amazon's a remote has
voiced by yeah yeah you also have a home
button obviously and then on the side
it's expect to have volume rocker so
it's going to be a thicker remote as
well not as well you so you can control
your Apple TV okay I got it according to
the report yes according to the reports
also Apple has been flirting with the
idea of actually releasing two models
one with a naked capacity the other with
a 16 gig capacity now a lot of people
are wondering why would they do such a
thing well they're going to be hooked
into the App Store although this new
Apple TV will be taken advantage of
using the iOS 9 core it's not running a
true you know I a pure iOS that we see
on our phones or anything like that but
it has an iOS core which allows them to
compress the size of the files for apps
to be smaller but just think if they're
really going to try and cater this to be
an app store you're going to need more
storage on some of these models they've
been debating the 149 price point and
the 199 price point according to nine if
I Mac BuzzFeed had said it will at the
very least start off as an entry-level
model for $149 that seems like a
competitive price for what we're trying
to do ya from comin from Apple what
they're trying to do there's no way this
thing was going to be able to make $99
just specifically because the remote in
my mind so there you have it also
another cool feature with the Apple TV
Universal Search what does that mean if
you've ever played with a roku box you
can type in a term and actor a movie
it'll tell you all the services that you
can access that movie from and whether
it's free or whether it's paid it
identifies that for you which is that's
awesome super helpful so sometimes I'm
going through like how much is this cost
on YouTube how much is it on Amazon how
much is that on here app you know it's
like it's a big pain in the end it's
super helpful that is super helpful so
because it's running off of iOS 9 s core
which if you've seen some of the beta
developer releases of iOS 9 it has a lot
of universal search where if i type in
the term like carrots when you when you
swipe
left in your spotlight search it also
shows like you know restaurants
addresses locations pulls up website so
it does an apps across the entire device
or gadget so Universal Search will be
part of the new Apple TV for as well now
here's a really cool story that I
thought and I want to hear your take on
this Beach I'm in a second Apple working
on exclusive content now this is an
article from Variety magazine or variety
then use outlet and in the report it
says Apple has been we just haven't
really heard about it has been eyeing to
move into original programming allah
netflix allah amazon what do you think
about this man I think they're way late
to the party man everyone's already been
doing it so you know they have to jump
in on and get competitive with everyone
else to basically become their own
studio this is something that my brother
had talked about for years probably like
three years ago he's like if Apple wants
to be unique about this service and this
is when we were all talking about the
idea of a service they need to have
exclusive content right that's gonna
drive people there know Apple is a big
machine the thing is they've actually
shown in this report that Apple tried to
negotiate with the top gear team to
potentially buy their show you put it
exclusively on Apple service and not
that didn't happen and who end up
getting them actually after all that was
just recently announced listen amazon i
want to say it's amazon i don't i'm
pretty sure it wasn't netflix no it
wasn't that flick let's or who was it
who Lou could have been hulu yeah who
lose making big moves to right now let's
see here I'm gonna because this is a
real live Timeship life real-time show
maybe people know amazon people are
saying amazon that's why periscope is
here yes thanks periscope people
complain like dude you talk to periscope
all the time no do you get paid by
periscope Ryan do I get paid back no no
absolutely not do I want to get paid by
periscope talk to me yes yeah do we yeah
yeah periscope yeah yeah ha yo holla
holla you have my number because you
have my twitter account which has my
phone number in it don't worry have my
number call me so top gear going to
amazon also if for people that are
sports fans are you familiar with Bill
Simmons yes so he got
out of his contract with ESPN he was
looking for a home apple also approached
Bill Simmons road to do exclusive
content for the words but he said no I
think as a content creator you don't
want to get locked in with Apple I don't
know I could see the PGA Tour teaming up
with Apple because that other products
are high-end it's like about this yet
watch PGA Tour it's like Mercedes that's
a good demographic no time soon that's a
good demographic of that all right rich
white guys r it's like rich white guys
if you have content for rich white dudes
put it on Apple hell yeah but for other
things it would it make sense to I don't
see people saying oh I'm only gonna
watch Bill Simmons sports content on
Apple TV that actually limits his his
earning power how much money they make
of him I mean the fact that the Internet
has democratized content and if you
really wanted to at the other day like
look at someone like Dan Patrick yeah he
has his own show he puts it out on
youtube clips on youtube you can watch
it through other stations but it's
everywhere he's ESPN right he used to be
SPN what is he now he's a known thing
Dan Patrick show Patrick show my god
that's where it's at yeah that's what a
lot of guys are doing even like
what's-his-name that guy from Fox News
uh I forget his name real crazy guy
someone will tell you in periscope but
he did the same thing Glenn Beck oh did
the same thing just went totally
independent if you have a strong enough
voice in a certain area you can do that
I'm even you want it you want to just
say what's on take this equipment and
just put in a room somewhere think
there's a broken TriCaster someone can
fix ok let's we can we will talk we'll
talk we're just kidding y'all we're just
kidding but anyways Apple working on
exclusive content I think this is a
great idea but it I'm curious to see who
they lure what becomes a little more
interesting to me though is the fact
that Marvel is aligned with Disney which
is aligned with Apple ok they're all
kind of in cahoots with each other it
would be interesting to see Marvel
already signed that exclusive content
with netflix for the daredevil show
which we love yeah big hit huge hit show
oh my god who's your favorite character
in that show you know what I haven't
watched that show what I'm just saying
it's a huge in so you've seen it no I
haven't seen I haven't seen it oh you
just like the actors no I just I just
know it's a big hit show
like all the crave casters we're talking
about it for like is you have notebooks
we have netflix i don't have no no
wonder it was on prime baby i would give
you access to my account but i already
gave it to one of our other co i gave
Charlie access to my account cuz he
works oh yeah yeah cuz you're allowed to
give like I'm 55 you can do a shared
account that's cool anyways okay fine I
thought you were but daredevil iron fist
Luke Cage jessica jones those are the
defenders in the Marvel Universe that's
right that's what's up for those of you
that don't know okay those four are
going to have their own universe
intertwined on netflix it'd be
interesting to see if Apple use their
clout to eventually somehow get some
type of Marvel property onto their
service yeah if they're really serious
about exclusive content yeah it's just
there's so many things out there it's
hard to keep track now it's hard to keep
up with all the stuff that happens but
Cena has great videos were like what's
coming and going on Amazon and Netflix
you know we have all that great stuff so
I'll go watch that it's called net pigs
Ned picks a great show net picks yes
love the show so anyways I love the idea
about I know we're talking about this
content is always king but we'll see
what they can do yes I don't know
they're gonna have to plop down a lot of
money because netflix has shown that
they're super they're hardcore investing
in it Amazon's got the money man yes I'm
200 billion dollar yeah they get they
can get some some big-time actors 200
billion dollars Big Ten producers do you
want to talk about this next okay next
story according to MacRumors this is
just a rumor because it's on macrumors
but Apple has is trying to acquire this
firm called phase shift which allows you
to you put a camera in front of your
face and it maps your face and then
animates your face onto a character like
an avatar a video game avatar yeah it's
really cool actually you know there's
this other app that i play with with my
son and it's called neato and it does
basically the same thing but here I'll
fast-forward through this video a little
bit but these people they have a camera
mounted on their face and then as they
talk and even like turn their head left
and right I had mad time yeah in real
time with the character and that this
neat-o app that I that I've been playing
with my son it's kind of buggy you know
it doesn't work that great but this
looks like it's very
this looks like it's very powerful
software running running these are fully
three dent 3d rendered cares now people
are saying why why would Apple do this
why would they potentially acquire this
look this is prime for you multiple user
profiles on devices forget the fact that
you sometimes have to take away the
technology of the way it's being
displayed and just from a pure facial
recognition standpoint apple doesn't
have anything truly really like that in
their in their pocket of tricks right so
let's say you walk up to you have an
iPad that you share with your family you
walk up to it it recognizes your face it
doesn't necessarily mean it's going to
map it to an avatar but you have your
face there multiple user profiles based
on your face why not yeah but not only
that but just for content producers like
independent movie producers and
animators this is an incredible tool to
use you know if you just want to go make
a cartoon now you could just act it act
it out yeah and make it an sdk know
you'd be so like someone is at the
Cannes Film Festival this last year they
shot a video on an iphone right and it's
like a very big popular I don't know the
name in the movie but it's critically
acclaimed film and they're shooting with
an iPad so all of all of Hollywood's
like freaking out like oh my god like we
spend millions of dollars making these
movies and then this kid comes with an
iphone and makes this amazing film right
so now they're going to give the people
this power to make an animated film with
your own face in your bathroom if you
want you know I mean it's crazy so I
want to show you this app though this is
the neato app that out my son and I play
with so for those of you who can't see
this obviously most people check out the
app called neato it's spelled nit nit oh
you can get it an ipad iphone it's in
the apple store it's also on android but
it puts like this grid over your face
you can see this woman in place like
this digital grid over your face and
maps your eyes your nose and your mouth
and you talk and then you can you can
actually save these videos and send them
to your friends too so you know what's
even directly that's pretty neat oh
that's super neato man but my son he
likes to do it all the time he's like I
want to play Annie now and then you like
pick out a face and you know talk and
talk in a funny voice and stuff so it's
pretty cool so we brought that up
because we want to show the connection
of how this might be implemented I've
got imagine
central Apple TV functionality down the
road they don't have any cameras yet set
up but also really well we have cameras
on phones but specifically ipads and
macbooks yes that'd be pretty cool for
families it's it's subtle it's something
that happens it's not the sexiest
feature but it makes everything better
all right next up people wanted to talk
about iPads last weekend we didn't
really bring much iPad news well let me
tell you according to guess who who
could have possibly broken this story
again 9to5 mac the ipad pro is planned
for September ninth to debut also with
the ipad mini now I was able to confirm
this with my own sources source but you
can't just go out and throw it out if
you only have one source although
actually a lot of times I'm sure people
do that these days but the ipad pro plan
for September 9th October pre-orders
around the end of october's when it's
expected November would be the launch
the reason why this is going to be a
beast of an event we're already talking
about Apple TV where are we talk about
iphones the ipad pro there's two
products that i'm super excited about
this show ipad pro because i travel a
lot to my number one buddy yeah and then
the apple TV although the subscription
sort of subscription service is not
there yet it's super compelling yeah the
I pred pro tell what's special about it
it's going to have a keyboard right well
it's here's some of the new things that
it's going to bring it has iOS 9 which
people have seen which now gives you
like split screen functionality because
naps also there's a picture in picture
video feature yeah so let's say I'm
watching a YouTube video I pull it to
the corner I can go to a different app
surf the web that video is still playing
that audio is still playing but it's
floating around on my screen that's all
so you have that ability it's going to
have a faster processor it potentially
going to have this force touch stylus to
enable different actions and
capabilities as well as rumors have said
that there will be some sort of a linked
bluetooth keyboard functionality to
really make this as feature rich as a
surface type device I can hear all the
surface pro fans right now surfers
already had that man service already
have that yeah man they did man they did
they don't have people don't realize
Apple does this all the time like I hate
it when people say to me oh I thought
Apple thinks different I thought there's
a leader in innovation they helped to
revolutionize certain product categories
they helped to evolve certain product
categories but name me one product in
the past ten years that Apple made that
no one had it might be I don't know if
the ipod know there were mp3 players
yeah mp3 player phone tablet it's hard
watch so but they have they have the
marketing muscle they have they are also
amazing what they do they make it easy
to use they make it sexier to use look
at us we look at how many apple products
we have between us we're not bashing on
them yeah but it's just funny when
people like a man I'm like I'm excited
about new iPad pro I'm excited about an
apple TV yeah sure i'm actually going to
upgrade my iphone success if it has all
those things that the new one is going
to have yeah the camera alone i'm gonna
be like boom someone's like when you're
gonna talk about iphones we will but
just let you know right a nine processor
in this new iPad pro also just another
nugget with the ipad mini that's going
to come out this is a ipad mini retina
the design has been slimmed down
according to reports also both these
will have better stereo sound because of
how they've placed the holes when the
speaker location so that's gonna prove
which is actually big deal that's cool
the ipad audio out of a single corner on
the butt is ridiculous yeah so it's the
stupidest thing ever so finally they who
was it i think it was amazon and i think
HTC that really brought real legitimate
Oh totally yeah that's enough on phone
yeah the phone and then the Amazon fire
tablet they had actual stereos on that
sounded awesome yeah it was like Dolby
Digital II digitally fine dolby digital
fine to dog I mean I listen to my iPad
music you know I listen to music on the
iPad all the time and I always want it
to be louder you know base here and sort
of stereoscopic but you know so we have
that if you want to talk I phones
iPhones my friends d a planned event now
some new details from you know who 7000
series aluminum that is that stronger
aluminum that has been using the Apple
watch sport we know about that the big
thing here though is that it's been
confirmed according to 925 that
capacities of the phones will still be
16 64 and 128 now that makes sense from
a price point standpoint but it's kind
of surprising that you would start off
with 16 gig with a 4k video come on
recording phone yeah start at 32 at
least like I fill up my phone so fast
I'm gonna take a single video of on of
someone kicking a ball 10 seconds my
phone spilled 4k video it's like 4k
whatever gigs would like 10 how many can
someone tell us how many gigs is like 10
seconds of 4k video well if it was
really true 4k video it would be huge
any like half a half a gig yeah I don't
know what the Samsung the samsung s6 and
i believe the s5 also are yeah that's
five has a best five has 4k recording
but it's not it's 4k you can't say it's
necessarily true true true 4k but it's
still 4k can tell you how many times
have been at like a like a vent or some
like playground or something and I'm
trying to delete photos because I got to
get a picture of my kids doing something
funny or something I'm like oh I can't
take a picture right now I was I was at
the Warriors freaking championship
parade ah and I'm shooting videos of
everyone right yeah Steph Curry's
freaking float comes up in Andre
Iguodala who has always been one of my
favorite players my phone says no
storage but what happens at night even
if you delete like 20 pictures it
doesn't really delete them like yeah I
was frantically like taking panorama is
going anything panra pigs every video
possible like nieces nephews forget it
that added a beach scenes valla cuz I
hands and I hadn't synced my phone in a
while so i'd still be strategic I was
freaking out yeah i did get video clips
of them but I was like dude this is the
ones a lifetime thing yeah I'm just
learned to go into my ipod just delete
albums like right away to start deleting
entire albums and I can see space pretty
quick I'm like I can just put the ship I
go you know you've been there you know
you've been there all of you everybody's
been there so I don't even care even
have a 128 gig phone you've been there
cuz just go I'll just fill it up yeah
it's crazy you don't think about it you
don't think about it until you have to
think about it yeah anyways a pricing
will still remain the same 199 299 399
for the iphone 6s 6s plus will jump up
100 to 99 399 499 the iphone 5s 6 and 6s
are expected to stay in place but those
prices will drop accordingly kind of how
they've done it enough how they've done
it in the past so that's how it goes
cool new iPhones pricing I'm in a new
venue new venue Bill Graham said bill
graham civic auditorium which is a
bigger venue right huge venue in the
huge I think this aligns with is a
really good point you know that you
bring up in alliance with the fact that
they're gonna release every product
Under the Sun at this one it's just an
we're gonna be in this room all day it's
like okay here comes the I bad okay your
comes the Apple TV all day i'm just i'm
bringing a bedpan I think that's
important Bonnie's bringing donuts
donuts in the bedpan another to continue
with more Apple products this will not
be necessarily happening at the keynote
it might we still expect to see some
sort of speed bump to max whether it's
macbooks a report about imax bringing
the 21.5 inch that's the smaller imac we
bringing a 4k resolution sometime in
october that's a report that's coming
out I don't the report also indicates
that that might still stay broad well so
we'll see i want to see skylake
processors this is the the faster chips
in new Mac specifically macbooks but the
imac should get one too we'll just have
to wait and see 4k screen that's gonna
be a real scream I mean it like be able
to put your hands up to like a fire me
keep you warm you could put a you could
play a 4k video of a fire your hands
next to it it's a good idea and it would
be warm yeah it would be not me a warm
screen give me warm screen okay uh
before we talk about some other things
we loved what you guys did with all the
magic magic mike mouse like it was so
bad it's so badass so we wanted to in
celebration because look the force
awakens just was announced and released

last week was Jordan Richards I didn't
reach out to Jordan yet because I've
been busy but we're gonna hook him up
with a nice little itunes gift card
sweet courtesy of btz nice because
that's awesome we gotta show love we
gotta show love so Jordan if you're
watching and listening we got you okay
um let's go to our phone calls you wanna
hit our phone closer to you some phone
calls alright first call comes to us
from I'm my name is Jordan Richards from
a delicious you're Richard right there
I'm just wanting to know when Apple pay
will be coming to Australia as a main
strength payment alright thanks keep on
Apple body that's so funny or just
talking about and I am honest I didn't
realize that I didn't realize it either
okay so Jordan and everyone all my
aussie aussie aussie boy or yes you know
that good like i said all my Aussie
Aussie Aussie oi oi oi oi alright so
when Australia it's not as easy it's a
little more complicated than what's
going on here in the US and the UK
recently received Apple pay all reports
come to the fact that Apple is butting
heads with the banks of how much money
they should get based off the credit
card transactions now Apple wants 15
cents per one hundred dollars the issue
though is that the banks that are only
get about seven and a half hour eight
cents per one hundred dollars used for
transactions so first we have apple
asking for like us type numbers yes the
other factor is that Australia already
has a level of a tap and go type system
so they're not dependent on saying
Apple you're the only game in town right
you're the new thing they have their own
kind of tap and go service with some
with some products whether it's their
cards or whatnot so that's another issue
and I think that when you combine the
fact that you know apples doing that
they're they're not able to lock down
the right pricing and then it's there's
not as much urgency it doesn't make it
as compelling for them to you know say
okay we agree to your terms when they're
probably happy with what they have right
now so there you go hmm that is a tough
one man it's a quibble over fees and
charges more than anything else I do I
hope Australia that you get that because
it is awesome like I said back in 2005
used it in Japan flawlessly five not 15
5 10 years ago dude all right we're
still trying to catch up here it's about
time so we'll keep our thumbs cross for
you we really will okay next call next
call is from hey whats up its Bowie from
the east coast of Canada huge fan of the
show my question is I'm a student with a
matchbook from 07 that just died I just
got a new macbook with retina enforced
touched from the apple refurb store am I
an idiot for not waiting for the new
processor or the Intel processor also
how can i get the theme from the apple
byte as a ringtone for my iphone that
would be sick swatch my watch watch my
watch watch watch watch my watch watch
might watch you nailed it oh what's that
again what's his name Lucy hey what's up
with Chloe from the youth chloe bowie
bowie Bowie's the man that was legit
yeah uh Bowie is the man because he
could say swatch SmartWatch but he's not
the man because dude Bowie I've like
said on my show wait for the past month
don't get a laptop yet yeah now the main
advantage of you getting a laptop now
which I understand is you got it
refurbished so you probably got it for
everything he did read dogs that was
smart that is some glad he didn't buy a
new one because then I would really had
to kick your butt like that be like
horrible Apple like worst Apple possible
not even bad apple like Dom Apple I know
that was so loud sorry that scared the
crap that literally scared the crap out
of me fader was all the way up Wow okay
it's okay i didn't know I'm like I'm
like a red right now holy crap oh so
anyways I wish you waited but guess what
it's not the end of the world if you if
he just got it I think Apple has like a
14 day return policy maybe yaks even in
the refurbs I believe even the refurbs
my advice to everyone though is that if
you can't wait and you need to get a
laptop maybe something because of the
school reason or work reason you just
got to get one sometimes two thousand
seven till 2015 that's a good run that's
a good run for a lot oh yeah so you got
your money's worth hell yeah so bowie
bowie bowie bowie bowie bowie bowie
thanks for calling man uh but we will
and we appreciate your contribution of
the SWAT smartwatch contest yeah he's
the winner are you a winner he just
showed us he's like did it like like it
was so nonchalant yeah it was a good
pace alright Bowie thanks man keep
calling us keep watching we appreciate
it next up all right one more call hi
this is jacob baltazar from the los
angeles area and i was just wondering
how do you get invited to an actual
apple event like i've always wanted to
go but I've never know that's how you
get invited so let me know thanks I ok
how to get invited to an actual apple
event this is so a lot of larger outlets
that have developed influence over time
have been able to get invited a lot of
you to bloggers that have been able to
get a used to bloggers like search that
have been able to legitimate phone but
every time I like millions we're talking
like mkbhd and marques brownlee yeah
we're talking about like unbox therapy
some I think technobuffalo sometime also
it just depends right so you kind of
gotta work your way up and get on that
list now if you're someone like me you
used to be invited but because you keep
it real you no longer are invited to the
keynotes that's the truth yes I used to
go to all the WWDC s which is fine like
I'm not I'm not mad it actually feels
good to know that
I'm doing my job so that's why I don't
get invited but then this leads me to my
other point which is that we have our
live coverage yeah sep tember 9th
starting at 9am the keynote starts at
ten a.m. but here in our studio we take
your live calls we take tweets emails
everything it's like fully interactive
we talk about everything before the show
after the show we kind of recap and then
also get your opinions it's a real live
free flowing copy of people inside the
show we have a camera outside the
building it's pretty intense what we do
actually it's like super bowl coverage
yeah it's like super well except it's
like us in the small room yeah but we
deliver the goods so you can watch that
people are asking where's the phone
number that I can doubt I forgot to tell
you guys about freaking phone number to
voicemail so if we don't get any more
voicemails for next week it's my fault
here it is it's my fault phone numbers 1
800 61 62 63 8 give us a call that is
specific to the apple byte extra crunchy
ok yes when we do the live show it'll be
a different number which I want to do
that one no no I want to I don't want it
we don't confuse everybody know we don't
know my mom might call I don't want to
confuse her 1 800 616 I can't do this
too sick how do you do that obviously
they can't do it all backwards so
anyways that's the number call us leave
your voicemail we'd like to hear your
name where you're from and get your
question we like that yeah so those
calls that we just had we're perfect
call those were actually very excellent
X I like I hate it when people don't
tell us who they are and where they're
from because I like to you know it's
kind of makes it feel a little personal
yeah now I definitely know Jordan
Richards Jordan the winner joyed Magic
Mike Mouse winner Magic Mike and it's
appropriate Mike Magic Mike Jordan
Michael Jordan as I was Jordan Richards
Michael joins a man is amazing ok I
think that's gonna do for this week bro
