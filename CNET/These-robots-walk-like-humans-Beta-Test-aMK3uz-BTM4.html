the first thing that you probably
picture is something from Boston
Dynamics those robots that do backflips
and can run really fast well I'm here at
the amber lab at Caltech in California
where they're building and designing a
different type of walking robot the idea
is if you can teach them to run walk and
jump just like us you can translate that
into something that's really useful for
humans like prosthetics and exoskeletons
so I'm gonna go inside take a look at
the lab and have a play with some of the
robots
how do you teach a robot to walk like a
human is it a process obviously have a
lot of falling down trial and error
there's certainly a lot of trial and
error involved but we try to actually
minimize that and and so the the word
teach is interesting because we don't
actually do learning on the robots
themselves so the idea is we're more
teaching ourselves we try to understand
the basic mathematical principles of
locomotion right we go to the physics we
go to the dynamics and we try to sort of
prove theorems and have this
mathematical representation of
locomotion and once you have that you
can distill that into algorithms that
ultimately go on the robot so the end
goal of understanding the locomotion is
to help humans that's right that's right
and that's a big part of it so by having
this approach where we try to take this
sort of fundamental mathematical
principled viewpoint on robotic walking
is what we can take that knowledge and
translate it to and and again the idea
is every time we achieve a behavior
let's say walking or running we'd like
to put that on a prosthetic device have
a person walk or run with it and
ultimately an exoskeleton device for
example for a paraplegic somebody that
can't walk we would like to have them
get up and walk with the same kind of
algorithms that we're using on our
walking robots so that's the ultimate
process that we're shooting for before
the robots walk they have to hop this is
a one dimensional robot hopping up and
down on a track it's a collaboration
between Caltech and Disney research with
the final robot designed to live inside
a ball and bounce around
Amba is a two-dimensional robot used to
study locomotion it can go backwards
forwards and up or down we also designed
this controller for perturbation
including peaking or pushing push
recovery per se so that sounds scary
push recovery so if I literally go in
and push it unless you are really
aggressive but I doubt it you can I
challenge you to where should I try and
push it okay so the Safety's place will
be around the hip in this line so just
this part so using the bar I should
drive push it back yeah I got a strong
touch it feels really cool this feels
really calm but I'm gonna try and
[Laughter]
besides shoving the robot I also try it
also cruel I can't believe I'm gonna do
this I'm sorry robot
oh it's had a little stumble yeah but
it's fine I got me a little nervous but
really and if that's not enough I push
it with a stick
what if the robot uprising happens and
the robots watch this and they think
that I'm cruel I'm not cruel no you're
trying to make me better yeah I'm making
you better okay you're learning their
limit here we go it's a comet that's
amazing so cool sorry again why did we
do why do we try and trip a robot
because we are designing walking
controllers you have very particular
scenario in mind but in reality when you
put a robot outside there are so many
things can happen so you want to design
a controller and considering it its
robustness against some type of accident
so you can go outside in a walk outside
the overall aim is not to try and mirror
how humans walk but achieve what's
called human inspired control so they
can translate robotic walking to
prosthetics like this one called an Pro
unfortunately I can't try it on myself
because I haven't been trained but
Rachel gives me a quick overview of what
it feels like to wear so how does it
actually feel to give over control to
this and walk oh yeah it took an
adjustment to feel to learn to balance
with it and also you have to fully trust
the robot to put all of my weight on it
because there's obviously times that I
don't have my foot on the ground and I'm
only standing on the prosthesis so how
heavy is it so it's slightly more than
the weight of a human leg and so it's
around 11 or 12 pounds but it feels
heavier because we still have the weight
of our own leg it's all powered through
this lipo battery so you just hold onto
it on the back man yeah so I just put it
in my pocket and it can last for about 3
to 4 hours of continuous walking how
fast do you think that you could go with
it is there a limit or is it really just
up to you it's just up to me but the
pace I'm walking here that's about the
normal pace that I walk when I'm with it
right so you don't really want to be
doing sprints and stuff with this I know
it's yeah it's just made to do walking
on flat ground for right now and the
actual mechanism of the foot so it looks
like it's just walking fairly flat but
if you're walking up hills or stairs how
does it cope with that that's like
something for a future work is to design
the motion to specifically be for
walking up a slope or down a slope but
it's robust enough to slopes that I can
still walk with it and so obviously in
the lab it's a very controlled
environment surfaces are flat there's no
kind of weather incidents but how do you
test for things that are edge cases like
icy slippery surfaces sand that's right
and you're really pointing to exactly
one of the big problems is in a lab we
know the surface is hard we know exactly
how to walk on that but if you take and
put that robot on ice or sand it's gonna
fall it's gonna fall hard you know I
would say I joke with people and they're
worried that sort of robots are gonna
take over the world and you know
terminators coming I said just run on to
some sandy slope it's
fall on its face and you're gonna be
totally safe because we haven't really
solved that problem yet so but we've
made gains and that's really what we're
working towards right now
meet Cassie made by agility robotics
it's a robot that moves in three
dimensions and all the mass from its
motors is up top so it's carbon-fiber
legs have a full range of motion so
before we actually put anything on the
robot what we do is simulate it so we
actually will design our walking
trajectories through the same
optimization problem or suit through the
same type of methods that we do with the
amber robot and the prosthetic that you
saw earlier so we're using a lot of the
same concepts here when we're designing
the controllers so this is the walking
controller that you're gonna see on the
actual robot being simulated unlike the
other robots in the lab Cassie is
designed to go out in the real world
it's semi autonomous so Jake is using a
controller to give it nudges in certain
directions but isn't telling it where to
put its feet
cassie is doing an amazing job walking
on terrain that's got a lot of slopes
taking twigs with ease it's fantastic
and you've seen people that have just
literally stopped in their tracks
watching reacting there are kids in
prams that are wide-eyed and seeing this
amazing feat for what it is
Cathy literally stops traffic
but the real test for Cassie is getting
out on to tricky terrain like dirt and
grass or in this case briefs amazing
that's really I was like shocked it was
dance I was a good way to close it off
she did as hopeful as well as I could
have yeah just the whole purpose of it
so fantastic and to make it to here it's
like yeah you know and hey on the exam
so
well that was an amazing experience at
the amber lab I got to interact with
robots trip them over and perform
disturbance testing and it's really
fascinating to see how this is gonna
translate to eventually helping humans I
can't wait to see what happens next
thank you so much for watching the show
make sure to give it a thumbs up and
subscribe and I'll see you next time
but okay I'm into it all right what's my
terrible aim anywhere
I'm sorry but this is all for research
