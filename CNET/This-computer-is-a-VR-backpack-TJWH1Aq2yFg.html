there's just no way to look cool wearing
a virtual reality backpack and while not
exactly fashion-forward the MSI vr1 does
send out to solve a very legitimate
problem with current gen VR you're
usually tethered to a PC by a big
umbilical cable which inevitably gets
tangled underfoot and restricts free
movement so think of the VR one as a
battery powered via already desktop that
you strap onto your back inside the
plastic case is an intel core i7 cpu an
nvidia geforce 1070 graphics card and a
pair of hot swappable batteries the vive
headset plugs directly into it so
there's no long cable anchoring you to a
stationary PC it's surprisingly light on
seven pounds and not really that awkward
once you're fully suited up but getting
there can be a journey you almost need a
VR caddy to help you put the whole thing
on including the shoulder straps the
belt strap the headset the headphones
and the controllers but once you're
properly strapped in the really amazing
thing about the msi vr one is that it
actually works in games like space
pirate trainer i usually move very
consciously so as to not yank the vive
cable i had to convince myself to move
more freely I wasn't used to having this
kind of free reign in VR battery life is
about 60 to 90 minutes but people
usually don't use VR for more than maybe
20 or 30 minutes at a time still this
may all be a moot point as useful as a
VR backpack is we're expecting several
wireless transmitter add-ons for VR
later in 2017 which will cut the headset
cord once and for all as tempting as a
VR backpack is I'd probably wait to try
one of those before turning yourself
into a walking human-computer hybrid
