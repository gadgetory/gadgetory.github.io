had seen it but nothing like this
this is garden space it's big it has a
rotating head with cameras and sensors
and it attaches to a hose and squirts
water think of it like a sentry for your
garden attach your own hose to arm it
and it keeps itself alert with its solar
panel it uses its bird's-eye view of
your plants to monitor their health and
instead of getting down in the dirt and
measuring soil moisture like the other
sensors we tested garden space uses an
infrared cam and remote temperature
sensors to detect the water stress level
of your plants when your plants need a
little attention garden space can turn
aim and give it a drink better yet if
you're growing food garden space has
motion sensors so if a critter comes
looking for a snack garden space can go
on the offensive and deter the pests
with a quick dose now garden space is
still a prototype so some of this
functionality is still being developed
when it's done it should also be able to
send you alerts if it senses other
health problems with your plants so you
can intervene by adding fertilizer or do
some more intensive care the app will
give you specific recommendations based
on what you're growing and you can also
get recommendations on what to grow a
pests squirting plant watering sensor
complete with a thorough database of
knowledge certainly sounds cool garden
space is launching a crowdfunding
campaign today we'll look forward to
testing the final product once it's
ready</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
