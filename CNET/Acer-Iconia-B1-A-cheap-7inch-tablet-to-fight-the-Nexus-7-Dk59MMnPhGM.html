2013 I'm taking a look at the Acer
Iconia b1 this is an extremely cheap
Android tablet to compete with the life
of the Google Nexus 7 so let's take a
look so this is a 7-inch tablets got a
7-inch display with a 102 4 by 768 pixel
resolution it's not the brightest
clearest screen I've ever seen but do
bear in mind that this is a very cheap
device and it looks pretty good
powering it is a 1.2 gigahertz dual-core
chip now that's not as powerful as the
quad core affair that you will find in
Google's 7-inch tablet but it feels
responsive enough I think for web
browsing things like email this would
probably be fast enough there's 8
gigabytes of on-board storage if that's
not enough capacity for you then you can
beef it up using a microSD card
it weighs 380 grams it certainly feels
very portable if I turn it on its side
you can see it's quite slim it does only
come in this blue color though so you
better make sure you like blue before
you buy it
because it is quite blue on the software
side we're dealing with Android 4.1
jelly bean that's not quite the latest
greatest version that you'd find on the
Nexus 7 for example but it is a very
rural version of Android so there's not
an awful lot of Acer meddling going on
here AC tells me that really the only
thing it's done is to tinker a little
bit with some notification menus all
good so far but now for the bad news
this tablet isn't coming out in the u.s.
at the moment it's going to be coming
out in Europe and Latin America
costing 99 pounds or 119 euros that
equates to roughly a hundred and sixty
dollars but as I say it's not coming to
the States yet
fingers crossed AC changed its mind on
that one so first impressions are that
it's not quite as slick as the Nexus 7
but then it is a bit cheaper so that's
exactly the trade-off you're getting I'm
really really pleased though that we're
seeing more and more cheap decent
Android tablets flooding the market it
can only be a good thing
I'm the Westway for CNET and this is the
Acer Iconia b1
