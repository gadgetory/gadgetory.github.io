CES 2012 and we're taking a look at the
samsung galaxy note now this device is
very interesting it's it's somewhere in
between a tablet and smartphone it has a
large 5.3 inch screen it uses super
amoled plus technology has a resolution
of 1280 by 800 so that is an HD
resolution and as you can tell it has a
stylus that you interact with a device
like this you can just scroll through
the menus using the tip here you can
also you know tap and hold to take
screenshots of anything you're looking
at on the device you can also mark up
and draw on anything that you capture
and send it to people say you want to
circle a web page or something like that
and make notes you can do that it also
transcribes your handwriting into text
which is something that is pretty useful
so it also is on AT&amp;amp;T LTE 4G network to
give fast data speeds also on the
Samsung Galaxy Note we have a
front-facing 2-megapixel camera and on
the back we have a 8 megapixel main
camera with LED flash just like the
samsung galaxy s2 this is a very
interesting device and it's you know as
it sits somewhere in between a
smartphone and a tablet we're not sure
exactly you know if customers will want
to give up their tablet for this or give
up their smartphone but it does have a
lot of really interesting usability
features and it's something that we
certainly want to take a look at once we
get a product for review check back soon
