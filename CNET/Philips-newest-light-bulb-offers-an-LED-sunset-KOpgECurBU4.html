I'm here at the Philips warm glow LED
this is a new bulb from Philips it's
coming to Home Depot in March and it
offers a unique spin on dimming what
happens is as you dial the light down
the color temperature goes down to so as
I go down to this nice low level it's
actually going from 2700 K down to about
1900 K so a very reddish orange hue now
it's a slight difference from what
you'll see if you're looking at
something like the Philips Slim style
LED or the existing Philips 60 watt
equivalent bulbs for my initial
impressions that's a pretty slight
difference compared to other LEDs that
dim but still kind of interesting now
moving right on to the basic bulb specs
the 60 watt replacement of the warm glow
that you see here it is very nice
putting out about eight hundred and
thirty lumens from a power draw of 9.5
watts there's also a 40 watt replacement
version that sells for a dollar less and
uses a power draw of six and a half
watts the other interesting thing about
this light is that it's upping the
warrantee previous philips bulbs have
had five year warranties three year
warranties but this one has a 10 year
warranty and that's the same as Cree
that's a very good warranty obviously
for ten bucks and we'll have our full
review up in a couple of weeks after
we've had some time to play with the
bulb to let you know how they stack up
thanks for watching for seanut
appliances I'm Rui Christy you can check
