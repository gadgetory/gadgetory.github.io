repaper now if you love drawing or
taking notes this thing is gonna be
pretty cool for you talking about using
a pencil any pencil you want any paper
you want as long as this is underneath
it it'll track what you're doing then it
goes into a nap or you could use it with
things like Photoshop or other desktop
software I'm going to draw something
that there's an active area on the slate
just slide in a piece of paper here and
the pencil has a magnetic ring this
could be put on any writing tool you
want as you draw the slate itself is
tracking the magnet placement so I'm
gonna draw a face it's actually tracked
everything I did and you can see the
drawing on an app over here the slate is
pressure sensitive so if you want you
could really really get in there and the
lens will get darker it's very very
natural if you talked before on paper
this is gonna feel exactly the same it
also works with thicker papers this is a
postcard I can draw on this too since
it's using a magnet it can actually see
what I'm doing
so the slate itself uses Bluetooth to
attach to an iOS device or Android or a
desktop if you want and what's kind of
neat is it as I stand alone mode so if
you want you can take the slate outside
draw outside it'll store the image and
then when you come back to your iOS or
Android device you can sync it back up
it's actually quite a brilliant idea cuz
who wants to sit inside sometimes this
place got a really cool function when it
comes to the app as well so if I want to
see how I drew this I can hit play it's
gonna replay my drawing as it was going
on you can see where I make a mistake
right here that's a mistake but it's
here on the slate there are two buttons
that will be customizable in the future
and allow you to do things like maybe
switch to pen maybe save at different
layers that kind of thing in size and
shape the slate is about the size of an
iPad it's got a nice sturdiness to it so
if I want to draw I don't need to get
like something to lean on I can actually
just draw on this so for pricing
availability this is gonna be around to
$200 when it launches that's the aim
anyway it's coming out in September I'm
gonna finish drawing Superman and
that goes
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
