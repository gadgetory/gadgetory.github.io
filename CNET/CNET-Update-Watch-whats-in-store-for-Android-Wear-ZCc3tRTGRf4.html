I'm Bridget Carey and this is your scene
that update google gave the world a
sneak peek at the future of
android-powered smartwatches it unveiled
Android wear which is a special version
of the Android operating system that
will work on the small screen of a
SmartWatch and it's very much like the
system that powers the Google glass
headset you can glance at quick updates
and notifications from google now but
also use voice commands okay
several company said they'll have
hardware to work with this including LG
HTC samsung and motorola in fact
Motorola took it a step further and
released images of its upcoming android
wear SmartWatch the Moto 360 it'll have
a round screen and it'll be sold in a
variety of styles globally by summer of
2014 so it looks like this will be the
year the SmartWatch may really take off
instead of burying our faces in a phone
screen we can look forward to a world
where we can't stop staring at our
wrists it's time to say adieu to the
ipad 2 Apple is no longer selling the
ipad 2 and replaced it with a fourth
generation version of the ipad with the
better Retina display this replacement
model keeps the iPad tues price tag of
four hundred dollars for a Wi-Fi only
model you'll have to dish out an extra
one hundred and thirty dollars for one
with a cellular connection Apple really
should have killed off the ipad too much
earlier that model came out in March or
2011 and it was a bit strange that Apple
kept selling it last year as such a high
price the ipad mini cost the same and it
was a better product well the ipad 2 was
the last ipad to have the 30-pin
connector port now there's only one
apple product left with the 30 pin
connector and that's the iphone 4s all
the other products have moved on to the
smaller Lightning port if you're
deciding between the two full-size iPads
the only difference with the more
expensive ipad air is that it's a little
thinner it's a little lighter and it
also has a faster processor apple also
began selling a less expensive version
of the iphone 5c to china europe and
australia it has half the storage or the
previous model just eight gigs but this
cheaper version of the colorful phone is
not for sale in the US gamestop will
have some serious competition next week
from walmart starting march 26th walmart
will let customers sell their used video
games in exchange for credit to buy
anything at walmart or sams club and
then walmart will start selling those
pre-owned games this summer that's your
tech news update you can find more
details at cnet com / update and be sure
to follow along for the latest on
Twitter from our studios in New York I'm
