sky dog routers from power cloud system
now this is a very special router
because it's come by new obsolete
hardware and state-of-the-art firmware
and then ask you to pay a lot for it so
before you do make sure what you need
more the real good performance or the
level control that the firmware gives
you the less fighter first up the real
deal now this is a true dual band Wi-Fi
router it support the dual stream setup
of the 802 point 11 and standard and
that means it give you the top speed of
300 megabits per second on each of the
two Wi-Fi band at the same time on the
front here as you can see that a ray of
light to show the stars of the router
it's also the WPS button but it doesn't
do anything it's just a placeholder
there's more place order on the back
here which is the USB port will do
anything either at least for now the
routers do have a four gigabit lan port
and 11 port and it is look mountable and
that's about it so specialized it is
probably the least impressive i've seen
in a very long time and in my testing is
performed it was dismal compared with
recent new routers and the rain was not
very long either basically he has
nothing of note now that brings us to
the part where the router is exciting is
firmware by far is the most advanced i
have seen now the rubber come with a
cloud connected web interface it allows
you to manage your home network remotely
from anywhere the one by going into
sky.com and login with a free account
now the vendor assisted we motor home
management is not new but park our
system did a very good job with skydog
here as you can see has a very robust
web interface that offer a lot of tool
for monitoring and reporting and I mean
a lot it will take me hours to actually
talk about all of them so take my word
for it no Dorado has a three virtual
network own zone including home
work and guest you can actually control
the internet bandwidth for each of the
zone but it cannot specify what Wi-Fi
ban ozone works on my knee for ozone
work on both of the 2.4 gigahertz and
foggy hood bands and the same time now
the second very impressive feature of
the railroad is the web filtering
feature you can define the blocking
mechanism from basic to extreme with
basic meaning that you can access almost
everything and extra meaning that you
can access anything at all you can even
create your own level parking by using
the supporting character categories
there are hundreds of them from adult
content to use distraction to social
media the very cool thing is that with
one client or user you can actually
apply one level parking editor tab and a
different level blocking at another time
basically the router offers you all the
ways you can think of in terms of
filtering stuff from the internet now
that's all good but the effectiveness
Harbor depends a lot on how the web
sites are properly categorized you know
why the sky dog is very exciting I find
a little bit too slow and too limited
into the hardware capability to justify
the current price up some one hundred
fifty dollars nevermind the fact in cost
you another 30 bucks a year after three
years if you want to continue to use the
cool feature about which are the only
reason why you buy in the first place
now from all the sky i'll check out my
full review SATCOM one thing though if
you look at this sky down here to block
your children from pornography on the
internet or good luck for one in my
testing even as the high-field ring
setting and could still you google to
shoot and display all tied up images but
the main reason why is not going to work
because what you're watching right now
is considered porn by men and they just
can't have it out of it that because I'm
don't know and this has been the first
look at the sky dark hour from pub</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
