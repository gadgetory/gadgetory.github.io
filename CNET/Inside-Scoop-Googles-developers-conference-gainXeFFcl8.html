Francisco as it rolled out a flurry of
products and even included some extreme
keynoting from its co-founder sergey
brin i'm dan farber and i'm joined by
cnet senior correspondent stephen
shankland what was the atmosphere there
it seemed like was really crazy with all
the sky divers and repellers on the
Moscone Center it was a big show I've
been to a lot of google shows i've been
dude a lot of keynotes this one had over
the top drama there were people you know
worried are these skydivers going to die
you know you don't get that kind of
emotional engagement at most shows you
don't get it at an apple show that's for
sure you don't get it at a Microsoft
show so it had a very different flavor
it was you know fun in a lot of ways
people were really really enthusiastic
but were they enthusiastic about more
than the skydiving yeah yeah you know
fundamentally in order to have a good
trade show you have to have news you
have to have solid information that
people are interested in finding out
about and Google had that in spades we
had jelly bean which is Android 4.1 a
lot of new features I kind of felt like
God how does it compare to Apple's iOS
at this point it's a more it's it's
definitely you know steadily a more
reasonable competitor to iOS I think iOS
is still the market leader in a lot of
ways but Google is pushing ahead I think
for example the notifications that are
now much more active in Android that was
an advantage that Android had over iOS
before their now even more active the
Google now feature I think it's actually
perhaps one of the most interesting one
that plugs into your calendar into your
location into you know everything that
you do and it feeds you information that
it thinks you might need and that's a
very googley way of looking at what a
mobile phone can do for you so you know
the real features that are that are
coming out to people now now it seems
that the big difference this year is
that that Google is turning into more of
a hardware company they introduce the
nexus 7 which is a 7-inch tablet they
introduced the Nexus Q which is an
entertainment center device is this more
of what you will we should expect to see
from google in the future I it's not
clear exactly which way they're going to
go to me you know I think they're still
you know trying to navigate some very
choppy waters about whether they are the
you know Android hardware supplier of
choice
whether they're just one of many clearly
if you're an Android hardware company
you have to be really concerned when
Google is competing directly with you so
that you know that's going to be a big
tension in the future but they're not
afraid to do at Google I think
fundamentally is much more about looking
at the world and seeing where can
technology disrupt things where can we
make a difference and if they have to
make hardware to do it so be it that's
where for example project glass comes in
that was a very interest idolos let's
talk about project glass these are the
glasses that you can navigate the world
with and and I think that that's where
Sergey Brin got on stage and talked
about the glasses and said that they
would be available to consumers in 2014
but is this something consumers would
really want no so here's what it is so
today they're you know computerized
glasses they have a you know processor
they're basically a lot of repurposed
mobile phone technology it's got a
gyroscopic sensor you move your head
around you flick your head up to turn it
on it's got a little tiny screen its
hovers right above your eye tells you
notifications plays video things like
that so they're trying to gradually you
know use these to introduce more
information into your life which is what
google loves to do and it's got a nice
little camera so you can take pictures
which is there you know but will do so
will they sell no millions and millions
and do not when T or even 2020 so next
year they're going to sell them to
developers for 1,500 bucks I think that
you know they're only aiming at a very
enthusiast kind of an audience this is
nerd central and i do not think this is
going to be something that most people
are going to really actively want for a
while now it could be you know that five
years from now 10 years from now it's
just like you know a bluetooth headset
on steroids and everybody just thinks
it's the most normal thing and that's
obviously Google's vision you know to
sell this but I think a lot of people
look look at this and say boy would i
look like a dork and you know with this
this would just interfere with my life
do I want more electronic screens
constantly telling me what's going on a
little earpiece speaking to me when I
meet somebody you know I think some
technology people will be very
enthusiastic about it I think it's going
to take a lot more work to win over
mainstream consumers it could be it
might be a few decades but it looks like
eventually Google is going to have its
way what what exactly is google now it
seems to me that if you look at all the
places they are in for example they just
started to compete with Amazon
with a new cloud service for developers
are they the new Microsoft well I mean
Microsoft was willing to compete with a
lot of different companies they got
rained in slapped down a lot in the
1990s with the antitrust action that
kind of you know was I think was
chilling to Microsoft and Google has
been slapped down by some antitrust
monopoly kinds of concerns but it seems
to me to be not daunted or deterred at
all by those it's got a very broad
ambition to do lots of things it used to
be just a search engine it looks to me
right now that they just really have no
limits on what they want to do so I
think that they are willing to compete
with compete with anybody and everybody
amazon you mentioned they now have you
know this cloud computing service that
competes much more directly with
Amazon's which is very popular and on
the complete other side of the spectrum
they also significantly improved google
play if you want to buy movies or if you
want to rent you know full season of
some TV show and subscribe to magazines
that's straight down what amazon is
trying to do and of course what Apple
does with iTunes so yes Google is very
willing to compete with anybody and
everybody including its own partners and
they just bought Motorola exactly thus
competing with their partner you know
competing with partners like Samsung and
other Android people well thanks Steven
yes thank you I've been talking to
stephen shankland i'm dan farber thanks
