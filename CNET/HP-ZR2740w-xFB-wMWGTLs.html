I'm gonna take you for a ride on the
train that is the HP Zr 27:40 W the HP
packs about 3.3 million pixels into its
27-inch screen which makes high-end PC
games look incredible
it also has back tilt pivot screen
height adjustment and swivel in addition
there's five USB ports including one
upstream port and it costs only $700
which makes it the cheapest way to get
an extreme definition or XD monitor onto
your desktop
unfortunately there's no included
on-screen display or OSD this limits
picture customizations to changing the
brightness only you do get a single DVI
and one DisplayPort for video
connections but that's all you get
it's kind of hard to say you're
disappointed with a monitor that packs
as many pixels into a screen as XD
monitors do that said some people need
more than just 2 connection options I'm
not really one of those people but I
still like to have the option to use
HDMI and yeah I know that's what
adapters are for but I'd rather avoid
that hassle also only being able to
adjust the brightness that's gonna be a
deal breaker for some people having said
all that there's a reason other XD
monitors cost quite a bit more than $700
and expecting to have the features the
HP is missing at that price just as not
realistic to put it simply the HP cost
as low as $700 because of its missing
features and at that price it's the most
affordable XD monitor out there however
if you can't live with the limitations
of brightness only customizations both
the Samsung sync master s27
a 850 D and the dell ultrasharp you 2711
offer similar performance with many more
options though with higher prices once
again I'm Eric Franklin and this has
been the HP Zr 2740</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
