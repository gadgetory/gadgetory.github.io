all right hello everyone and welcome
back to the cnet stage in the South Hall
the Las Vegas Convention Center and live
coverage of CES 2014 I'm Donald Bell
editor with cnet and here we are in the
next 15 minutes focusing on drones
joining me today is Henry sagoo chairman
and chief executive officer of parrot
and Jason sure beanie vice president of
sales and marketing at 3d robotics
welcome thanks for joining us today I
have to say right off the bat out of
anything I've ever see at CES the thing
that draws everyone's attention
immediately turns everyone into children
are drones I want to know what you think
is going on there because there's
something about drones even more than
any other kind of RC aerial vehicle that
just is mesmerizing the people Henry
what do you think the magic is here I
think the magic is flying and flying is
like a dream and we make flying so easy
that a kid of eight years I can take it
and in a minute in order to fly so it's
something that is unbelievable and the
technology make it to ya and then John
was what's been your experience about
what the appeal is coming for people
coming to 3d robotics for the drama it's
just being able to get a new perspective
on all the regular stuff that you've
been doing so you know water skiing or
snowboarding or whatever you're able to
get a whole new perspective on what
you're doing from the air and then
what's I think I my assumption is both
of you are coming to this from different
perspectives what's been for you Henry
the from Perry the first time I heard
parrot it was through bluetooth
headphones headset bluetooth speakers
and then suddenly drones popped up and
it didn't you know no one was
complaining because there was a lot
there a lot of fun but what was the the
journey for you getting towards this as
a product so we do
and technology around the cell phone we
do products with bluetooth or under cell
phone and one day like seven years ago
the company was going and say okay now I
can do what I limit and I've seen all
those components that you have on a cell
phone the cameras as a accelerometers
and I said with this with it's so cheap
now I can make toys so I start to to
make toys I make a first one was a car
with Bluetooth and camera and I give to
my son and the prototype and I did not
see in his eyes that you know it was
something I say okay I have to do more
so I I look for something flying and I
found we have to do an airy cop there
because in the room in your home you
cannot fly with a plane sure so this is
all we get into into drones and then it
took us four years to make the first one
for consumers and then from there we get
more ideas and more technology and now
we developed one or so for professionals
and that sounds like a lot of fun I
think you will really parrot the
ar.drone I think with one of the first
ones I saw here at CES and the kind of
first kind of commercial commercially
available yes I think for the iphone you
know to make it super simple you know
really like a nap you know it's not not
more difficult than enough you have a
button take off and take off so this is
what we we like you know on the
technology of today so you can hide the
sings very complex into intuitive things
and now John you're coming from another
perspective here I know it a lot of the
3d robotics rigs are meant for more of a
professional user what what got
everything started off what's the
inspiration behind we started it's very
similar so in 2009 we started off making
auto pilots that flew primarily
fixed-wing airplanes and then started
moving in
new technologies that were able to
leverage from the cell phone revolution
and the accelerometers and gyroscopes
and barometers and GPS and started
moving the the code that we use into
controlling multirotors for four motors
six motors 8 motors 12 motors and and
that's really been the progression is
starting off you know very simple
infrared based thermopiles that
controlled the aircraft's and moving
into these more complex MEMS sensors and
and you know the end goal is ease of use
and Henry and parrot have done a great
job at that and we aspire to be as easy
to use as they are it's into it's it's
easy to get that lost in like a lot of
what we're talking we actually just got
out of a panel discussion on sensors
it's easy to look at these as toys and
not realize how much of this technology
is reliant on sensors for the
stabilization for everything tell me
about your latest product what's going
on that makes this the thing that you
guys are showing off this year so this
is iris it's our first kind of foray
into the consumer drone market we have
typically been a little bit more in
industrial design style where we're
using more aluminum pieces and cut
carbon fiber pieces and things like that
but this is our first foray into you
know injection molded consumer-facing
products and along with this we've also
upgraded our auto pilots to a 32-bit
platform
and 32 get hardware and still leveraging
the experience that we've had over the
last four years with our code so we've
actually created a hardware abstraction
layer to take our existing stable code
and poured it over to the 32-bit
hardware platform but this is this is
for someone who's not fooling around
they want it they really want to have a
product that's going to get up and take
some you know controllable aerial shots
is there's the brushless gimbal down
here moving the camera once it's in the
air this thing ready to fly is about
eight hundred dollars and so you know I
would say you know any sports enthusiast
or somebody who really enjoys taking
pictures from the air it's very
accessible and you know it obviously
goes up from there but you know it'll
also go down from there eventually as
well so I'm not Henry you've got some
you know very high in products too but
the one that we're most excited about
seeing at CES this year is the smallest
quadcopter we seen from her tell us
about what you've got so what we show
here at the at the CES what we introduce
is the mini drone so it's really a drone
for indoor and for the phone so this
drone roll it but it were also on the
ceiling it hold on the walls and also it
fly so it's really something that we do
a power know there are lights
yeah my kids all uh I'm sure and this
kind of gets back to I what sounds like
your original inspiration of trying to
find something fun for your kid as well
to this is actually it seems like the
top of my list of my five year olds you
know I think to do things for the kid is
difficult you know it's a challenge
don't believe that we do this because we
believe it's easy you know we do it
because we believe it's very difficult
today the kids are most of the
experience they have of playing is video
games of course video games are
beautiful you know they are very
aesthetic and they show the world a kind
of a world of today but I want to do
something that for the kid it is as
sophisticated as video games but on the
real world right so this is why we get
those idea of the schematics for key to
have fun with the technology of today on
a certain way you learn for example ah
drones everything is repairable so you
can find any part and we put tutorial
and videos on the internet so any key
which is a 10 years old can fix the
ground chandrapur chandrakala and it's a
part of the game and so that gets to
another question I had about the hurdles
for developing this prob of these are
you know some products I've had years of
development going into variations and
other products if you guys have on your
belt what are the what are the struggles
that have happened what do you see in
drones that is kind of the biggest
struggle against the category growing
more is it the perception like even the
word drone kind of sounds like a loaded
word is it safety concerns I mean I see
like you're saying like building
something for a child is a lot different
process than building something that's
going to get up near and have a lot of
power what drugs are for us there's a
safety is very important we pass all the
walls of a toy so it's a
it's it's a legally otay so and but for
us you know what is the biggest
difficulty is the technology is going so
fast so it's a very interesting but it's
like making self you know I don't do
suffered I imagine you know to stay on
the on the self and to hide from the
wave to the beaches not easy you know so
the technology is going fast new
techniques are coming every year right
so to to get the good product that's a
good time using the latest technology
for me is a challenge I can imagine too
quickly with the competition now
everyone come in coming out of the
product at a different point maybe
people to pick up on a different way to
the technology now the category also is
more popular and I don't think people
outside by a drone you know like they
are not afraid by robots and I think
they like them now the customers are
different for your products you know
this is the this is you're saying this
is your consumer product but this is
still a relatively expensive product
this is for someone who describe your
customer I guess you know like i
mentioned earlier you know we're really
targeting kind of those consumer action
oriented markets of sports photography
and
and taking aerial images from from this
consumer perspective you know we have a
ton of other application viable
applications like you know mining
construction agriculture all of these
are things that we're moving into with
other platforms but for iris here in
particular we're really looking at those
you know action sports photography kind
of markets now I'm assuming both of you
have heard about Jeff bezos's claim
about him wanted to have a fleet of
drones for product delivery how much are
you buying that as a legitimate
proposition for for either he or even a
smaller business I might want to have a
fleet of drones to deliver products but
you know when you have a new techniques
people don't believe so when you say
maybe tomorrow we'll deliver drugs by
drones and so people find it's crazy but
at the end everything
is done you know so the question is I
don't know when but for sure for
something like a drug you have a pain
you want the thing why not you know so
it will I have today the drones the
usage professional is to collect data
collect data for for my knee for
agriculture so it's making photography
mainly making photography and then
process the photography for different
applications this is the application
today for the drone and there is a lot
to do it's super useful we have a big
jobs and 3d robotics was also in
agriculture because if you can get
pictures of your field and every month
you see how it go how much you have to
put chemicals you can put less chemicals
you can put the chemicals at the right
place you can put less water or you can
so for article to the drones should be a
very ecological progress for agriculture
so this is a target for the next year
for the company while in professional
goals I what do you think about the
basis vision of delivery I think he's a
little ahead of his time at this point
in time but it's Henry's right we are
going to get there I think there are
certain ways to create you know
easements and leverage existing space
and cities that we can do this in a safe
and reliable way I think it's just going
to be a few more years before we're
really able to scale it because you
would also have to make a quadcopter
that is inexpensive enough to sacrifice
correct I mean I just my mind goes
immediately the people trying to shoot
them out of the sky you know got with a
packager we will definitely have
disposable drones to where it's it
doesn't you send a hundred out to go do
a job and 80 come back it's not that big
of a deal right now that also gets the
point of look legal issues lawsuits the
idea i mean with any new technology
people are afraid i also i think
legitimately I would be concerned about
you know amazon drone falling out of the
sky and you know hitting me in the head
in the head
I know a lot of people are probably
scared about Jones because of issues
around getting hurt is that unfounded
how dangerous are these things at like a
commercial scale version of this I mean
we you know we always stay under 400
feet within line-of-sight and away from
people and objects I wouldn't want this
this guy falling on my head either but I
think from the commercials perspective
that we were touching on earlier is that
it's it's a matter of creating safe
zones for these things to travel in and
and you know improving the safety and
reliability of the hardware all right
and then overall in terms of the formula
for the designs that both of these I
feel like the quadcopter is in a mature
state I mean I've seen the hex copters
and the other you know more rotors more
lift better cameras but what's the
formula for the whole thing that you
guys are honing in on year after year is
it is it making a lighter is it the
battery is it the the range to describe
to me it's not just one specific thing
what the the laundry list of things are
that kind of get dialed in it's like an
insect you know you have a small teeny
bugs you have a large huge bugs like
like planes also so you don't have a
drone for for everything the the quad
walk up there is certainly the formula
the most Madonna because it's very
hottest and it's easy to manufacture you
don't have mechanical parts no so the
quadrocopter which is a very old idea of
the quadcopter is the oldest idea of the
ricotta it's come from the nineteen ten
or 1912 where they did the first public
up there so the quadcopter photo/lee
cocktail is is very good but if you need
to make a lot of pictures and to go into
large fields you need to to have wings
so but one is the nice thing of it you
know it's like the aviation in nineteen
twenty or nineteen ten you know
everything is to do you know for example
at the hot we like to make wheels and
flying because we think it's more funny
but also it has more usage for example
for for delivery sometime you have old
you cannot go on the old and sometimes
you cannot you you will fly off I don't
know you know so jealous it's really an
open field for imagination and then John
what are the things that you're dialing
and the most on kind of week to week is
it is it getting a lighter is it new
materials the processor yeah sensors I
mean I would say all of the above I mean
we you know we've recently moved to this
32-bit autopilot and you know we call it
a universal autopilot because it is with
one piece of hardware you are able to
control multiple pieces multiple
configurations of hardware I can control
a tricopter a quadcopter a hexacopter an
octocopter a rover a fixed-wing airplane
so it really does depend on the
application that you're looking for as
to what platform you would choose we
feel we have an advantage in that you
know our Hardware has enough headroom
and has the code that backs it that's
able to allow it to operate multiple
vehicles so it's honestly it really is
all of the above if you're talking
agriculture you're typically talking for
larger areas fixed-wing airplanes for
smaller areas you can cover them with
things like hexes and things like that
but it really depends on the application
you're talking about as to what you want
to what you want to maximize on your on
the hardware today's and technologies
cooler you know maybe drones will be
printed you know because the clinics you
do the autopilot for everything so maybe
you will choose what you do and you will
print your voice this does look like 3d
printed material on my right is those
are three different a class I can
imagine getting pretty crazy with people
sounds like a lot of fun a lot of work a
fun work to be done in making these more
interesting year after year thank you
guys for both joining me today and
talking about the magic of drones and
quad copters all right we look forward
to seeing more projects from these guys
but we'll be back live at the top of the
with CES in depth so stay tuned to see
us live coverage of CES 2014
