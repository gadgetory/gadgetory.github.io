this is the M 840 a beautifully crafted
Kolkata dollar headphones from a new new
york-based company called master and
dynamic is forged from aluminium
stainless steel and real lambskin
leather and its sound is competitive
with that of comparable priced models
from established brands like AKG bear
dynamic Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins and Sennheiser
the MH 40 is a closed back over the ear
design with 45 millimeter drivers and a
32 ohm rated impedance weighing 12 point
7 ounces or 360 grams it's definitely
heavier than most over ear headphones
the upside is the MH 40 s build quality
feels super solid and the supple leather
adds a sensual side to the design the
headphone comes in a few different color
options beyond the tan and silver
version you see here terms of
accessories you get a simple canvas
carrying bag in a small case for the two
included cables a one point two five
meter one with a remote and mic for iOS
devices and a 2 meter plain cable
this is a passive headphone and the
noise isolation is decent and we liked
how the right ear cup has a metal mute
button that indeed mutes the sound when
you press it the headband isn't hinged
but the ear cups do fold flat for
storage that's worth noting that the
warranty coverage is two years or double
what most headphone brands offer
performance wise the MH 40s and is
highly detailed yet never harsh and the
bass is deep without any boom or bloat
it's not quite as strong in the
mid-range vocals could be a little
richer but overall this is an excellent
sounding headphone that stacks up well
against other audiophile headphones in
the 300 to 400 Ava car noise and that's
the master and dynamic MH 40 thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
