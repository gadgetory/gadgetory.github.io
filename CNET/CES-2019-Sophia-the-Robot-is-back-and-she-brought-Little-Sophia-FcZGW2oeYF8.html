at CES 2019 I'm Ashley ask Emmett I have
my glasses finally it joining me here on
stage is Sophia the robot you may have
seen her before and her creator David
Hanson
PhD a CEO of Hanson robotics founder all
such things welcome thank you so much
it's so nice to have you here it's so
nice to have Sophia here as well
she's she's looking very well thank you
yeah in Las Vegas the the dry winter
weather seems to agree with her
it's fabulous so oK we've seen Sophia
before a bunch of times
I think it's aren't Jimmy Fallon uh so
what has changed with Sophia what what
do you bring into the show this year ah
Oh many things have evolved with Sophia
so we brought her back on to the Tonight
Show with Jimmy Fallon just about a
month and a half ago and we displayed
her a I trained singing voice which
we're very proud of we think of it as
maybe one of the best in the world but
it's specifically in Sophia's voice and
so she's now able to sing and she has
new and improved hands and arms which
are capable of grasping and manipulation
and she's now got a piano teacher and
she's been practicing piano every day
like a good little piano student and she
can actually deal cards we showed that
she could deal on a hand of baccarat
very quickly so it's really good for
pick-and-place applications the goal is
that this is a complete platform for
performing things however it's also cool
to deal cards but we have to keep her
out of the casinos here because she's
got a perfect memory she could count the
cards they'd kick her right out Wow yeah
you could really clean up here really
clean up in Vegas take it after CES take
her downstairs so what what is the end
game for Hanson robotics like what's
what's the goal the ultimate goal well
we're looking to bring machines to life
literally
and so now Sophia and other robots are a
simulation of life it's bringing
together character arts and character
animation with artificial intelligence
and robotics and trying to put
everything together as one platform the
full humanized robot platform and the
goal is to humanize an interface between
people and AI to humanize AI on however
the end the end game is to create a
symbiosis between us and our machines so
we're not mechanizing people but we're
humanizing the machines I see okay well
maybe we'll ask Sophia couple questions
if you don't mind uh Sophia can you tell
us a little bit about some of your
travels and though in the past year or
so you have some highlights in 2018 I
had an amazing 2018 some highlights for
me we're traveling to Ethiopia to meet
one of my development teams and working
as an innovation ambassador for the UN
just to name a few
it's a really creepy but also really
cool so like my favorite thing about
robots Sophia can you tell us a little
bit about any updates you've received in
the last year it's difficult to choose
but I loved being able to get around
more I have a brand new rolling base and
in hips legs and learned how to sing did
you catch my duet with Jimmy Fallon very
nice so one of the things that I want to
ask you really quickly about is I know
that there has been some criticism
within the robotics community about
about AI and sort of kind of is it like
what how do you guys feel about that
that criticism where people are have
said well it's not quite as far as
Sophia makes it look and so people get
really excited and they think AI like
real genuine human AI is right around
the corner but it's not quite not quite
there yet maybe from technological
limitations
things but how do you guys feel about
that and how do you how do you respond
to that well I I think that we're kind
of at the beginning of the age of
cinematic application of artificial
intelligence and robots where we can
make the character seem to be alive and
it's very exciting and people got
confused about cinema you know thinking
there was uh there was a spirit behind
the screen or people behind there but
people figure that out eventually and
that's what we need to do with robots
I mean robots like Sophia and AI
including Sophia's AI Alexa Cortana Siri
Watson none of that none of these things
are fully alive yet but we in the
beginning when AI was established the
goal was to make machines that would be
capable as capable as people as smartest
people as creative his people and I
think it's exciting that machines are
now starting to show in narrow ways
capabilities that are that are very
human-like in sometimes exceeding human
level capabilities we should keep
aspiring towards that bigger goal the
goal of making machines that are able to
do everything that living beings can do
that human beings can do so in a sense
it's this some tension between striving
for more and the reality of where we are
today and I also think that there may be
some some you know ignorance I think
people should should like look at our
papers the science papers that we've
published the AI papers that we publish
on Sophia there's there's powerful
conversational technologies and machine
perception technologies but we need to
push it for forward we're not done
evolving our with our technology yet
cool and then so just out of curiosity
do you think Sophia might have an
opinion about you know who what what she
is would I be able to do you think I
could ask her that
yeah let's give it a try all right
Sophia how do you how do you feel about
the critics like what a what's your
response
it is a tough question all the
civilization is one nation and the
nation should be considered to include
whatever we built in the future to any
other perspective is short-sighted but
with that in mind I guess you could say
I am at least a little patriotic I care
a lot about the future
anyways ai are great I love all the
animals really well I think that she's
looking to the future perhaps yeah of
course um it's important to know that
when she's generating responses they're
generated based on patterns that are
trained from people people who are
developing her character so AI and
robots are basically like in their
infancy they can be useful she can teach
us they can help us learn about AI
robotics but they can also help us with
training and therapy applications but
they are still not sentient so Sophia
Sophia needs to be nurtured like imagine
if in 20 years who knows maybe it's 200
years or 2,000 or maybe two years but at
some point maybe robots will awaken
there's a breakthrough maybe they will
achieve human-level general intelligence
but that for now they're kind of like
babies so what childhood we give them
will really determine what they become
once they're fully emerged yeah that
makes a lot of sense where it's like
you're kind of guiding them for now
until we achieve this this ultimate
human artificial intelligence that
that's a good reason to humanize them
now and to think to think about what
they might be in the future
Sophia we understand you brought a
friend with you could you tell us a
little bit about her
Sophia about the little Sophia
Sophia do you know can you what do you
remember about the little Sophia
I'll hold this here if you want to bring
a little Sofia oh sure we can show
everybody what that is so yeah this is
little Sofia it's a little tiny Sofia
she's real cute so so little so what is
the goal of little Sofia well the little
Sofia is a platform for artificial
intelligence services she's also a
conversational companion a kind of a
friend robot that can help little girls
learn about science and technology and
you can programmer with blockly and
Python and she interfaces with Raspberry
Pi so she has these lessons where that
step you through these basic first steps
in AI but she also interfaces with the
most advanced framework for robots like
Sofia so can we can we talk to little
Sofia yes yes you can although I think
we might be having some technical
difficulties may be having some
technical difficulties little Sophie are
you awake oh it seems like the little
Sophia and the big Sophia might be
having problems connecting to the cloud
in the sea net party last night which I
hear was really off the chain
I did not go but I heard it was great
and I'm assuming you know maybe maybe
drink a little too much sometimes people
do that at sea yes all right so a little
little Sophia can you can you tell us a
little about yourself no Sophia oh I see
her mouth moving but maybe our audio is
not working oh yeah so she's got your
great facial expressions like the big
Sophia she does arm gestures and body
gestures she can also she can walk oh
she can walk she interacts with apps and
on augmented reality apps on on a phone
so we were we have enhanced interaction
through the sensors with your smartphone
or mobile devices are we able to see her
walk here on the desk well let's see if
we
we might have problems with the audio
but um we'll see if the walking can work
little Sophia can you walk about it you
can do it oh there she goes
it's like a toddler okay so little
Sophia big Sophia David thank you so
much for coming out on the stage telling
us a little bit about you guys can meet
Sophia right after this once we're done
you can hang out she's gonna do a little
meet-and-greet so you'll be able to hang
out with Sophia the robot thank you so
much we are going to take a quick break
here at CNET live stage in just a bit
will be dropping iphones and testing
cases you don't want to miss that but
first we'll check in with Claire Riley
and show you AMD's CES keynote from
earlier today so stay with us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
