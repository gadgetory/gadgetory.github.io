today we're taking a look at the
t-mobile mytouch q now t-mobile
certainly offers some high-end Android
super phones but what if you're on a
budget and can't justify spending two
hundred dollars or more on a new handset
enter this device basically the mytouch
q offers the basic in Android computing
and it also has a slide-out QWERTY
keyboard as well as a 5.1 megapixel
camera with LED flash plus it offers
access to t mobile's 4g hspa+ high-speed
data network so basically you get a lot
of smart phone for a low price how low
right now it's being offered for free
with a two year contract and after an
instant rebate if you buy the phone
online the first thing you notice about
the mytouch is it's 3.5 inch TFT screen
now it's not as bright as other devices
I've seen but it should serve your knees
pretty well you also have the genius
button which is a feature that is a
staple on my touch devices basically it
allows for voice commands and common
functions of the phone like searching
for emails and making phone calls to be
done using your voice but what's really
important about this device is that it
has a slide out qwerty keypad so here
you see the keyboard it's a 40 keyboard
unfortunately it's not a five row which
some of the other devices on the market
have but Android devices with a full
physical keypad like this are becoming
very rare now the mytouch q is not a
high-octane super phone running the
whole show is a 1 gigahertz single core
Snapdragon processor now the one good
thing about that is that it has a pretty
good battery life so far it has a big
1500 milliamp battery and with a
processor you know not as powerful as a
dual-core processor it seems to offer
better battery performance than other
devices so far I'm Brian Bennett and
this has been a first
book of the tmobile mytouch q</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
