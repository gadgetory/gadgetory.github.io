moon as you can get here in Japan run
the sand dunes just outside of hala
Matsu we're team hakuto is testing their
Rovers yes they have two Rovers to task
in a mobility test the larger one called
Moonraker the four-wheeled rover was
toast behind it a two-wheeled guy called
Tetris the idea is that Moonraker will
back up to a skylight on the moon a
cavern formed by lava and drops Tetris
down within after landing we send a
signal from the ground station then
envelopes should open then global should
post out from the envelope the entire on
the surface of the moon this portion of
the terrestrial milestone prizes are
designed for the teams to show Google
Lunar XPrize or the XPrize foundation
that they have actually created hardware
that is on a path for launching my name
is John Walker
I'm the rover development leader forty-
you can see the camera here and this is
an off-the-shelf camera for industrial
youth pointed straight up so it's also
on top of the rover a parabolic mirror
so the camera can see a 360-degree image
all the way around this is the operator
console we get the live raw image so we
could see in front of the rover to the
right my name is Nathan Britton I'm one
of the engineers on the team I'll show
you a spot turn we're going to turn
thirty degrees to the right
the weather at the moment is quite nice
but for the test itself it was actually
pretty bad that didn't stop a scrum of
Japanese reporters from coming out and
filming the event this is a best place a
nice place for us to demonstrate the our
mobility system our final goal is to
contribute to the science the lava tube
underground the surface of the Moon is
really fascinating today we know that
there are several holes and if possible
our Rover should go down into the hole
the KB is supposed to be the base for in
the future so we are going to explore
the tape in order to identify the tape
is feasible for the future days so then
first we complete the 500 meter trouble
and approaching to the whole edge of the
hole then as an option if we use this
teaser system to make underground
exploration the judges are not quite
willing to commit to saying whether the
team was successful but things certainly
looked good from where we stand the
milestone phase of the google lunar
xprize is over the next step is the moon
we're still waiting to find out which
team will get to the moon first and win
that twenty million dollar prize
certainly we'll be there to cover it
when it happens whether we win the
XPrize or not we're going to continue to
our journey
I'm Tim Stevens foreseen that covering
the google lunar xprize</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
