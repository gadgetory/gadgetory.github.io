welcome upgrades in fact the camera
alone may be reason enough to entice a
lot of fans but the rest doesn't seem to
have changed much from its predecessors
and there are a few things we wish
Samsung would have done differently the
cameras on the s 9s are reaching pro
level with features like a dual aperture
lens and super slo-mo but for DSLR style
portraits you're gonna have to upgrade
to the s 9 Plus this year Samsung pulled
an apple and reserved the dual lens
camera setup for the larger more
expensive device okay so maybe flexible
screens was a stretch but when your
biggest design change is moving the
fingerprint scanner then you know you're
gonna get called out the curves and the
glass make Galaxy phones look great but
they also make them a lot more fragile
so why not swap out the back with a
sturdy and right aerial other
manufacturers are using ceramic titanium
stainless steel or if you really want to
keep the glass then make it out of this
Samson may have fixed one of the biggest
complaints about the fingerprint scanner
by placing it below the camera but it's
still not quite where it could be inside
the display and it's not just a rumor
anymore Bebo's phone proved that the
technology is already out there
yes nine has facial recognition to
unlock and create an emojis just like
the iPhone 10 but the iPhone uses a
depth sensing camera the facial
recognition features that power the s9
SAR emojis and intelligent scan are 2d
and not at the level you would want to
take full advantage of these features
and Samsung did not get rid of the
Bigsby button the s9 fixes one of the
biggest design complaints but the other
one still remains a designated button
for an assistant you may not want to use
it's the hardware equivalent of
pre-installed apps and you still can't
reconfigure it to do other things like
turn on your flashlight or access your
camera quick charge on the s9 hasn't
gotten any quicker it's still using the
same standard from three years ago when
there's now a quick charge for plus out
on the market that would bring an even
faster charge to the s9 or Samson could
take a page out of the 1 plus handbook
and create its own proprietary fast
charging solution like - wishlist aside
the s 9 and s 9 plus are still gonna be
the phones to beat going into 2018 so
