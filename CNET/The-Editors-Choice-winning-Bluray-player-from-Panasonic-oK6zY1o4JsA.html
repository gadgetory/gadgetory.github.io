and we're gonna take a look at the
Panasonic DMP B BT 220 this is a 3d
blu-ray player that's selling for a
hundred and thirty dollars and not only
is it the best value in Panasonic's
blu-ray lineup I think it's the best
blu-ray player value on the market the
design actually looks pretty sleek
compared to some of the other players on
the market and that's because
everything's hidden behind a flip-down
panel which flips up and down
automatically when you eject a disc
under the panel there are a few playback
buttons a USB port and an SD card slot
which is a nice bonus that a lot of
other players don't have around back
you'll find just a few simple ports
including an HDMI output optical audio
output and Ethernet plus the player has
built-in Wi-Fi there's also a USB like
port on the back but it's only for use
with Panasonic's Skype camera accessory
the main user interface is a little
different than other blu-ray players
with the kind of replicating the remotes
directional pad on the screen if you go
into VIERA Connect you'll find all the
streaming media apps including Netflix
Hulu Plus Amazon Instant Pandora and
Vudu the app selection is really solid
all around and the simple layout of the
home screen makes it easy to use if you
want to access apps that aren't on the
home screen you'll need to go to another
layer of the menu which is a little more
confusing but luckily you can customize
the icons on the home screen so you'll
rarely need to go into another layer of
the menu the included remote also
includes direct access buttons for
Netflix and VIERA Connect which is
really a nice convenience image quality
was excellent on blu-ray movies DVDs and
Netflix but that's to be expected
because all blu-ray players pretty much
have the same image quality these days
in terms of disk loading speeds the
Panasonic is a little faster than
average thanks to a super-fast
QuickStart mode that goes from the
player being off to playing a movie in
under 10 seconds altogether if I had to
recommend just one blu-ray player this
year this would be the one it has
essential features like built-in Wi-Fi
without charging you for extra features
that you don't need and it's the only
player on the market that has the most
essential apps combined with this
straightforward user interface it's the
best value for Blu ray
as I've seen and that's why it earns the
Editors Choice Award in the blu-ray
category I'm Matthew Muscovy ak and this
is the Panasonic DMP BDT 220</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
