mess of duplicate contacts and entries
with no phone number I'm going to show
you how to clean it up with a few simple
tricks the first trick is to D dupe your
contact list if you have the same person
listed on your phone three or four times
this is going to merge them all together
go to contacts at Google calm on your
computer and sign in with the same
Google Account use on your phone you
should see your phone's contacts over on
the left under my contacts if you see
more contacts on your phone than on
Google it's probably because another app
or account is adding them in there we'll
get to that later but for now just hit
the more button in Google contacts and
select find and merge duplicates Google
will show you a list of all your
duplicate contacts which you can merge
with one click or expand to evaluate
more carefully you can also manually
merge contacts by checking the box by
the names and selecting merge contacts
from the more menu that same menu can be
used to individually delete any contacts
without names or numbers that are just
junking up your list once you've made
those changes go back to your phone
manually refresh the account on your
settings and you should see a cleaner
happier contact list but we can still do
better when we looked at your account
settings before you may have noticed a
lot of other accounts that are synced to
your phone maybe it's another Google
account maybe a Facebook account or
Yahoo all of them could be contributing
to the clutter to relieve some of the
pain let's dive into the settings of
your contacts app nearly every phone
I've seen arranges things differently so
you'll have to do a little exploring on
your own what you should find though are
some toggles for controlling what
accounts are displayed on your list the
little digging you also find the
checkbox that filters out any contacts
that don't have phone numbers that's a
big one for me I also find that the
contact stored on my SIM card which came
from my old phone compete with the
contacts I have in Google in most cases
you can find the setting that hides the
sim contacts try that and see if that
helps now at this point you may be
wondering can't I just get an app that
does all this stuff for me yes there are
hundreds of them the problem is do you
really trust those app developers with
your contact data and do you want yet
another app competing with all the other
things that made this mess in the first
place personally I'd rather try
we had the root of the problem and
understand my phone a little bit better
in the process so there you go that's
contact cleanup 101 for Android users
more how tools like these head over to
how to see Netcom I'm Donald Bell thanks
