popular than pandora I'm Bridget Carey
and this is your cnet update cnet has
learned that Apple is close to making a
deal with two major music labels for its
upcoming music streaming service
possibly called I radio and apples plan
could pay music labels better than what
they get out of a service like Pandora
Apple would offer new revenue streams
like a quick way for users to buy a song
that's playing which could boost sales
on iTunes and Apple might offer a share
of the audio ads sources say Apple is
determined to get all major music labels
to sign a deal so the service can roll
out this summer there's been a rumor
that the next xbox console will require
an internet connection at all times even
while playing games well a tweet from
Microsoft Studios creative director not
only implies this is true but he says
it's no big deal and that people need to
deal with it yeah because requiring an
internet connection to play a game has
worked out so well for SimCity linkedin
is rolling out mentions it's similar to
what you can do on Twitter and Facebook
you can make a mention by typing the
name of a connection or a company in the
status update box or on a comment on the
homepage there's no symbol required and
those mentioned get a notification in
the future we'll have sensors everywhere
sensors on the wall sensors in your
shoes sensors on your wrist even sensors
on our foreheads and they're all
communicate to help improve your life
well that's one possible future based on
some of the innovations coming out of 18
t's labs the company's showcase some of
its latest research in New York such as
a device that reads your brainwaves and
will block a call if you're deep in
thought the forehead sensor communicates
with the phone using bluetooth and if
you're feeling chill and relaxed calls
will go through but if you're
concentrated or engaged with something
the call is blocked with the polite
message the labs also featured a sensor
that could detect when a strong chemical
is in the air that might aggravate an
asthma attack such as paint cleaning
products perfumes even the chemicals
released from hand sanitizer there was
also a demonstration of a live video
chat being translated in real
time from spanish to english in both
text and audio and for those of you who
telecommute or work in offices across
the globe how about a video conferencing
tool that lets you see what's going on
in different offices and you can
instantly jump into a lively
conversation you see happening in
another office it's a neat way to feel
more connected although I'm not quite
sure how I feel about all those cameras
spying on me that's your tech news
update you can find more details on our
blog sina com / updates from our studios
