Pablo is now available to stream on
Spotify Apple music and google play
music this is kind of a big deal only
because Kanye himself tweeted that the
album would exclusively be available for
streaming on title and would never be
for sale even though thousands of fans
were allowed to pre-order the album
before he said that Kanye owns a stake
in the serene music service along with
his buds and business partners jay-z and
Beyonce this might be a publicity stunt
to keep the album in the headlines Kanye
backtracking on a bad business move or
signs of greater distress within the
company jay-z recently filed a lawsuit
against titles former owners he claims
that the number of subscribers he was
told the company had was greatly
exaggerated basically he was catfished
either way the life of Pablo has been a
great success for title helping it
recently reach 3 million subscribers and
if Kanye and company aren't looking to
jump ship we could see Beyonce rule out
her album in a similar fashion</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
