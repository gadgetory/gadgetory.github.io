of Nokia the nokia name is now a thing
of the past on Lumia phones say hello
then to the Microsoft Lumia 535 name
aside it's business as usual for a Lumia
it has a familiar plastic body with
rounded covers these are interchangeable
and come in a variety of colors to suit
your mood or indeed your clothes
it's a 5-inch device so it's quite big
although not so big as to feel bulky
you'll probably need two hands to type
on it though the display itself has an 8
60 by 540 pixel resolution which isn't
particularly high but forgivable on this
phone given the budget price tag it'll
come with icons look reasonably sharp
and it seems pretty bright as well it
comes with the latest Windows Phone 8.1
software on board you'll see the
scrolling grid of colorful live tiles
and a recent update means you can now
pop tiles into folders the update also
brings voice assistant Cortana although
only two countries where Cortana is
currently supported above the display is
a five megapixel camera for those
embarrassing selfies and you'll find a 5
megapixel camera on the back as well the
Lumia 535 then doesn't seem a bad buy
for its cheap price tag there is a
caveat though this phone doesn't support
4G meaning you won't be able to take
advantage of super fast data speeds
still if you're after a cheap smartphone
for the essentials believe me a 535
might be worth a look
I went to hoyle for CNET and this is a
Microsoft Lumia 535</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
