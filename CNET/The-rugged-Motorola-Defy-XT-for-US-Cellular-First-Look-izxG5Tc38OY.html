and today we're taking a first look at
the Motorola Defy XT now this device is
rugged it costs 9999 basically a hundred
dollars on US cellular and runs Android
Gingerbread 23 also has a 3.7 inch
display here as well as a 5 megapixel
camera on back but what really makes
this phone special are the rugged
qualities that it has can survive dust
and water and shocks to the screen
thanks to a gorilla glass coating to
make sure that the Motorola Defy XT is
secure from the elements you basically
have to flip this switch here to make
sure that the back cover is locked so
this phone is basically built to survive
any kind of abuse you can give it
specifically if I drop it like this in
the dirt and there's lots of sand
covering all the ports and everything
that's pretty scary brush it off phone
looks like its operating just fine
though have to say it's very dirty we
got to clean this off ok so now this one
is really dirty it's covered in dust and
dirt and we got to get this clean so all
you got to do just pour water on it and
thanks to the flaps that are covering
all the ports and stop them up like
rubber stoppers this is not a problem at
all as a matter of fact you can submerge
this phone for half an hour without any
problems let's take a look looks like
it's running just fine
looks pretty clean no damage whatsoever
this has been a first look at the
Motorola Defy XT for US cellular be sure
