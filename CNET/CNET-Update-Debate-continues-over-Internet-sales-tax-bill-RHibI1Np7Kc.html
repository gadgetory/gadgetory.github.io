much longer I'm Bridget Carey and this
is your see not update soon you could be
paying more taxes when you shop online
depending if a new internet tax bill is
passed the Senate approved a
controversial bill that would require
businesses to charge customers tax based
on the state they live in so an online
retailer needs to be able to charge a
customer from Texas their tax rate and a
customer in Florida a different rate
it's something big companies like Amazon
and Walmart can handle easier than a
small business because businesses could
be dealing with more paperwork
impossible audits and legal battles from
every state that collect sales tax the
way it works now if an online shop is
based in the state you live in you pay
the sales tax but you don't have to if
you lived in a different state from the
business the bill still needs approval
from the house of representatives to
pass and President Obama said he
supports this change if passed it would
impact about 7,500 businesses it's any
business that has a total annual sales
of at least a million dollars outside of
the state they have a physical presence
in in other words if you're buying
something from a crafter on etsy that
crafter won't be forced to deal with
States taxes in honor of password day
McAfee has posted some tips on creating
a secure password yeah I didn't know
there was a password day either but
let's just roll with it don't use the
same password for important accounts
make it different for your bank account
your email and social network because if
your email gets hacked they'll try that
password all sorts of sites to see what
it unlocks and a password doesn't have
to be complex to be strong it should be
long like a phrase which might be easier
for you to remember the longer the
password the longer it takes to hack
there's been reports that the next Xbox
console will require a constant internet
connection but perhaps that's not true a
new internal email to the Xbox team
which was leaked to the blog ARS
technica suggests that the Xbox won't
need an internet connection for some
basic functions like playing a blu-ray
disc watching live TV and playing a
single player game and if that emails
real it also confirms that the system
will play blu-rays and serve as a cable
box
featured app is one that will release
your inner gangsta it's the stupefy app
yes as in Snoop Dogg or snoop lion as he
goes by now it's a photo app that lets
you to dress up a picture with added
cartoon drawings of snoop approved
things like gold chains big chicken hats
grape soda and wads of cash it's free
for android and iphone but you can pay a
buck for extra sticker packs say if you
want some Rasta inspired stickers expect
more apps to jump into this trend of
making money off silly stickers Snoop is
ahead of the pack on this for shizzle
that's your tech news update you can
