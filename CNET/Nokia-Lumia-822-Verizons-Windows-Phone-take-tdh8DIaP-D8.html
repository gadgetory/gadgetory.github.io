this is your first look at the nokia
lumia 822 for verizon so this is one of
the variants of lumia 820 one of the
main differences for verizon is the
shape is much more round but it's still
pretty thick and fairly heavy at five
ounces now the phone comes in white
black and grey the white version that I
have here in my hand has a very glossy
finish the black version has a slightly
rougher exterior this is a 4G LTE
smartphone running Windows Phone 8
operating system it's got the full
complement of extras including nokia
music and nokia drive and you'll also
see a few additions that reisen is
responsible for including NFL mobile and
univision there is a 4.3 inch AMOLED
screen on here that's got Nokia's clear
black display that helps fight against
glare outdoors and it also has a gorilla
glass to surface so that's going to add
some extra strength and durability you
find that in a lot of smartphones it's a
very nice screen as with all windows
phones you are able to change the theme
color on the front is a 1.2 megapixel
camera for video chatting on the back
you'll find the 8 megapixel camera with
autofocus and dual LED flash the 822
supports 1080p video capture off of the
main camera and 720p video capture off
of the front-facing camera inside there
is a 1.5 gigahertz dual-core Qualcomm
Snapdragon processor nice and speedy
there's also 16 gigabytes of storage
inside and there is a micro SD card slot
behind the back cover that can hold up
to 64 gigabytes in external storage the
nokia lumia 822 costs a very reasonable
ninety nine dollars and ninety-nine
cents after two-year service agreement
however if you want the absolute best
deal on a nokia phone the same price
will get you the Nokia Lumia 920 on AT&amp;amp;T
of course that is a different carrier so
you'll have to decide what you want I'm
Jessica doll court this has been your
first look at the nokia lumia 822 for
verizon you can catch the full review on
