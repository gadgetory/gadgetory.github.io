Apple Biden we're back with your
regularly scheduled programming for
everything good and bad inside the world
of Apple let's get to it and the new
apple TV is coming next week after Tim
Cook announced that wsj deal I've that
apple will be taking orders on Monday
October the 26th and shipments will
begin at the end of the week it's 149
for the 32 gig model and 199 for the
64gb model and just a reminder there
will be no 4k support so you'll just
have to wait for the new new Apple TV to
bring that now just ahead of the launch
new channels have arrived to the current
Apple TV including NBC CBS all access
and the fashion focused made-to-measure
channel they'll also be available for
the next gen apple TV now Cook was also
asked about Apple watch sales numbers
@wsjd live and still declined to reveal
a specific number saying customer
satisfaction is off the charts
translation sales are still really low
compared to anything we've made and we
won't talk about it now coach said Apple
music has six and a half million paying
customers and 8.5 million still on free
trials so for 6.5 million subscribers at
ten dollars a month for 12 months that's
780 million bucks a year they'll only
need to convert 1.8 million more trial
users to make it another one of apple's
billion dollar businesses joining the
iphone ipad mac itunes and Apple TV
Kretsch ah and I just had to do that to
honor back to the future day that
happened this week and did you know nike
has finally made an actual pair of the
self-lacing nike mag shoes from Back to
the Future to insane okay back to the
show and what about Apple's car
ambitions there will be no flying
DeLoreans anytime soon but cook didn't
say much he admits software is important
at the core and in the short term Apple
wants people to have the iphone
experience in the car Cook says we'll
see what we do in the future so what
about products that are here right now a
lot of you been asking me about if it's
the right time to buy an imac and I've
been telling you to hold off and
now Apple updated its imac line with the
new 21.5 inch retina display model
starting at 1499 and an upgraded 27-inch
5k display model that starts at
seventeen ninety nine plus an all new
lineup of magic accessories with a new
magic keyboard magic mouse to a magic
trackpad to that all bring rechargeable
lithium ion batteries connect via
bluetooth and can be charged with
lightning to USB cables all right
apple's ipad pro still says available
november on the website with no specific
date but Macotakara supply chain sources
have targeted november the sixth as the
official release date FCC filings state
that the ipad pro has already been
approved for sale in the united states
and early november is still the rumor
time table with no confirmation from
Cupertino just yet there's also a whole
bunch of software updates across the
board this week from the big a I OS 9.1
is finally here bringing us the
long-awaited new emoji set supporting
Unicode seven and eight including
burritos and tacos
oh it's a big deal plus live photos
won't record those unnecessary moments
when you either raise or lower your
phone during the picture and I know you
all do it also watch OS 2.0 point one
gets new emojis performance improvements
and bug fixes Apple's TV OS gold master
has been seeded to developers so it's
ready to roll and Mac os10 El Capitan
gets bug fixes office 2016 compatibility
and the new emoji support as well
including popcorn the unicorn head and
the middle finger all very important but
even more important I learned a really
cool trick that I had no idea about sent
to me from el rob diaz on twitter with
iOS 9 in the messages app just hold down
the camera icon and it gives you a quick
option to take a still picture or a
video that will go directly into your
message pretty slick and that proves i
actually do read the messages you send
me and before we go I haven't shown you
all the love in a while so we're doing a
giveaway from my friends at belcan with
my favorite doc for the Apple watch an
iphone it charges both at once it looks
really slick and it's all for you all
you have to do is tell me what your
favorite new emoji from the iOS 9.1
update is and why I'll pick my favorite
one and announce the winner next week
alright that's going to do for this we
show you can send me your email to the
apple byte at cnet com or tweet me at
brian Tong thanks so much for watching
and we'll catch y'all next time for
another bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
