it is the smallest electric scooter that
you can buy today now the ER B is what
you call a last mile form of transport
the idea is that this small 35-pound
electric scooter and just toss it in
your trunk or take it on the train even
take it into a store with you and then
when you get where you're going you just
fold it out hop on it and take it for a
ride it's powered by an electric motor
on the front wheel and has the range of
about 20 miles with a four hour charge
top speeds about 15 miles per hour which
would be dangerous in here but we'll get
you from the train station to your
office pretty quickly the ER be was
pinned by a former Porsche designer so
there are a lot of aspects of its
construction that keep weight down the
chassis is made out of aluminum with
holes in it so that you use as little
material as possible while still being
stiff the forks in the bar made out of
real carbon fiber this thing is to the
gram as light as it can possibly be now
it looks a little bit funny and you
might look funny on it but it will get
you that last mile from the train to
your office without being a sweaty mess
I'm and so on Google we've been taking a
look at the ER v electric scooter take
it on back over</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
