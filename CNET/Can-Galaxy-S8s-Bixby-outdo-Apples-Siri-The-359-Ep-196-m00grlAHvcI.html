morning good morning that did not send
intro John has has had a difficult
couple of days I have two boys in a
couple times I'm sorry I'll give you a
break this Wow while on assignment I
mean that's like the worst thing i've
been i've had food poisoning while on a
trade shows when you're not at home that
just just a terrible terrible situation
being that is yet to happen to me but
now I have to go find some wood good
well now you have to get her three times
because well I've had boys she's
edgewise so yeah you got three times in
one show actually oh what's that embassy
yes for three days and have only happy
boys I think this all time Brad you eat
the catering that we have pretty
religiously then maybe got a high chance
to get sick it could happen I do eat the
catering it's I'm kidding Peter's fine
all right let's get back on topic yeah
I'm sorry everyone work so we're not
just talking about food poisoning today
we will be talking about poisoning tag
the galaxy SI and Bixby samsung's new
digital assistant is it gonna be you
know is it gonna be series it gonna be
Alexa I hope it's not serious about ebay
there's some news about that that
they're gonna do guaranteed shipping and
with the five people who buy from ebay
right out by the way crappy on ebay i
buy on ebay so you have to your your the
e-commerce guy and also Jones here to
talk about South specified yeah not food
points nothing poison on foodborne
illness parts of South by wish i'm sure
are exciting and not filled with lawmen
so yeah sleeplessness well they've got
most people there they are filled with
it's a very there's a lot of alcohol
that's true a lot of right all right i
should assume that pass out five all
right we're off the rails on we're
already off to a great start on Monday
all right
so as always if you have any questions
about in these topics leave them in the
comments section Brian will pick out the
best and we'll answer them in three
minutes 59 seconds I probably a little
more you've already given up on our
timing constraint all right we try from
exactly 3 minutes and 59 seconds we'll
be back to answer your questions and
comments in the chat go ahead and file
them we'll see you in three two welcome
to the 359 when we talk about the top
text of the day and all the crap you
want to throw in I'm Roger Cheng I'm Ben
Fox ribbon I'm Joanie salzman say hello
to big speed samsung it's given scene up
the details on its new digital assistant
which will show up in the galaxy s eight
samsung envisions bixby showing up in
all of its products eventually activated
with a touch of a button so not not
necessarily by a voice then you're
you're the digital assistant expert what
do you make of this it's there a little
late to the game and they're using this
button which i think is interesting I
mean like the whole concept is voice
activation that's supposed to make
things a lot easier like if you're
washing the dishes or you're holding two
babies like you do in my house then the
concept of voice activation is really
really useful so I'll be interested to
see how people use this maybe they said
a little bit differently than they would
Siri or alexa i don't have real issue
with it being on the phone I think it's
when you put it on other appliances like
washing machines refrigerate button
there like that seems to make a little
bit lessons to me yeah I it's it's also
like how is this going to affect Google
assistant and Alexa because LG has made
a really big push into saying like hey
we're gonna use Amazon Alexa across all
of our stuff right um now with bigsby
coming out it seems as though samsung
wants to gain greater control and they
don't want to Alexa to go in there or
Google assistant so um yeah I would I
would expect that to happen and that
seems to be like what Samsung would
probably want to do because there's
Samsung all right next up you know
there's some news from ebay yeah so
watch out amazon ebay is guaranteeing
3-day shipping on 20 million items
starting
this summer this actually highlights
something that eBay has already been
doing but it took them apparently a
couple years to really say hey we we do
fast shipping just like Walmart just
like Amazon so that mean the 20 million
items is that everything that's sold on
ebay know there are more than like a
billion listings on ebay but for the
professional sellers this is a way for
them to really show off that they're
able to ship you stuff in three days or
less and can actually guarantee it and
you said most of this stuff actually the
vendors that are on the site or actually
the same ones who sell em some yeah so
if you're buying during the holidays
like you might buy from the same vendor
whether it's amazon or ebay or best buy
or walmart but i think a lot of people
do tend to go to Amazon because they
think it's faster shipping but at the
same time you really are buying from the
these same vendors in the back end so
this is a way for you betta like maybe
just let people know like hey buy from
us to like it's the same stuff from the
same people all right lastly Jen got
back from South by Southwest what were
some of the biggest highlights from the
show it was uh it lasts up but usually
as it was kind of circus Joe Biden
showed up and talked about his cancer
initiative there's a lot to talk about
VR and AI and and kind of the geekiest
highlights the game of thrones
showrunners we were interviewed by back
to the place on sun aria on stage was a
lot of fun any any juicy details uh they
announced that ed sheeran will be making
a cameo in this upcoming season of Game
of Thrones which is exciting for Arya's
actress she's a business it's really
kind of cute like they wanted to get him
on the show because she's such a big fan
I wanted to do the sweet thing for the
actress oh please oh oh yes so hope they
killed on the show like from this not
that I have anything against him what
Aria kills him oh that would be pretty
sweet actually that would be I don't
know cheap wish be gushing wish me
flushing as she like stabs him in the
throat or something but I love your
music uh anything else interesting a
cool from the show you know it's always
crazy um one thing that was
I'm cool there's a lot of brands there
and one of the funny things that one
branded was Casper the mattress company
they had these sleep pods where people
could kind of go and take a nap and
escape the chaos so one of the best
things about South I was a way to
pretend you weren't there that sounds
perfect all right more of these stories
check us out on cnet I'm Roger Cheng I'm
Ben Fox Rubin I'm Jonas Olsson thanks
for listening and we're back in the chat
scoping through yahoo our new Oh a-one
a-two and then for joining us as always
where they getting the data for Bixby
CIA NSA partnership anything else uh you
know what it's unclear they weren't
really that forthcoming with details
initially I think we're going to hear a
lot more about Bixby once the s8 gets
formally announced which is next week in
New York but for now we're not really
sure where that where that day is coming
from it well they do experience with
doing like a worst voice assistant with
s voice yes so they are one would assume
that they're building off of that I hope
not cuz that was terrible mm-hmm ok
didn't really work well it just wasn't
doesn't look great we do know it should
be fairly limited I'd launch you know
they announced they had bought a couple
of startups did was notable one which
was founded by one of the cofounders of
Siri that isn't going to get integrated
into Bixby right away I think that's
going to come in later versions of the
voice assistant okay here's a good
question from regenerated Flavio right
why does samsung use the Snapdragon
processor here in the US but their own
in-house uh eggs i knows it's an
excellent exceptional check funny I
we're just having this conversation I
have a general answer to this do it they
just lay us some wisdom on on-chip
nerdiness okay so so generally with
chips as with any type of supplier like
Samsung gets it has I think like three
different suppliers for its batteries
hmm it's the same thing with 22
different suppliers for its batteries is
the same thing with chips you don't want
any one supplier to get too greedy and
basically monopolize and that's why they
probably wouldn't want to use Snapdragon
across the board in one hundred percent
of their devices so this is a way of
keeping Qualcomm honest and also just
making sure that they're getting the
best price and staying competitive
there's an element of branding to it I
mean the fact that Samsung is the first
one to get the snap set Snapdragon 835
which is the newest chip like the
hardcore geeks are really going to get
into that I mean it's not a matter to
most people but like peoples there are
certain segment the market that looks
and go though it's got the news chip
it's gotta be the fastest phone and make
the purchasing decision based on that
yeah yeah I mean like do people really
make their purchase decision on getting
certain areas some of re exactly like
some of our readers to like the most
hardcore pawn right people right also
the most loyal customers yeah right so
speaking of loyalty they want to know
more about the samsung galaxy SI what
can you say about the fingerprint sensor
placement from what i understand i mean
the rumors have it that it won't be in
the home button like he used to be able
being a bad back but not like not what
do you think where the you know the
pixel has haha thanks al has the pixel
has a basic be in the center of the back
i think this one is supposed to be a
little bit higher up that's the rumor
like closer to the camera lens which
seems to make less sense to me because
it'd be like awkwardly reaching for it
or you can be hitting your camera lens
by accident plus i think that's what the
rumors say i'm not it's not confirmed
we're not really sure yet we'll get more
of the details next week but that's what
i'm hearing the rumor is the new iphone
in September is supposed to have it
integrated into the screen right so it's
gonna be in the front there's not going
to be like an actual physical home
button yeah the rumors for samsung was
they tried to do this but like ran out
of time figured out which actually kind
of makes sense right that they're
launching like six months early right
other than the iphone so maybe a they
couldn't figure it out in time mmm let's
go ahead and from our early impressions
about Bigsby Quincy wants to know if
it's going to be equivalent to Google
assistant where does it line up in the
pecking order against Syria against
Alexa against sorry to anybody who has
an echo in the room right now no I would
like hey I would say it's a probably
premature to rank Bixby at the flicks we
haven't really got a good chance to play
with the butt
in terms of those other assistants like
what would you kind of rank them I think
a lot of it really has to do with
marketing right like they Apple oversold
Siri they had all those like flashy
commercials with celebrities that were
basically like you can have a
conversation with serious your can
answer all your questions and the truth
is is that like a generalized AI voice
assistant just isn't quite there yet and
that's why Syria is still very maddening
to deal with because it's trying to
answer what everybody gets the worse the
bunch now right it is still really bad
but the echo probably or Alexa doesn't
answer a lot of your questions either
right it's just they started from a much
lower point like lower expectations and
then built up from there so well now
that I've started using an echo the only
thing I ask really is play kids music
right you play kids music unless the
weather the weather yes timers yeah yeah
but when I was in South by in a hotel
for a week um every morning I wanted to
be I wanted to say alexa i would say me
like that one thing that i would have to
pick up my phone and interrupt the
emails that i was reading to look if i
could just be like alexa what's the
weather today Oh instead of like having
to swipe yeah there's boring mundane
things become the things that you really
start to rely on true rather than you
know having a conversation with Siri
yeah nobody ever does no I mean I tried
it she's all vertices so so to me what
will be interesting with bigsby is how
are they gonna sell it to people right
you know and and at least my
interpretation of it is if they at least
set expectations reasonably low then
maybe people will be you know like
positive about about their experience
with it they like a little bit more
surprise that hey it does more than you
know samsung sold it as have either of
you guys were right to have you used
google assistant at all yeah i have it i
haven't used it what's your reaction to
it uh it's definitely better in terms of
mimicking the idea that treadmill a
conversation i think it has been more
conversational but i don't know i've
only ever used it typing questions i've
never actually like doing right yeah cuz
it's on the pixel and I'd rather just
type because I don't want people hearing
my rations I want to know what it is
our oh yeah ok Google what's this rat we
have a good question from Jacob in the
chat given how much Samsung is pushing
big speed do you think we could see a
push for Tizen OS messing around oh my
god oh man isin so glad you asked that
question because it's a chance for us to
monetize a good more no no sorry
question is not dead though is it it's
not dead it said it's being used on
their smart watch yeah like you don't
worry it's no air balls I think it's in
the TV's as well um but no in terms of
you know phone OS I think that ship has
sailed everyone's sort of sitting on
Android it was a time when there was
like a ton of firefox a boon to there's
bunch of these OS is that kind of came
out and tried to be the third viable
option there are there is no third
viable option at this point like it's
all blackberry you know like Windows
Phone they're all pretty much irrelevant
just a note and sharp tip constr she did
talk to in John Reeves the head of R&amp;amp;D
he mentioned that he envisions bixby at
least initially to be a bright psychic
quote bright side kick I don't know that
means to control your phone so it's it's
really more about as less about search
like Google assistant is and more about
like activating apps on your phone or
turning on the flashlight or something
like I think it's more basic early on i
think that the other stuff will come
later but i can almost see Bixby and
google assistant coexisting you just
largely answered asad's question and
said why is Bigsby needed when they
already had google right so i think
right now at least initially don't know
where it's going to go the two can kind
of coexist okay cool has also been a
little bit more controlling over google
assistant they brought google assistant
to the pixel first right and what other
phones well actually it was basically i
got many every know every phone that's
got the latest version of android now
can download google assistant Oh g6 is
the first one that has google system
pre-loaded but if you've got the if
you've got a early modern fos herbs are
wasted enough OS usually now you have
google as soon as opposed to like
whatever okay
yeah exactly the predecessor I think the
thing is though is that that at least
shows that like Google is going to keep
google assistant at least early on for
itself and that gives Samsung a very
good reason to create something like
bigsby because then they have control
over that process and they can bring it
out to their customers when they're
ready to do it I mean the the skeptic in
me is basically like Samsung has rolled
out s versions of different services
like ass voice in the past and they've
all been pretty terrible so I mean they
kind of have you know a tough job ahead
of them to actually make this worth
using let's try to get to a couple more
questions before we wrap it up for the
day sure Yaffe was asking is bigsby
coming to other Samsung products like TV
or as exclusive the essay there they say
eventually it'll go to more products if
enemies refrigerators may be anywhere
that has an internet connection and a
microphone washing machine yeah if
there's if it's a smart washing machine
yea big speaking uh can live there with
the Bixby button gotta walk over your
washing machine push that bun got to fix
me right hello actually have a
conversation with your watch I only
makes me keep me company I have a
question um this kind of breaks the mold
I know Joan you were there you were sick
you were working but did you get a
chance to see an equal stage shows at
South by this year um none of the
stations but I went to so Spotify did
these it's kind of cool spot if I did
these super fans private recording
sessions where people that are really
big fans of certain artists as the you
know info that they drew from there
listening data they invited them to
these secret recording sessions and so I
went to one of those it was a band
called the lemon twigs and they were
super super super killer they were
really great performers I'd never heard
them before and they put on a really
great show they also are one of those
leg bands it's a super hard working
artist that had like eight shows at
South by um but yeah I didn't get to fit
in a lot of music while i was there i
did get to interview Grandmaster Flash
which were just like oh yeah which is
doing it's very doe does not whack at
all these are terms that Grandmaster
Flash would you like
as everybody in the challenges while we
say doped up and whack yes in this room
it was great it was really cool back one
let's get one more in on topic before we
call today asad's asking will Bixby to
the Java voice to typing kind of
assistant because if we can do that then
Bixby is going to win it all what you
guys say about that hmm I don't know
voice to typing basically a decision
yeah education I mean like Shira does
that to her start next time it was
alright rate no it's not they're all
they're all not that great with
dictation actually Google assistant is
better I wish I oh yeah in general
Google listen I've never tried never
tried to patient with without any of
them actually well Syria did and didn't
work and I just stopped using voice
recognition obviously very difficult and
comment or is right that if they nail
that then people will be more likely to
use bigsby because you know well yeah
nothing's more annoying she saying his
name Frank to Alexa a million times
until she actually understands what
you're saying if it's in a loud room
then that happens a lot in my head and
which do you find is no Sakura for you
like in terms of all the assistant to
use Google assess like the Google in the
google app on my iPhone okay is the most
useful but I don't use it in my house so
there aren't my kids yelling and
screaming around so Alexa has a high
error rate in my house but it's also
really loud there to claim their kids as
usual yeah I just want to provide all
the necessary contact and do you use
Cortana lungs no I don't export I've had
some experience with Cortana but um you
know it's it's more like pc-based these
days yes like Alexa and Siri and Google
assistant are in a variety of different
types of products yep alright so Assad
we're we're waiting for your report on
my desk as soon as the galaxy SI comes
out nice looking forward to commentary
before we wrap it up let's get one more
