outside in the parking lot and as you
can see obviously we need to be outside
because cars and motorcycles so here at
BMW they are doing it some demos with
the x7 sir as you can see the cars are
doing some fancy tricks behind me you
get into that and I'm gonna go for a
ride in that in just a second but before
that the riderless motorcycle now this
is pretty insane when you watch this
with your own eyes just take a look and
see it is writing itself so obviously
this isn't gonna be a real product this
is something that BMW is going to be
using to kind of optimize and get a lot
of data about how the motorcycle rides
and then feed that back to help develop
better safety systems so the motorcycle
can do pretty much anything that it
would if you were riding it like normal
so it can stop and start on its own
you'll be able to change gears use the
clutch and everything and will take
corners really really easily so it's
kind of crazy just to watch it do its
own thing so this is gonna be in
hopefully some safety systems in
motorcycles in the near future but for
now it's not gonna be a real product
just enjoy it driving itself and just
have your mind blown by what this looks
like
you ready Tommy I am ready what are you
gonna show us today well we're gonna
experience the new all-new BMW x7
obviously in some situations scenarios
obstacles here that you probably
wouldn't normally take any BMW in this
one it can do it this one can do it it's
not necessarily built to do it but it
can do it that's what makes it so
awesome so you can see obviously the
initial look of the vehicle is all new
redesigned and from anything else
they've ever had
so in my opinion it's got a great great
look to the interior and it's it's
pretty easy to use you've pulled up our
our X view our inclu meter here showing
some different angles and stuff for any
experience better ride height to the
highest setting we can adjust that now
first time in a long time we've had
fully adjustable ride height there
mm-hmm so what's uh so first up we've
got our offset ramps here we're gonna
use and the xDrive system itself is
gonna be exercised quite a bit in this
case because in a minute we will
eventually have only two tires touching
the ground as we Teeter across so oh
yeah when we get to this point you'll
feel one of the tires will come off the
xDrive system will very smoothly engage
the opposite tire this still has grip to
keep us moving right along and we're
gonna go real slow here and see what
kind of balance whoa we are we are on an
angle there yep we're flexing out so the
other thing that's cool about this right
about here you feel it bouncing around
on two wheels right on two wheels right
there there's a lot of torsion in the
body right now so with our unibody
structure in these cars it creates a lot
of rigidity so even here we can open
those back door or the right side doors
there and they closed smoothly the
hinges line up there's no no flex in the
unibody or anything like that which is
pretty cool because sometimes an SUV or
something like that you might end up
with a lot of twists in the body and
sometimes the doors don't even align
right when you get the suspension
torqued up like this so obviously this
thing is nice and stiff so we'll slowly
come down the other side here that was
the other end drive your tires way off
the ground there I feel like I need to
be holding on I mean I feel very safe
but at the same time I know this is not
a usual driving situation correct yep so
up next we're going to experience some
lateral angle because that would mean we
were flipping over but we're not going
to do that today we're gonna get it way
up here close to maybe 20 or a little
more Wow
lateral angle yeah and so you can see
here 21 degrees 22 degrees so what's
awesome about this in a vehicle this
size the MWR strives to have a great
balance and the
center of gravity being as low as it as
it can be in this thing allows us to do
this with really no risk of rollover
anything like that I would say we're
well within reason you could even go a
little higher probably but I don't want
to be the driver that finds where the
limit is that means we did flip right
exactly
well I mean so theoretically we could
stay at this angle all day we could hang
out here for a long time until the blood
rushes to one side exactly and then I'm
starting to feel sick why do that okay
like I said most people never do that to
their their BMW but but you can that's
the thing it's a great way to experience
it now the other thing I like to always
point out is BMW does a really good job
of creating the ultimate ultimate
driving experience in all of their cars
they all have a very similar feel this
is a big vehicle making this tight
corner with some of the stuff stuff they
put into their bigger vehicles to make
it feel like you're driving a into or
something would be like the rear
steering assist and this thing is
helping us make it around that tiny
corner so actually as we're cornering at
a low speed the rear axles turning off
this direction to keep us going around
there so up next we've got the rollers
here this is scary so again the
intelligent x-drives can have to work
overtime as we get onto the rollers
they're free spinning so we're gonna
have to keep it going and that
eventually the opposite corners are
gonna grip up and power be transferred
across the axle as needed to keep us
moving along so all right let's do it I
feel like this is a roller coaster for
cars here so now we're looking at the
sky and one of the features a point out
to you here is our start off assistance
so all BMWs have this if you're stopped
on a hill now obviously normally
wouldn't be this extreme you can
actually you're given three seconds to
take your foot off the brake and go to
the throttle to start moving forward
without rolling back that's a feature in
all the Wow a car so I'm going to take
my foot off the brake here go to the gas
it didn't allow us to go backwards
Roback it was
we go forward this is what you need in
San Francisco straits because it's s
steep we can't see what's down there so
I don't know I mean hopefully the ramps
are still there all right so I'm going
to turn on hill descent control this
button right down here so in our f7 here
we've got hill descent control that
works in a range of two miles per hour
all the way to 20 miles per hour
so now that I've got it active its gonna
go to its base speed of 20 or excuse me
2 miles per hour and when I let off the
brake here in a second I'm not going to
touch the pedals I'm gonna let it do the
work to guide us down this hill on these
narrow ramps so it's gonna do it on its
own okay I'm trusting it is a trust game
feels like wow so I can adjust my speed
there through the cruise control dial
Wow
obviously we'll keep it at the low speed
but that's a handy feature if you live
anywhere where there like if you're
driving in a range that's below 40 miles
per hour you can adjust that and it'll
kick in very smoothly to guide you to
the set speed anything above 40 it'll
automatically knock hill descent control
back off so that way obviously doesn't
break you from a higher rate of speed
sorry extreme Tommy that was amazing
thank you taking us around nice to meet
you
sorry that ride was absolutely crazy
honestly at times it was a 26 degrees on
that incline and it actually felt both
really comfortable and really terrifying
which is a real testament to that
technology so that's all from the BMW
briefs make sure to stay tuned to seeing
it for lots more coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
