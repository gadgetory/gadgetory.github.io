7000 you're looking at the 65 inch size
the largest in the series but this TV
also comes in sizes all the way down to
40 inches so what do I like about this
TV it's affordable for a samsung 4k TV
it's flat and not curved and the styling
is pretty sweet
the metallic frame is minimal and classy
and the pedestal stand provides an
element of futurism that's pure Samsung
seen from the side is nice and thin
thanks for an edge lit LED backlight but
not as razor slim as some other TVs
another unusual design element is the
textured backside that helps it cut an
attractive figure even from behind the
kayuu 7000 also has some cool extras
that you won't find on other brands just
plug in any device like a Roku or cable
box and the Samsung will recognize it
and automatically set up the TV remote
to control it without you having to
program anything it can also control
smart things smart home devices although
that feature won't be available until
early 2017 in the mean time you get one
of the better Smart TV systems with a
new simplified interface that services
individual shows from apps like Netflix
as well as your cable box allowing
easier access there are also plenty of
apps that do 4k and HDR video including
Netflix Amazon and YouTube so what don't
I like as much in short the picture
quality compared to some TVs at this
price the Samsung showed lighter black
levels leading to less punch in contrast
particularly in darker rooms it also
showed some video processing issues
including a choppier look with 24 frame
content that might bother some film
buffs I did appreciate its accurate
color and solid bright room image but
they're not enough to earn my full
recommendation all told the Samsung keio
7000 will appeal to buyers who value
Smart TV extras and sweet design over
raw image quality for the price I'm
