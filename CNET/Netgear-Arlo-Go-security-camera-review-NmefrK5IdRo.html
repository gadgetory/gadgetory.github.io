indoor/outdoor cellular security camera
by the go for 400 bucks and pay a
monthly or yearly fee for Netgear zone
LTE service or get a plan directly from
Verizon or AT&amp;amp;T similar to Nikes Wi-Fi
enabled our low pro cameras the our logo
comes with a rechargeable battery that's
supposed to last for several weeks I've
been testing mine off and on for a few
weeks now and the battery was hovering
around 50% the last time I checked so
that's pretty good expect the same seven
days of free activity Clips saved to the
cloud with this LTE version and the same
straightforward app where you can arm
and disarm the camera record on-demand
video clips and more this model works
with microSD cards up to 32 gigabytes if
you prefer local storage
it also supports Alexa and Google
Assistant voice commands if you want to
see your live feed on a bigger screen
since you aren't relying on Wi-Fi the
our logo works really well in places
where a traditional network won't work
so you can mount it to a tree to monitor
local wildlife or even attach it to a
barn to keep an eye on things remotely
basically put it wherever you want
in general this camera worked very well
with a few key exceptions its motion
sensor while adjustable was very
sensitive and since the go doesn't offer
motion detection zones you're likely to
get a lot of alerts Netgear zone LTE
plans are based on the number of
activity alerts you receive and if you
meet that max allowance and you probably
will your camera will simply stop
working for that reason I'd suggest
going with an AT&amp;amp;T or Verizon plan
instead since they're based on data size
instead of number of notifications
battery life will also vary a lot
depending on how much activity is
happening and the outside temperature
lower temps can drain the battery faster
still the our logo is a reasonable
option if you're searching for a
security camera that goes where Wi-Fi
can't</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
