200 makes the almost three year old d70
100 look like a terrific deal with only
minor improvements over its predecessor
and given the d70 100's lower price the
d70 200 becomes a tough sell unless
you're a night owl or a long burst
shooter I'm Laurie grunion and this is
the Nikon d70 200 what are the updates
some improvements in buffering for burst
shooting and improved image quality
above ISO 1600 plus 2 black and white
high ISO modes and time-lapse movie
creation the camera also gains wireless
connectivity but Nikon zap is one of the
least capable I've seen among auto ISO
support and a flat color profile are
welcome for movie shooting shooting
video with the camera remains a trying
experience its design is unchanged it
retains the comfortable grip and solid
dust and weather-sealed build quality of
its predecessor and overall it's still a
well-designed camera with a logical
shooting design the biggest drawback of
having not updated the body design
though is that we're stuck with the
fixed LCD and for the most part it has
the three year old feature set autofocus
is excellent in continuous shooting it
achieves up to a 90% hit rate of
sufficiently InFocus photos and that's
both panning or photographing a subject
that's moving towards you Nikon added
Wi-Fi to this model with tap to initiate
NFC but the company's app offers only
the most basic capabilities you can view
and copy photos from the camera to your
mobile device or use your phone as a one
press remote shutter the only control
you have with the remote app is to
choose your focus point another problem
is the cannot believe it works this way
video controls the camera supports
manual settings but you can't change
them while you're in movie mode to
change shutter speed or aperture you
have to exit live you make your changes
and then reenter live you the d70 to
hundreds a great camera for the money as
long as you really don't care about
anything beyond photo
quality and speed for more detail read
