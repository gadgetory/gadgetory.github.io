mid-range phone that you can get
unlocked for only 230 dollars it's
equipped with a 5.5 inch display and has
two 13 megapixel cameras on the back
with this dual camera setup you can take
different kinds of artsy photos one
setting gives your images a bokeh effect
similar to the one on the Apple iPhone 7
plus it doesn't work as smooth but it
lets you blur the background or
foreground after you take an image for a
dramatic look because one of the
shooters is a monochrome camera you can
take some fancy black-and-white shots -
or pictures with just one pop of color
there's also a live photo option which
again we've seen on iPhones or you can
take short jiffy photos that have
movement one of the best things about
the phone is its battery life it has a
3.14 ampere-hour non-removable battery
and during our lab tests it clocked in
14 hours of continuous video playback on
airplane mode that's an excellent time
and it has quick charging to the phone
has a fingerprint reader for user
security NFC and dual-sim capabilities
as well unfortunately it runs Android
marshmallow which isn't the most recent
version of the OS at six and a half
ounces is also pretty heavy in the hand
and pocket and its back cover collects a
lot of fingerprints and smudges that are
difficult to wipe off but again the
phone is only $230 which is a good deal
if you want a cheap Android device plus
with its impressive battery life you'll
be able to get through a workday without
having to recharge it all the time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
