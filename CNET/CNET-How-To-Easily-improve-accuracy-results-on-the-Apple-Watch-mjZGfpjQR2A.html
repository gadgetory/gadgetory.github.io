about a month now and I've noticed
that's not always the most accurate when
running or even walking for that matter
with results sometimes being off by as
much as 10% but there is a way to
calibrate it which will help improve the
accuracy of the distance and pace
measurements when running outdoors
without your phone or when your phone's
GPS signal isn't available such as when
running or walking on a treadmill I
found that when calibrated correctly the
accuracy results were spot-on with an
error rating of less than 1% before we
begin make sure the location services
are enabled on your iPhone to check this
head to settings click privacy and
select location services you will also
want your motion calibration and
distance settings to be enabled this can
be done from your iPhone by heading to
settings selecting privacy qualify
location services and selecting system
services at the bottom of the page now
let's get started on a day with clear
skies head to an outdoor location that
has good GPS reception such as a park
calibration is performed automatically
whenever you use your Apple watch's
outdoor walk or outdoor run features in
the workout app so from your Apple watch
tap the digital crown select workout app
and choose outdoor walk or outdoor run
select the open noble option and start
your activity Apple recommends you walk
or run at your normal pace for roughly
20 minutes after that simply end and
save your workout it's as easy as that
now for people who frequently walk or
run at different speeds it's recommend
that you calibrate the watch for each
pace the more you calibrate the
accelerometer to learn your stride
length the more accurate the Apple watch
will be but be warned calibration data
isn't backed up on your iPhone and is
instead stored locally on the Apple
watch the data will be erased if you
ever unpair the watch with your iPhone
and you will be required to recalibrate
it for more tips and tricks like this
one be sure to check out how to cnet.com
you can also reach out to me on Twitter
with any questions or comments I'm dan
