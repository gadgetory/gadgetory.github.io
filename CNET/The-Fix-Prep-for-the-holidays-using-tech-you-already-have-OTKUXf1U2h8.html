the show about do-it-yourself tech and
how to's I'm Sharon Profis and i'm eric
franklin and up ahead we have some great
tips to help you get prepped for the
holidays including a couple of DIYs for
those of you who want to make a unique
gift for someone or you know if you want
to keep it yourself you can do that too
but first we show you how to use your
smartphone to send a personalized
holiday greeting there are regular
holiday cards and then there are
nfc-enabled holiday cards with this DIY
I'll show you how to create a holiday
card that launches a video when you tap
it with an Android smartphone the first
thing we need to do is record that video
greeting so to do that I'll launch a
webcam recording program on my computer
and record a short holiday greeting hey
guys I just want to wish you happy
holidays and a happy new year so now
that I have my video recorded i'm going
to upload it to my youtube account and
make sure that it's unlisted that way
only the people who receive this card
can view the video it won't be
searchable under regular youtube search
and within a few minutes it should be
uploaded to my channel and i should have
a link to that video at this point what
i need to do is program this NFC tag so
that when it's tapped with an android
phone that holiday greeting video
launches immediately right now this only
works for android phones since apple has
locked the iphone 6 and 6 plus as NFC
capability to only work with Apple pay
so for this I'll use trigger which is a
free app for Android I'll hit the plus
sign to create a new task and select NFC
hit next and then done now we'll create
the task so we'll hit next again hit the
plus sign to create a task and then
choose open a URL hit next and in this
window will type in the URL for the
video that I just uploaded then I'll hit
add to task hit next and now I'll grab
my NFC tag
and hold it to the back of my phone so
that it writes that action to the tag
and it's done the last thing we need to
do is adhere the NFC tag to my greeting
card and these are great because they're
actually adhesive I got a pack of 12 for
about fourteen dollars I'll just peel
the back off and put it right on the
greeting card just like that now in my
recipient receives this card they'll see
this little android logo and when they
tag it they'll get a little video
surprise hey guys I just want to wish
you happy holidays and a happy new year
if this is something you want to do with
a lot of family and friends this year
consider getting a pack of NFC tags
happy holidays I really like that very
unique and it's really geeky to all
right it's time for a quick break and
when we come back we've got a bright
idea that'll only cost you 20 bucks to
make
you
welcome back in our next segment we'll
show you how to make the most of items
already laying around your house and if
you don't have them you can easily find
them at your local hardware store donna
bell has a DIY that'll show you how to
add accent lighting for just about any
place that needs it sometimes the most
thoughtful gift is the one that you make
yourself for a gift that anyone will
enjoy but takes a bit of nerdy
electronics skill to make I'm going to
show you how to make your own candle
flicker LED tilt lamp this is based off
of David backers design for the dry
lumpy ax from my version we're going to
use a glass jar some copper wire some
stranded wire a candle flicker LED
cr2032 watch battery watch battery
holder and a tilt switch this is the
real secret ingredient hear these things
are a lot of fun to use so from 20 bucks
you can get enough of these supplies to
make about three or four these lamps to
start things off we're going to take a
length of copper wire and we're going to
mold it around into a u-shape around the
back of the battery holder here the next
step is we're going to solder the
battery holder onto the wire
finally we're going to flip it over and
that negative terminal that's on the
other side we're going to solder some
stranded wire to that and then just
leave it alone all right give it a
little tug make sure it's nice and
secure all right that looks good so
that's going to get our power everywhere
it needs to go next up we've got the
tilt switch my favorite little switch
we're going to take one leg we're going
to bend it down we're in a wire this end
so that the circuit will turn on when
the jar is turned upside down find the
place midway up on one of the copper
wires and give it a snip now solder one
of the two feet to the bottom of the
clip section then take the other foot
and solder it to the length of copper
that you just clipped off alright it's
working now we can solder on the LED
take the longer the two leads from the
LED and wrap it around the copper wire
coming from the tilt switch that's going
to be our positive side then wrap the
other lead around the opposite side
slaughter both of them in place and clip
off any extra wire now that the LED is
there to hold the shape well go back up
to the battery holder and take the
stranded wire from the negative terminal
and use the exposed bit to wrap around
the copper that's opposite from the tilt
switch and then solder that down with
that done clip away that copper that
connects the negative side to the
positive terminals and now you have a
complete circuit now for the very last
step we're going to mount it inside the
jar to do that we're going to super glue
it down to the jar lid now we're going
to use a big heaping glob of superglue
not just because it's going to hold it
in place better because it's going to
act as an insulator and keep the circuit
from interacting with the metal the lid
alright now that we've got everything
glued in place you notice we have this
extra length of copper here on the
bottom we can either just clip that off
so it'll fit in the jar or you can have
some fun with it you can bend them
around make some interesting designs
just make sure the ends of those copper
pieces don't touch each other all right
now let's give it a test let's pop in a
watch battery pay close attention to
which size positive and which size
negative all right let's screw this into
the jar give it a test
boom so there you go now you've made
your very own LED tilt lamp a very
simple design easy project for beginners
I really like this got back candle
flicker LED in there to give it a cool
vibe nice gift for kids to makes a great
night light or make a bunch of them to
have around the house they're
inexpensive to make have fun with it now
depending on Alfie use those LED lamps
you might get about five days of
continuous use however if you use them
off and on they might last for about a
month nice yeah now if you plan on
spending some time in the kitchen this
holiday season cooking for friends and
family we have a DIY accessory for your
tablet that might make things a little
bit easier hey guys you know what the
holiday season right upon us you're
probably gonna be doing a lot more
cooking than you normally would you know
when I cook I like to have a tablet
nearby so I can see my recipes but not
every tablet stand is really conducive
to kitchen cooking you know there's
flour flying everywhere there's spices
going every which way who knows so what
you can do is you can build your own DIY
tablet stand for a low price and it's
going to look a little bit more
appropriate in the kitchen so here's
what you're gonna need first you'll want
a cutting board like so a kid's triangle
shaped wooden block a wooden scrabble
towel holder and some wood glue so
here's what you're going to do first
you're gonna take your cutting board now
you can stain it you can paint your
cutting board if you want I'm going to
go for the raw natural look I really
like the natural look and feel of this
one also I'm a little lazy so you're
going to take the board you're going to
make sure first that your tablet will
actually fit on the board you want it to
be as why and as tall as your tablet so
my tablet is about nine and a half
inches tall and about seven and a half
inches wide so my cutting board
thankfully is eight and a half inches
wide and it's about a foot tall you're
gonna take your scrabble tile holder you
want to make sure first that you know
the size of the canals aren't blocked if
they're block your tablet won't actually
be able to fit in there so to make sure
those aren't blocked the wooden older
ones are better for that you're going to
take that
you can apply one stream to the back of
the towel holder so we're going to apply
that to the bottom of the cutting board
when a center as best as possible and
leave about a centimeter of space okay
now that that's drive going to move on
to the next step which is to use the
basic kids building block you don't have
either of those you can go to the
hardware store and get a piece of wood
cut for really cheap one thing you want
to make sure is that it's at least at a
40-degree angle you know if you want
this tablet to sit higher you might want
to go higher than 50 or 60 also you want
to make sure the block is at least three
inches tall okay now we're going to
apply one stream of wood glue to the
longest side here right in the middle
like this okay let's check to see if
everything's dried feels pretty secure
to me let's try it out there's a tablet
stand right there that's less than
twenty dollars you can pay more or less
that's pretty good deal for a tablet
Stan let's try it out alright there's a
recipe right there you can put it
horizontally of course of course you can
put it vertically boom it's very simple
way to build a tablet stand now you're
gonna be cooking a lot this holiday
season what better way to do that then
with a tablet right at your fingertips
and a nice appropriate looking stand
awesome
since you gave me my tablet stand I've
been using it in the kitchen and it is
super helpful it really is isn't it yes
