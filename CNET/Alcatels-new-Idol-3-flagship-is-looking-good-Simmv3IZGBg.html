series here at Mobile World Congress
2015 I'm Jessica delcourt for CNN here
in Barcelona this is the alcatel one
touch idol 3 comes in two different
sizes the 5.5 inch version which is
larger and then the smaller 4.7 inch
version now these phones look and feel
really nice even though they're plastic
they've got sort of a premium aura
surrounding them they're very thin light
and just look really nice and feel nice
in the hand one thing that's really cool
about this is that it runs Android 5.0
lollipop but there's an OS layer on top
that makes it reversible so you can
actually pick up your phone any which
way turn it upside down if you've got
this enabled and use it of course there
is a technical upside and you know that
because of the front-facing camera there
are dual speakers one on the top and one
on the bottom and when you reverse the
phone say to answer a phone call the
dominant speaker and microphone actually
switch each phone has a 13 megapixel
camera on the back and flash though the
specs are slightly different they are
stepped up on this larger version
they're a little bit scaled back on the
4.7 inch version so for example you've
got an 8 megapixel camera on the front
of the big one vs. 5 on the smaller one
more battery more memory and a higher
screen resolution you're also looking at
an octa-core processor for the larger
phone and a quad-core processor for the
smaller one there are a lot more first
impressions and details to be had as
cnet com I'm Jessica doll court taking a
first look at all katella's new flagship
one touch idol breach
