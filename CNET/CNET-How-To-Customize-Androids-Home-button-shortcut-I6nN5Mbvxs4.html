the home button does different things
of course one tap always takes you home
but a double tap or a long press does
something different on the s4 for
example a long press launches the list
of recent apps and a double tap launches
s-voice some phones let you change these
settings but on the s4 and many others
you're stuck with what you've got unless
of course you've got to work around with
my setup a long press still launches the
list of recent apps but watch this a
double tap launches the camera here's
how it's done go to the Google Play
Store and install the home to shortcut
app for free when it's done installing
launch it directly from that download
page you'll see it's a pretty bare-bones
app which is ok once this is set up you
won't really have to look at it again
here in step one choose the app you want
to launch whenever the home button is
double tapped for me I'm choosing camera
but it can be whatever app you want
quick access to no matter where you are
on the phone for now keep this interval
setting at normal you can change it
later if you find you want the response
to be faster or slower finally down here
choose the launcher you're using if you
don't have a launcher like apex or go
launcher installed or you have no clue
what I'm talking about
choose your default launcher for me
that's TouchWiz and you're almost set
hit the home button then choose home to
shortcut and hit always now let's see if
it works
give that home button a double tap and
you should see your shortcut in action
if you're on the s4 and it's still
launching s-voice go to the s-voice
settings and uncheck this option that
should fix it if you're liking this
shortcut business home 2 also lets you
program combos like home and in the back
button or home
and then menu give them a try if you
want quick access to other apps too
all right guys if you have any questions
