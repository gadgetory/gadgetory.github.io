to the buzz report the show about the
tech news that everyone is talking about
this week Facebook gets a spanking ATT
get some poker playing advice and
gadgets make with the special effects
excitement but first it's the gadget of
the week the gadget of the week is the
asuste transformer prime tablet which I
gotta say I thought we were past getting
excited over tablets especially
five-hundred-dollar tablets but the
transformer prime is hot it has a
quad-core NVIDIA Tegra 3 processor in a
body that's thinner and lighter than the
ipad 2 there's a gig of internal memory
up to 64 gigs of on-board storage plus a
microSD slot for more super IPS display
front and back cameras and a sue says it
will get Android 4.3 manwich early next
year all that is thick as hell plus
there's an optional $150 laptop dock
that adds a keyboard a second battery
USB ports and a full-size SD card slot I
mean I didn't even know that my cold
cold heart could fall in love again like
that one and now for the news facebook
settled a major privacy dispute with the
federal government this week and agreed
to a few changes the biggest one
facebook now has to let you opt in to
any changes that would override your
current privacy settings yeah opt-in
like remember that one time when
Facebook made your gender your current
city your name your profile picture and
the pages that you like public without
telling you we're giving you the option
to change it back they can't do that
anymore but they can introduce new
features like places or something like
that and then make all that information
public by default win some lose some
still Facebook will have to endure
yearly privacy prostate exams for the
next 20 years and we all get yet another
apology note from Mark Zuckerberg which
really you must have like a macro for
writing those by now in good job
government news 18 tease attempt to buy
t-mobile is seriously on the ropes the
FCC officially opposed the merger this
week saying it would dramatically reduce
competition and lead to
massive layoffs which duh the FCC also
released and then retracted a huge
report that basically said ATT had
engaged in crazytown doublespeak to try
to push the merger through and that 18t
had no factual basis at all for its
claims that the merger would increase
competition lower prices and lead to
more jobs again duh 18t withdrew its
application to buy t-mobile and it's now
trying to come up with some other
strategy to get the deal done that
strategy could include trying to sell
off massive amounts of its own assets to
make itself seemed small enough for the
deal to make sense which doesn't make
sense that doesn't you know eighty I
think it might be time to take some
advice from our friend of the gambler
flees right you got
know when to fold up know when to walk
away and now for some action jack-kun HP
this week denied reports from Columbia
University researchers who said that
networked HP laser printers can be
hacked sent new software remotely
controlled and even remotely set on fire
HP strongly disputed those findings
which why would you deny this that is
some seriously awesome James Bond right
there all right okay I get it I
understand just saying I know some
printers that i would like to remotely
incinerate I mean pc load letter I don't
even know what that means in other
electronics excitement this week an
iphone 4 overheated in the middle of a
flight over australia passengers and
flight attendants reported that the
phone started emitting a red glow and
lots of dense smoke the phone was
quickly extinguished and an
investigation is ongoing does anyone
else find it funny that the phone only
smoked and glowed red I mean men that
thing really doesn't support flash does
it bless the phone is obviously an alien
just saying don't you guys watch any
movies at all and finally guess what we
are clogging the tubes this week see
last week buzz report producer Sarah
Harbin writer Jeff Sparkman and I
collaborated on the video hitler reacts
to the pepper spray meme and which
hitler is mad that the pepper spray cop
became a meme so fast anyway it's a
Arianna Huffington even tweeted it we
are so proud of our inappropriate humor
and thank you all for watching it and if
you haven't already go watch it it's
hilarious and that's the buzz report for
this week everyone i'm molly wood and
i'll see you next
