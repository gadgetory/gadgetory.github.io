driverless car race the state's governor
rick snyder just signed a bill that
would allow the operation and eventual
sale of autonomous vehicles while other
states including nevada and california
already allow for their testing and
operation michigan is the first to make
it legal to have them on the roads
without a driver behind the wheel or
steering wheel altogether but the state
can't take all the credit it had a
little help from some of its automotive
friends who already had some cards in
the self-driving game General Motors
Ford Fiat Chrysler automobiles Google
Toyota uber and lyft are all said to
have contributed to make sure the bill
actually did something impactful and
even with industry input there may be a
few players feeling a bit left out the
bill states that companies like Apple
Google and uber who may be working on
their own prototypes or the technology
for these prototypes will only be
included if the companies work with a
vehicle manufacturer and it complies
with the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration lyft already announced a
partnership with GM to roll out a fleet
of self-driving Chevy Volt electric
vehicles while Ford plans to sell
thousands of autonomous vehicles for
ride-sharing purposes starting in 2021
the law is set to go into effect
immediately
so Michigan will officially become the
nation's guinea pig to see if these cars
actually make the road safer and for
