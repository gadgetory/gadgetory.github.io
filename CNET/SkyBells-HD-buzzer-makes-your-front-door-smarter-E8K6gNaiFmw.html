when it comes to the whole smart home
industry and we've reviewed about five
models so far and the first few just
really didn't impress us but this model
the third-generation skybell HD is
really awesome
basically it combines all the features
you'd want from a front doorbell that is
also connected to the Internet and has a
built in camera it has an HD 1080p live
stream it has motion alerts it has free
clip storage and it integrates with
Amazon's Alexa if and nest so you can
integrate it with your indoor nest cam
that's a lot of smart home integrations
with third parties that you don't find
with other models that we really liked
Alexa tell sky Belle to record video
your sky build device is now recording
it's also easy to set up it's easy to
use the app is really intuitive and it's
responsive there was very little lag
time between when a motion event was
triggered or I actually press the
doorbell and I received a push alert one
thing I really wish it had was more in
app configurations the resolution for
instance is 1080p that's at the high end
of your options and it can take up a lot
of bandwidth so if you have spy internet
connection you're kind of out of luck
all in all I think the skybell HD video
doorbell is an awesome product that I
definitely recommend especially if
you're interested in third-party
integrations</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
