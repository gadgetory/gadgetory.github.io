show only on cnet TV I am Jeff Bakalar
and I am Justin you and this is the show
where hey the 90 hey it's the nineties
people are doing crazy things you know
screw it we're doing it all ourselves
today cats and dogs living together yes
hysteria look down there it is there it
is so I hope you're watching the video
today because we've got a lot of really
special camera shots we decided to rig
up all the cameras today to show exactly
what we're doing I've got like this
keyboard ivory set up here hello kitty
ivories so basically I didn't over let's
be totally honest what's going on today
you know we got a lot of people out
South by Southwest yeah you talked to
mark let's say you're talking Richard
Peterson you're talking Bridget Carey
and I think Brian and Molly are out
there too right uh we were gonna go but
then we realized that we hate Texas yeah
I don't like standing for a long time
and I heard there's a shortage of chairs
at South by yeah so we decided to forgo
such an event maybe plan better next
time yeah and jump in next year you know
with both feet so I was kind of hoping
to check out some of the bands that were
playing this year yeah me too i'm a
little bitter about that I heard one of
my one of my new favorite bands of the
month is gonna be there what's that foxy
shazam oh I think they're gonna be there
yeah they are so good how did you
describe their sound again it is like
kind of a mash-up between two bands
they're like if Queen and I don't know
what got together okay they're very like
epic rock yeah the vocalist has like
that high-pitched Freddie Oh like the
darkness yeah that's right they have a
darkness in Queen had a baby and it's
called foxy shazam yeah I wanted to go
cuz Andrew W K is gonna be right and
he's doing the whole I get wet records
right something that he's playing the
entire I get way which is awesome friend
of the show Andrew W K yeah that's right
so uh you know it's just Justin me today
we're really excited about that because
I think we've done some of our best
stuff just you and me shooting
I agree the credit should be shot yeah
where the shooter and it will be shot
accordingly and a short show today
because we'd love we just door I think
that's a very aesthetically visually
pleasing composition right there so
we're looking at the TriCaster these are
this is like the control panel we use
right which the camera is like insider
stuff is like behind the scenes stuff
now I get to see that this is like
podcasting 101 here and we're learning
this as we go to but so this is my shot
you want to look at what Jeff's working
with his hands right here you know as a
paper I like bringing this up and
bringing this down hey I'm gonna put
that up and put that down yeah I'm gonna
go up with these three down with these
you know what I'm saying there's a lot
of ins and outs and what-have-yous yeah
people think we just sit around like you
know I don't know what there's not
clothes on here no it's not it's never
like that yeah kidding me we we started
wearing pants once the cameras got put
into yeah yeah also they got cold in
here too hmm so anyway yeah let's get to
some of the stories for today cuz it's
gonna be kind of a short show only it's
Friday and also and I knees it's the 90s
it's Friday you know crazy things
started happening in the 90s speaking of
the 90s this is kind of a cool story
yeah obviously you've seen home alone I
have and it's a subsequent sequels I've
only have abs hurt oh you're talking
about old man Duncan tells ya the third
one no wasn't I didn't see the third one
the third one's not McCullough third
ones like that weird kid the second one
is lost in New York right where the Wet
Bandits become these sticky bandits
right and Marvin Harry it magically
escaped jail and going up in the back of
a fish market in exactly man this thing
was like they put taper on their hands
and they would put it in like a donation
like a Salvation Army but a bucket just
feel like 78 cents at a time yeah they
don't really I mean in 1995 that was a
lot of money in New York you could you
know rent a hotel room at the Plaza
right right now you can't no no what you
can do is you can buy the original house
from home alone well you look at but now
it's sold so this actually went on sale
last May talked about that yeah we
talked about it uh god it's so crazy how
we look followed up all these doors yeah
this is a short
I'm not sure anyone has followed up on
us how do you remember talking about
this story yeah are you sure we covered
hundred percent positive bummer yeah
okay anyway time flies when you're doing
work the same thing every day uh so this
is from the 1920s it's like this mansion
that was featured in the home alone
movie yes and it went on sale in Chicago
took in Chicago's North Shore but here
it is it finally sold for 1.6 million
dollars that's actually a lot less than
what the owners wanted to get out i was
going to say that doesn't that looks
like a two-million-dollar house yeah I
know it's beautiful I mean it's like
fashion after a 1920s manage they were
asking 2.4 originally for it if now I
have a question did they actually um
shoot inside that house for the movie oh
they did yeah so we can actually take a
virtual oh let us please let's do this
right now um so yeah all right when you
walk in you get that staircase where
they you know we slid down so they shot
the hole in this freaking house yeah
yeah yeahs think it's really cool they
actually wanted to shoot in it for Uncle
Buck to really dating secure it so they
had to do it for home alone the movie
that came after i wanna this is this
maybe is a little tangential but you
know a lot this is what we do on fridays
yeah okay get to f it feel like there
are certain sets on TV sitcom family
room sets yeah use aim more than once oh
I'm trying to think of what that I think
one of them is step by step okay when
the staircase on the light and odd there
charlie sheen show no odd bottom two and
a half men no yeah I don't know I feel
like and maybe the chatham can help us
out because I'm almost positive there's
at least two or three sitcoms that
shared the same set may be on the same
lot maybe they want to you know break
the set down and they wanted to keep it
together ya feel like there are certain
and you know they're completely designed
differently you don't I mean like right
totally different color schemes but the
furniture the bare bones the blueprints
of that set are intact right I don't
know what the hell those ones are though
I'm trying to yeah I feel like I've had
this thought before when I've been
watching and they're only they're always
in the 90s 20 it was like the living
room set up and there's a staircase on
the left hand side next to the
difference I feel like spit is it like I
don't know I feel it's like I can't I
can't put my finger on it yeah
so maybe it's just that maybe it's just
that sitcoms use the same sort of you
know visually pleasing layout because
that's what works for television right
no II mean that makes sense that makes
more sense I feel like it's like boy
meets world and step by step or
something like that or there yet and
then you have like full house and like
family strangers yeah perfect strangers
in the apartment right you know they're
in New York hmm that's weird i want to
know i wanna i really want to know about
that because that's really what's okay
wait so cherish night says Children's
Hospital and scrubs what first off
scrubs was really in a hospital that
looked like what I don't know and
children hospital appears to look like
it's in hospital to that's not bad we're
talking talking about sitcom taped in
front of a live studio audience right
that sort of stuff well anyway we'll let
the chatroom kind of percolate on that a
little bit let's go back to this home
alone house this is really cool so
here's the kitchen where all that one
scene happened yeah all he updated its
updated right like what you did a little
jerk yeah awesome it looks pretty
awesome so yeah I mean there's been a
lot of improvements made to the inside
of the house since the 90s has been 25
years after all it's pretty dope when
did the original uh one of the original
homeland movie come out I want to get
bummed about how old I feel I'm gonna
say 1988 really 190 all I think you
should look that up because I guru that
I kind of oh man I I want to say it's
1990 an idea oh my god it's been 22 22
years since little Macaulay Culkin
single-handedly took down to violent
birdie yeah with like a bunch of silly
string and micro machines yeah have you
seen him lately so I was watching a show
last night I was watching bravo your
watch and they interviewed wilmer
valderama valderrama and they're like
hey you're tight with Macaulay Culkin
yeah whys he looking all you know
emaciated yeah he looks all drugged out
and he said that it was in the case he
said that you know that was just the
crappy photo cheese he looks okay here I
mean maybe he just had a rough night
party maybe he
shouldn't be drinking red bull because I
just don't think his heart can take it
ya know it he does look terrible there
but that's fine he look man he looks he
I'm not trying to be fine he looks sick
yeah you know he looks fine this is what
I look like in the morning now is duh
you red bull man you he makes you look
like a fatty mcfatterson telling you man
that's brutal really weird on um all
right we'll move away from the from the
80s reminiscing nineties reminiscing
we'll get to some show voicemails later
on where the topic of movies in their
decade comes up again okay but for now I
really want to talk about this because
you know we've been getting a lot of
calls from people everyone's like hey
it's so refreshing to hear cnet not love
apple for five seconds right I'm saying
like right and you know it's not that
we're we're trying to take the the
opposite position we're just trying to
take a side of the you know we're trying
to look at everything and differently as
possible and let people know it's not
all sunshine and roses right um the new
update for the iphone came out yeah and
apparently it's displaying a 4g logo now
that's part of the update so believe we
have a screenshot we can check out right
here so check this out this so i updated
my phone yesterday notta i OS 5.1 it's
really convenient you can just do it if
you're attached to a Wi-Fi network right
and i did it took about half an hour and
when i updated i looked and there's this
little 4g in the corner now so assuming
i was assuming that this is like a 4G
connection i would get 4G speeds on it
um Apple's claiming that you can get
about 72 megabits per second on the down
no that seems crazy to me that's like
internet home no that's that doesn't
sound right yeah but uh what's
surprising to me is that they just sort
of apparently are displaying a you know
a logo that is not accurate right right
and I wanted to get somebody in here
that like Scott or something that could
talk about the network but I looked up
and did a little bit of research so the
iphone runs on spca plus right hspa+ now
it's very confusing a lot of
letters and plus ly symbol which is
actually faster than 3G but not quite as
fast as 4G right and so the next iPhone
when it comes out probably in September
I'm assuming yeah we'll probably be 4g
speeds for now this is a little
deceptive I think this is telling people
that it's a 4g phone it's not a fortune
what's strange about this though is what
had recently happened so the ITU which I
my guess is just some sort of like
institution that dictates standardized
speeds and and wireless cellular
networks right arm it's the
International Telecommunication Union
and apparently the standards at which
they set a 4g phone must adhere to yeah
they seem to have backpedaled on what
constitutes a 4g phone and it's weird
because it's like oh they just did it so
Apple could maybe get away with putting
that 4G logo on their phone it's kind of
messed up right it's kind of not cool
and it almost feels like if you just
look at the chain of events and infer
it's sort of just like oh they're doing
it just because Apple said they write
this to be displayed on their phone it's
like Apple letting Apple create the
rules for which they can put whatever
they want on the phone which is a little
suspect regardless officially now the
ITU is recognizing that the iphone is
technically a 4g phone yeah i mean
that's that's what gizmodo saying here
that's interesting but on you know like
also the verge did their own their own
spy comparison here yeah and it it was
literally getting the exact same speeds
as a 3g so there's hardly any jump
whatsoever so check this out so there so
are they saying that the 4g they're
saying that supposedly even after the 4g
update on the phone yeah you're still
getting about the same megabits per
second that but up yeah I'm not worried
we're looking at 1.58 megabit down yeah
this is in New York yeah I think I think
that's looking like 3g is looking like
3g numbers right there yeah that's been
really that easy yeah I mean is that not
a sus buts shady cool that's shady I
like that you know uh
what's going on the general iOS 5.1
update was a little disappointing to
there's really nothing else that has
been that's new you know like in terms
of an upgrade you get additional
Japanese series support really matter no
nominees no mum Japanese and then you
get like a little camera icon when you
just press the home button you can swipe
that up and go directly to the camera
application also not that couldn't do
that on my ice cream sandwich phone for
about four months yeah so I'll call me
when you come up with something clever
yeah i mean what's you know what I mean
don't talking to the side of your mouth
like I can't I'm just saying like yeah
you know they roll out these arbitrary
updates that a lot of people have been
enjoying for a while yeah and I'm
supposed to you know bow down Neil pray
come on it's not gonna happen i'm gonna
happen screw you Apple it's just funny
though you know you think about like all
of these labels it's like these 4G
labels right it's all arbitrate does its
marketing target is generally what those
words and spin I mean yeah yeah it's
really upsetting and I feel like the
more and more people educate themselves
about what exactly the kind of crap
they're getting shoveled in their face
right you know it's better for us I also
feel like people aren't realizing what
they're doing with their phones probably
don't necessitate 4G speeds like for
example i'm on 3g right now i've never
had to complain about you know like
browsing speed you're not being well
this is you haven't had the pleasure
yeah that's probably true too i mean i'm
downloading you know 40 megabyte audio
files in less than like a minute what do
you download a podcast okay yeah like
when you're on the go yeah I'm doing it
and it's like no problem right and
that's special there just needs to be a
standard across all of the handsets and
networks I feel I agreement it needs to
be a naming standard hey minute well
don't even get me started with the names
we'll get to some of that in a little
bit before we start hitting the
voicemails and the emails I want to go
to a story here by wired wires claiming
that up when you type words with your
left hand that actually might shape the
meaning of said words yeah this is kind
of a crazy story so you know we can kind
of tell the like the nuances of language
and things like sorry
chasm by the tone of your voice a
quarter deliver speech of course you
know like if I was like hey Jess nice
shirt dude Thanks you know I mean like
that's clearly sarcasm you could
actually find out those nuances in the
way that people type out the characters
online right so these this is like a
social psychologists study that came out
and wired is profiling this they're
saying that people attach more positive
meetings two words that are typed that
contain letters that you type with your
right hand because it's actually easier
to type those letters out because most
people are right-handed and that's their
dominant but also it's because there are
more letters on the qwerty keyboard that
exists that you type with your right
hand and your left and just an easy
thing yeah so if you compare the amount
of letters you I remember the exact
number is well I bet there's more on
your right hand oh I bet it's a
staggering amount I bet it's like three
two one right and I was intentionally
created because there are more
right-handed than left-handers well if
you look at yeah I was trying to I was
trying to sound smart but again I'm just
trying to think like my right hand the
way i look at the keyboard here right is
i mean i feel like this right hand
touches from like the are diagonal down
almost even though it's probably only
supposed to do like what the why you
ever yeah yeah well that is common the
properties right of course I feel like I
i flirt with that appropriate type of
typing but my right hand just does
whatever it wants right yeah i mean i
mean this study is kind of nebulous i'm
seeing taking it with a big grain of
salt here but i feel like you could tell
more about the way people type by the
pressure they put on the keys there
should be some kind of application that
can test how hard you're pressing the
keys yeah like when you get angry just
like really you're allowed typer is that
why you're bringing that up because
you're an angry typer I am I get pissed
yeah you put a lot of emotion into it
you just hate keys on counter um before
we get to our our emails and voicemails
I want to bring up our lovely friends at
Nintendo they're actually doing

voicemails and emails I got an email
from patrick p mmm this is crazy and I
guess he was talking about the you know
taking a photo with your phone something
that so he uses a lot of cuss words do
so I'm gonna have to tread very lightly
here he goes real Android users don't
give an F we got a torrent and
third-party sources you gonna edit your
pics in iphoto like a bee I guess like a
bitch I'll plug my blank into your USB
port you want to talk about cameras I
won't be holding up no shoe boxes I
guess he's talking about like your net
photo with an iPad
I'll keep that shizz on the DL 7030 and
then he lists like the sea was like eff
scott numbers and I so do so strange
like a like a boss then I'll Jack that
into the into my a to hundreds USB port
and pop that shizz with a touch and boom
I don't get is it supposed to be set to
music I don't know goes I thought you
knew bakalar I thought you knew well sir
you have put me in my place my god I
feel like I've been served you skipped
over the best part where he was like I'm
also gonna up that shiz to picasa web
this is a terabyte wrap I don't know who
is it is exactly no no no no rolling us
so was asking me about terabyte the
other day terabyte has taken a hiatus of
absence if you will so anyway thanks for
the email Patrick I guess yeah I don't
know he was listening to like Eminem or
something there is uh this is from Dave
the app aholic that we're calling now
right he said he thought he would
actually have a little fun with his appt
addiction email he says of course that
number which was in the for thousands of
apps he said that number comes from apps
purchaser download after the last four
years he looked back at his first four
apps and he bought a few apps those are
purchase on July eleventh two thousand
eight but then he goes down to sort of
calculate what he actually has been
paying he was the last time I checked
listen this the average was about a
dollar 15 per app so yes 4780 for apps
times a dollar fifteen equals 5501
dollar and sixty cents so over four
years that's been almost 1400 bucks a
year that's the price of a decent imac
so yeah he's been getting spending a lot
of money I can't believe that and he's
admitting it to which i think is super
brave I mean I think it's fine if he's
actually spending time playing these
apps and getting a good life span yeah
you know me but if he's doing what I
think everyone does with their iphone
apps look at them for three minute and
then forget it forget about it yeah
delete it because they get lost in the
ether and because there no one can
is a no one's been dancing funny don't
you yes I I mean Dave if you can afford
it more power to you man it must be nice
being able to for fourteen dollars of
abs a year yeah that's sick man if you
can afford it more power to you I would
not spend I'm sure there's some sort of
12-step program you can enroll you're
right stop that and why are you paying
six dollars for solitaire that's what my
quest don't pay for a sitter 599 for a
game called solitaire forever which I
can't imagine me much different than a
thousand other free solid I don't know
you're you make a damn good point I do
not know um Wisconsin from James writes
in about the ipad name while it may be
confusing to not call the new ipad the
ipad 3 most apple products haven't had
this type of naming recently all the
ipods are just referred to as their
generation number which i think sucks
and is not easy what i like that why do
you like that it's the same thing that's
calling it you know like ipod 2002 it's
the same idea no you should do well now
called the year the point is that so
that if you can if you wanted to buy an
accessory for it but news models have
subsequently come out now you can just
go back and be like oh i have the 3g
model it's hogwash it's hogwash he goes
people had to figure out what generation
they had with the ipods and now it
sounds like it's going to be the same
deal with ipads and most likely the
iphone James thinks that the next iPhone
is just going to be called iphone yeah
which I mean I don't know all the four
heads in the world would be slapped I
think it would be especially confusing
to call the next generation iphone the
iphone 5 because it's technically the
sixth generation iphone people already
called the iphone for the iphone 4g and
thought that the 4g speeds when it did
it daddy areata you're right it gets
confusing which is why my vote is for
the year yeah and and the difference is
you don't really talk about macbooks
with other people but you always bring
out your iphone you do and then you say
what kind of iphone your iphone other
the answer iphone 13 iphone 14 yeah did
in 2013 big effing deal calls from the
public time to show the love
for scenic all right this is bernard
bringing up very very relevant and
important oh you're gonna see how i do
the yeah okay the writing let's see okay
Bernard DM i will now click on this one
hello this is benari from hampton
virginia and i had a question regarding
episode 1003 we have the gutenberg on
and Justin made a comment saying that
the Ghostbusters had that 80s nostalgia
and the crappy cg on things like that
well my question is if that movie
represented the eighties type of
atmosphere fuel what movies would you
save represented are made more so like
the 2000s and late 91 movies would you
say fall in that area I was curious to
see which one to come up would you say
the matrix a conception which okay well
i wouldn't i wouldn't say matrix or
inception because those are science
fiction movies yes already stopping what
we're talking about and correct me if
i'm wrong and i want you to die this is
the way I wanted you to sort of speak
about this okay and maybe I'm inferring
the wrong thing when you talked about
Ghostbusters representing the 80s that
to me meant like New York in the ad
right like that like an escape from me
right not necessarily like oh we when
the eighties we thought it was going to
be giant marshmallow right right right
so it's tough to equate the matrix to
the 90s because that was just like a
filmmaking aesthetic as opposed to a
reflection of pop culture and and an
American rife in the eighties right with
that said would you agree a an accurate
representation of 90s life for film
would be something like mall rats yeah
yeah I think that is it I think's lat I
think those movies nail it I think
hackers even nails it yeah as hackers is
like Manhattan in the 90s you know what
really hit it for me was a reality bites
yes you see that rate example yes one of
my daughter Stacy's favorite film it's
amazing higher records yeah what a great
90's movie for sure the 2000s like
american pie no that was 90 does that
nine
yeah I'm trying to say and hardly wait
yeah yeah I know when you you know I all
those like 90s horror movies actor even
