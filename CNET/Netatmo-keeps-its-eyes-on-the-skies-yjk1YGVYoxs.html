taking a look at the netatmo weather
station this is a two-part device you're
going to get an indoor and the smaller
outdoor module and both of them are
going to keep track of the environment
they're going to take the temperature
monitor the humidity you're even going
to measure things like co2 levels and
sound and all that information is going
to go straight to the netatmo app for
Android and iOS devices as well as the
netatmo website the indoor module plugs
in by a micro USB while the outdoor
module uses triple-a batteries two of
them you'll unscrew it and unscrew these
and put those batteries in this to me
was kind of frustrating because you have
to really unscrew these things and pull
it out to get to the battery compartment
and it isn't totally clear on which way
the batteries go is a little confusing
so if you do it wrong and try it out
you'll have to unscrew everything all
over again to get those back in not a
huge deal but still not a perfect design
that said in our test this kit did
pretty well it was very accurate it was
responsive and it told us what we wanted
to know the app is very clean and fun to
play with especially on iPads or other
tablet or you get a little more real
estate on the screen to play with it's
easy to use and it's got a lot of
functionality packed into it another
cool thing about this device is that it
has a really comprehensive if to channel
so all that information that you're
taking in temperature humidity co2
levels noise you'll be able to use those
as triggers for your ifft recipes if you
want to have the switch in your bedroom
turn on whenever it gets too warm and
turn a fan on you can do that with this
system still this isn't the only product
that offers that level of environmental
triggering capabilities and at 179
dollars i'm not sure that it's the most
cost-effective we've tested out the
quirky and GE spotter that's a
fifty-dollar device that can monitor
sound and light and temperature humidity
and trigger all of that on ifft and
there's also the dedicated weather
channel on if that uses the iOS weather
app and so you can trigger things based
on the relative outdoor temperature and
factors like that without having to buy
an expensive kit like this I'll confess
I'm not much of a weather geek I've
never really tracked the co2 levels in
my home or worried about the UV index
outside and if you're not that type of
person either I don't know that the
netatmo weather station will get you
there it's not going to build sudden
interest in those things and after a
while it might actually become
boring but if you do have an interest in
whether if you find it fascinating or if
you have a greenhouse or a wine cellar
someplace that you need to keep tabs on
I think the net at mo could work really
well it's an easy to use product that
worked well in our tests give accurate
readings and I like the app the app is
pretty and fun to play with I can't say
that I would rush out to buy one but I'm
not going to say that doesn't mean that
you should we're seen it I'm right Chris</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
