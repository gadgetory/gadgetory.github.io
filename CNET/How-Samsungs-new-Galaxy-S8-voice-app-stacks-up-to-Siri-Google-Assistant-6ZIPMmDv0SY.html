beatbox kinda fix feet is rolling out as
a sneak peak to Galaxy s8 owners as long
as you signed up to test it out
Samsung said that Bigsby voice is
designed to help you use your phone
better rather than just search online or
tell you the weather but we still want
to see how it compares to Google
assistant and Siri and remember this is
an early version of Bigsby voice sorry
not everything is fully functional yet
let's start with the easy stuff what's
the weather in San Francisco set an
alarm for 6:00 a.m.
take a selfie
turn on Bluetooth okay I turned on
bluetooth turn on the flashlight change
the wallpaper to the most recent photo
okay we can set our wallpaper here fix P
gets it right
Google searches the web these pictures
should match and Siri brings up my
oldest photos but it still kind of knows
what I want to do Bixby lets you open an
app and perform an action in one go so
you can say app specific commands like
open Instagram and post a recent photo
okay let's write a caption for this post
looks like Google assistant is searching
the web and poor old Siri knows she can
do more I wish I could but Instagram
hasn't set that up with me yet Google
assistant does this first time send a
whatsapp message to Charlie chat with
Charlie sure and Siri should but she's
struggling with the spelling whatsapp
didn't find the contact charlie code do
you want to send it to see which one
Bixby needs a bit of training to know to
open whatsapp and if you don't say it in
the right way it will open the default
message app send a whatsapp message to
Charlie not seeing that contact but if
you get the phrasing right it does work
open whatsapp and send a message to
Charlie alright let's enter your message
here one of google assistant strengths
is a continued conversation show me Sean
Connery movies Sean Connery's movies
include doctor no Goldfinger and 59
others how old is he he's 6 feet 2
inches tall Siri can't have this
conversation I found some Sean Connery
movies how tall is he
here's what I found on the web for how
tall is he and Bixby can't even get out
the gate with that syntax I couldn't
find it but does search the internet if
you ask it the right way
what Maeby's has Sean Connery been in
here is what I found on the web
read my last email I found this in your
Gmail Google assistant can't do it
series got this one though here's an
email message but convict's be ok
emails up don't think she can it's way
too soon to call a winner because this
is just an early look at some of the
things fixity voice can do but stay
tuned as Samsung rolls out more features
which one charlie
which one charlie which one the first
one ready to send it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
