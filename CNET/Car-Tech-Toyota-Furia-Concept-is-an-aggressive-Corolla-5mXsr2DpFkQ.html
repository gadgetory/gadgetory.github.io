with cnet.com and we're on the floor at
the 2013 Detroit Auto Show and we're
taking a look at the Toyota Corolla
furia concept
now this Furia concept is a very
forward-looking peek at the future of
Toyotas Corolla so underneath a lot of
this concept car aggressiveness we're
seeing a lot of the same design cues
that we saw debut on the toyota camry
and most recently on the new toyota
avalon if you look right here you'll see
this sort of like grille that just kind
of flows into the headlight and unites
the whole front of the car with one big
chrome element you'll see that on the
avalon these LED headlights also
reminiscent of the avalon and even if
you look at this big lower grille
opening you'll see that even though
you've got a lot of carbon fiber and
aggressiveness here that same sort of
kidney beams shape that you'll see in
the avalon is still there if you blur
your eyes around back you'll see
generally the same tail lamp shape that
we saw again in the Toyota Avalon
although this is a lot more aggressive
with these LED elements some concept
only features that will definitely not
make it to production are these little
bubbles that are kind of suspended in
the turn signal and of course all of
this carbon fiber that pretty much just
surrounds the vehicle with the spoiler
the lower balance here and then again on
the side skirts
now the next Toyota Corolla hasn't
actually been announced or anything like
that but we can expect that when it does
eventually hit the market it'll look
something like this I'm an Swan good
