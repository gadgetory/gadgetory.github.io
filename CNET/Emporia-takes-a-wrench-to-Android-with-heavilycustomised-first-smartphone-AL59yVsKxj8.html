to see net here at Mobile World Congress
in 2014
checking out a smartphone with a unique
twist on Android it's the Emporia
Emporia smart let's take a look so the
idea with this phone has been to make it
as simple as possible it's running
Android version of 4.3 but you wouldn't
know it to look at it because it's been
so heavily customized the interface as
you can see it's just these really
simple blocks and I'm told that this
phone was built on the premise of what
you press is what you get so for example
if I tap the battery you get a little
in-depth analysis of how much power is
left and if I press over here on the
signal you get a little breakdown of
that as well it comes with a stylus and
it also has hardware keys along the
bottom here for call answering and for
ending your calls if I spin it round on
to the side you can see here there's a
button with a little light bulb on it
and what that does is trigger the flash
so that you can use the phone as a
flashlight so some nice touches then and
another one is this plastic prong on the
end of the charging cable now what that
means is that you're not able to plug
the microUSB prong in the wrong way
apart from that you get a 4.5 inch
screen with a 640 by 560 pixel
resolution it's got an 8 megapixel
camera on the back and a 1 megapixel
camera on the front it has a 1.2
gigahertz quad-core processor - so it
should be reasonably powerful it's gonna
cost 200 euros when it comes out in
Europe towards the end of this year I'm
told that there are plans for us launch
but it's not going to happen in 2014
what do you think of the Android
customization and are you tempted to buy
let me know and check out cnet.com for
loads more from mobile or Congress 2014
