Dreyfuss and welcome to rumor has it the
show where we round up the week's
biggest tech rumors and then we vote on
which ones on legit and what seems like
it will never ever happen and remember
that you can vote on all the rumors too
so keep your eye out for the pull in the
interactive player if you're watching on
cnet first up Google might be releasing
a new Chromebook with a touch screen
citing the Chinese language newspaper
commercial times digit time said that
the search company will launch a
12-point 85 inch chrome book soon
possibly by the end of the year
according to the report Google placed an
order with its taiwan-based manufacturer
compiled for 20 million of the new
devices previous Chromebooks were
manufactured by Acer and Samsung this
one interestingly it would be
google-branded hmm this rumor seems
likely to me touchscreen is already a
big part of the Google landscape and
with windows 8 focusing more on touch
google has to compete but if they're
really going to get this ready by the
end of the year they better get crackin
agreed everybody's pretty much finished
up their Hanukkah shopping maybe we'll
see it at CES in January next Xbox World
magazine sent gamers into a frenzy
reporting that the new xbox supposedly
codenamed durango we'll have a new
version of Connect a blu-ray drive and
an AV port for watching and possibly
recording TV shove blammo oh and another
new thing that this xbox 720 durango
will supposedly have a brand new
controller you doing over there ok
nice music every breath okay obviously
this is very exciting and I might need
to get karine a brown paper bag to
breathe into Xbox world editor-in-chief
stands by these leaked specs but where
they got them from is unclear there were
also some other nerdy specs leaked in
this rumor directional audio and
augmented reality glasses as an add-on I
need those glasses when can I get those
glasses like gosh we do not know when
you can get those glasses like all
previous Xbox 720 Durango rumors this
one has no time frame unfortunately next
up last month that was announced that
Disney purchase Lucasfilm leading
everybody in their wookies to speculate
what was next for the star wars
franchise the best rumor of all and
probably the least likely to happen came
from British tabloid site The Daily
Express citing industry insiders saying
that Disney plans to have Darth Vader
return to play a significant role in a
new trilogy I have a bad feeling about
this so I don't think that there's any
way they're going to spoiler alert for
an almost 30 year old movie bring Vader
back from the dead without legions of
Star Wars fans freaking out also we've
seen him as a kid we've seen him as a
teenager we've seen him as an adult as a
really gross adult under a helmet we've
seen him as a ghost hanging out with
Yoda like what else is there for him to
do wait in line at the DMV well I mean
maybe since it is a Disney movie he'll
be brought back from the dead with a
kiss from Sleeping Beauty right or maybe
he'll sing I mean his daughter is a
Disney Princess now whoa that is blowing
my mind or maybe they cloned him and now
his clone is back or maybe they'll just
unearthed a hologram of him telling land
that he saw he was such a bad dad I
don't know I mean I guess that would
make fans freaked out too I think the
only thing that would incite more fan
rage is that they put Jar Jar Binks
inside the vader costume what do you
guys think will Vader rise again will
there be a new trilogy will Vader sing
and dance don't forget to vote and leave
us a comment on the blog while we ask
the cnet council what they think the
cnet Council is composed of five editors
who cast their votes anonymously their
opinions are not an endorsement by cnet
or CBS interactive obviously because
these are rumors folks and the cement
councils verdict is no for out of our
five editors said absolutely not cross
their hearts and hope to die Vader will
not come back and one of them said sure
well that's our share of your Betty
