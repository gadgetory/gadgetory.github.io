Prius into a family joining the original
is the bigger V the more electrified
plug-in and this the smaller C let's
drive the cheapest way to get a Prius
badge in your garage and check the tech
no cars should look that much like one
of these but color aside the Prius C is
a smaller Prius in both engine and in
total package size it weighs 2,500
pounds about as little as a production
car does these days and 500 pounds less
than a standard Prius it's 19 inches
shorter and as a 3 foot smaller turning
radius that makes a real difference when
you're parking or making that illegal
u-turn you always do
you've got several displays inside this
guy with this kind of weird offset
dashboard it's very much Prius like up
there you've got a multi information
display all of these prius c's have that
one this one is only in the upper two
trim levels the three and the four and I
think it's optional as a package or a
line item in each case it's a very
simple navigation system as you can see
it's on a small screen as well but I've
got an apps button that means I've got a
version of Toyotas in tune service in
here you've got Pandora you've got fuel
price lookup Bing search this is a
different interface that we've seen
before I don't like it nearly as much
but it's a lower cost unit so I get it
endless screens on here to check out
your energy consumption and pat yourself
on the back and even told there's a way
you can input the MPG of your other car
and this one will tell you how much
you're saving by driving this car but
all this cabin tech in here is not the
point to my mind on a Prius C I would
not load it up like this in fact you may
have seen a recent survey by RL pulp the
big car data company that indicated that
only 35% of folks who had a hybrid
bought another one in 2011 when they
replaced the car so it's a pretty small
number of return customers they're
finding out they can do just as well in
many cases with a small lean four
cylinder gas engine car and I'd have to
earn back the premium on a hybrid we'll
talk more about pricing later the rest
of this cabin is pretty familiar Prius
stuff you've got these little Prius
controller wheels here on the steering
wheel you've got the similar Prius style
shifter which has the B position for
additional regenerative brake capture of
energy to the battery and here's your
Eco mode and your evey mode eco makes it
run very lean Leigh with gas and
electric evey mode of course forces the
car to run on electric motor as much as
it can and unlike some toda hybrid
products like the Lexus ct200h
there's no sport mode on this car and
that's good
now under the hood it's a Toyota so our
hybrid system is right there Hybrid
Synergy Drive this is a one and a half
liter gas engine couple of an electric
motor this is like in the earlier pre I
the big Prius has now moved on to a 1.8
liter total combined horsepower here is
ninety nine horsepower you can't combine
the electric and the gas engine total
horse powers together it's a common
mistake because they're blended they're
not totally additive and of course it's
a side saddle front-wheel drive and
you've got a CVT only as your
transmission okay under way if you think
this car is going to really feel like 99
horsepower which is all it has you're in
for a bit of a surprise in certain
throttle positions and transitions it
feels quite a bit more sprightly those
numbers would tell you where the car
Peters out is once you get into anything
more than just sort of poking around
town 30 40 miles an hour and getting up
and down from that around town that's
great because this car is light and not
2l sound insulated shall we say you hear
all kinds of noises it's not a very
refined experience but again for the
money that could be alright the ride
quality on the Prius C is about what
you'd expect a short wheelbase car with
a fairly unrefined suspension but it
does have that belly full of batteries
giving this car a little more planted it
so it doesn't ride as poorly as some of
the lightest teeny of small cars I've
driven it's actually got pretty decent
run quad
I'm pricing out the cheapest C in this
case because that's how I approach this
car a C one starts at about nineteen 750
delivered now at that level you can't
even option a sunroof or an LCD screen
head unit with nav or in tune but it
will have all the important media
sources and it's the cheapest way to get
into Toyota's vaunted hybrid technology
though still an arguable financial case</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
