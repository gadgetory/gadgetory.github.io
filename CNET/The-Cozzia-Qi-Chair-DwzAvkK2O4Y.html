available for $13,000 at cozia usa.com
so yes I know that sounds like a ton of
money and it is but wait until you hear
about what this thing can do so yes it
is a typical massage here in a lot of
ways it has rollers it has foot
compressors it'll massage your whole
body or certain targeted areas but it
also has a really interesting piece of
integrated tech that makes this more of
a smart home product than any other
massage chair I've ever seen
so the cozy Chi app for Android or iOS
actually has this biometric reading tech
so you hold on to this little device and
it calculates your biometrics so all
sorts of different sensors and things
but especially your perspiration so
basically how tense you are it'll gather
that information and then decide
basically what sort of massage you need
so it'll customize all of that for you
but you can also use the app to set your
own types of massage so you can go for
all sorts of different types you can
customize your own or you can use
different settings that are available
within the app so it really gives you a
whole new perspective on massage instead
of just the basic massage chair that
we've seen before this device also has
integrated lighting that basically can
change based on your mood it also has
integrated speakers that connect through
bluetooth so you can play soothing music
or energizing music as you so desire and
they're also planning to integrate some
voice control integration sometime in
the future this isn't available now but
at some point you might be able to say
cozia Qi start my massage
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
