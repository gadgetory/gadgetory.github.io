spend all day long messaging but in
today's appt centric world messaging is
treated like just another app so that
means that all day long when you're
messaging you're constantly switching
back and forth between apps and and that
can be annoying and we think that that
it should be better you know we all want
to talk to people not apps so we came up
with this idea that we call chat heads
and the idea is really simple so let's
say a friend messages you in this case
it's going to be shrap he'll he'll pop
up and it's going well and and you can
just tap on a space and bring up the his
conversation and without losing any
context of what you're doing on in the
app behind and this is what this can
stay there in any app that you're in so
let's say you're playing a game then and
you want to tell your friend about it
now that's easy if you're if you're
looking at a photo and you want to reach
out to someone immediately now you can
do that no problem chat heads give you
this immediate personal connection to
the people you care about so now let's
say another message comes in this time
it's going to be from Cheryl now you get
to and you can easily switch between
them you can close them and they
collapse into this nice little pile on
the side of the screens they're not
taking up much room you can move them
around to find the right place where you
want them to be that's a lot of fun and
and then the most fun of all when you're
done with them you just throw them away
at the bottom BAM all right now chat
heads work with both your facebook
messages and your SMS is on on your
android phone so we think that chat
heads are this great personal way to do
messaging
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
