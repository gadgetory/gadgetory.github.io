rather impressive Chevy Corvette we
thought it'd be a nice time to look back
at some very cool classic American
muscle cars that were made in relatively
limited numbers and had some very cool
tech I'm Brian Cooley with my top five
muscle cars that we can hear echoes of
today we're gonna rank these guys by
their rarity of production let's go
number five 64 Pontiac GTO in the tri
power configuration about 8200 of these
John DeLorean gave it its name he was
working at GM at the time inspired by
Ferraris grand turismo on the lo gato
nomenclature of the same era blasphemy
too many Ferrari Ste since this was
basically a Pontiac LeMans
another optimistic American use of
European car terminology but add the
optional tripower triple two barrel carb
package and you're getting 348
horsepower from the very first muscle
car today you can draw a pretty straight
line from the GTO idea to performance
tears today like BMW M ODS Mercedes AMG
although I noticed they never call their
cars things like Talladega number four
the 69 Mustang 428 Cobra Jet 2,870 made
Mustang was a pony car faring poorly in
the street drag culture back in the
early part of the muscle car era so Ford
made up for it by wedging their 428
big-block into that car and topping it
with the freer breathing heads from the
even more impressive 427 engine they
also gave it a ram air scoop bigger
intake valves all of this foreshadowing
the theme today of working on freer
breathing engines for faster running the
end result in this Mustang was 411
horsepower and those same physics
lessons that it brought to the market
underlie today's trend toward things
like air in tank kits so I'm afraid
nothing will make your Mitsubishi sound
like an R code mustang number 3 68 Dodge
Charger r/t Hemi 467 copies 68 was the
first year for the charger in its coke
bottle shaped with that wide inset
real still fresh looking today you know
this guy as the bad guys badass car in
the chase scene from Bullitt now when
you add the 426 Hemi option that's where
the badass part came from 425 horsepower
490 foot-pounds of torque Hemi refers to
the fact the engine had hemispherical
combustion chamber roofs other engines
did and do but nobody markets it like
Chrysler number two the 69 Camaro zl1
just 69 were made this zl1 was created
by specking a rather arcane factory
option code called COPO 95/60
that added a $4,000 427 v8 to a $2,200
car it made over 500 horsepower and did
0 to 60 on slippery old-school tires and
is still impressive today 5.3 seconds by
the way those optional zl1 engines were
hand-built in what was basically a
cleanroom overseen by none other than
one Zora arkus-duntov the head engineer
of the Vette before we get to number one
the car that could have been accepted
really isn't a production car and not
fully an American car it's the 67 Shelby
Cobra 427 Super Snake they just made -
as if a 427 Ford v8 wasn't enough
Carroll Shelby bolted on a pair of
superchargers for a total of 800 horse
in a car that weighs about the same as
your fat uncle after a big meal of the
two made Shelby kept one for himself
gave the other to Bill Cosby who scared
himself so bad he immediately gave it
back at which time it was sold through
the Ford dealer in San Francisco to some
other guy who also couldn't handle it
and drove it off a cliff into the
Pacific Ocean
that's why performance cars have abs and
traction control today our number one
classic American muscle car that
foreshadowed the future
the 71 Hemi Cuda convertible yes just 11
of these Plymouth's were made in ragtop
form with the 426 Hemi is the last year
that engine was offered by the way in
production incredibly rare especially
since most muscle cars were incredibly
shoddily made this was an interesting
example of something we take for granted
today extreme performance
and a ragtop it took some decades of
engineering later to get that to really
work without cars turning themselves
into pretzels and today you find high
horsepower cars that give up nothing by
having their roof go down you can trace
that back to the Hemi Cuda drop-top for
more high-tech cars back then today and
tomorrow
