big old treads that they stole parts off
a steamroller and the angriest scowl in
the auto business Oh God not that get
out of here that let's drive the 2012
Camaro zl1 and check the tech
now the zl1 is pretty standard Camaro
stuff in the cabin if you've seen a
Camaro you've seen this
nothing changes dramatically you do get
some Mouse fur up here on the dash and
you get a cluster of gauges that's very
complete oil pressure and tempo and your
blower pressure coming off the
supercharger right in front of those
tour sports traction control these are
the buttons you used to control the
ferocity of the drivetrain which notice
though because we have the automatic
groan in three two right you don't have
launch control only the six-speed manual
on this car has launch control for
getting out of the hole as cleanly as
possible but it kind of doesn't matter
because this car is two-tenths of a
second faster with the six-speed
Automatic no gate on it you go back to
drive or you go to manual in manual your
paddle impulses stick now this head unit
is the head unit you cannot get an LCD
traditional navigation head unit in this
top-end Camaro some will say who cares
that isn't the point of the car others
will say it's the top end Camaro give me
the choice I think I'm in that camp for
the most part your entertainment choices
are am/fm satellite radio no HD radio in
this guy auxilary Jack CD drive right
here or you can stream from your
Bluetooth phone as well but you're not
going to get any meta tag information
just audio playback on here it's pretty
rudimentary now of course since you
can't see a map there you're thinking
what known avital well yes you've got
the OnStar directions and connections
that's a plan you subscribe to hit the
button talk to the operator which is now
automated and they'll feed you
rudimentary directions on here and on
this center display now I just find that
using OnStar for navigation is really
cumbersome I don't want to talk to the
operator shoot me and if I'm talking to
the automated system all too often the
thing rings and doesn't pick up like
four times today alone then you've got a
language issue here in California lots
of streets have complicated Spanish
based names maybe you're in one of the
parts of the country with American
Indian base names it doesn't get those
things well Sepulveda and is a POC WA
just can
to make it nutty now the last thing to
notice about this car if you haven't
already is the fact that it's kind of
like driving a tank high beltline low
roof you got this gun slit you're
looking out of aka the windshield and
the car feels very tall and square when
you're in it as well
this all adds up to something kind of
disconcerting to me but that's a matter
of taste oh thank you chevy for doing
the speedometer right so many cars today
go to 200 miles an hour on the speedo in
a tiny little arc that means you can't
tell 50 from 60 it's like a couple
needle widths here they spaced out the
reasonable speeds see that and then took
all the ones you're never going to do
and compress them over on the right
finally oh one more give back because we
don't have a color LCD we don't have a
good home for the rear view camera as a
result it lives up here on the left side
of the mirror filled with Chrome II
glare didn't really work for me that way
although it does have trajectory
prediction which is kind of slick for a
little guy like this aside from BMW this
may be the best head-up display in
manufacturer right now it'll show you
any combination of speed GeForce
entertainment currently playing next
navigational direction a lot of good
stuff in there with four different menu
pages adjustable height and brightness
now herein lies the heart of the beast
this is your 6.2 liter supercharged v8
you probably need to know much more than
that do you but I'll continue 580
horsepower 556 foot-pounds of torque
good grief zero to sixty is a little
under 4 seconds though who cares this is
more like a zero to 100 car car rocket
now you only get 12 18 mpg in this
configuration
that's pretty poor and you're going to
get hit with a gas guzzler tax as a
result if you buy this car you don't
care rear wheel drive only of course as
I mentioned choice of two gearboxes six
automatic or six manual and you have a
standard magnetic ride control that's an
active adaptive suspension in all ZL
ones check that out down there that is
an electric power steering rack so I'm
consider that heresy in a muscle car and
by the way this is a sequential port
fuel
injected motor not a direct injected
motor it is relatively low-tech so what
do you save on a car with five minute 80
horsepower
Trane's this being a huge supercharged 6
plus liter v8 what am I going to tell
you I mean it's madness and it's a hell
of a lot of fun in kind of an unrefined
way I don't mean any disrespect to Chevy
but this car feels like I'm very nicely
finished sledge here it comes on hard
it's big and chunky it's got some road
manners though I'm not an expert in
driving it in just a couple of days I've
had it and overall it's got a gritty
factor to it that is exactly what this
car sets out to do it's about having fun
it's about visceral it's about
red-blooded it's about Americana the
power is ungodly as you can imagine look
I'm on a tight autocross track I can't
begin to utilize what this car can do
and that's one of the fascinating things
about it you can buy a car now for about
fifty thousand dollars that does so much
more than you could possibly exercise
this is a wonderful era for those who
love horsepower the ride on this car as
you can imagine is firm but it's not the
most jarring I've driven it's actually
fairly comfortable certainly at speeds
like this and it's got one of the great
exhaust notes in American driving today
okay let's price rzl one should you be
so inclined fifty-six three delivered
but that also includes a $1300 gas
guzzler tax you're going to pay for your
fun in this guy now the options to take
it further see net style are limited as
we talked about sunroof 900 bucks
purists are going to say no then we've
got another 1100 to get the premium
sound with the dual powered subs in case
those exhaust tips aren't music enough
to your ears the only other option is
around 1200 for the automatic
transmission I can be convinced on
automatics these days but not on this
one it's kind of muddy and I really want
to drive the me
