Highlander certainly improves over
previous versions let's get in this
third generation Toyota Highlander and
check attack and this is the 2014 Toyota
Highlander it's grown about half a foot
from its first generation in 2000 this
is actually the third generation vehicle
just new for 2014 Toyota is added a lot
of its truck like styling features for
this 2014 model in front here we have
these really prominent headlights and we
have this grille with these really
strong louvers along here these are
things you'll also see on cars like the
Toyota 4runner which we just reviewed
recently which is more of an aggressive
truck like thing this is still more of a
crossover but we do have these contours
along the side that lead up and we've
got this two-tone roof rail here the
silver roof rail I don't particularly
like it and we come out to the rear and
we have these really bulbous taillights
these sort of stick out of the back here
this is sort of another twin a signature
design feature in the cabin here to put
a lot of convenience features in the
Highlander first of all we got this
console here and if I pop open these
slots for it here it goes way down I can
put laptops in here basketballs or who
knows what else then I got the shifter
up front here for the 6-speed automatic
transmission that's one choice there's
no other transmission you can get we got
a reverse camera on the screen here with
some distance lines but Noah trajectory
if I spin the wheel nothing happens on
there and they can throw it over to
sport here holds the lower gears a
little more and it's also got a manual
shift mode which doesn't make a lot of
difference in a car like this up in
front of here I've got my all-wheel
drive controls I've got a button that
says snow and that will actually detune
some of the torque at the wheels you're
less likely to put a lot of twist at the
wheels and slip in the snow there's a
button says DAC that's a downhill assist
control well that's a it's a very slow
maneuver only for really slippery hills
and then also we have a button that
shows the wheels set a little X in the
middle that's your diff lock the diff
lock will actually ensure that you have
power at all wheels use that in a
situation that
if you're an eyesore stuck in some mud
puddle or something like that and wheels
are spinning so whichever one can get
grip will hopefully pull you out of that
situation but now let's go up to the
head unit here this is a completely new
head unit for Toyota so we have a row of
buttons across each side here these are
soft touch buttons actually got about
says home we go here and we get a nice
screen that shows our map the what
current weather and whatever audio we've
got plane we go to our apps button here
now this is kind of a neat thing this is
what cars are going towards Chevy MyLink
as this to all the buttons are kind of
the same shape for navigation audio
phone messages eco will show you how the
cars perform and we got a traffic button
Detroit I can keep on adding apps to
this car with this type of paradigm so
it's it's just like a smart phone really
it's and there's even the ability to
change these apps so you can move
buttons up to the front that you'll use
the most there's a reorder button here
and kind of move things around on here
so that that's really useful we got a
navigation here's something we haven't
seen in 20 vehicles before these maps
are running off of an SD card and we get
a perspective view and that shows that
sort of 3d look bird's-eye view of the
terrain Toyota has not had this before
so it's nice to see they finally gotten
around to putting this e in one of their
cars some people like this perspective
more than others this head unit comes
equipped with Toyota's and tune system
that's their app integration systems
I've got my phone sitting on here
running them to an app connected to the
car through bluetooth for hands-free
calling and music streaming also works
as a data connection for the apps that
put includes on here so if I want to
find a destination help you find a
business the business you want to find
CBS Interactive say the list number of
the one you want or say none of these
and once it brings it up on the map then
I can hit and go to and that'll program
it as a destination for navigation it's
a lot of steps to go through that I kind
of wish they would make that a little
more convenient take out some of those
steps but it is online search and need
to see that in cars these days please
proceed to the highlighted route
the route guidance will start other apps
in here we have within tune we can find
those by just scrolling over to this
screen here we've got movie tickets calm
open table for making restaurant
reservations Pandora and iHeartRadio for
online music and we even have Facebook
Places Yelp sport stocks and a fuel
guide that will actually show you local
fuel prices that's pretty convenient if
you want to find your lowest price per
gallon to feed this this monster of
course we have the usual audio sources
we've got bluetooth streaming audio
we've got a USB port that does I Oh s
integration HD radio and satellite radio
and all this plays through a JBL sound
system in this limited trim highlander
14 speakers of these at GreenEDGE
speakers that's their label for a type
of speaker that uses less energy but
still is supposed to sound is good the
clarity is good I mean hearing a lot of
detail in the music and that's really
nice but there's a big problem with this
system any time the music gets a little
bassy the speakers really rattle and
distort it's it's really bad music
lovers are not gonna like this car I'm
not really sure what's going on with it
but that's one of the real problems with
this car and it's definitely a fault of
engineering that you get this panel
rattle and distortion from the system
this Highlander being pretty much a
family van has a third row seating so
with this middle row I can pull some
latches on the side here and pull this
middle row forward gives me access to
the third row it's not bad access third
row is pretty small but you can put some
kids back there I can also pull this
down and make this middle row go pretty
flat
definitely not flush with the floor but
if I pull the third row down too and I
got a decent amount of cargo area back
here maybe enough to get a couch from
like here or something
shut away under the hood here we have a
3.5 liter v6 engine Toyotas have to sit
around for about 10 years
270 horsepower 248 pound-feet of torque
those aren't great numbers by today's
standards is it with an engine of this
size fuel economy comes in at 18 miles
per gallon city 24 miles per gallon
highway
you can also get a 2.7 liter 4-cylinder
engine in this car that only gains you
about one mile per gallon fuel economy
so it's not a great bargain really now
you can see what's this engine it's
mounted pretty low a lot of space down
here this transverse mount is pretty
common in a front-wheel drive vehicle of
course this has the all-wheel drive
option which means it's way to put a
drive shaft down to the rear wheels the
more compelling engine option for this
car is the hybrid drivetrain that gets
up to 280 horsepower net
you also get 28 miles per gallon fuel
economy in this sort of standard 3.5 v6
configuration I've been seeing real
world under 20 miles per gallon and
that's not great as an average first
thing I notice about the Highlander is
the suspension it has a very comfortable
ride a very springy compliant suspension
since it has three rows of seating you
put 1200 pounds of humanity in here and
also have to ride comfortable for that
too it's you know it's not a great
handling suspension it'll it'll do
alright but if you take a corner a
little too fast like I've done a couple
of times you'll feel it lean quite a bit
it won't feel all that stable I really
like how the steering is also tuned this
is of course electronic assisted power
steering as pretty much every new car is
and one thing I do find that with this
engine though it doesn't have a lot of
power you can mash down the accelerator
to pass somebody it's just not super
fast I've also noticed with a
transmission here six-speed automatic
under power if you're climbing a hill or
something like that in normal drive mode
it tends to hunt you can fight feel it
kind of shift up and then shift down and
shifting up again put it in sport mode
though climbing some hills and that
seems to really solve the problem that
just ensures it
keeps the power up keeps in some lower
years base price for the 2014 toyota
highlander and le trim is thirty
thousand four hundred seventy dollars we
have the limited trim Platinum Edition
that includes the driver Technology
Package and panoramic sunroof with
all-wheel drive that goes for forty four
thousand eight hundred forty five
dollars there are a lot of things I like
about this 2014 Toyota Highlander
there's a lot of good improvements in
the technology I certainly like the head
unit the Entune connected feature JBL
speakers weren't my favorite the driver
assistance features are pretty nice what
I really don't like though is Toyota's
engine options this 3.5 liter v6 is just
not much power and terrible fuel economy
the hybrid in this trim goes for 51,000
but that's probably the one I'd want</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
