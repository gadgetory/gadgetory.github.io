the Samsung mobile LTE hotspot pros yes
it is quite a mouthful
this is a 4G LTE hotspots actually
support up to seven devices right now
it's connected to one there's a meter on
this front screen that shows you how
much battery life you have which
t-mobile network you're on in this case
is 4G LTE your signal strength the
number of devices you're connected to
also any messages you have there is a
2.2 inch QVGA screen here it is not a
touchscreen so if you tap it you will
only think your hotspot is broken there
are other features to this device it's
black with a rim of bright red all
around it so it is attractive it's kind
of flat so it is easy to stack things on
maybe shove in a pocket carry around
with you it is a bit of a transformer if
you pull out the bottom corner here
you'll see that you've bought a space
for a micro SD card if you put that in
it means you'll be able to share the
files you have on that card with any
device that's connected to the hotspot
this bottom flap even here also doubles
as a USB charger so if the hotspot is
fully charged and you need an emergency
top-up you can plug your device into
this USB charger and it will charge your
other device for you on the other end
you can peel back a micro USB charger
and there's a micro USB charging port on
the same side there's a 3100 milliamp
battery on here
it has a rated battery time of up to 24
days so you should get some pretty good
juice out of here it's pretty large for
a hotspot you can buy the Samsung mobile
LTE hotspot Pro from t-mobile for 160
$9.99 or for $49.99 down
with five dollars every month for the
next two years Christina I'm Tusker
