in for Bridget Carey and this is your
cnet update
some more scary news out of Syria early
this morning apparently the entire
country has gone dark completely
vanishing from the internet over the
course of just a few minutes according
to Renesys a company that operates a
real-time internet monitoring grid all
of Syria's IP connectivity has become
unreachable we'll have more on this as
it develops today google has announced
the acquisition of incentive targeting a
maker of coupon programs that tailor to
users behaviors and likes the company
has worked with retailers to design
trackable coupons that help gauge their
performance and usefulness since 2007
incentive targeting has been collecting
data on countless shoppers so it makes
sense that Google wants to tap into that
resource seen it has a review of the

mobile app can track your heart rate
sleeping patterns among other things an
hour reviewer gave the product a three
and a half out of five citing some
limitations of the bracelet specifically
the fact that it only works with iphones
the up is designed to be worn 24 hours
seven days a week alta pain a detailed
picture of your health it then uses the
data to motivate you into getting off
the couch or out of that chair and move
around the up also tracks your sleep
recording length quality etc all in the
hope you'll work to eliminate your sleep
debt and get more rest since the device
