Veronica Belmont and as promised i am
here at CES in las vegas with me today
is my co-host for the day rich demuro
all the way from New York City and
finally we are sitting and comfortable
so tell me what did you find what I find
these are the pure Matt these are
wireless sound rockers and basically you
can rock out to your favorite video
games movies TV shows whatever you want
because their speakers behind your head
and an awesome subwoofers your entire
chair just oh can you vibrate yo it's
awesome so this is really great so we're
gonna walk around the floor a little bit
and see what other kind of cool stuff
there is oh my geez it looks like I
wants big brother colorful I guess says
swing with the beats of your music so it
lights up and there's scanners although
i don't think i could lay an egg traffic
it's a big egg but look at this is in
japanese so we can't really see what it
says but somehow has two gigs 1,500 130
qvga and nokia excellent well we know
that much alright next now I love
adorable plush pandas as much as any
girl but I like robots better especially
robo pandas that's right wow he's one of
my favorite companies they have the best
robots the best toy robots it's the new
teddy ruxpin except look at this guy
does everything look you could pick him
up and he knows where are we going
there's all kind of thing you just stand
up you could sit down he can move yeah
he can are we there yet are we there yet
oh he said we're here here we're here at
the sands are we where are we where the
sands for the innovations area
oh yes scary I panda all right that
could keep you up at night we better go
yeah let's move on to see some more
stuff I think he's in feisty mode so
Veronica I think this is pretty cool
it's a solid drive speaker system look
you hook it up down here makes your
entire glass panel or any type of wall a
speaker wow so you can put this on you
like your shower that's what I want you
can shave and watch TV this doesn't come
with it but this is just a cool
application of it you can use this on
anything anything any kind of hard
surface that's gonna vibrate the sound
actually comes off of this that's unreal
500 bucks that's not bad at all I mean
kind of worth it to get that kind of
system going on in your house I love it
so continuing on that shower theme these
are LED shower heads when the water runs
through it it powers it and lights it up
in different colors Vegas very cool
which color would you choose I think I
would go with the red that's like the
alfred hitchcock shower I would go with
the blue nicey cooling Chris I like it
definitely no batteries necessary those
wires are just because they don't have
the water running through a pretty cool
well you sure know how to pick them and
hit it
I just so obviously this is all we know
why don't we find now this is a roll up
keyboard look it just rolls right up and
you could take your music on the go turn
it up turn it off oh yeah yes it is
sounding a little that sounds better
than anything that I could pull out of
my you know whatever within chopsticks
that's all I know how to do forty
dollars and it's kind of like an iPod
except you need to be a musical genius
to play it yeah I'm like anyone we want
to listen to what I know how to play
well this was good that's it alright
next this way
so Veronica where have you brought me I
feel like I'm in a time war of my
bedroom from the 80s well if you were a
Star Wars famine this is like your
ultimate dream come true this is an r2d2
family entertainment system and he's got
a projector built into him so he can
actually put star wars up on your wall
in your room it's all you can hook up
you can hook up an ipod you can hook put
a DVD in there connect your laptop and
watch video from your laptop pretty much
any input he's got it all he's a
functional robot here it's not grainy
like it was in the movie it's not the
holographic it seemed clear good yeah it
looks really good oh I don't know but
you do have to be a successful adult to
get one because these things are 2,500
bucks ouch well you know it's worth it
if you're that much of a geek I guess so
well we've pretty much seen every
imaginable pillar thing sumer
electronics gear here at CES this week
and I'm plumb tuckered out but if you
want to send us your other crave stuff

thing I want to check out before we head
