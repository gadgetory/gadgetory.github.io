need us we are trying something a little
bit different today because we are in
two different locations joining me via
Skype this time is Josh Lowensohn senior
writer for seen it Josh thanks for being
with us great to be here so Microsoft
and Nokia are all over the news at the
moment Microsoft is buying nokia's
handset business should this come as a
surprise the deal between the two
companies is valued about 7.2 billion
dollars most of that is with Microsoft
acquiring Nokia's phone business the
rest of it is kind of some of the
patents and intellectual property that
no key owns which is pretty substantial
if you look at it they have 8500 patent
set that Microsoft is now getting
they're also getting licenses from
Nokia's deal with Qualcomm and they can
use all those across all their products
this is very similar to what happened
with google bought motorola a lot of
people expected that that deal was less
the hardware as much as the intellectual
property which gives them defense
against other companies it might sue
them it also kind of lets them bring
over some ideas that nokia was building
it its phones and all sorts of products
from tablets to computers into the very
core of at the software so it's pretty
interesting when you look at it like
that for folks who haven't read about
the acquisition can you share the
details how much money are we talking
about here how big of a deal is this
this really couldn't come as too much of
a surprise to you you know this this big
deal between the two companies happen in
2011 and it was kind of expected then
that there would be a merger at some
point so this is really kind of a
completion of that deal that began a few
years ago and it makes sense in a lot of
ways for both companies you have
microsoft which has this huge kind of
interest in getting back in the
smartphone market after kind of really
faltering and trailing to catch up with
companies like Apple and Google and you
have nokia which also has fallen away
but it's really kind of hedged their
bets with microsoft and and put a lot of
their momentum into developing phones
for that company now we do know that
recently Steve Ballmer announced he
would be retiring so a lot of people are
turning the conversation towards who
might step into the CEO
seat some people have named Stephen Elop
who runs nokia as a top candidate is
that a possibility yeah I mean right now
he lock is looking like the prime
candidate for this spot he of course is
a Microsoft veteran and left Microsoft
to go run nokia basically so if you look
at some of the experience there he knows
the culture he knows how it works of
course a lot of things have changed
since he's left he's also been deeply
involved with their product with windows
phone nokia really has pushed all their
older momentum into creating devices for
Microsoft platform and this is someone
who knows the company pretty much inside
and out because he had experienced there
so what does this mean for nokia and
microsoft customers will we see more
commonalities between the two companies
i think there's a ton of commonality
between the two companies now especially
when you look at some of the direction
they can go now and blending those
hardware and services together there
really weren't any doubts the Nokia kind
of had the inside track of what
Microsoft was working on because of
their partnership and how strategic it
was but now that's going to be even more
implanted and kind of important for
nokia too i mean i can't see them at
this point making devices for anybody
else they are all windows phone now
that's pretty clear also when you look
at this it's not just phones it's
tablets to one of the areas where
Microsoft is kind of fallen behind
especially with kind of the non success
of the windows RT surface device so if
you look at something like Nokia they
have the hardware know how to really
create those that kind of product that
they might fit in that we've already
seen some leaked shots of that so
there's a lot of expectation these two
companies are going to come together and
make more than just phones now you
mentioned that Microsoft has fallen
behind certainly they have when it comes
to tablet sales Windows Phones does this
give them an edge can they increase
their market share as a result of this
acquisition there's really no doubt that
the these two companies coming together
is going to create a much stronger
third-place contender against Apple and
Google then any other company has I mean
the big competition for third place is
really between Nokia and blackberry of
course samsung also makes devices but
almost everything they do is Android
air of course working on their own
operating system called Tizen which you
know i think is expected soon but
they're not ready to run with that yet
so this is really a key thing for nokia
and microsoft to be working on a single
platform and for customers really have
one choice as far as it comes from those
two companies so i think if you expected
windows mobile to kind of died off this
would kind of wash away any worries
about that so there's a lot of benefit
for consumers that these two are teaming
up you know really bring in that third
place spot and really tighten it up and
hopefully expand it with other products
all right Josh thanks so much for being
with us for inside scoop I'm Sumi das
