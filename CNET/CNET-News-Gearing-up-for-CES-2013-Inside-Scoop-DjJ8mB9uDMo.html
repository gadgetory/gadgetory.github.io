scoop I'm cnet's carros ooh boy joined
by senior editor Donald Bell and Donald
we are talking all things CES 2013
that's the Consumer Electronic Show
happens every year in Las Vegas and
roughly the second week of January so
we're just a few days away from heading
down to the big show what are some of
your thoughts for this year what are we
going to see as far as products go one
thing that's always a staple of CES is
TVs it's half of half of it always seems
to be big name announcements for
televisions and also some new
technologies that have been kind of in
the pipe for a while now that it's
falling down into you know consumer
level television so we're looking at 4k
TVs which is double the resolution of
our highest resolution 1080p TV y is
right now and oh l EDT beans which have
been in the process for a while but
we've seen smaller screen sizes that are
very expensive hopefully now we're going
to be hitting an equilibrium of screen
sizes and price to make them more
attractive to consumers I remember a
couple years ago the rage was 3d TVs so
it looks like that fat is past or on to
a new desk yeah that's kind of like
people take that as a given now in any
TV they're going to buy I heard that one
of the things editors are keeping an eye
out for is streaming and connectivity
and products like Roku and other
competitors right there's there's that
continued push to make the living room
all the more wireless especially now the
Apple is pulled their connection port to
their phones and their tablet there's
this push to have like airplay speaker
systems Bluetooth speaker systems people
are now whether they like it or not
having to embrace more wireless
technologies in the living room
including things like Roku for streaming
video to their TVs they even on the
front of like wireless charging for
their phones or wireless speaker systems
for their home theater what about
handheld devices in the form of
smartphones or tablets do you think
we'll see a lot of innovation in the
hardware space there so release for the
past two years CES has definitely been a
place where we've seen a lot of new
Android tablets and I think that's still
going to continue here because we've
seen some successful footholds in the
tablet market for Android devices like
the amazon kindle fire and the nexus 7
so we're going to see probably even more
android tablets moving the CES but as
far as phones go we have a mobile world
congress coming up in a month after CES
checking a lot of the manufacturers
going to save their big name
announcements for that next bone and
then we'll see some phones here but
nothing that's going to really make a
lot of headlines except maybe some
fireproof waterproof phones things like
that whatever always seemed to trickle
out that are funded demo but gradually
it's not really the things that people
get excited about and speaking of
companies sort of wanting to release
products on their own schedule we
learned last year that Microsoft would
no longer be participating in CES yeah
what kind of impact will that have on
the show this year well it takes a big
big brand name off of the show floor
yeah but that also leaves space for
other people to come in and take it over
so there is a vacuum there but I'm sure
it's gonna be filled by a lot of other
manufacturers this also makes sense for
Microsoft anyway because they just came
out with the big push for Windows 8
Windows Phone 8 so they've already kind
of shown off everything that they have
for this year so that's not a lot for
them to show at CES i have now this will
be my fourth CES how many of you gone to
this will be I think for four or five
yeah is there anything that you can
share with our viewers that you're doing
to prepare right now before I head down
just exhaustion preparation just taking
my vitamins take care of myself you know
but yeah it's it's rough because you're
on your feet all day it's high stress
you're you know the bloggers and writers
are bringing extra like my thighs to
keep connected to the internet at the
different press conferences it's a lot
to go through yeah just waiting to the
crowd right call that time I bring it
bring extra socks comfy shoes that's a
lot of walking yeah definitely that's
all this note there's no real
preparation you can do except to get a
lot of rest absolutely well we look
forward to seeing you down there thank
you so much Donald Bell I'm Kara Tsuboi
thanks for watching the inside scoop
