bacon emoji I'm Bridget Carey this is
your CNET update the language of emoji
is expanding 38 brand new icons are
coming in 2016
including a symbol for bacon there's a
pickle there shrugging and the facepalm
what you see here are just some
suggestions on how they should look many
of which were created by Gawker and
adopted as examples by the Unicode
consortium a group that sets the
standard for emoji across different
operating systems but it's up to Apple
Google and Microsoft to create their own
art for each icon the plan is to add
these new icons in Unicode 9.0 update
that's in June of next year another chat
news facebook Messenger is rolling out a
form of caller ID when someone contacts
you for the first time on messenger
you'll see a large photo and details on
how you may know each other which can be
helpful when you have hundreds of
acquaintance friends on Facebook and
forgot how you even met the person let's
switch gears to look to the future when
the day comes that we're living on other
planets and off having galactic
adventures as one does in the future
mankind will need some sort of symbol or
flag to represent planet Earth NASA
plans to put humans on Mars in the 2030s
and I'm sure NASA will have the American
flag all over that red rock colony but
one graduate student of the Beckman's
College of Design in Sweden felt we
should have an earth flag and he created
this flag as a project he explains that
the seven interlocked circles form a
flower a symbol of life on earth and it
represents how everything on our planet
is linked together directly or
indirectly blue is of course for water
essential to life as oceans cover most
of our blue planet it reminds me a bit
of the symbol for Epcot the theme park
that was born from Walt Disney's vision
of the experimental prototype community
of tomorrow and part of the inspiration
for the new movie Tomorrowland the movie
out in theaters now is the first movie
released in Dolby vision it's a laser
projection technology that can deliver a
whiter more vibrant color palette than
anything you'll see on TV colors are
richer
there's better contrast even in darkest
blacks you can make out more details the
director used this to make a vivid
contrast between the alternate realities
the characters travel between it also
uses Dolby's Atmos audio technology to
envelop you in sound one of our CNN
video experts saw Tomorrowland in Adobe
cinema and says it lives up to the hype
it was the best picture he's ever seen
in a theater but chances are you won't
be able to experience it like he did
there are only a handful of theaters
equipped to show Dolby cinema right now
I guess I'll have to experience tomorrow
with yesterday's tech that's all for
this update but there's more as seen
accom from our studios in New York I'm
