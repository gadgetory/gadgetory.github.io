game on a Windows 8 PC hands-free with
leap motion this actually works with
Windows 8 Windows 7 and with Macs
what is it well I'll explain it's this
this little puck is leap motion it's $80
and it allows connect like connectivity
for computer it does have to work with
its own app ecosystem which is one of
the leap motions drawbacks and catches
although that app ecosystem is pretty
big at launch over 70 apps to start so
it's simply you plug it in via USB you
put it down you download the starting
software called airspace and there's an
associated airspace store that holds all
of the apps now the lay makers elite
motion are open to the idea of having
applications be outside of the store
maybe certain applications actually like
Google Earth right now has the ability
to work with leap motion via software
update that could be quietly posted
about or bumped up the fine tuning is
the important note the makers of leap
motion and vision people may be using
this for robotic surgery or for fighter
planes that may sound a little bit scary
but the idea is that this is really much
more fine-tuned than a Kinect is and you
can see here my hand hovering over the
space and it notices each one of my
little joints and notices little tiny
Wiggles and movements as I move my hand
so that's kind of cool now it seems like
this would be great for games and there
already are a couple of games this one
is dropped cord by Double Fine and it's
a music based rhythm game that allows
you to move use both fingers around this
circle and collect things and time
things for points it's a pretty fun demo
it's a real game too so it's not just a
demo of technology and this is one of
the launch games that's currently
available and if you fancy doing a
little bit of painting and art you can
with things like Corel Painter freestyle
beta and air paint to your heart's
content and you know what my arm is
getting tired I'm feeling really tired
doing this over a period of time it's
kind of like a workout because you got
to hold your hands in this space up here
it's not really a lower zone
an upper zone so if you're the type of
person who has a standing desk than your
set but if your type of person who sits
down at a desk which is most of us then
you might find that over a long period
of time this is probably not the most
comfortable productivity tool in the
entire world now there is an app called
touchless that allows you to use leap
motion with Windows 8 or Windows 7 or
Mac and actually navigate the operating
system so you can go outside of the app
universe that is kind of a weird mixed
bag now you can see here my finger is
actually becoming the cursor and I'm
navigating around and I just
accidentally launched a game that shows
that you have to push into click and
that's the part that's a little
unintuitive here and the gestures are
made to work with your fingers and you
know what you're probably just gonna
reach up and touch the screen or use a
trackpad and guess what it connects to
your Mac as well as I said so you can
connect it to your MacBook Air or iMac
or Mac of choice and it works with OS
10.7 and later now certain apps work
with just Mac or just Windows but a lot
of them are meant to work with both Mac
and Windows
so that's leap motion in a nutshell
connect on your desk in a small scale
space you probably don't need it but if
you start imagining using this and
something like oculus rift or you wanted
to manipulate molecules or you want to
see where gestural computing might go
next and don't want to spend all that
much to get into it for $80 the
experiment is yours now and it's an
intriguing one and there are certain to
be a lot more apps to get in the space
and who knows you might even have a
computer with this technology built in
sometime soon I'm Scott Stein and that's
a look at leap motion available now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
