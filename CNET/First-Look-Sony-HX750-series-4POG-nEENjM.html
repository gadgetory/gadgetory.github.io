this is a review of the HX 750
television in 2011 Sony had one of its
best years in terms of producing high
quality TVs but unfortunately this
didn't translate to sales so in scaling
things back for 2012 the company has
gone to just a handful of models and
relatively inexpensive ones at that two
of these are the $1500 46 inch and the
$2,100 55 inch HX 750 this is an edge
lit LED screen which offers a good
feature set and the minimalist yet
classy design we expect from the company
the Smart TV features are similar to
last year's with the addition of a new
interface called the Sony Entertainment
Network which rolls all of Sony's
streaming music and movies into one
place as Sony's second from the top
model you can also expect to receive 3d
playback but no glasses for hdmi ports
and 2 USBS picture quality is average
for the price with excellent colors but
lower than expected black levels 3d
playback is very good however and the
range of Internet content should keep
you entertained for a while yet the TV's
biggest problem is one that is
completely out of Sony's control the
competition is better and cheaper the
new 55 inch panasonic st 50 is one of
the best tvs we've seen in years and
it's $500 cheaper than this as a result
the sony HX 750 is a decent but not
especially significant entrant in sony's
portfolio could the top-of-the-line HX
850 be that much better this has been
typing agree with the HX 7</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
