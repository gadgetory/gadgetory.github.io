that is settling around consoles it's
very interesting
we have continued to tweak and refined
PS now I was lying down flat and using
my head to navigate as I was sliding
under big tractor trailer trucks they
want to create a world that feels real
that sounds real you could bring the
sword point right up to the night tickle
his chin or decapitate him whatever you
want to do xbox one now when Microsoft's
Xbox one came out November of 2013 it
had a very broad kind of a whole-house
message gaming at the core yes but also
communications with skype streaming
media and pay-tv integration and of
course gesture and voice control through
connect xbox on it seemed aimed exactly
where consoles were going to be going
more broadly around the household four
months later however what it's mostly
aimed at is catching up with Sony's
taillights the sales race is quite stark
Sony in the first four months have sold
seven million ps4s Microsoft five
million Xbox ones that thirty percent
Delta is alarming to the folks in
redmond and at e3 microsoft came out
talking about basically one thing around
xbox games they went back to the core
this renewed interest and excitement
benefits everyone creators publishers
console manufacturers and especially
gamers you heard almost nothing about
skype pay TV integration or gesture
control this time it was Sony they went
broader they rolled out a slightly new
version of the ps4 and new games of
course but they also talked about new
peripherals like the PlayStation TV box
was rolled out which will yes stream
games but also be streaming video from a
new service that Sony plans by end of
year to compete with Amazon streaming
and Netflix they also had their Morpheus
virtual reality headset being shown in
development with games like Jurassic
encounter and Street Lou and they rolled
out details in their PlayStation now
streaming service that will soon let you
stream games to future Sony televisions
with nothing but the addition of a
controller with the Wii U games Oh Toki
no addiction Annika we have the first
two dedicated screen in the long history
of video games the fritz part Nintendo's
still wondering how it can get back to
being the darling of the mainstream
console revolution which the wii was
once touted as their wii u with its kind
of tortured gamepad
tablet peripheral was being shown as a
place where developers are spending more
time making the tablet relevant they
also rolled out something called amoeba
or Ameobi I guess in plural these are
little sorts of toy figurines that have
NFC technology built-in you would touch
them to a certain portion of the gamepad
to launch the related game and also
bring in your history preferences and
profile with the game and start gameplay
right from that point and everybody's
wondering when or if Nintendo streaming
TV and movie platform will be a major
player taking a first look at the new
valve controller for steam machines and
valves steam machine platform is delayed
till 2015 when it does arrive it will
have a revolutionary controller with
touch sensitivity haptic feedback and of
course tie into valves very popular base
of online games games written directly
for the new class of boxes and the
ability to stream TV and movies as well
now one of the most interesting facts
around all this is a game consoles
remain globally the most installed
device that is capable of streaming
television and movie content along with
its core gaming mission not smart TVs
not Roku and Apple TV boxes those are
actually relatively small numbers in the
u.s. about half of all homes have a game
console about a third of those though
use it for TV and movie streaming as of
the close of e3 2014 it's still clear
that no game console maker has yet fully
cracked the code on making their class
of products dramatically more appealing
to every member of the household in
every demographic and everyday part of
daily life
