welcome to the Apple buy for everything
good and bad inside the world of Apple
let's get to it and we can thank Taylor
Swift for the biggest news story over
the weekend after her open letter to
Apple praise them for their innovation
but also criticized them for not paying
artists and labels during Apple musics
3-month trial period
in her letter she said we don't ask you
for free iPhones please don't ask us to
provide you with our music for no
compensation now in less than 24 hours
Apple quickly changed their tune and
Eddy Cue announced a swift policy change
over Twitter saying Apple music will pay
artists for streaming even during
customers free trial period and just
like that it was resolved
Taytay that's power now imagine all the
other things Taylor Swift could fix like
world peace cellphone carriers vs
unlimited data that's throttled the
drought in California or maybe even
t-swizzle could make Kanye smile
okay that's not happening now this is
good news for artists but it would be
even better
if they started getting paid
legitimately for their streams instead
of less than a penny per play and I know
we throw a lot of bad apples out there
but Apple stepped up to avoid a PR
disaster and deserves a good Apple C we
are actually nice people
now Tim Cook also recently spoke to the
Chinese language version of Bloomberg
Businessweek and said the popularity of
the color gold among Chinese users was a
key part in the company's decision to
pursue gold design for its products you
guys can thank my relatives for that one
now cook also said that developer
support for the Apple watch is stronger
than the original iPhone with over 3500
apps available for the SmartWatch right
now that's compared to 500 apps on the
iPhone at the 2008 debut of the App
Store and 1000 for the iPad in 2010 but
you also have to remember Tim that this
was also the first time you could
develop for any iOS device at all all
right getting developers on board is
always a good thing as they love new
hardware to develop for and according to
nine-to-five max sources they report the
next gen Apple watch to is planning to
get a new FaceTime camera for video
calls from your wrist it will also get
the ability to function with just a
direct Wi-Fi connection independent of
fetching data from your phone in a
feature they are calling tether list and
the watch will have similar battery life
to the current one now they expect the
next gen watch to be released in 2016 so
this report is nice and all and even
though I love a FaceTime camera on it as
a fun gimmick where exactly are you
going to put this thing the report says
they'll put it on the bezel but where
are they going to put it on that bezel
unless it's an entire redesign on the
body I don't see it now this thing needs
Wi-Fi and even an LTE version as an
option but more importantly if they
really want to treat it as a legitimate
fitness device with standalone apps it
needs a dedicated gps chip and also uh
I'm not wearing my Apple watch because I
had to charge it seriously all right in
i phone news there has always been talk
about a single touch screen design with
no buttons now we report from digit time
says
Apple is developing touch and display
driver integration single chip solutions
for future iPhones the chips are said to
include fingerprint sensors which would
allow for new iPhone designs without a
home button enabling the entire front
panel to be the devices display now an
Apple Insider source confirms that Apple
is planning to remove the physical home
button from future hardware but the
change will not arrive within the next
two years
targeting sometime in 2017 or even 2018
as the long-term goal for the company
also a heads up for iMac 27-inch users
with the three terabyte drive option
purchased sometime between December 2012
and September 2013 and yes I'm one of
those people
the company has initiated a program to
replace your hard drive that may fail
under certain conditions Apple is
contacting owners but you can go to
Apple support website to see if the
serial number on your iMac qualifies you
for a replacement and we always like to
acknowledge the Apple products that
helped make the company what it is today
well Apple has quietly pulled the
original iPad Mini from the Apple online
store this week and removed all
references of the tablet on its website
now we criticized it for its lack of
Retina display and obscene 329 Apple
premium price point at the time but
right now we'd like to take a moment 200
let's get that out all right it's time
to announce the winners of our multi
watch doc giveaway from last weekend I
asked you to name me the two things I
liked about iOS 9 from WWDC but then I
checked and I kind of said three things
which were multitasking the picture
picture view for the iPad and the better
battery life on iOS devices so if any of
you said two of those three or all of
them you are good plus I asked you what
your favorite sandwiches so congrats go
to email winner in grid crepe us whose
BLT takes her to the next level it was
written like that and on Twitter
Misha went with the emoji fried egg
sandwich I can't hate on that and for
all of you who were trying to kiss bud
and said the meatball sandwich was your
favorite it didn't work on me except
poor Lynn did lead so congrats to all of
you and I will be in touch all right
that's gonna do it for this week's show
you can always email us at the Apple by
to see Netcom or tweet me at Brian Tong
and I'll respond when I'm not playing
Arkham Knight this whole week and you'll
be lucky if I put that game down thanks
so much for watching we'll catch you all
next time for another bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
