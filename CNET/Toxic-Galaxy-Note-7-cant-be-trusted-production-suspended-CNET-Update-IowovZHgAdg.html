production of the note seven phone after
reports of several replacement phones
Catching Fire but Samsung of course used
a softer phrase saying it is quote
temporarily adjusting the Galaxy Note
seven production schedule in order to
take further steps to ensure quality and
safety matters but try as it might
there's no softening the fact that major
US mobile carriers including Verizon
AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile are no longer selling
the note 7 or offering replacement
models customers instead can switch the
note 7 out for another type of phone
after the global recall to replace the
explosive batteries in the note 7 there
have been multiple reports of the
so-called safer replacement phones also
Catching Fire
last week one reportedly started smoking
aboard a Southwest Airlines flight at
Louisville International Airport leading
to the evacuation of the entire flight
before takeoff another man in Kentucky
told local news station WKYT that he
woke up at 4:00 a.m. on Saturday to find
his bedroom filled with smoke after his
replacement note 7 caught fire and the
phone wasn't even plugged in a day
before that a 13 year old girl in
Minnesota had her replacement note 7
overheat in her hand
according to local station KSTP it
burned her thumb before it started
smoking and melting clearly there is
still a problem with the batteries of
the replacement models and if you have a
note 7 just get rid of it now the note 7
model is toxic and this is likely the
end of the phone Samsung's big challenge
now is to win back the trust of its
customers and it couldn't have come at a
worse time
as Google's new pixel phone is likely to
win over Android fans looking to leave
Samsung for something different that's
it for this tech news update I'm Bridget
