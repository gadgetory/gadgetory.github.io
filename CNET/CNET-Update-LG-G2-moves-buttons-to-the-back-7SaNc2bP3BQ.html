copycats LG may be trying too hard to be
different I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your CNN update LG unveiled its new g2
smartphone and it's a little unusual
first off its got a 5.2 inch screen
that's huge it's walking a thin line on
phablet territory but even stranger is
that the power and volume buttons are on
the back right under the camera and if
you hold the volume down button the
camera turns on hold the volume up
button is a shortcut to the note-taking
program called quick memo and if you
want to wake up the phone but you don't
want to use the power button on the back
because it's on the back you can instead
tap twice on the screen LG has a few
other unique software features the g2
can automatically answer a call when the
phone is raised to the person's ear
there's also a guest mode to protect
privacy by displaying only certain apps
when someone besides the phone's owner
unlocks the phone that's for those of
you worried about nosey friends we're
seeing several Android phones pushing
their unique software tricks but the g2
also is packing in some solid hardware
the g2 will be the first global device
to include Qualcomm's highest end chip a
quad-core Snapdragon 800 processor this
phone will be globally sold and at the
four major US carriers but no word yet
on a price or exact date for the US
Facebook is taking another feature from
Twitter I'm sure you're shocked
this time Facebook is testing trending
topics so on the top of your newsfeed
along with birthday alerts you'll see
what topics people are buzzing about
today the trending topics are being
tested now on Facebook's mobile website
that's em facebook.com but it can only
be seen by a select group of users this
is Facebook's way of staying relevant as
a source for checking in with breaking
news or trending conversations about TV
shows and memes and if you want to put a
new twist on your text messages whatsapp
now lets users post audio recordings
into conversations whatsapp has become a
popular alternative to using traditional
text messages the company says it
process
is 31 billion messages on a daily basis
today's app to watch is brand new it's
called a go-go and it wants to be what
you listen to in the car instead of the
radio this a go-go app will pull in
different online offerings like Spotify
RDO and NPR blend it up with local
traffic reports news stories book
excerpts even television programming and
