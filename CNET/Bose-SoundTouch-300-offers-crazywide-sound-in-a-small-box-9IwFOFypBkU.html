that can produce a really big sound from
a really small box then the Bose
soundTouch 300 is the first sound bar I
could think of this is a $700 sound bar
which offers excellent movie sound and
even decent music replay this is a three
channel speaker with a ball bouncing
wide effect the bar has an HDMI input 4k
compatibility as well as Bluetooth and
Wi-Fi streaming you can also use the
Bose soundTouch app to stream to this
and other sound touch speakers
throughout your house as much as I like
this sound bar though of course there's
caveats the first is that there's no
subwoofer so there's no deep bass
response if you want that you have to
pay another $700 for the acoustic Mass
300 sub and if you want surround there's
another 300 for the satellites even
without the extras you will need a room
with bare walls for the Bose to bounce
sound onto this is what gives the sound
bar its ultra wide soundstage though I'm
not usually a fan of wide sounding music
the Bose does a great job in pulling out
details and music you've heard a million
times and presenting it in a new way but
hold on to your manual and be prepared
for a weird setup process you'll have to
wear this headset and sit through five
runs of calibration routines in
completely different positions for it to
sound its best as a $700 system that
Bose is definitely better than the Sonos
playbar at the same price it offers
better clarity and a better wide effect
but the Bose is not the sound bad to get
if you just want something without a sub
look to the Z box SB 500 or samsung ms
650 instead and also save yourself a few
hundred bucks as a full system with
surrounds in the sub the resulting least
$1,700 sound touch 300 is very likeable
and fun but it's just not the best value</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
