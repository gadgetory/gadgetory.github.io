and it's already one of our officers go
to tabletop games it's a two to four
player game and matches lasts about 10
to 15 minutes so the last time we played
a board game in the office we were here
till about midnight and not everyone's
got that kind of time to kill on
pre-industrial horticulture
luckily hand of the king is for you and
it takes about a minute to learn and
I'll prove that to you right now look at
the board like a big sliding puzzle
players take turns moving varus around a
6x6 grid you can only move him into a
new position in a row or column that
he's already touching and when he moves
you take the character that he lands on
plus any other character that belongs to
the same house that he passes over let's
say I take varus and I move him over to
Ned Stark Square I'll pick up Ned and
I'll also get Leanna adding both Starks
to my hand if you've got more people
belonging to one house than any other
player you control that houses banner
when varus has no legal moves left
whoever controls the most banners wins
the game there's a few other bits and
pieces like companions that have special
abilities and there are some rules to
play in teams but that right there
that's the entire core game forty
seconds
nailed it so my favorite thing about
this game is the Oh moment when a new
player is a move or two into their first
game and they realize they need to start
thinking two three four moves ahead
setting themselves up for good moves and
leaving everyone else with nada if
you're new to hand of the King or even
tabletop games in general thinking
strategically and plotting like
spymaster varus himself is a great
feeling it's damn fun and surprisingly
deep it comes in at around 15 bucks in
the US or 20 bucks in Australia making
it the cheapest tabletop game you'll buy
this year check it out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
