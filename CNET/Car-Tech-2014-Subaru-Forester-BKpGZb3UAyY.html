not just Subaru buyers they tend to be
fans so what will the fan base think of
this new forest or the 2014 has more all
around more high-tech and less towing
capacity let's drive this 2.5 I limited
and check the tech
now obviously the Foresters not
dramatically bigger but it's grown a
little bit in most dimensions the weight
has stayed pretty low though they use a
lot of what they call high-strength
steel which gives you a lot more
strength without a lot more bulk you're
also gonna spot one easily by the new
face much boxier much more aggressive if
you will and no longer to the headlights
flow into the grille it's an easy way to
spot one or just look inside if it's got
to see the T transmission it's got to be
in 2014 that's all new
now the first thing I noticed getting
into this Subaru is what the hell are
those big ol lobes hanging down here
from the headliner this is what they
call their eyesight camera system
there's a camera here's one here and
what's interesting I've never seen this
before they're actually looking through
midair and then through the windshield
normally these kind of things are bonded
to the glass as we've seen before but
these cameras powers several features
and they're optional by the way they
power the lane departure sensing they
power forward collision avoidance
letting you know when you're closing too
fast and they also I believe are
powering some of the adaptive cruise
control now the next screen we get to is
this guy down here in the eyebrow this
is a sort of a helper screen because the
big boy is down here and this is
standard on this trim of car but let's
go back to that helper you've got
several modes there including one about
the drive line as you see some of the
historical mpg stuff current mpg on this
kind of rotating motif and then some
places to handle vehicle settings it's
basically sort of a fancy trip odometer
taken several different directions what
I'm not crazy about is they use the
little screen for the backup camera and
that's a safety thing why wouldn't you
make that bigger and route that video to
the big screen okay onto the main screen
now now it's a wonky little interface
but if you hit this little button you
get some of your audio choices AM and FM
with HD by the way satellite radio is
optional but it's in there aah-ha
streaming support though not on my phone
my aha app is running my phone is paired
it keeps telling me it's not running and
not paired so I can't show you much
about it I'll take their word here's how
our ipod looks hooked up to the USB here
in the console it's a pretty good reader
it's relatively responsive not the best
not the worst but my biggest gripe is
that the album art is ridiculously small
just don't bother
and instead bump that over and give me
more room for metatag data that's way
more useful my bigger gripe gets when
you come to navigation and while the
basics work alright here I find it's
under processor it has a lot of issues
getting to things quickly if you want to
enter a destination it's still by bucket
the way cars used to do it so you got to
go address then Street then City you
can't just blurt the whole thing out now
the next techno tour comes down here in
the console around the shifter this is a
big headline in this car for the first
time now
Subaru Forester moves from a four-speed
automatic to a CVT that's gonna save
Subaru some money first off because they
no longer have to make fender badges
that say Forester Smithsonian Edition
that for speed was crazy antiquated now
you've got a CVT which is a very modern
gearbox notice it has no shiftable gate
just a low range and no paddles this is
a fairly pedestrian transmission we'll
see how it does on the road in a moment
and right ahead of the transmission
related to it is a big ol badge it
screams out ex mode it doesn't turn you
into a super hero instead it engages
kind of an all-encompassing get me out
of trouble mode if you press this button
you see something change up here on the
screen and now the computer is taking
control of the details of accelerator of
independent wheel braking of how the
transmission holds a low gear of how the
all-wheel drive clutch is biasing power
it basically says let me handle the
off-road mode and I will crawl out of
whatever you're in now because we're in
a 2.5 i Touring which is kind of mid
high level we have a lot of nice these
in this guy did you notice this big
panoramic roof this guy is standard
there's no optional cost on that and
it's one of the biggest ones in the
business you've got a power liftgate
also included and that your camera
showed you small as it is is also thrown
in now the reason that our Subaru is
called a 2.5 is because there's a 2.5 I
two and a half liter fuel-injected dual
overhead cam horizontally opposed
four-cylinder Subarus got their whole
DNA tied up in this engine and all-wheel
drive what's interesting about these
boxer motors is they're real flat and
they sit real low does wonders for
center of gravity I mean basically the
metal part of this engine stops way down
there so all the weight is kind of here
on down the numbers 170 horse Evan t4
foot-pounds of torque
it's a fairly torquey mix of those two 0
to 60 for this 3400 pound vehicle
happens in 9 seconds nothing to write
home about there but the mpg is 24 32 is
a nice set of numbers for economy on
something this relatively boxy though as
I mentioned fairly light
but the first thing I noticed about this
Subaru is not a good thing I know
there's a good motor in there I've
driven this one before but this
transmission is getting in the way the
power response is almost no response at
all it's loopy and spooly and elastic
and I hate that given the fact that
there's no shiftable gate either no
sport mode no paddles you are stuck with
this kind of disconnected driving
behavior it's not good now as I
mentioned all Subarus except the BRZ
come with symmetric all-wheel-drive it's
known for being very balanced for aft
and left-right in terms of the weight
and the array of the equipment it's also
known for being very tough and basic you
don't get any weird intrusion of it
feeling like an all wheel drive vehicle
there's no weird gear whine as I showed
you there's no sort of convoluted sort
of mode switches you just have that
simple X mode button and even that's
only when you get in trouble ok now the
driver assistance tech that comes out of
these two eyesight cameras first of all
the lane departure stuff is really
spot-on it just hits it just right right
as your tire it starts to kiss the
painted line it comes on and it beeps
and gives you indicator here on the dash
the forward collision warning I find
it's too touchy though I'm really not
close to any car or closing on it that
fast and it starts to be bits red light
that's a little annoying now what is
interesting on this cars I don't think
I've seen on any other vehicle is it has
a hey stupid wake up function if you're
at a red light and the traffic ahead of
you starts to move and you don't after
about two car lengths it beeps and says
car ahead of you
has moved telling you to stop looking at
your damn phone and start driving again
in traffic
okay let's price the new 14 forester in
this 2.5 I limited trim this is min high
in the range and remember all wheel
drive is thrown in thirty thousand eight
on top of that twenty four hundred bucks
will take you seen that style that's for
the eyesight package adds in those two
cameras that help power adaptive cruise
control lane departure warning forward
collision warning and they also role in
high-intensity discharge headlights it's
a pretty good value and it's a nice
basket of stuff though note you cannot
get blind spot tech on this car all in
about thirty three to four what has been
a pretty modest revision on the outside
but a big change in a lot of the guts</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
