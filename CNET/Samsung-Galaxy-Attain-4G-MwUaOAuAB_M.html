and welcome to my living room this was
actually my CNET living room and I'm
about to give you a first look at this
new phone it's the Samsung Galaxy attain
4G it is on MetroPCS 4G LTE network
MetroPCS was the first for LTE but since
then it sort of been slow to release the
phones so this is one of two new Android
phones it is Android 2.3 Gingerbread no
word about Ice Cream Sandwich upgrades
yet now I personally like the way that
this phone looks it's silvery all around
it feels thick but it really isn't it's
good in the hand good on the air so I'm
very satisfied with the way that it
looks I also like something that Samsung
did it added four physical
navigation buttons below the screen and
this is something that most of the
manufacturers aren't really doing
anymore they're using the touch
sensitive navigation but I think that
these buttons are well-constructed and
they were really comfortable and easy
for me to use so I like that
another thing that Samsung added that
you don't see a lot these days except on
a Windows Phone is this dedicated camera
button so if you press and hold on that
it will definitely trigger the camera
app and I always like that the phone has
a 3.5 inch H VGA display pretty bright
and colorful but it's definitely not the
largest site you'll see it's the same
screen size as the iPhone so if you
don't think that that's too small then
you should be pretty happy with this one
now I know you really want to know about
is the camera and how good the camera is
well there are two of them there's the
3.2 megapixel camera on the back and
that's got autofocus and flash and then
there's also a 1.3 megapixel on the
front which is good for video chats and
self-portraits now this camera on the
back I was actually pretty impressed
with the outdoor shots although the
weather in San Francisco has been kind
of crummy lately so the lighting was
very even there weren't a lot of shadows
not a lot of bright lights but I have to
say that the pictures were really good
for a 3.2 megapixel camera the indoor
shots however I thought kind of grayed
everything out so I would definitely
reach for a different camera if you're
mostly taking indoor shots beneath the
back cover there is a micro SD card slot
and it
takes up to 32 gigabytes of memory but
it comes pre-installed with two
gigabytes as for the apps this phone
comes pre-loaded with many there are all
the google apps and services plus
Samsung has a bunch of apps on here
MetroPCS does too now there is LTE on
here and I would say that if you're in
an area that's strong for MetroPCS LTE
is strong then you're definitely going
to find faster speeds one problem with
the network is that there really isn't a
lot of 3G so you're gonna fall back to
2.5 G which is going to be much slower
but if you're a long time metro pcs
customer then the phone will definitely
feel fast now the phone is going to be
available later in January it's not
available quite yet it will cost $199.99
after a $50 mail-in rebate so I'm
Jessica's all-court for CNN and this is
the Samsung Galaxy attain 4G for
MetroPCS you can check out the full
