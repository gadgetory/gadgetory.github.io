planet Earth my name is Steven Beecham
and you're watching the Apple byte extra
crunchy podcast with your host mr. Brian
Tong Oh Oh what's up everybody welcome
to the show it is episode 96 of the
applewhite extra crunchy this is our
complimentary piece our long format kind
of discussion kick back dig deep into
the latest stories that came out this
week from the Apple byte and as always
this show is all about you for you kind
of by you although beech and tall I mean
I guess it's by us but it's for them
right
yes it's by us for them but they
contribute so well with their phone
calls and it makes the show a lot more
fun like when we get to the end and all
the phone calls we love it like that so
it's 1 800 662 help it under a minute we
are the training sessions have served us
well especially this week right like oh
yeah I think everyone everyone stayed
under a minute except for one caller
that we never gonna use yeah we won't
use them but stick around after the show
because we might have a special
voicemail we're gonna play yeah that
will be for people that aren't listening
the podcast so let's just jump into it
there's I love it because right before
an Apple event so much news start to
drop in this week is no different and I
think the cool thing and Beach you'll be
happy about this one that really the top
story this week comes to us from the
Wall Street Journal in a report that
Apple has now finally really taken
investing in original content seriously
with a 1 billion dollar allocated amount
of money of cold hard cash to spend on
original programming and this is how
long have we been talking about this
like for them if they really want to get
in the game they got again the game oh
this is this is huge I mean 1 billion
dollars that Netflix is actually
spending still a lot more I think 6
billion in 2017 Pros billion upping it
like an extra billion or something right
but 1 billion is a good start and huh
and I was gonna ask you Brian how do we
get a chunk of that
we we create content how do me people
use Apple's apps to listen to our stuff
for free oh but we do we do read we do
read a sponsor so I can't with that put
that past but let I just want to give
you guys and gals a little perspective
of how this whole industry is shaping up
we know that Netflix clearly changed the
game and really pushed forward
they started though and they became who
they are today because they had guess
what hit shows so we talked about what
Apple is trying to do unfortunately
right now apples two shows per se are
carpool karaoke which is entertaining
but I'm not going to pay for a service
to watch that and then we had planted of
the apps which although the idea and I
think the intent was fun the actual
execution of the show everyone's pretty
much pooh-poohing on it so if those are
your first two to get people interested
in a service that's not gonna cut it now
Apple is investing the 1 billion dollars
the other aspect of this if you compare
it to what HBO is doing you know the
home of Game of Thrones the home of
Silicon Valley right great amazing
content over there well they they're
spending about 2 billion so Apple's
budget about half of what Time Warner is
doing but what you're seeing is really
this race for content where everyone is
now putting a mom on these you know
really subscription-based services even
Netflix right six billion dollars can
you keep up with what is on Netflix you
you know what Beechum you don't even
have a subscription yet no but never so
be high your so being high I'm Way
behind yeah I'm like I dunno if I had a
free extra person to put on my plan I
would give it to you but I don't doesn't
my whole family just rides it rides on
my coattails bro it's fine I'm surviving
with Amazon Prime and HBO go so I'm kind
of no fee yeah I mean I don't know if
you heard this one also but Shonda
Rhimes right shaundalyn Ruffino shows
like Grey's Anatomy scandal had a gate
with get away with murder
she left ABC and is now on board
exclusively with Netflix Oh like that's
how powerful Netflix has become as a
destination for regional content now
where Apple comes in here they have a
billion dollars to spend that roughly
you're talking about
maybe if you're really allocating that
properly you could invest in about let's
say seven somewhere between seven to ten
legitimate projects but the key thing is
that they have to come out with some
hits right oh sure
house of cards orange is the new black
those were hits I watched Netflix
because of house of cards and I'm like
okay I'm gonna do the damn thing right
you need something like that and then
there's also comes a point
Beechum how many services you actually
subscribe to right now that are original
content services I mean you probably
have prime but you have any others just
just two right now just two just two
service and those with the cable I mean
cable you know what are the services
you're locked into right now right now
Amazon Prime HBO go and comcast cable
that's about it okay yeah so do you
think that you're at a saturation point
where you already have too many services
or do you feel like there is room for
another one or two for you you know I've
been trying out all these different
services like I tried Hulu for a month I
wasn't totally into it I tried was
another thing I tried for a month
YouTube TV I tried that for a month it
was great it worked great but it didn't
have enough stuff so I mean I think I'm
cool right now like I don't I don't need
a ton of content you know what I mean
you know for me I literally I don't
subscribe to Apple music I'm waiting for
something compelling enough although you
know I have a bunch of different music
services that I'm on but Apple music for
me that if they're really going to like
they have so far put this stuff behind
app it behind Apple music and if they
come out with a really great show I
think then that is a advantage for them
with their ecosystem be like not only do
you have our Apple music service you
have our shows
I'm just curious people that are
watching right now are they do they feel
like they have room to add another
service on top of what they're doing
right now like where you at tell us like
are you what are you subscribed to three
or four services five or six I mean you
know you got Hulu Amazon Prime Netflix
your cable provider HBO GO I'm curious
where everyone is that because at the
same time I don't think we've hit our
saturation point like I feel like if the
shows are good enough I'm definitely
keeping Netflix no matter what I'm
definitely keeping cable because of my
support
but then after that Amazon Prime is just
a gimme right it's part of being an
amazon user but I don't really watch
stuff on Amazon Prime I I could fit
another one in there is it gonna be
Apple I I don't know they have to they
have to show me they got the goods so
this is gonna be interesting how it
shakes out you know a lot of when you
see people like Shonda Rhimes leaving
ABC you're going to that's not the only
big name that's gonna leave you you're
starting to see studios or content
traders or writers and producers go
directly to Netflix now right now
Netflix is the leader it's probably
gonna stay that way for a while but I
think there's still room for other
competitors to kind of slide in here
yeah you know that there's a bunch of
producers probably hitting up Apple
right now being like yo I got some ideas
you know but a Palazzo has to get out of
their way and let them be creative and
make what they want to make instead of
like trying to control everything and
you know trying to censor what they're
trying to do cuz we've seen that with
Disney in the Han Solo movie with two
directors leaving and like the same week
or something and then they brought in
Ron Howard they're like Oh Ron Howard is
gonna fix it all and everyone's like you
know Ron Howard what's he gonna do
exciting but so so they really have to
get out of their way and just let them
produce and make cool stuff well I think
though I mean not to say well actually
because I don't do that but I do think
the difference was that with the Star
Wars franchise is that they have a voice
they have a tone they have this kind of
they have a way that they need to carry
this feeling throughout all their movies
and if director isn't on board on that
they're not gonna drastically change the
tone of the franchise everything Rogue
rogue one was a unique offering because
it's kind of its own Side Story so could
feel like Star Wars but kind of not
that's why I liked it a lot some people
didn't but if you're talked about a han
solo movie you can't get super creative
I mean we've even seen this with
directors for the Marvel Universe but I
think what's different with the Apple
kind of platform is that they just want
the best content I don't think Apple's
going to interfere with it this whole
idea of them saying it has to be music
related that's gonna have to go from the
wayside if they really want some unique
offerings that no one can put out there
like don't tie it to a theme of music or
a theme of apps or a theme of your
services forget that you just need to
basically outbid people for the best
shows and movies that are coming out
they're sitting on 260
plus billion dollars so out of all those
companies out there they have they
literally have the cash to do it it just
comes down to in their DNA are they
willing to throw all that money with the
risk of it not working or not because
ingrained and a company like that their
culture is like we need returns on
margins we need we need to make a profit
guess what
shows and movies don't always make a
profit so there's a gamble there and I
think it's like kind of maybe changing
their mentality or their DNA of how they
think because content creation is
totally different than product creation
yeah I have one more quick thought to
like you're saying apples like
concentrating on like music based
television shows and stuff like that
like they got to get away from making
commercials because planet of the app
was like a commercial for Apple's App
Store exactly the music stuff that
they're doing that's a commercial for
Apple music they're like it seems like
everything they're creating is like a
commercial for Apple sort of you know or
what is it the carpool karaoke I'm sure
all those songs are like find it on
Apple music so they just got to get away
from that and just make something that's
totally out out of the ordinary of Apple
you know and you have you have like now
some of the competitors right it's
Netflix its Amazon its HBO
Hulu CBS all access our parent company
is coming out with their a Star Trek
Discovery show which is kind of one of
their to them that's like that's our
bread and butter to get people in right
you got to have a show like that Apple
is going to get into it we're probably
not gonna see any real fruits of this
labor until next year so don't expect
all sudden to drop like this amazing
show on us because that stuff just takes
time you have other content creators
that are trying to get in it so it's
gonna get crowded really fast in the
next year but at the same time I mean
it's just gonna come down to how much
disposable income are people willing to
allocate because they're watching less
TV they're gonna be putting that money
now arguably into these services so if
your cable bill was around 50 60 bucks
the whole goal was not to pay 50 60
bucks for cable anymore so what you're
gonna maybe allocate 30 40 bucks to
these services I think that's we're
gonna find out where consumers really
fall on that yeah that's a better number
definitely better number so uh just I
think it's really exciting though I'm
happy to hear it as
someone who has been begging for Apple
to create original content they struck
out on their TV subscription service we
know that that that was a big fail in my
opinion but other people may argue it's
not I think it was because now everyone
is doing it everyone is making money
from it but we'll see how this plays out
I think this this is a good sign that
they actually care about this their jump
into it and we'll see how it all pans
out it just comes down to the people
that make those decisions over there but
also kind of some other exciting stuff
in the Apple TV world we talked about
how the home pod firmware from a couple
weeks ago revealed that a new Apple TV
will most likely if all you know all the
strings in in the developer firmware pan
out that it will be a 4k based Apple TV
I'm kind of some small little things
about Apple TV ESPN just announced and
the app is officially out from what I
gather I didn't I didn't get it on my
Apple TV yet but their new app will
allow you to basically stream up to four
games at one time Veta a split screen so
this is like perfect for the college
football season coming up I mean if if
you don't want to look outside for the
day you can take full advantage of this
I mean I think it's I think it's amazing
cuz we've always been used to
picture-in-picture this is four games at
one time that is pretty cool but I can't
imagine watching four games at one time
but I can I could see this like in a bar
or something you know like at someone's
bar like you can have bunch of multiple
games on the screen but I don't know if
I'd watch four games at the same time do
you like separate games like can I have
like a golf tournament one in a football
game but you know what's really cool
about this you know I like the fact so
here's one yes so for example it doesn't
have to be sports games what it appears
is ESPN put out a video clip and it
shows off how not only it doesn't have
to be force claims it can be - it can be
a split screen of two different types of
programming it doesn't have to be sports
games it's all stuff that's on ESPN it
could be a big screen with two little
windows it can be versatile depending on
how you use it they also said
potentially one of those screens could
be used dedicated for like scoreboards
fantasy stats because come on if you had
three screens and a fantasy stat ticker
in the bottom right of those four
screens that's kind of cray that's like
that is oh they got gone
they got golf on there when they have
golf events on ESPN right this is all an
event so that that makes it pretty sweet
but what I like about this is finally
it's taken so long but these are the
type of apps that we want to see on
Apple's platform that make it unique
that you can't do anywhere else I mean I
know you can do split-screen in other
ways but in order just like they finally
were like hey let's make the iPad pro a
unique product of its own with iOS 11
that's what they need to do with Apple
TV not only does it need to be 4k and
these have killer apps like this to be
able to do that to be able to make it
special to make it feel like it's worth
our money this is cool this is really
cool um watching this demo I hadn't seen
before and I want this on everything
Comcast everything it's cool so that's
really cool also another app that's
coming out reports point to August the
22nd Vudu which is a video service I'm
not sure if you all are familiar with it
but I'll tell you why I know about is
because I bought the very first moudou
box they had like a an actual set-top
box and I paid $300 for to get access to
video streaming this is before a video
streaming was like built into everything
yeah that guy right I'm that guy but um
they're they're making an app coming out
August 22nd but what I find is really
interesting about voodoo is that one of
the things that made them special is
they do HD streaming of not only HD
streaming but 4k streaming content
depending on in its it's typically
linked to some of the most recent movies
but there were a few places that are
doing blockbuster movies if not the only
4k streaming through your set through
whatever device you're using so they're
bringing this app to the Apple TV in an
August 22nd now the reason why that is
interesting to me is because we've had
all these rumors about a 4k Apple TV
coming this year a voodoo TV app that
supports or sorry a voodoo movie and TV
app that supports 4k content it also
supports Dolby vision and Dolby Atmos
surround sound if you haven't heard it
that's like blows your mind like this
app will be able to do it with your
TV so it just seems like this marriage
of we are getting a 4k Apple TV sometime
this year all the hints are there I
don't think it's gonna come next I think
we're gonna see it sometime this fall or
at least for the holiday season that's
cool you think yeah you think they're
gonna announce it at the next big event
probably I hope I hope so well the thing
is their next event we still don't know
the day for it
typically it's early September so we
will know you know we'll talk about it
later but other rumors point to write an
Apple watch iPhone and then Apple TV all
announced in September I mean that's
that's a lot of stuff but I think
they've waited this long to kind of end
this year on a high note like let's do
the damn thing you know that's what I so
foodie I'm not too familiar with voodoo
it's like a Netflix but it's Walmart
and it what does it cost you know how
much it costs a month it's a free
service it's just a video streaming
service where you can buy movies you can
also watch movies for free it's not a
Netflix there's no subscription base
it's just basically a video service and
also if you're someone like me who buys
blu-rays you get a digital code to be
able to watch those movies digitally as
well like through streaming oh that's
cool that is cool
so it's just another option the only
reason why I like it also was like
because studios are jerks sometimes they
don't give you an iTunes code and you
have to watch it through like the Warner
Brothers app or a different app Vudu
typically plays nice with everyone
whether it's Disney Marvel content or
Warner Brothers Studio stuff for
Paramount so ultimately it works on Vudu
and then it's platform agnostic so
that's kind of cool to see oh there you
go um last thing before we get to our
little break the Apple TV we this I
don't don't don't believe this but you
can look at public seconds I don't I
don't know what to think but there's
this microblogging Chinese site where a
lot of people leak stuff on it and
allegedly someone leaked what is
purportedly potentially an actual Apple
TV like television set like a television
it's like in like a testing room yeah
like what is believed to be a television
there's like other photos down there
that you can click on it's like in this
white glow a room it looks basically
like a nice big silver flat team
but it has like an Apple logo on the
back on the rear side that everyone's
like so this is an actual TV is this an
old-ass picture that they're not doing
anything with it to me it still doesn't
make sense for Apple to make and release
a TV purely from a profitability
standpoint purely from the fact that the
market is dominated it's not it's not
easy for someone to be like hey here's
just another TV that happens have an
Apple logo on it has to do so much more
differently and they don't need to they
just just sell an Apple TV box so take
it for what it's worth it's out there
but if you're listening to this it's
okay you didn't see it because it's
probably fake do you think maybe like
maybe there's a possibility Apple might
have like developed this a long time ago
and then like shelved it or something
yeah totally
I mean Apple has done thing remember
they made the iPad before the iPhone
that's right that's right yes so the
things that we see have been the things
that we finally see in our hands have
been in development for like four or
five years so a lot of times when Apple
was like on that downturn they knew they
were on the downturn they're laughing at
shows like guys are like dude Apple what
are you doing but then they're like huh
I guess wait for four or five years then
we'll show you planing and it's gonna
take four or five years for them to turn
that ship around so you know well we'll
see we'll see how it all plays out but
let's let's take a little moment for a
little breather shall we let's do it

yeah just do that for yourself you can't
lose and lose all right let's jump over
to Apple watch stuff a lot of juicy
stuff here this kind of was the week of
Apple watch stuff until the Apple TV
news dropped according to reports the
Apple watch Series three is in final
testing which means it will be hitting
mass production in the very near future
which also means is expected to line up
to be available to ship out sometime in
September that would align conveniently
around the same time as guess what's the
Apple iPhone so that is a report from
the economic daily news coming out of
Taiwan based on their supply chain
relationships but I thought this cool
story we've heard a lot about
LTE being part of the iPhone this week
was really kind of hammered home that
LTE will be part of this next Apple
watch I'm sorry I said iPhone earlier
LT will be part of this next Apple watch
KGI Securities analyst Ming Chi quo our
favorite our favorite scooper Ming Chi
quo says that the iPhone is expected to
launch this fall with LTE support it'll
be the first time obviously for the
Apple watch but it's unlikely to support
direct phone calling and a lot of people
are hoping that oh I could use this as a
phone it's not necessarily the case just
yet it sounds a little gray but what the
report says is that because Apple
is still trying to work on perfecting
the actual user interface and data
transmission of making just a call
directly from your Apple watch they do
he does believe that we probably may not
see it this year
however the Apple watch will support
services like FaceTime audio Skype right
we have these voice over IP services
that the Apple watch could use and could
leverage that LTE data so that is that's
the latest report about this Apple watch
the main the faces or the watch faces
are still expected to be the same size
38 millimeters 42 842 millimeters but
the real a main selling point this time
around according to the reports is that
it will be a the LTE version of the
watch and there's people that are gonna
want that I I have an Apple watch first
gen so maybe I'll do the LTE one I don't
know that it would have to I would want
it to be able the thing is I don't want
to call I don't want to do this I don't
want to do this I don't have no problem
doing that you know but is that is that
this is because of real estate on the
watch like there there's they're trying
to find room for antennas and room for
other things in the watch so they
they're getting rid of the out or
they're getting rid of the direct call
ability well they're actually saying
it's more of a kind of Apple perfecting
the feature in the software so here's
the other issue it's good you brought
this up because I forgot to bring it up
the actual Apple watch you know it
doesn't have enough space to put in a
full-on SIM card kind of like our phones
right they didn't design it that way in
the first place but it will support
what's called isom it stands for
embedded sim which is you know not a
actual sim card you put in but a chip
that is in the watch it'll be able to
pair with your iPhone and basically sync
it up so you'll have that same similar
phone number at least that's what the
reports are saying but the other trick
about this is they have been talking to
US carriers who are on board to sell and
support this Apple watch but the e sim
technology not the sim card technology
but this embedded sim technology isn't
supported by every carrier and so when
you talk about internationally that
could be a problem where stories were
saying hey look this Isom isn't gonna be
supported by every carrier so that means
you won't everyone won't be able to use
LTE for this Apple watch it'll kind of
start
as a slow rollout depending on where you
live more than anything else which which
is kind of a bummer but if that's just
the way it is that's the way it is right
there's no space for sim card
so so do you think people should wait
for the the next watch after that if
they want to get clown or well I think
well I think we have to ultimately we
always have to see officially what Apple
tells us about it maybe maybe they get
it done in time right we don't really
know this yet but if it's if you've
always wanted phone calling on your
watch I think that I'm more than happy
using FaceTime audio in fact FaceTime
audio sounds better oh yeah then LTE
call anyways so if that's the case bring
it on I'm totally cool with that it
always trips me out when someone calls
me and it's like through VoIP VoIP or
whatever cuz it sounds so different it
sounds like they're right next to you
almost you know like the quality is like
really iOS super it's super nice yeah
that's cool so you know that we'll see
we'll see how that all plays out other
kind of reports are just saying that the
form factor which was roughly rumored to
change it's not gonna change we talked
about the watch faces staying the same
and then CNBC earlier said this week
that yes the LTE reports are correct
they also threw out no one has thrown
this out yet that the Apple watch Series
3 will launch alongside the iPhone 8 at
the September event we haven't heard any
of the report confirm that or door also
say yes that's happening so we'll wait
and see we don't even have a date yet
again for this new of this next Apple
event so I'm just gonna we're gonna
we're gonna chill on it cool gonna Apple
watch in chill Apple watch it show you
wait I forgot do you don't have an Apple
watch when you get an Apple watch if you
could call from it I I would if I could
call from it I think I would I would get
one just because you know it's just it's
cool my watch my Casio which is really
old it's dying right now so I'm like
yeah watch so I have been thinking about
it looking at Apple watches and stuff
and if I can make a call from it that
would be awesome
boo-yeah so people people I think look
that the rumblings are pointing at
either September the 6th or September
the 12th which is a Tuesday it's it
we'll see where it falls again
we don't really know no one's even given
an inkling so the way man that's coming
up yeah yeah alright let's get to this
we've talked about the iPhone so much we
wanted to kind of push it down a little
lower because there are other stuff that
was going on this week this is my
favorite story this came out fresh today
like this is new you this is new news
so McDonald's put out this promotional
email earlier today and then people
started looking at it like wait what
what what is going on here
it appears that McDonald's used an
iPhone 8 mock-up and an act mock-up to
show off like a new app for McDonald's
that has a pickup order restaurant
locator with a special 25% off discount
but the funny thing is in this email
they used an iPhone 8 as the example to
show off their new app and promotion
this is so hilarious I mean did they get
that from Apple or haha how does this
happen
no no let's see I think look I don't
know where they got this but there's a
couple flaws in this whole picture here
so first of all yes it is it looks like
it's from an iPhone mock-up right we've
seen plenty of these throughout the
internet I mean this one looks like one
of them the other thing is if you look
at the signal bars on the top left of
the phone
those are dots you know in iOS 10 they
were dots but in iOS 11 which is the new
operating system they are actual they
went back to bars so that was a giveaway
that some graphic artists a genius he's
a genius McDonald this is marketing guy
whoever does me I'm gonna give him that
I will get him mad genius very smart
we're talking dude the Apple by this
time I'll McDonald's
I'm loving it no but that is that is if
I have a feeling this graphic artist is
a tech fan you know cuz this is very
smart thing to do cuz you got more
attention to this to this app now like
they don't need any more hey you know on
that song that I pulled
go to like the last ten seconds I've got
to hear the ending of that hungry for
the music gotta eat I'm loving the R&amp;amp;B
version so thank you McDonald's for the
lead the top story of the day put a
smile on my face and get a little JT
singing I'm loving it McDonald's yeah
yeah do you know what it was actually an
original song and then was adapt adapted
for an TV ad but he has a song called
I'm loving it that is original JT song
you can look it up everybody and then
they twist it around and manipulate it
for the McDonald's ads which were like I
actually was like I'll do that sounds
good that's cool yeah if McDonald's like
if I wrote a song McDonald's Kim like I
want to buy your song I'm like sure yeah
what when do you need it send it right
away I'll change the lyrics and include
the prize chicken McNuggets and
officially in there for ya with special
sauce shoot they should talk to the
apple pie we could create a dope video
for oh man yeah Oh call us holler
McDonald's Apple
oh you guys holy I hope we showed you
some of those inside the Apple TV photos
earlier talked about it for people that
are listening check this out
there were two leaks of videos blurry
videos from inside potentially
purportedly allegedly let's just throw
those words out inside the factory a
factory allegedly of workers polishing
rows of what is believed to be iPhone 8
and then another video showed them all
hanging on a rack like just dangling
there on who knows but this is all
leaked blurry ish but but now you can at
least see stuff look video looks kind of
legit I mean you don't know what that is
I think it looks pretty legit to me I
don't know what people think watching is
that legit is that like a yes legit I
don't it's a long line of long line of
uh workers right there just working way
those whose people are working hard and
if someone complains about their job
like I'm gonna show I'm
let's put things in perspective man like
oh my gosh right like could you met
that's what we don't think about like
that in a way this is kind of sobering
right you've seen this video people like
polishing your phone like there's like
that's what they're doing all day just
for us to have this like crazy $1,000
thing in our pocket it's like damn
and then just imagine all the videos of
people like destroying them on camera
for YouTube use and stuff I look I you
know me you know I'm against that I'm a
hundred percent against that yeah I if I
get fired for saying I think destroying
a product for views I think that's total
crap my bosses can holler me but I it's
such you know people the thing is more
like it started on YouTube and other
people did it like do we really have to
do that no yeah you know it's gonna
break you like I shoot it with a high
round like a high rifle round or
something or drop it from the top of a
building
I think we're sure it's gonna break yeah
like we're a technology website we
should love technology we shouldn't
 whoo we should have destroyed it
oh he's getting passionate about his
passion is everybody yeah really
we should not if you love technology
don't destroy it that's all I'm saying
like there's people like to thank you
out that video okay I'm off my rocker
you know like an inside look at how
iPhone gets me and when I first saw it
to I was like it's you know it's it's a
little bit shocking is that that might
be like Foxconn or something who knows
what yeah yeah it's just so brain to me
it's just so bringing me this
perspective all right um as we
transition over to something more we're
talking about the iPhone 7s leaked
schematics of the iPhone 7s have started
to indicate or look to indicate that the
phone itself the body itself will be
slightly larger only by literally
hundreds of millimeters larger in all
dimensions height width and thickness oh
okay so it's because right we know that
this these new iPhones are reportedly
going to have glass surfaces on the back
and what that's believed to do is
support
wireless charging so in addition to that
right if you're gonna have a phone that
is a little thicker because of adding
that layer of glass so there you go that
that would make sense why the iPhone 7s
will be at least a slightly thicker
someone's someone on periscope like
saved earth so we'll use that you want
it's gonna be girthy girls dear now I
mean like the thickness in Apple in like
Apple measures like that's enormous
right if you're someone from Apple like
that's huge oh you know you know Johnny
I've right now he's just he's just
shaking his head like he's up shake it
yeah I can't believe you made my phone
thicker you can't take it dude you can't
take it I'm just a quick also people
have been calling us and asking us about
the iPhone se just to let you know the
last we heard about it is that it's
rumored to come out sometime in early
2018 most likely really just a process
or upgrade my hunch is that touch ID
will still be on it because it's not
like they're gonna put in the whole new
face ID system maybe they will if it's
cheaper but if it's the iPhone se it's
that same form factor that's what you
should expect just more of a faster
processor to support the new ISO we'll
see when that comes out but rumors say
early 2018 nothing has pointed to us
seeing it
this September as well so yes okay you
know what I think we should just go to
the calls man let's do it let's do it I
was trying to find this Q this up for uh
you're talking about the iPhone se and
you used to use I got a drop again
powered okay that's that's classic man
people that watch the Apple I know
that's classic
it's a classic yeah yeah you used to
make the greatest oddball
my favorite dance movie right now you go
iphone SE alright alright thank you all
for calling guys we got a lot a lot of
good calls this week is like it took me
in bTW like an hour to go through all
the calls here we go call number one hi
my name is Shawn I'm from Atlanta
Georgia and with all the hype going
around the iPhone 8 release you know and
there being three iPhones this year
everybody seems to get hyped on that but
you know what's the plan for that phone
into the future is Apple going to just
have three phones from now on and you
know how are they going to roll out the
tech on the ice the iPhone future into
the you know upcoming phones or is this
gonna be a one and done deal
thanks I love it first of all I love how
he like mentally called it the iPhone
future our indoctrination of getting
that name spread has completely worth
it's working yes it's totally working
but Apple's not gonna use it um what I
was gonna say is you know their Apple
has made more money than ever with the
multiple models of phones I think
they're gonna stick to it this is Tim
Cook's mo different levels higher
margins on the higher phone different
price points they took really the
Samsung model of multiple size phones
and adopted it themselves and they're
making more money from it you know we
skip the story because we want to get to
the calls but in the based on our report
the number who are the top two selling
phone models this quarter from April to
June it's the iPhone 7 at 7 and the
iPhone 7 plus those are the top two
selling phones so imagine if they only
had one model fine it would be the
top-selling phone but now you're talking
about two phones at two different sizes
and now we're gonna talk about three
phones at three different sizes yeah
there
though it's most likely at least for an
individual model not selling the most
phones we know Android phones are gonna
just destroy as a total how many iPhones
are sold worldwide but for a specific
model it's gonna be no surprise if at
least see end up seeing iPhone 8 iPhone
7s and the iPhone 7s plus on the top 3
the next time they do something we know
once the iPhone is out for a good amount
of time I would told it's totally
believable to me so they're gonna stick
with three models that like anything
they always eventually roll out and
adopt the new technology I think this
10th anniversary phone is kind of going
to be one of those benchmarks where this
is at least from a feature standpoint on
new design because I know people like
the iPhone is the same design over here
yeah it pretty much is but this is kind
of that next jump for an actual form
factor that feels different although it
may look the same it's gonna feel a
whole lot different so that'll be kind
of like eventually the 7s and stuff will
go away just like they've always done
just think about how they always done
every two years basically that new form
factor comes in I think it's it might
also be a little heavier if it's more
glass on there I feel like it's gonna be
a little heavier so it might feel a lot
of hands yeah it might be yeah okay next
call here we go hey yeah what's up this
is Austin from Monticello Arkansas
anyway my question for you is do you
think since space ideas coming to the
iPhone 8 and touch ID won't be included
since they couldn't get to work under
the glass and future iPhones they will
even use touch ID anymore
if face ID works on how they plan do you
think that the iPhone 7 7 is could be
the last iPhones we see to actually
include touch ID all right yeah things
have a ghulam the answer is with
exception of an upcoming updated iPhone
se absolutely I think those will be the
last two phones that have touch ID
because they're trying to get under that
glass that that's the goal not only are
they trying to do it Samsung is trying
to do it other companies are doing it
Qualcomm themselves I believe it's
Qualcomm already has the prototype for a
fingerprint sensor through the glass
that will be they'll start selling those
components sometime in early 2018 so
it's coming not only to Apple but to
multiple manufacturers
cool alright next call hi this is cat
from tokyo i'm an american but i
currently live here and i'm wondering
about the ipad mini I have an iPad Mini
2 and I want to buy a higher storage one
and I'm afraid they won't make an iPad
Mini 5
there's blowout sales all over the city
for iPad Mini 4 should I buy one I don't
like the size of any bigger iPads like
the iPad Mini 4 is for me unless I make
a 5 what should I do
what should she so we wanted to show
love the cat because look we have a rule
here on the Apple bite if you're a girl
and you call your gonna get on the show
but I do not want you guys to be calling
in squeaky high voices pretending to be
girls just to get your call on do that
now someone is going to do that I love
peach and Todd is Krisha whoever I'll
let one of those through but you better
ask a good question all that one through
that's will let one through yeah yeah so
eight I don't know the next they just
announced the iPad door they just
dropped the price of the iPad Mini 4 I
don't think we're gonna see an iPad Mini
I think that's gonna go away in about
two years I don't think we're gonna see
it anymore because we have these large
screen phones
it's obviously cannibalized that and
then the ten point five inch iPad is the
same size roughly as what the iPad 9.7
is used to be I think that many is great
I would I would still love if there if
somehow I don't I'm not saying like
actually no I would put it if I had a
car and I wanted to install an iPhone it
I would put it 7.5 inch iPad in the - if
I could I always wanted to put an iPad
in my - but it just wasn't ready yet so
you know what I don't I don't I think
it's gonna be gone in about the next few
years I really do it would be dope to
have an iPad in your - I haven't diamond
thought about that that'd be cool I mean
that's kind of the Elon Musk are that
what did they called the test yes yeah
they all have like an eye like not an
iPad
three model three yeah yeah they have
like a table model that looks cool I
like that I'm on that waiting list cuz
I'm like I'm gonna put down the deposit
because by the time I get it maybe I'll
be ready to get a car but if not oh well
word yeah well I mean that'll be done
let's go over lesson roll out together
man that's good that's roll skip I hit
on some chicks in it just kidding
honestly that's like a nerd car it's
like it's not a hot car like a nice not
no sports car it's like oh hey there's
that tech bro guy in the car and his
Tesla Model 3 I just wanted like have
the self-driving feature on and watch
movies on my iPad in the dashboard I
like that yeah yeah alright next all
thanks Karl
hey this is Trevor from Seattle do you
think the power button is being enlarged
on the iPhone 8 because there might be a
possibility of them adding touch ID on
to it or no power button change
yeah there's rumors you know the designs
are shown an elongated power button
there are phones that have had a
fingerprint sensor on that power button
I believe Sony phones have incorporated
something like that forgive me if I'm
wrong internet world who knows
everything more than all of us combined
so we're not always right but if if they
needed to integrate that in the future
and that is an option by elongating the
power button maybe there's no reports
that's so anything that indicates that
the next iPhones will have it so we will
wait and see but that it's all
speculation right now like a lot of the
stuff that we talked about but guess
what we're listening it's fun because we
love talking about this stuff so we'll
see I can't lie I called you a while
back about a question about Joe breaking
but I'm a big time jailbreak fanatic I
love my Apple products when I get to
jailbreak it dude Apple has been
tightening down so hard on the jailbreak
people and not allowing the Joe brace to
pull through annual I bro I'm kind of
thinking about ditch at Apple yeah
you know apples cool and stuff but did
you know it's friggin boring at the same
time you know you can't theme it you
can't download music from Pandora or
anything like that unless you got a
premium subscription I kind of like all
that stuff I don't know let me know what
y'all think
much love homies much love everybody
y'all be good peace I love I love the
positive vibe on that call I love the
fact that I feel like that homeboy right
there if he saw me on the street or he
saw us on the street he would just talk
to us just like that oh yeah that's like
that was like that's real I'm look if
he's gonna leave he's gonna leave I mean
you're not the thing is you're not gonna
leave it was getting I kind of agree
with him that I've boring now you know
it's like the same thing that we've had
for 10 years now so it is it is kind of
little boring you know it is born until
it unlocks with your face we're gonna do
thanks uh yeah we're gonna be excited
about that like the first two times we
do it I think that's gonna be like like
day 1 day 2 in your face Samsung Samsung
users me like yeah I've had this for a
while bro yeah problems do that alright
next call we got to this one I'm gonna
have to cut it off early cuz this guy
went a little long so let's let's try
this bitch in town what's up just again
Houston Texas want to quickly go over
the iPhone for Life program I don't know
how it is for every carrier but with
least the one that I'm working with if
you aren't quite at that 50 percent mark
like say you're 12 months is and
December not at September you just have
to pay the remaining month so if you got
a $27 a month iPhone 7 and you got three
months left before you're at your
halfway mark well 27 times 3 that's what
you're paying whatever $77 is and then
trade in your phone and then you're part
of that iPhone for life so you can still
do it even if you're not smack dab on
that 12 month cycle I love a show
Houston Texas always listed when I'm
driving to and from work
love the iPad pro 10.5 great Apple
awesome product okay he's like anything
you say it's a good I was like great
Apple I'm telling you that is that is
one hell of a product this year I mean I
got to give a major props specifically
with iOS 11 specifically so so what do
you think it the apple the Apple iPhone
4 life thing so he's saying if you want
to get the next iPhone you have to pay
off what you which you would owe for the
then yeah Apple months or whatever you
have left over basically whatever is
left on that contract you sign to cover
it and then turn in your old phone that
makes sense I mean that's why we have
people call because I don't deal with it
that way so there's a lot of people that
are curious and it's a it's a unique to
me it's not unique to me it's everyone
does things like that so that's good to
know yeah okay we got two more they're
real short so let's not okay this is
Allen brim from Texas tips and cards
take longer
Apple pay takes longer face recognition
will take longer but Apple fans don't
care I can't I don't want things that
take longer
Apple pay does not take okay hold up
Apple pay is fast well he's he's talking
about when we get the new facial unlock
we don't know how we don't know how fast
it's gonna be though we I'm all I'm
saying is I can't I'm never gonna speak
on it or judge it I mean we might give
hot takes cuz that's what we're
basically doing most of the time but to
say like it's slower we don't know that
but I get what out i get what my man was
it Alan I get what he's saying yeah we
had a lot of colors from Texas this week
I know I guess we got a everything's
bigger in Texas Apple buy extra twenties
big in Texas bro yeah don't mess with
Texas baby love it that's where I was
born
okay really yeah Houston Texas baby
space city okay here's the last call we
got this is trail from Texas and I was
had a question about Cameron iPhone 8
this coming but you get a black eye or
something oh
I swell and lip is swollen you're gonna
have a phone as your phone still gonna
be able unlock and what is this guy's
name again hang on a second me hi this
is Trey from Texas well it really trails
real brill / l / l yeah he gets in a lot
of I think does he get a lot of fights
you think like is he boxing or sodium
oxide no he's worried about fat lips and
a black eye well here's here's the thing
I don't I actually think that the
pigment if how this if Apple is smart
and they've seen what's happened with a
lot of other technology gadgets that
aren't able to pick up on changes or
darker skin tones or pigmentation
differences the fact is that this
infrared sensor or you know will be able
to not only look at your face but I'll
have some ability to capture the depth
of your face which means it could create
a rough wireframe of your face in
addition to who knows exactly what
they're doing if it's a combination of
iris scanning facial scanning depth
sensing and then also the ability to
really see if you're a living person
like right if you're I know not moving
or blinking because it's gonna have to
register faster than that but there was
some aspect of that facial recognition
as a whole all of these different pieces
being used together so I don't think
it's gonna just rely on like as if you
were a photo that stayed the same all
the time let's hope not let's hope that
like you know you know I'm saying like
we've seen all those stupid things like
there was recently I I can't remember it
was like a soap dispenser that like
worked on a white paper towel but not on
like a black dude tan you don't I'm
saying it like stuff like that Michael
chin in certain apps that couldn't pick
up people that had dark skin tone so
it's like that we've seen that a bunch
so I'm pretty sure that I'll give them
the benefit that down until it happens
but there are the type of coming that
tends to think about a lot of those
things in general tends to I would love
to see their like testing facility where
they're testing is stuff like giving it
to different people and try this out
okay didn't work
let's get another guy in here real quick
that's it then we're done we're done
all right thank you so much everyone for
