DAV d-david for short is a prototype
augmented reality display that fits into
a Kirby Morgan dive helmet the helmet
display was created at the Naval Surface
Warfare Center Panama City division and
offers situational awareness or sector
sonar that enables topside divers to
provide visual communications to divers
below the surface according to the
video's description which was published
on the US Navy's YouTube channel in
early June the da VB aids a diver in
navigating to a target underwater that
is mostly always difficult to see and
also can assist in other tasks such as
repairing a ship or locating sunken
objects like a downed aircraft at the
bottom of the ocean when we think of
drones we usually picture a quadcopter
that can fly up and down go left and
right maybe sometimes bust out a flip
trick well the omni copter is going to
change all of that the omni copter is an
aerial vehicle with six degrees of
freedom that can generate forces and
torques in all directions using an 8
rotor configuration it was designed and
built by researchers at the Institute
for dynamic systems and control in
Zurich Switzerland the Omni copter is
able to change the direction of the
motors and rotor blades while in mid-air
allowing each propeller to produce both
positive and negative thrust the
actuator configuration allows the omni
copter to utilize four different planes
of flight as opposed to a standard
quadcopter rotor configuration this six
degrees of freedom allows the omni
copter to roll over while hovering move
in a straight line without having to
tilt itself in a desired direction and
by combining the two moves makes flying
novel maneuvers much easier and smoother
