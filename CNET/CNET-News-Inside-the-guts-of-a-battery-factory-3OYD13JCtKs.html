could last more than one day without
having to recharge I'm Jessica's all
court for CNET here at Layton energy in
Fremont California where that is not
just a beautiful dream it is the future
I'm here with Mark Jesco who is the vice
president of research and development
and they're working on a chemical
composition that goes into batteries and
helps them last longer how does this
exactly work we've developed a new
electrolyte system in here which can be
used with any cathode or any anode
material and this allows us to get very
very high energy densities within our
system we're using a lithium amide salt
as opposed to the standard el ap s6
salts and this lithium amide salt it's
very very stable so basically it cuts
down on the creation of hydrofluoric
acid and that's what helps the battery
last longer that's correct okay so now
we're gonna take a tour of your R&amp;amp;D
facility here what are we looking at
with these arms popping out and what we
do in here is we get the materials ready
for the battery
so right now Alana is preparing
materials she's weighing them out and
getting them ready to put into cells so
mark I see that this is the cathode room
and I'm looking now at a spinning
cylinder what is this this is the active
material so the cathode active material
that's the positive and what we do first
is we take the active material powder we
mix it with a binder and put it into
solution
what's it called this is the slurry
slurry all right can we see it
some black goo in here pretty much
that's correct and we're gonna see what
this goes on eggs know exactly how this
helps to produce batteries the next step
is the current collector where the
slurry is coated and dried in a long
oven we want to put as much active
material into the cell to make the
battery run longer so to do that we move
over to this calendaring machine where
we compress the electrodes the sheets
are then cut into strips and then tabbed
and that's gonna carry the electrons to
the outside of the battery now the
battery enters the winding room or the
anode and cathode are shaped into
cylindrical or pouch cells so this is
one of our electrolyte filling stations
where we put the our own proprietary
lithium amide electrolyte into the cells
now that the cell is made that's going
to be part of the battery Leyden isn't
finished yet because now they have to do
some testing so we've got our trusty
goggles here and what's going on this is
an impact test we take a 20 pound weight
who drops two feet directly onto the
cell and it's meant to simulate an
internal short-circuit we're showing
that these cells are safe to transport
on aircraft and also to get ul
recognition and the tests aren't over
yet so what we're going to do is we're
going to fire a nail right through the
cell and make sure that there's no fire
no smoke no explosion so you can see
that's an excellent result battery
performance is the last thing they'll
test as part of their research now well
you won't be seeing Leyden batteries and
today's smartphones and tablets they are
on track to start cropping up sometime
in 2013 for CNN I'm Jessica's all floors</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
