welcome to another first look video
audio files tend to prefer listening to
music through wired headphones but that
hasn't stopped certain venerable audio
companies including Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins
from jumping on the wireless bandwagon
and introducing Bluetooth headphones
this is the p5 Wireless and for all
intensive purposes it's a dead ringer
for the wired p5 series - but at $400
costs a hundred and thirty dollars more
than that model like it's wired sibling
the p5 Wireless is comfortable for in an
on-ear headphone they're not
exceptionally so and it really does have
the look and feel of a higher-end
headphone with a swanky design that's a
mix of retro and modern styling at 213
grams it weighs 18 grams or 0.6 ounces
more than the wired p53 buttons on the
right ear cup allow you to control
volume skip tracks forward and back and
answer calls yes there is a built-in
microphone and call quality was decent
the headphone offers apdex bluetooth
streaming for compatible devices aptX is
supposed to deliver better sound quality
though it's debatable how much of an
impact it has like the wired p5 this
headphone has removable ear pads they
adhere magnetically which is nice and a
cable is included if you want to go
wired in case the internal battery dies
that battery is rated for 17 hours of
continuous music playback which is quite
good it's also worth mentioning that a
nice carrying case is included this
headphone has the same drivers that are
in the wired p5 series too and those
drivers are based on the drivers found
in Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins top the line p7 and
over the year headphone this Wireless
version retains the same well-balanced
sound profile and overall I thought it
sounded excellent for a bluetooth
headphone they're not quite as open as
some of the high-end over-ear models
I've tested but the headphones deliver
relatively clean detailed sound with
deep punchy bass and you can listen to
them for long periods without getting
listening fatigue
sure the wired p5 sound a little more
dynamic but it's almost impossible to
find a bluetooth headphone that can
compete with a top-notch wired model in
the end my only hesitation about these
headphones is the price you can get
other premium on your wireless
headphones such as the Plantronics
backbeat sense and bose sound like on
your Bluetooth it cost significantly
less and are lighter and more
comfortable they don't have the build
quality of this headphone and depending
on your ears and musical tastes they may
not sound quite as good but it's a close
race so if you get a chance to try
before you buy I'm David Karn away and
that's the Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins p-5 wireless
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
