mini it's a lot like the galaxy s4 many
of the same features but a smaller
screen and a smaller price let's see if
this little budget-friendly phone will
impress me and you it's a small box
tamper-evident tape
oh it looks so tiny it's totally Minnie
this is gonna be hilarious by the way
cuz this mini I think it's good size
that most phones used to be remember
like two years ago all right get it out
of here I continue to love Samsung's
packaging by the way eco elegance iCarly
oh look at that little nubbin so cute
4.3 inch display it's like almost the
size of an old iphone okay I'm cracking
myself up here all right it is super
lightweight for that subset of people
who still want to put their phone in
their pocket which due to radiation
concerns i do not recommend but to each
his own let's get the battery out of
here while I figure out what else is in
the box we have a little quick start
guide some deer foam thingies our
international power brick head phones
charging cable and finally the babby pop
that in here definitely have a little
bit of that plasticky Samsung feel for
those who like that or don't like that
it's impossible to get the back off
apparently seriously what a deal with
that
am I missing something
my break a nail this mini I'm gonna be
mad first I break this mini I'm gonna be
madder I did it
I'm less in love with the packaging for
the baggage in this case is the phone
have to say I am astonished at how small
this feels compared to today's modern
mini phablet and actual phablet but
let's turn it on have a look at that
display some people are really gonna
find this to be the perfect size because
the galaxy s4 even since the s3 has
ballooned to you know four point six
inch screen a really big phone this is
nice and tidy there you have it I'm
going to go through some of the setup
here and while I do that let's talk
about the specs the galaxy s4 mini has a
4.3 inch Super AMOLED display it's a 960
x 540 resolution which is a little
disappointing but remember this is the
cheaper model it runs a 1.7 gigahertz
dual-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 400
processor powered by 1.5 at gigabytes of
RAM it has just eight gigs of on-board
storage although it is expandable via
microSD up to 64 days it runs Android
jellybean 4.2 with Samsung's TouchWiz UI
you're either a fan of that or you're
not but you can always customize at
least a little bit the mini is an LTE
phone that also has Wi-Fi NFC and
Bluetooth
it has a removable 1900 milliamp hour
battery which our editors say can last a
full day of moderate to heavy use the
camera on the s4 mini is 8 megapixels
compared to the s4 s 13 megapixels and
it also has a front facing HD camera it
does get many of the features of the
bigger s4 like smart stay which keeps
the display on if you're looking at it
motion control for pausing video or
audio and group play for sharing music
with other Samsung phones the full
unlocked price is 580 dollars u.s. the
s4 mini does seem like a perfectly
premium phone and in fact its price is
not that much lower than the s4 at five
hundred eighty dollars so i would say
this is not a budget option this is all
about having a phone that's smaller than
something like a nexus for smaller than
the Big Brother s4 something maybe
closer in size to an iPhone it's really
all about your pocket and if that's what
you're most concerned with it's a good
one
check out cnet's full review for all the
details on the s4 mini</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
