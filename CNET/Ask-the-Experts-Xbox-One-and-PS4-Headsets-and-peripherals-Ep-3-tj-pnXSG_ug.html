of ask the experts the fantastic
collaboration between cnet and GameSpot
on the scene outside I'm Jeff Bakalar
and Peter Brown for gamespot absolutely
today we're talking about existing
peripherals for the consoles like xbox
360 and playstation 3 will those flights
tix bite sticks wheels headsets will
they work with the new consoles that
just came out let's tackle this console
by console okay starting with the Xbox
one nothing is going to work sorry at
the moment sorry so everything from
headsets to flight sticks two
controllers those all have to be
purchased brand new the ones that are
made exactly for the Xbox one the one
difference here is that Microsoft has
plans to release an adapter for the
headsets they've changed their
proprietary connection from the xbox 360
for the xbox one controller so right now
the old headsets don't work but
potentially in the future you might be
able to use those I'm actually kind of
okay with the new proprietary connection
yeah have you like used it yet i've used
this yeah but eyes yeah so here here's
the box that it comes in you could buy
extra for 29 25 bucks the old headset
connector was really flimsy in that
connection and always flicker sure so I
like that this is way more sort of
grounded into the controller but like
you said if you have a headset like an
astro and a 4850 whatever it is it uses
that patch cable that goes from the
controller to the earcup gonna have to
wait for an adapter come out for you to
use that you can't take the optical
audio signal yes just for the you know
surround sound of the actual game audio
yeah when it comes to voice it's a
different story alright let's switch
gears going over to the PlayStation 4
the DualShock 4 has a port at the bottom
here that you can actually plug in any
headphone or headset rather of
one-eighth inch jack and it works with a
lot of iphone headset compatible sort of
devices and not only can you use it as a
chat headset it can also get game audio
out of radius 4 controller which is so
amazing it's so not enough people are
talking about it
because all of the significant others in
the world oh the ps4 designers their
lives and their sleep yeah I mean people
would spend a lot of money to buy
wireless headsets to get the sort of
functionality that you're getting
straight from the controller yeah and it
might not be surround sound but come on
I mean for for having it just working
outside of the controller is pretty
great yeah apart from that on the
PlayStation 4 the DualShock 3 will not
work arcade sticks Sony said that it's
going to be up to developers to program
that functionality into the game sony
also said though that the move
controllers will work granted I don't
think that there any game is at the
moment that use move rennie people that
really like using off I think the latter
is harder to come by yeah tell us a
little bit about the the existing sort
of Bluetooth head headset I a good
question yeah so the ps4 does have a
bluetooth radio inside of it sony did
not include Bluetooth functionality for
headsets the little guys you'd put in
your ear but they're coming out with a
way for that to work they said sometime
next year they don't have a patch out so
that's coming and that'll be good for a
lot of people who do already own stuff
and basically the headsets aren't
expensive peripheral if you want to keep
using your existing equipment and save
money you're gonna have to do it on the
ps4 and talking about surround sound in
headphones philip has a question about
USB support on those headsets will it be
able to do surround sound on the newer
consoles well not with the xbox one
right but with the ps4 there was a 1.5
system update that came out shortly
after release and yeah so USB headsets
will work now that includes the likes of
Astor a 40s and turtle beach headsets
and if those supports surround sound
then it'll work I feel like we shouldn't
maybe go right out and set and buy
something before there's full support if
you have like a legacy model like an
astro a40 a 50 you're going to get the
surround sound for the audio yeah for
chat a little more dicey I guess it is
also worth mentioning that the Kinect
can be used to record voice audio during
games it was only due to pressure from
the audience and you know consumers
right I led them to include this guy
right well there you have it all the
headset talk legacy options surround
sound USB hope you
guys learned a lot today that's going to
do it for us on this episode of esque
the experts I'm Jeff Bakalar and I'm
Peter Brown thank you Peter Brown for
being here we've got a lot more to talk
about with these next-generation
consoles plenty more questions that
deserve answer it stay tuned and we'll
see you guys very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
