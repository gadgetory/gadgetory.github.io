hop now backup plus B goes to the
external hard drive that connects the
computer using USB 3.0 connection and
then it comes with software for you to
backup your computer on it in fact you
can forget about the software and use
your windows or Mac's built-in backup
utility to backup your data on it either
way is fine but the hub part is
interesting because the first up is
tired come with two USB put on the front
right here that means you can connect up
to two other devices such as your phone
your thumb drive or another external
hard drive to your computer veer it now
that's pretty cool right
now despite the look of the port here
which is not blue they actually USB 3.0
trust me I tried them and they were
plenty fast and speaking of fast the
drive here is also very speedy in my
testing it has to sustain real world
speed of more than 180 megabyte per
second that's really fast for a
straightforward single volume regular
hard drive but keep in mind though it's
also a very high capacity drive a
terrible and that mean at that fast
speed it would still take you some 13
hours to fill it up so you know this is
a great drive for a desktop computer and
it's not too expensive either
for example the a terabyte drive here
can be had for just 250 dollars still
too much well it's also available in
four and 60 by for less or you can try
to be me and get one for free actually
don't try this is too late for you and
that's because I'm dumb no and this is
the Seagate backup plus how
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
