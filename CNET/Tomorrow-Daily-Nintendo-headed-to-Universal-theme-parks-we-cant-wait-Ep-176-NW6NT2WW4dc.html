to find Nintendo characters at a theme
park near you we're gonna give you the
details it's a tomorrow daily
yes you didn't see that I didn't even
tell you I was gonna do that so it's
good what's up everybody welcome
tomorrow daily greetings citizens of the
internet welcome to tomorrow daily the
best geek talk to another new verse I'm
Ashley Skeletor me as always kill
anonymous I should have known that was
coming and I didn't I an you caught me
off guard but daddy knocked me right off
right off balance ok so you're a
Nintendo fan girl I don't even think I
don't even think we we there is no BS
ism we just go right into this let's do
it hit the headlines all right we got to
talk about Nintendo okay last week
Nintendo and and universal of all plate
universal studios of all places
announced a partnership to bring
Nintendo franchise characters and
attractions to universal theme parks
around the globe Oh finally whoa um
obviously if you've ever been to
universal studios orlando they have
they've got a pretty awesome harry
potter wizarding world that you can go
visit and it's pretty great i have not
been but i've heard it's unbelievable so
here's what they are going to do so they
said they want to bring quote immersive
experiences unquote that will include
major attractions at universal theme
parks featuring a nintendo games and
characters they have theme parks in here
in california right down the street they
have Universal Studios Hollywood
universal studios orlando they also have
osaka and singapore so therefore park so
it's not just gonna be united states no
and i would imagine like a lot of the
nintendo stuff you might see that in
osaka first depending on who builds it
the quickest acaba de sintra have no sin
Tendo so um so yeah they they did not
reveal a whole lot of info but i found
this video from youtube on youtube from
PokePark which is apparently it was a
japanese pokemon theme theme park you
said was it was i don't think it exists
anymore i think they think I've closed
the PokePark um but the PokePark i saw
this video and it just I thought it was
hilarious there's like all sorts of
Pokemon themed rides okay sure beyond
the reaction of it's about time that
does Nintendo land exists yeah
in any shady shape we need shape or form
yeah one to ten what is your excitement
level on it 15 at least 15 okay now now
what what is so exciting about a
Nintendo land park so I think and beyond
you being like into Nintendo yeah I
think for me uh universal has a really
great opportunity here to not only do
you know a you know mario kart or is
legend of zelda roller coaster like a
themed roller coaster or two I think
they really have an opportunity to like
do Universal Studios Mushroom Kingdom
like they could do like Harry Potter
wizarding world they could do Universal
Studios Mushroom Kingdom are you like
walk around and there's like little
toads area all of cashiers the
restaurants that stuff hey little toad
hats everybody works they got a little
toad outfits they're all totes I think
we all in our minds in magic can already
imagine what it looks like oh yeah many
different rides I gotta say if you need
a park designer call us these the the
characters and worlds are so iconic they
buy everyone they are like people that
don't even play video games this is like
a gigantic ranch eyes that needs that is
never has related to exist imagine
getting to go to like the gift shop and
buy a little foam master sword and a
link hat and run around and now you know
there's take our money it sticker money
it's unbelievable and you know you can
maybe they have a new game that comes
out you can play it first there well and
of course of course there's gonna be
three DS streetpass spots they're gonna
do I mean they're really gonna
capitalize I would imagine on things
like that so I think I love the idea of
being able to go to universal studios
and play a game that hasn't been
released yet you know or you can only
play it here why I will say that what I
was confused at first that it was
universal studios and then you said that
there's a reason why so this is pretty
interesting um right now in universal
studios orlando and i don't know how it
is it here in Hollywood because they
don't have as much space but in Orlando
they actually have Marvel characters
walking around the park and they also
have attractions Marvel attractions they
have they have restaurants that are
Marvel think they kind of have a land
that's marble theme yeah it's a
superhero land yeah it's a superhero
line but they
have actual ex-fighter man and j jonah
Jameson like they've got characters from
the Marvel Universe in that area of
universal studios but now that Disney
owns marvel Disney obviously does not
want those characters in another theme
park they want them in Disney World they
want them in Disneyland they don't want
them in universal studios if you don't
know in florida disney world is right
here and then Universal Studios right
here yeah and then when people travel
they like oh I'm gonna go see the Marvel
character universal studio and there's
been rumors going around that Disney has
wanted to open a Marvel theme park like
its own theme park sort of like they
have you know the they've like blizzard
beach and then they have you know all
the different animal kingdom and like
all the stuff they there's been rumors
they want to do a superhero-themed kind
of theme park in Florida not here but
but yeah I mean this is a great way for
Disney to kind of n mart and universal
to kind of both get out of that
agreement while still looking good so
Disney can't really force universal out
of out of their contracts they held
previously I believe in you universal
studios I think you'll do a great job
your Islands of Adventure theme park is
my favorite theme park your harry potter
land is unbelievable so I'm very excited
about this but I think what we want to
know from you guys is our hashtag of the
day yes it is TD Nintendo it's not TD
Nintendo it's not it is ok I thought
we'd do it ok so with all the potential
and all the excitement that we get out
of this we want to know what sort of
attractions do you expect or would like
to see we wanted to get out of the way
some of the obvious ones a Mario don't
you're not wise it's exciting you're not
allowed to use Mario Kart don't guys
don't let's not going leave me
negativity it's too easy so Mario Kart
that would be fun that would be I mean
the best ever uh producer Logan what was
one of yours green ooze lions yeah he
wants the green tube and a slide so so i
would say that like maybe a Hyrule
roller coaster like alleged Zelda roller
coaster okay Mike get get get real Korea
dig deep into the Nintendo catalog
purchase your CD okay I I want these
great ideas to come like it because
there are obvious there are the obvious
choices the Mart
mario karts the you know the roller
coasters have we're not like a metroid
one where you go into a like a ball roll
around and stuff like that that would be
awesome that very pretty cool there's
tons I would love to see I'd love to see
you super smash brothers one where you'd
like it's like a simulation type thing
where you dress up as the character and
it's like a VR cimmyt hours you know
we're gonna go by the time the fix this
things made what like five years from
now I don't be longer than that maybe it
might even be longer it depends on what
they're building it could be if it's a
whole new land if it's a whole new area
it could be five to ten years but so
there's your question a lot sooner TD
Nintendo but going off of what i just
said where you know you simulate that
your simulations yeah you simulate where
your super smash brothers it actually
leads into our next story where this is
actually happening I'm so excited all
right you ready for this I am so stoked
so whatever virtual reality headset you
have right now it's garbage throw it out
it's kept it compared to this new thing
coming out called void now this is an
experience imagine like you'd go to a
laser tag arena but this is like 4d you
put on a VR headset and they put you in
this room it's just a plant it's like
playing walls but you basically are
walking around inside the world yeah you
don't know because you have a VR headset
on so void stands for vision of infinite
dimension it is a plan to open a virtual
virtual entertainment centers around the
globe that uses VR to immerse people in
a fully-realized location based game yep
so I men they've already projected so
many different types of worlds haunted
castles dinosaur safaris futuristic
battlefields I think they have like a
lord of the rings tyldus type type thing
yeah um what's really crazy first of all
they're using their own headset it's
called rapture it's got quantum dot
curbed 00 LED display custom up optics
THX headphones so it's surrounds town
and movie review microphone for Team
chat and sensors for spatial and head
tracking so you actually know where you
are yeah and then the game knows where
you are which is awesome yeah so it's
it's it's basically a completely fully
immerse simulation vr lasers right there
uh they're simulating rain by actually
like dripping water
oh so it's like a full experience either
there's people looking look you look
goofy but you think you look like a
robot person um so this is something
yeah look there there's all that crazy
sim like flight sim things yeah the void
so they're hoping to bring it all over
the world like open up these little
places all over the world like these
little arenas and you go in and I love
this little light on you playing yeah a
little plane landed i got a horror game
um what I am super jazzed about this
sounds like the next level of an
attraction and I could see this being
used in like theme parks is simple it's
like VR LARPing yeah look at this so you
can go with your friends and kill some
dragon cuz right now there's a big thing
um there's a big thing in Los Angeles
and kind of all over the world called
escape rooms and go to a room and you
guys have to it's like the steam room
and you have to try and get out but this
is like putting it in a VR world this is
actually doing what we wanted with VR
yeah this is like the peppery thing
we've imagined with VR and you go and
you just play and then you go home my
only concern is it all sounds too good
to be true and I'm just scared that like
is it not never gonna live up to my
level of heightened my not time that
this stuff kind no it's absolutely time
I mean they had like VRC like actually
frozen toys dragon on ya know it's great
and I love that they can sort of create
a space in which like in this room they
can basically recycle corridors over and
over again and make you look like you're
in a completely different spot they
changed it out a month by month or
whatever yeah it just means you I mean
you could do licensing stuff I mean it
would be unreal to be able to do
something yeah I think it's I think it's
pretty it's pretty easy I mean as long
as they're making their money back money
that's the big daddy that's the big
thing how much do you think it was weird
that they're not like collaborating with
like oculus to like step that up instead
they're using a router on proprietary
yeah bright airy heads over curved OLED
isn't cheap I know I'm doc curved OLED
zar not cheap this is not it this is not
a cheap thing yeah so how much would you
pay to go on this experience I'm just
curious uh let's say it's an hour long
experience or make let's see even
actually no because they've got to put
bodies through the door they got to get
teams through the door so let's say it's
20 min
how much did you pay it wouldn't be 20
minutes half hour let's say an hour okay
listen I think that's because if you're
only putting in like three or four
people in the room at a time because you
won't be by yourself uh why assume maybe
they'd have like two or three males so
okay and I think they'd have to do so
let's say an hour hundred dollars you
pay a hundred bucks for an hour maybe
maybe a little bit more I'm depending on
what the experience was just say it's
like the escape rooms it depends on the
quality of the escape room like some of
them are kind of not as good and so you
pay like 50 bucks for it but then I
think for a really high quality
experience the most i'd pay is like one
fifth actually I do every single
experience if they had it and it was
like well you'd have two hundred two
hundred dollars like I would do every
single experience give me a groupon
especially especially if they give you a
video afterwards of like you like you're
going around reactive like that this is
0 this is the next level entertainment
that I think a lot of us have wanted and
also has been in books like ready player
one stuff like that so see very cool
sorry to talk so much about that but I
am sooo it's it's amusement park day I
know it is amusement park day well I now
we are going to leave the amusement
parks get on a bus and go go on a field
trip we're gonna go on a field trip are
you ready to go on a field trip it's
time for your this is going to start the
week off in it you're gonna feel really
good but aside from the other three
stories which are awesome but this is
gonna make you feel good about people um
so this is not necessarily new
technology but I just love this right up
front this is an ad there's an ad
campaign from Huggies but it helped
somebody and it's pretty touching and
adorable um so there's this woman and
she is blind and she's been blind I
think since she was 17 she's pregnant
with her son and she's about 20 weeks
pregnant and she is on this video from
huggies Brazil talking about what she
imagines what he would look like and and
so they took the ultrasound and they
sent it over to a 3d printing company
and they made at called three I think 3d
are actually knows on 3d babies that's a
different company but they sent it over
to a company they 3d printed the the 3d
scan of her son's face and so here's
yeah there's like straight up printing
it out this is like crazy science
fiction stuff which i really i really
love but there they
helped her in this way so they sent her
they gave her this actual 3d print out
and it says on the bottom in Braille
like I'm your son and so she was able to
sort of see him oh yeah like it's like a
variety of daredevil or so you know like
touch somebody's face you can see what
they look like yeah so um so she got to
kind of meet him which is just adorable
and delightful and and like I said the
tech is not brand new there there are
actual like straight-up companies
regardless of you know what what oh they
steal is they totally surprised her they
gave her this beautiful little image of
his son like look at how great that is
and she was just so thrilled to get this
and and like I said I mean it's again
it's an ad campaign but i still love
that they did something really nice for
this lady because you know why she see
him like it's it's delightful so she had
to see him before he was even born which
is fantastic and hopefully though maybe
they'll do another one after he's born
so should be able to search my pictures
of him don't even like babies it's so
adorable it's like 3d printing is giving
people a way to sort of see pictures
like she could fist bump him he's got a
little fist up it but she like what's
cool about this is you know people who
are vision impaired or you know you
can't really like pictures don't work
you know you can't look at a picture but
now with 3d printing you can have
pictures she can document her kid's life
in 3d printing and see what he looks
like like every year of his life even
she could do it you know like it's
awesome like i love i love that that
exists and i love that they did this for
this lady and i hope they do it for lots
more people huggies get on it do it for
everyone so really it's delightful
anyway I hope that made me feel really
good about humanity cuz it did for me
you're gonna do you need a tissue do you
want you to take a break no I already
gave all my emotions I got nothing left
oh no I doubt that I think kels gonna
have a cry uh we're gonna take a quick
break when come back where we come back
with back your hackett we're gonna
really get weird good cool nothing's
gonna be couch 'let honestly yeah that's
probably true um but we're gonna come
back but until then don't click away cuz
it's tomorrow daily
welcome back to the show we've returned
nah cool you're just not you don't wanna
be back you could continue indefinite
break back to the weekends do it uh well
it's a Monday which means they like take
a look at a crowdfunding effort that may
or may not come to life and we do that
through back at her hackett pakka dragon
alright so today you know I hate it when
I see light bulbs and they're screwed
into a socket like it really mad do is
the most it's terrible like it's very
upsetting but flight is looking to
change that by making levitating
induction base bulbs so this guy has
been making his name's Simon Morris even
making levitating stuff for different
companies and all sorts of things for
all in line and now he's decided to
combine this sort of magnetic levitation
effect with induction and so he has
created flight which is a floating
rotating light bulb that's amazing it's
so cool looking like I mean what that
that's so awesome you guys that is so
cool I'm it's explain this explain okay
so uh he like I said he's using do you
remember Aurra the light up christmas
lights that kind of when they went over
the ring the power ring it was is it
uses induction sort of give it power or
qi charging like these are things that
you know you basically get close to it
and then it will give it power so he's
decided to use you know magnets and
there's this base you saying you could
also be used for things like charging
your phone um so uh you have to plug in
the base still so that's like you're
still going to plug that in it's not
just you carry around a little light
bulb with you lights up everywhere you
go you're not Uncle Fester ok but this
bulb has you it just sits there and you
Center it right onto the magnet so you
set it down and then it lights up pretty
great pretty simple but also pretty
great though science there I'm not a
scientist fair enough and and honestly I
don't want to know I just want to think
it's magic okay so how much then well
how much is he so keep in mind that this
is a shatterproof bulb these are not
like like regular bulbs that you'd find
in a store their shatterproof to to an
extent i'm sure i can't run them over
with a truck or something the shadow
proof bulbs and the other thing is is
there led so they're made to look like
edison lights like incandescent bulbs
but they're actually led so they're good
they're great yet which is more energy
efficient obviously the last longer
which is fantastic because you're gonna
be paying a couple dollars for this
you're paying a lot of money the retail
price they're planning on is four
hundred dollars 399 but I'm Kickstarter
it's to 49 per flight 249 um they have a
little under two weeks ago they've
raised almost half a million dollars
they asked for 80,000 G so a lot of
people really like this a lot of people
want to love is hitting lipo lobsters I
say so hipsters necessary I want this
but I'm oh good coma do you know where I
see this lesson homes and more in like
coffee shops and buying like a pack of
like five of them and putting them
across like a bar or something like
that's where I see thee like a hotel
yeah yeah like a standard or something a
fancy hotel I sort of see it being used
like that but I would because the only
one it does seem very hipster it does
yeah but to have like five or six of
them along like a like a bar or table or
something that you could go sit out like
that would be cool but it definitely is
um well again the great thing we can the
great thing is we can say whatever we
want about this cuz these sort it mate
yeah this is happening uh I don't have
to back it it's already mad well but I
mean what would you know no that's way
too much money much yeah I could buy an
oculus rift headset yes you know that
you know the price if it's over three
hundred dollars people are gonna buy
that I might be though maybe it's 349
maybe it's about the same price maybe
actually we don't know enough about it
we don't know almost and we don't know a
lot about the desert the dead build was
like 200 300 I think it's like I think
it's 349 there's 350 so that's the devil
you could go to a magic you can go to
any magical world instead of having a
little light bulb on your if money were
no object if money were no I've been
absol
we buy a bunch of yeah i buy everything
in this room but for that price I think
no I would not buy one at that price for
four hundred dollars here so Logan what
is the acceptable price i'd say maybe
150 me no no because it's levitating BS
is levitating and it's and it's
interesting i would say well i would say
the moat 152 199 i feel like is that 169
seems like an appropriate price but i'm
getting totally cut whoever this is can
totally cut the cost down once they
start making them i'm not sure like what
out of the gates expense that maybe it's
sort of the price of it kind of comes
down over time but we'll see anyway
flight not like he has to worry about it
he's got $500,000 yeah fl y te flight um
and so that's it for our backcolor
hackett now because we got so much user
feedback on oculus rift we're gonna do
another round of TD rift and user
feedback don't get don't get me wrong I
want the light bulb I want it I think
it's super cool i like strange oddities
that like actually have a function in my
house but I just I get paper i can put a
500 oddities of that well it's like i
could buy two packs of hue light bulbs
yeah and I can control it's like a it's
for me it's like a sort of cost-benefit
comparison I wonder things that are cool
yeah somebody watching right now cuz
they're all super smart he'll DIY would
be able to DIY it's like yo your shoes
like an apple and a thumbtack okay
somebody'll MacGyver that together okay
so we asked you guys last week to tell
us if you were in or out on the oculus
rift and now that you know you kind of
have to wait through a few more headsets
it's kind of a landslide kind of a
landslide a lot of people said no I'm
just out i'm done i'm not feeling it
what did you see on did you see anything
on youtube yeah oh I don't think
everyone was like I'm going 5-5 yeah
that's what everybody said everything
seemed like everyone's like there was
there was either just I'm out or that's
too late or I love valve I'm going valve
but we again we don't know anything yet
for about either the headsets so Abdul
erman said after trying DK 2 and
feelings
I think I want to try normal gaming but
I want to try valve er hope it's better
than rift so he's also vivre by fig
though he's been calling it beep vibe
those questions betray me Valve's got a
lot of people's fandom already so they
do and so Kylie said none oculus is the
best but it's owned by Facebook so no go
I've never I haven't heard anybody bring
that up yet I've seen out like a like a
small handful of people say I was into
oculus until facebook bought it now I
don't want it I because I don't want to
give Facebook my money like I don't want
to support that company weird that it's
like the enemy yet everybody uses it I
know uh Euclid wrote in and said I'm a
kill on this on the vibe i think i want
survive a day they already have taken
one step further no i know it's gonna be
oh man we had again we don't know maybe
the the new oculus headset does
something blow up said I know who knows
who knows um dan sent us an email and
said hey TD yes there's a big oculus
ecosystem already from all the dev kits
but that big name IP like kill says is
vital to bringing mainstream success for
VR as well as the obvious IP they
already have valve valve zone Unreal
Engine and that's now free kinda you pay
percentage on profit so free to play is
free to you is making it a direct
competitor to unity which the vibe also
supports as owners of both hardware and
platform not to mention the baked in
marketplace they have the power to make
it super easy for developers to build
and distribute compatible games and I
can imagine the VR market will tend to
spend more than your average mobile
gamer such a good point so the incentive
will work to the incentive to work on a
made-to-measure platform could win over
a lot of the developers and become
genuinely competitive very quickly he
said also it's election day here in the
UK which is lassie he got a this this
was from last week it's election day
here in the UK and occurs to me that
inspired by tomorrow daily we should
have the big Inhumans party its name is
also its manifesto may the force be with
you Dan Wow Dan I like that yeah dance
dance good uh it's such a good point
that that they have the built-in they
have the built-in ecosystem right there
with steam I mean could you imagine you
put on your vibe in there's the steam
store with all of the VR titles right
there waiting for you to buy you just
reach out and touch it yeah it's you
know valve has the you know steam and
you have like let's imagine to pipe
it's like here's the entry point for the
vibe and then here's the game the entry
point for the game all they're missing
is just be like oh we just got to
connect those two yeah that's something
oculus doesn't really have yet there's
no platform site yeah they don't really
have that many relationships but again
if they ever has a relationship with
like somebody we don't think comic book
has the has a Microsoft advantage with
remember when Microsoft had the xbox
when the Xbox first came out was kind of
a flop and what they did was probably
the exact same thing Facebook is going
to do which is they threw money at
developers over and over and over again
until the Xbox became successful and
what did they do they threw money at
halo they threw money at bungee they
they had and it was a console exclusive
is a is a device exclusive game and
people went crazy for it and if Facebook
can give the right amount of money to
the right development team and make an
exclusive game for oculus that is a
platform seller they might be able to
win as I've said that time and time
again I think they think what's gonna
happen is oculus is going to focus on
experience whether it be some sort of
for app or something and then five is
gonna focus on gaming I mean that's
completely obvious that they're gonna
focus on gaming so probably right so
there's gonna be a breakdown and I think
honestly think gamers are more likely to
buy a VR headset then maybe that but but
and I keep feeling like I'm defending
oculus even though I'm totally on vibes
side yeah even though I've spent more
time on ocular now we it's the only
reason I'm trying to make it because I
want to make sure that the playing field
is all well thought about you know you
can't just be like well oculus too late
sorry suckers and also here's here's the
most important thing is that competition
in any way shape or form and especially
good competition it only we all win we
all win in competition world like all of
these headsets one-upping each other
trying to be better better better only
means that we're gonna get the best
possible stuff when it finally gets to
us so I think we also want vibe to come
out and be a success it's yeah i did a
dark story i want them all because Excel
hasn't really like successfully launched
any like like hardware yeah and
and then also you know it's it's going
up against facebook and ocular hitters
so move it's gonna be interesting well
no by III maybe a little bit by the end
of the summer yeah and we'll be able to
make our decisions then but all the
great points yeah really good salient
point silly an excellent um okay I
really briefly I just we have an email
from James but I'm gonna I'm just gonna
go over it really quickly just mentioned
that his Ansel for oculus rift is no
because one so expensive to limited
content as of the moment and three
waiting for 2nd gen rift so he was
saying he's waiting for 2nd gen which I
think maybe we might see a lot of people
do just like the Apple watch people are
like well I think I'll just wait til the
2nd gen oh no I'm not ready to jump up
your way for 2nd gen rift you're gonna
be waiting for a second gen vibe I've
yeah exactly and that and also i think
this technically counts as 3rd gen for
the rift and we don't know and and the
other thing is is that we don't really
know um we don't really know how long
the lives of those devices are going to
be so is it gonna be like a console
where it's like five to ten years or are
we gonna be waiting a year is it will be
they just updated every year hardware's
updated just like the iphone or buy a
new headset every year yeah exactly see
eye but you know who knows i don't know
i don't know how that'll work um so that
was a user feedback which means now that
we're done with that we got to get into
our very last piece user feedback which
is always our phone talker for the day
I'm growing an hour for tomorrow daily I
feel like feels like it's only our one I
was like just our one okay I are all
