a stylish Jamie come on watch put it
down seriously yeah put it down we got
my show what we gotta shoot a plane you
know i wanna i want to listen to music
what's happening Brian song here on the
Apple by with everything good and bad
inside the world of Apple plus it's kind
of a special week for me and we have a
giveaway for you now lots of iphone news
this week with some actual real
information so let's get to it in a
branch at darien fireballs john gruber
claims that iOS 7 is running behind
schedule and engineers have been pulled
from OS 10 10.9 to work on it now this
happened before in 2007 when Apple
delayed the release of OS 10 leopard to
concentrate work on the iphone so I'll
be patiently waiting for can now Gruber
also adds that it's a significant
system-wide UI overhaul and engineers
who are allowed to carry around devices
with ios7 running has special privacy
filters like screen films that reduce
viewing angles now I Moors Rene Ritchie
also adds that Jony Ive's work is making
many people happy but will make rich
texture loving designers sad so goodbye
poker felt it was real in other tidbits
from the chat included rumblings that
biometrics will be used on the new
iphone 4 payments and identification
richie also said he's heard an event is
or was planned for the new 9.7 inch ipad
if it's ready in April and if we don't
see it it means it isn't ready and those
were his words exactly now the Wall
Street Journal jumps on board with a lot
of what we've already heard saying Apple
will begin production of the next iPhone
in the second quarter of this year with
a possible summer lunch they also report
Apple is working with other partners to
produce
less expensive iPhone to be released in
the second half of this year with a
different casing with different color
shells but their plan remains unclear
also if you're worried about what the
next iPhone will look like with steve
jobs gone the next two phones may have
been designed under his supervision it
was revealed to San Francisco's district
attorney during discussions with Apple
about the growing problem of mobile
phone theft in metropolitan cities he
was told the next to iPhone designs had
already been developed and they
proceeded Tim Cook now I was also able
to confirm the information with SJ
himself but he still won't tell me what
the next new iphone looks like and leave
it to Japanese site mac fan that claims
Apple unveiled the next iPhone on
Thursday June the 20th and will kick off
sales a few weeks later in early July
with a low cost iPhone aimed at a larger
prepaid market to debut in August well
the worldwide developers conference is
where iOS 5 and 6 have been announced to
developers in the past and website gotta
be mobile believes June tenth through
the 14th could be the week for WWDC 2013
and the first look at Iowa seven based
on openings on the Moscone Center
calendar now iOS 5 was in beta for 120
days iOS 6 was 90 days so using those
rough time tables it could push out iOS
7's release date to mid-august
coincidentally around the time we're
expecting the next iPhone see that's how
it all works out now Apple hasn't
officially announced any WWDC dates yet
so everything I just said could be
thrown out the window or right on target
now look out Pandora and Spotify the
verge reports that significant progress
has been made and talks with two of the
top labels Universal and Warner for
apple's upcoming streaming radio project
one source says I radio is coming
there's no doubt about it anymore an
apple is pushing hard for a summertime
lunch do you guys also no watermelon is
summers most popular vegetable and it's
part of the cucumber pumpkin and squash
family it's actually considered both a
fruit and vegetable and I love
watermelon
all right back to the stories and a
whole bunch of rumors the games
developer conference just wrapped up in
San Francisco and Pocket Gamer reported
that Apple was floating the idea of a
physical game controller to developers
with a space reserved and a false name
to fly under the radar now I like the
idea and it's good for developers but it
was shot down just as fast as it started
with a nope from the loops reliable Jim
durable and this has got to be my
favorite rumor of the week a Topeka
Capital Markets analyst claims the ITV
project will launch this year in a 60
inch screen size but could also include
50 and 55 inches and will come with a
ring-shaped motion controller called the
eye ring they add it can be placed on
the user's finger and act as a
navigation pointer for the ITV enhancing
the motion detecting experience so there
you go one ring to rule them all that's
right someone actually gets paid to make
that up all right guys we told you it's
