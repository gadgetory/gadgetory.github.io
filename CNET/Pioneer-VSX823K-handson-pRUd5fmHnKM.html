and we're going to take a look at the
Pioneer vs x8 - 3 - K this is a
mid-range 5.1 AV receiver with built-in
airplay and is currently selling for
around $400
like most AV receivers the Pioneer is
big and boxy so you're going to need
plenty of space in your TV cabinet to
hold it there are two large knobs one
for volume and one for input selection
and that gives it a symmetrical feel
altogether though the looks are just
middling so if you're looking for
something better looking I check out my
rancis slimline AV receivers the
included remote is about as confusing as
most AV receiver remotes are there are
just a ton of tiny buttons most of which
you'll never use plus there were all
these confusing secondary labels that
require you to hold down the shift key
it'll be fine for home theater
enthusiast but it's a pain for anyone
else to use the Pioneer offers six total
HDMI inputs including one front panel
HDMI input and that's the most you're
gonna find at the $400 price level this
year it also has built-in networking
functionality which includes smart phone
control DLNA compatibility Pandora and
internet radio to use the networking
features you do need a wired Ethernet
connection as the Pioneer doesn't have
Wi-Fi now pioneer does sell accessories
to add Wi-Fi or Bluetooth but both of
those accessories are unreasonably
priced at over $100 that's especially
pricey when Sony's competing strd and
840 offers built-in Wi-Fi Bluetooth and
airplay for four hundred and fifty
dollars and that ends up looking like a
much better deal if you want that
wireless functionality sound quality on
the Pioneer was above average
we had resident audiophile Steve
Guttenberg give the system a listen and
he was impressed with its well balanced
sound and then it really held together
well when we crank the volume
he even preferred it to the more
expensive Denon AVR II 400 when we had
head-to-head comparisons he found it
offered a clearer more detailed sound
now differences between AV receivers are
but the pioneers sound did stand out so
overall it really comes down to what
features you need the Pioneer vsx 823 -
K does offer a lot of HDMI connectivity
and built-in airplay for its price but I
think most buyers will be better off
spending a little more for the wireless
features on Sony's competing strd and
840 I'm Matthew Muscovy ak and this is
the pioneer vsx 823 - K</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
