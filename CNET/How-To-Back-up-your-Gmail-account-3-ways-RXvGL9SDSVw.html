corporate screw-up Oh like Google
accidentally deleting the email of
thousands of its users forever then you
may just want to back up that gmail
account but uh how do you back up a
website it turns out there's more than
one approach I'm Jessica's all-court
from CNN and I'll show you how one of
the easiest ways to backup webmail is
through a web-based backup tool they're
a bunch of these out there including
backup a file which you can also use to
archive Facebook Twitter and Picasa Web
Albums setup is extremely simple after
registering for an account you select
the services you'd like to see backed up
just authorize your permission then wait
2 to 3 days for your archive to appear
the free account gets you two gigabytes
of storage and weekly backups for up to
five services but prolific emailers may
want to upgrade to one of the
subscription plans another option is to
save all that email data on your
computer's hard drive in Gmail settings
find the forwarding tab and click the
first option to enable pop for all mail
even if it's already been downloaded
make sure that first option in the
drop-down box is selected to keep your
Gmail messages visible and active in
your online inbox don't forget to save
changes but that's just the beginning
pop setup is the first step you also
have to have a desktop client like
Outlook Thunderbird or Apple Mail to
receive your Gmail messages luckily
Google lists step-by-step instructions
for configuring mail in these supported
desktop apps so you won't be left in the
dark
this downloading technique can be free
if you use a free client like Mozilla
Thunderbird but the problem is that
clients can tend to be slow to load and
if you don't use them daily to read your
mail you'll have to remember to
periodically open them so your most
recent message is load if you don't want
to use a desktop inbox there is a third
method it's a bit of a hack because it
uses a separate email service - that's
right back up your Gmail account
unfortunately you can't use Gmail to
back up another gmail account so you'll
need a new or existing account somewhere
else after configuring Gmail's pop
settings open the settings menu on that
second account there should be an option
to send and receive mail from another
servus just enter your Gmail credentials
there and you should be on your way to
automatically receiving all those daily
deals and love letters that's it for
this tip but keep checking back on CNN
TV for even more great how-to videos I'm
Jessica Dahl chord and that's how you
backup your Gmail account</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
