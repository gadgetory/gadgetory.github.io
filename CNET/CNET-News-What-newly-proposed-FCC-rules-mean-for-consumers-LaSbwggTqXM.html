affect every aspect of how use the
internet from watching movies to
streaming music on your phone in an
op-ed published online by wired FCC
Chairman Tom wheeler declared that the
internet must be fast fair and open the
FCC is calling for greater authority
over Internet service providers such as
Verizon and Comcast asserting that an
open Internet quote fosters innovation
and competition by ensuring that new
products and services developed by
entrepreneurs aren't blocked or
throttled by Internet service providers
putting their own profits above the
public interest chairman wheeler is
proposing standards that support
President Obama's call for a free and
open Internet just to ensure that a
broadband provider cannot block your
access to any particular content if
you're watching Netflix they can't go in
and and monkey with the Netflix traffic
the rules would also ban so-called fast
lanes that allow companies to pay
broadband providers to push through
their content or service faster than
others the real fear with the fast lanes
is that if you have some companies who
are able to pay for priority access then
what happens to a company that is just
starting out the internet association
which represents major tech companies
like Google Amazon and Facebook
applauded the rules which will likely
pass in an upcoming FCC vote however
lawsuits from broadband providers and
other opponents are expected in San
