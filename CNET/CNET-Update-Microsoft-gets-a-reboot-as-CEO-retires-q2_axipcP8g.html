Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update the hunt for a new head of
Microsoft has begun Steve Ballmer
announced he will retire as Microsoft
CEO as soon as the board of directors
finds a replacement for him within the
next 12 months Bill Gates is not coming
back but as chairman of the board of
Microsoft he will certainly have a hand
in picking a replacement bomber has led
Microsoft for the past 13 years there
have been many hit products like Windows
XP xbox 360 the Kinect and Windows 7 he
also ushered in the era of the microsoft
retail store but Microsoft has had its
problems windows was late to the game in
the smartphone race and there have been
mixed reactions to windows 8 and it's
dramatically different interface the
surface tablet has seen poor sales and
oh yeah there's this guy poor little
zune but it's worth noting that Ballmer
isn't the only executive to leave
recently the head of Xbox don mattrick
he jumped to Zynga after the xbox one
was announced and the former head of
Windows Steven Sinofsky he left right
after windows 8 was launched Ballmer
wrote in a memo that now is the right
time for a transition but he was working
on reshaping the company to put more of
a focus on hardware as well as software
it'll be interesting to see if his
replacement continues that mission but
no matter who gets the gig I don't think
we'll have another CEO who will be as
eccentric as bomber you may recall
moments like this ah Elmo PC and I love
this company Bella purrs developers
developers developers developers
also getting buzz is Pandora the music
streaming app is lifting its 40 our
monthly listening limit for mobile users
and for those of you that like to listen
to music when you go to sleep the apps
have a new sleep timer feature so it
turns off after a set time Google wants
to be your dictionary if you're looking
for the meaning of a word first type in
the word define then the word you're
looking for and Google replies with the
meaning origin and translations and
there's a new app worth checking out
it's called front back as in take a
photo with the front camera and then the
back camera that's it yeah it's simple
it's silly but like vine it's inspiring
people to think differently when telling
a story this time with two pictures
instead of one that's your tech news
