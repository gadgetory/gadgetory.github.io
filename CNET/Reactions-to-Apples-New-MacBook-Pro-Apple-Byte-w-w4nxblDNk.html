the Apple buy for everything good and
bad inside the world of Apple this week
it's all my reactions to Apple's new
MacBook Pro keynote but like we normally
do let's start off with these smaller
announcements and build our way up to
the big stuff because I promise I'll be
gentle now Apple TV finally got some
love in the form of a new app called TV
because that won't be confusing at all
the app is going to be useful to find
shows you want and be able to pick up
where you left off easily if you're on
an Apple TV or an iOS device now not
every service or channel with an app is
going to be a part of it like Netflix or
Amazon which is a big deal but look
deeper this app's discovery is nice but
it's also the result of apple's failed
attempt to get their own TV streaming
service you still need to pay for your
own cable or pay for HBO now and hulu
separately to take advantage of this now
the TV app could have been a new revenue
stream a new business but they couldn't
do it over the course of years because
they wanted too much from the studios
and networks and now Apple doesn't have
a streaming TV service well other rivals
do and they're actually good so you know
what that's a bad apple all right on to
what we were all waiting for the new
MacBook Pros these guys are powerhouses
and if you're in the market to upgrade
you should be more than happy with the
performance big gains about 50% in
processor performance roughly twice as
fast graphics and 100% increase in flash
performance a better performing screen
at the same retina resolution but Apple
made a point not to mention the
resolution at all and let's not forget
that design if anything is going to
stand out it's how sleek this is
compared to any previous MacBook Pros
and yes there are plenty of other
sleeker non Apple laptops out there now
it's going to be a great laptop but the
flagship feature the touch bar this
isn't the first changing bar we've seen
the lenovo x1 carbon had it two years
ago but Apple just decided to go all-out
with that idea now I'm going to hold my
judgment until I actually use it for an
extended period of time but how much are
you actually going to use it like I
don't think anyone knows right now sure
it's some really nice eye candy and it's
super responsive I could see myself
using it for some of them
basic apps but how much easier will it
actually make doing things now when they
demoed Final Cut Pro to use a single
finger to scroll through the project
while starting directly at the touch bar
no like no one edits video like that and
they won't and you know what
that was a bad apple too and let's just
stack up what makes more sense from a
creative standpoint right now apples
touch bar or that insane surface dial
that works on that insane surface studio
for Microsoft that blew away anything
Apple announced that's just real talk
now only time will tell if the touch bar
ends up being good great or just matte
and what about that price point MacBook
Pros basically went up $200 at every
price point from the previous generation
let's see how the audience feels about
that one
yeah that's a sad Apple and lastly
remember this is loaded with four USB C
thunderbolt ports you know what that
means we go in done go we go in dumb go
look if you want back all the ports and
connectivity you lost I did the math for
you a USB adapter cost 19 bucks
a thunderbolt 2 adapter for hard drives
cost 49 bucks USB Sita lightning to
connect your iPhone or iPad costs 25
bucks and a USB C 2 Ethernet adapter
cost 35 bucks and if you want the
MagSafe connector that they took away
from you Griffen technology has that
covered for you with their break safe
for another 40 bucks so let's add on
roughly another 170 dollars worth of
dongles on top of that hold up hold up I
just wanted to check in with our
audience again
yeah Phil you on that so what should
Apple's new campaign for the new MacBook
Pros be how about this
just dongle it or how do you like them
dongles or there's a dongle for that and
the crowd favorite on my Twitter think
dongle all right all jokes aside it's a
nice upgrade it's going to cost you and
I'm not in the market to get a new
laptop right now but there have been
times in the past where Apple really
maybe want to get a MacBook Pro when I
didn't need one but you know what this
wasn't one of those times now there's
also a really expensive 5k display in a
partnership with LG that you can buy if
you have lots of money to and let's not
forget the letdown of no new iMacs no
new Mac Mini updates after two years and
no new Mac Pros remember it was fill
killer who once claimed can't innovate
anymore my ass and that Mac Pro hasn't
seen an update for over three years now
all right that's gonna do it for this
week's show we'd love to hear what you
thought you can email us at the Apple
byte at cnet.com or tweet me at Brian
Tong and will include your thoughts in
next week's show thanks so much for
watching we'll catch y'all next time for
another bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
