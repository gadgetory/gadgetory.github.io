welcome to Google issues for everything
Google you could think of the reviews
for the pixel 2 &amp;amp; 2 XL are here for its
official October 19th release date and
it's getting great reviews overall what
stands out about it well in our own CNET
review by Lin law no surprise its deep
integration with the Google ecosystem
it's superb camera and Google lens which
will continue to only get better now if
you love the Google ecosystem come on
you're going to love this phone and how
good is that camera CNET's Alexi
Sebelius AM Nessa Han Orellana took it
out in the field and those low-light
shots on the pixel 2 are just excellent
the portrait mode is great it's not
always as good as the iPhone 8 pluses
but at other times it's equally as good
it can handle faces and even animal
faces but it doesn't do as well with
objects right now now the fact that it
was just as good in many cases with just
a single lens is really impressive also
its optical image stabilization is great
as well and we'll have full breakdown
sports photo and video performance this
week now the biggest problem with this
phone no headphone jack like it's a
stupid trend that I'm still completely
against personally and telling me to go
buy a wireless headphones as a solution
that's just isn't fair for everyone now
in fact Google themselves realized they
wasn't getting out of hand
after they decided to slash the price of
their own headphone dongle from what was
originally $20 to $9
wow thanks Google but you know what
you're still getting a boo-boo and no
it's not the sexiest phone out on the
market but for some of you that's all
that matters in a phone and not what the
phone can actually do for you alright
early hands-on by darren gloucester has
revealed a hidden notification light on
the pixel 2 XL last year's pixel phones
had an RGB notification light placed on
the right side on the front near the
earpiece and it looks like this year's
pixels will have the same with an option
to toggle it on or off in the
notification settings also the new pixel
2 phones support embedded SIM cards or
sims and project by is one of the first
carriers to support it on Android it
really means you no longer have to have
a physical SIM card in your phone a new
Isom manager app is now on the Play
Store if you want to check that out
there's also a brand new power menu and
a video showing it off shows the menu
now appearing next to the physical power
button instead of the center of the
screen on the pixel - with a power off
and restart as options you know it's
just a small change but just some of the
new tweaks you'll see on the pixel - ok
Google
we know that's a hot word for assistance
on phones and as they expand it to
different devices hey Google became an
option for the Google home and now looks
like they could be bringing the hey
Google hot word to smartphones alongside
ok Google and yes I said that slowly -
deliberately set off your devices now a
breakdown of the google app by
xda-developers reveals that both
commands could be coming in the future
and it makes sense because hey Google is
a lot more natural sounding then ok
Google and that's the part where I
waited for your devices to stop
listening again and this could be
arguably the most important story of the
week for Google nation Google Photos can
now recognize your pets
I repeat Google Photos can now recognize
your pets now face recognition for
friends and family has always been
important but you will now be able to
add naming support for your cats and
dogs
unfortunately pet turtles goldfish pigs
and lemurs appear to have been left out
now Google Photos will now be able to
recognize specific dogs or cats as long
as there's a clear shot of their face
and treat them as people when looking
for their pictures there's also been no
word if it supports the idea that people
do look like their pets like this guy or
this lady and definitely this guy all
right that's gonna do it for this week's
show you can email me at Google issues
at cnet.com or tweet me at Brian Tong
thanks so much for watching and we'll
catch y'all next time for some more of
that Google issue
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
