actor and a movie coming out called
Snowden the government knows that we
have these documents now I run a
production company called hitRECord you
can come work with us it's back in 2005
that first started hit record with my
brother and that is my introduction to
myself I always loved science fiction
whenever they would go out on missions
you know when they would leave the
starship enterprise and walk around on a
planet they be walking around with
little computers they're like reading
things or they have their Maps or their
sensors or stuff on this little machine
and I remember thinking myself back then
like oh man it'd be so cool if I could
walk around with a little device that I
could just hold in my hand and like
learn things from it and lo and behold
this is what happened when Oliver Stone
first called me and he asked me to play
Edward Snowden in his movie first of all
I was just flattered and honored because
I grew up loving Oliver Stone movies but
then I was like oh man you know the
truth is I don't really know that much
about Edward Snowden and so I looked
into it and will tell you two things
that I found really interesting one is
there was this congressional hearing in
2013 and a director of national
intelligence named James clapper
testified before Congress and he swore
to tell the truth does the NSA collect
any type of data at all on millions or
hundreds of millions of Americans
no sir he was lying no one can prove he
was lying because no one had any
evidence that he was lying until later
that year Snowden provided that evidence
one other thing that I learned that that
really surprised me was a government
conducted an investigation and found
that these mass surveillance programs
had not actually helped stop any
terrorism when I went to meet him in
Moscow I found someone who is just
really down to earth really actually
quite warm and very thoughtful and who
really really cared a lot about his
country I was really more approaching as
an actor and and I haven't actually met
him I think I'd be doing a lot more
guessing it record is the name of this
company that i started a number of years
ago now you know like a lot of times on
the internet you'll see people saying
hey look what I made here's here's my
video or here's my photo or here's my
song and on hit record it's less about
here's what I made and more like hey
let's all make things together and we
turn the fruits of our collective labour
into productions and then when those
productions can make money we pay the
contributing artists mr. Snowden
contributed to one of our projects on a
record called are you there democracy
it's me the internet and it's a whole
bunch of videos about people sort of
talking about how technology impacts
democracy he's sort of become a symbol
of how technology is misused and it was
cool to hear him speak more
optimistically and say like but I
actually think that technology could
make the future a better place and
here's watch really proud of the stuff
that we made together it's a lot of fun
for me I I love it
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
