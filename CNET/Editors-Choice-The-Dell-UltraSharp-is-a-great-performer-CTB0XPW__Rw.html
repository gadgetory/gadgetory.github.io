we're taking a look at the dell
ultrasharp u24 12m the dell is a well
performing 24-inch monitor with great
ergonomic support including back tilt
height adjustment pivot and swivel its
OSD is easy to navigate has tons of
customization options including this
cool energy tracker
it also has five USB ports and the best
part is that it's available for only
$350 that's a pretty great value and
consider the features it offers
unfortunately with only DisplayPort DVI
and VGA its connections are lacking
compared to pass ultra sharps now this
will be forgivable if it was only
composite and component ports because
you know who uses those these days but
Dell also got rid of HDMI and that I do
not forgive
also whilst performance is great
compared to TN panels it's not quite
there compared to high-end prograde IPS
panels especially in viewing angles when
it comes to value there are a few
monitors that show up at the U 24 12 M
does has a great list of ergonomic
features tons of customization options
and good performance at a great price
HDMI will be missed and while it won't
match high-end monitors and viewing
angle performance most users won't even
notice for professionals however we'll
want to spend a bit more money to get
something that better aligns to their
needs
once again I'm Eric Franklin and this
has been a look at the dell ultrasharp
