cnet's open tab we're wrapping up the
week with a couple drinks and just going
to bring you in to talk about the big
tech news of the week I'm here with a
dan ackerman fresh from Los Angeles from
e3 and Jones salzman our digital
entertainment reporter and we're just
going to break down it's been a crazy
week we've had a apple's WWDC kicking it
off and the video game electronic every
team XO at the same time begin with
apple what do you guys think Apple tried
to introduce a whole bunch of new things
Mac OS the rebranding Apple music with
possibly a really cool new exactly
formats all very software-based all very
kind of services based it happened of
course the WWDC keynote which is always
the big thing where they come out give
the whole big speech was the same day
and literally the same time as the
Microsoft kind of keynotes press
conference at e3 which is always a big
deal so literally I don't know if they
counter programmed against each other or
what but you could only watch one of
them or a ten to one of them in real
time did you attend the Microsoft of
course I've been doing anything at some
time I just watched no I didn't get a
chance to I have to have we can't jump
on every flower seriously but they're
very different in tone the WWDC keynote
I've been to that before it's fairly
sedate they come out they gave you some
facts and figures they trot people out
one by one to sort of you know walk
through this walk through that whereas
the microsoft thing it's like there's
fans they import their cheering there's
bright lights and pounding music and
down your ringers at e3 what's a cheer
ring and I'll tell you well it sounds
like you said in point import yes the
cheer yes they have ringers in there all
the big press conferences now import
fans they say we're gonna have X number
of seats for fans and you can like apply
do I get a ticket or something and
they're super excited to be there it
kind of takes away from the new Xena
separate if you ask me but it makes it
like an event yeah yeah you hear screams
when you watch the live streams it
exactly there you hear a lot of
screaming that's right they're not all
PR PR
if you were watching both in the same
time feel free to jump in the comments
I'm going to bring you in through my
tablet any time to bring in some user
comments so i was really most taken back
by during wdc about because mentioned
apple music their attempt to rebrand
because i kind of not not really into
their service personally and they really
tried to brought out from her have her
name correctly boat azuma buzz I'm not
gonna try to pronounce Excel mess it up
alright she was a star I mean she was
righteous she had so much attitude and a
good kind of attitude I loved that her
idea of like wanting to use the services
of morning strut into her entire office
because it made me think okay there's a
lifestyle angle for once and I kind of
think there before kind of like this is
your music and where you're gonna get it
and you're gonna use old itunes still to
clunk through it its differentiation
right so how do they differentiate
themselves in the ten other music
services that kind of do the same thing
that's the problem as they all basically
do at core the same thing for the same
price so what's that music do better
that's really good question i mean
people would say beats one that's really
unique thing so beats one is the 24-hour
worldwide live radio service they've
gotten some really stellar djs like Zane
Lowe to sign on he's got sort of the guy
that's spearheading it he's the big star
and when I listen to beats one I usually
enjoy it there's a little element to it
of traditional radio complaint where you
sometimes hear some of the same major
label releases more often than you like
like recently there's a calvin harris
song that's remix with Rihanna that's
guy I've been listening to beats one a
few times in the last few days and it
seems like I've heard that I want you to
tell that one keeps coming out Greg you
know it's radio the good thing about it
is they also pepper in some really cool
tracks that i haven't heard and so
that's a neat discovery element it
becomes a discovery platform and that's
how all these services are trying to
distinguish them now can you still get
that outside of Apple music yeah okay
but in different ways you know like on
Spotify they have discover weekly which
has become a the beach one radio though
what do I think we made music outside
okay you just listening that through
itunes so you don't need to do yeah if
you knew that particular is that what
you're saying like if you knew that
particular song you wanted to you know i
think you can just get the beats one
stream without being asked
that's right yeah you don't have to pay
for that music subscribers I let me do
it without having to pay yeah so we're
talking about Apple music in terms of
the product yeah I really like beats one
or I think it's really interesting in a
good differentiator but it's not part I
think it's free service yes I'm part of
this obscure it's like lunch at the same
time but could we gave up the 24-7 radio
thing I like listening to somehow like
they pulled some shows here and there
with it I'm wondering about its future
but it's sort of a see what you guys
think about them Siri being added to Mac
OS and the integrations and other
services their attempt to go out of that
world yeah I mean that everyone's
working kind of the personal digital
assistant angle and Shiva is one of the
first ones but it's also one of the
first ones we made fun of I remember
what it launched Scott and I did like a
funny video i wish i could find is
probably on youtube somewhere where he's
walking down the street talking into the
phone chery chery call my mother for her
Siri hello you know and it's it's still
it's still sort of the same way today
but now you have Cortana and Alexa
whatever the google one is called and
they're getting yeah they're so
personality free is your name right k
cookie is that like um cliffy mr. that's
right he like they needed out that that
should have been the microsoft version
of Cortana Cortana be one day everyone
will gravitate much more towards Clippy
yeah if you said like a clippie but what
it really does on Mac OS I think based
on what I've seen is it lets you
integrate those results that work at us
for you into regular desktop tasks
whether it's composing an email or
looking something up online or making a
document you can just ask Siri to get
something and then just drag it over
where is on your phone it's a very
transactional sort of thing which way is
the F train you know do you think you
guys had actually talked to your
computer though cuz i took i know i
wouldn't do it in our office or any real
obviously i would be out loud part
that's cover right yeah especially in an
office environment oh yeah when you're
at home I don't know I mean I talked to
alexa i guess here did you stuff all the
time at home I don't know yeah if it
took a step back and was more like that
then maybe that would be a little more
if it's added to my life to talk about
it cuz I the example they gave was like
look for the files that I tagged with
this as saved between 2014 and 2016 I
would never say that see I like that
though
trying to figure out how to search for
that through spotlight if I was looking
for all the files that said you know
that were named after a particular
product or something that I was trying
to find and maybe just ones from the
most recent version so from 2016 rather
than 2015 I could totally see that
working for you and the clinch to that
is the language conversational woman has
to really work like you have to be able
to say to her to her Siri you know I was
working on a project it was three months
ago can you find the documents three
months ago that had something to do with
if you can say it like that and if you
can search it like for keywords or scan
the contracts and stuff I don't know if
we're there yet uh yeah but it's a step
you know we're taking a step towards
that Shelley in our comments says that
she loves all the flying emoticons which
may be referring to facebook but also
there's the messages app and their
redesigned they have those they of the
bubble effects where they set a message
and they blow up or it gets tiny right
the confetti and the invisible ink I'm
personally afraid of invisible ink I
know my guess Carlos why are you afraid
of it because I have friends who already
sent me horrible photos and now they're
gonna be blurred and I have to uncover
them Oh what did those things resonate
with you guys at see it is sort of
borrowing a lot from facebook snapchat
I'm not really too old to understand
emojis besides the winking smile face
that's the only one I get and I'm
literally too old to understand any
others I also don't understand how to
send someone an animated gif somebody
can show me that I would really
appreciate it thank you I've been using
I did install Google's G board onto my
iphone and then it has a gift search
built in and it lets you like tap to
copy and paste the gift that sounds
awful yeah it's better than what it used
to be we go into like your browser thank
you opposite of your something like that
sounds amazing amazing I want that we
also roane asks if serious can be
available for developers I guess the con
I've already is with the developer
preview that came out on Monday yes but
it's like of the whole OS but they are I
think opening up some of the new
features in Mac OS was what weather
changing the way from always tend to two
people to be able to add to their own
apps like you have things like tabs and
stuff or things like Apple pay
not sure about Siri yeah I'm curious
about like they used lift as an example
in the press conference I believe I
really want to see how far it integrates
like I said I subscribe to google play
music because I use YouTube red but I
somehow whatever subscriber I'm one of
the few but i watch youtube on the
subway because I little there's no
signal but um I very much wonder if
they'll work together to let Syria do
that or if Google's gonna be like no we
want you to use the Google right right
ads what happens we be fragments
ourselves into these ever narrower
channels that's one thing that people
like about echo and Alexa is that it's
so it's so open they've embraced all
these other companies and all these
those technologies like Philips hue and
all the other smart home stuff and
Spotify now you know amazon has its own
you know music service as part of them
is on prime but now if you want to use
Spotify with it that's great and I think
that's why that's been such a success
because it's so open mmm apples mo
traditionally has been a partner with
stuff when they're not threatening lift
isn't threatening to Apple at all but
when it comes with like with something
like most about yeah until the Apple
self-driving car flying car Apple flying
car let's start that rumor right now um
but then once a company there's a little
bit of competition you know like with
amazon they compete on devices like
kindle versus I've had they compete on
Apple TV vs. amazon fire TV that's where
Apple starts to shut the gates and so
there that's where Apple i think is more
aggressive in closing people out than
other come but what happens when you try
to watch amazon prime video on your
chromecast you know you have the same
black you get you can't it's not it's
not support it but you can't I knew you
could do through a browser yeah you can
did you do work that out it's annoying
yeah it is annoying I just got there yet
everybody's got their little iron gates
slamming down left or right ya ali is
excited about watch os3 and I'm I don't
know I'm not sold on good free good for
you okay I say is there was there
anything with that part of it that
interested you guys with the games
smartwatch platform I think the fact
that the main things they trotted out if
i remember right the first thing was
like it's faster right that was the main
headline mark he thing they wanted to
tell about watch OS I think that speaks
to the fact that the first version had
some real problems like if your big
improvement that gets a lot of great
reactions like you don't have to wait as
long for it to do what you want I mean
you know it kind of works like a
commercial ya know all the pro of videos
were everything's all zippy and instant
gratification once you finally get it to
that point in real life man you're like
okay now I get it and I think the last
coach will take on the Apple topic is a
one of our thoughts about Apple pay
making its way to the web yeah that's
super interesting what you do is you go
to a website that takes Apple pay and
you press the Apple pay button when
you're checking out and then you just if
your phone is nearby you can you can
send the credentials basically from your
phone to the web you have two thumb in
basically on your on your touch ID but
there you go you can use your store
Tampa Bay credentials and of course
that's not sending the actual credit
card number it's doing the the temporary
number it makes up what do you think
that it well I think that's interesting
about that is that the move into mobile
payment systems came at this time when
people you know it's something where you
have to pay at a brick and mortar
retailer at a time where people are
moving towards paying on their phone
itself so it's interested that's really
interesting that it's kind of converging
right way to bring it in yeah I have to
add like a thumb print sensor to like an
eye neck or something or MacBook yeah
it's been comparable just without the
phone but the phone acts as a secondary
security system because it's the most
encrypted thing you have and it has to
be within you know proximity of your Mac
OS devices yeah I like that there's
always like I'm a big fan of payment
encryption because security is so
important right now with identity theft
but at the same time with that version
you have to let you log in on the Safari
Browser it seems you take your phone and
you thumb print it in a little destroyed
it but it's it's the future of ATMs you
go up to the ATM with your phone and the
bank app and you and you fingerprint
your way in on your encrypted Apple
phone or whatever and that's how you
access your ATM instead of this plastic
card with the mag stripe on the back
that's going to get you know copied when
you have a corrupted ATM with one of
those little readers fake
news on the front yeah skimmers Danite
really i forgot to introduce your bar
that you brought here oh I know what you
guys make it here but I I never show up
anywhere without my own without my own
1950s mad men travel bar so you know I
like to be prepared for any eventuality
and yeah you know I like to be portable
and I like to be hydrated mmm did you
want to pour yourself a glass before we
continue and uh okay cool you're ready
to go I'm drinking beer Dan's drinking
whiskey I'm being fruiting having pine
apple cider because it's delicious um to
each his own so uh Dan you can't just
came back from e3 I did what was that
what's that like Electronic
Entertainment Expo to the big annual
trade show for the video game industry
this was my 16th trip there over the
last 18 years starting in nineteen
ninety nine not to date myself say I
think I'm pretty much done with it at
this point we really anything you're not
gonna go see 3 i'll tell you why because
the event is not really it's not really
a trade event anymore where a lot of
buying and selling and dealing with
retailers happen some of that is there
it's almost not even a media event
anymore because all the press
conferences like we were talking about
are not intended for the press anymore
they are literally direct-to-consumer
showcases and they bring fans in to
attend in person they live stream
everything on the web so you can just
watch it from home if you go to the show
a lot of people wandering around you're
supposed to be connected to the industry
and some way to get in everybody gets
their friends in there's you know 50,000
people wandering around not all of them
have legit jobs in the in the
interactive entertainment or media
industries just take it to the next
level open it up to the public make it a
world's fair of gaming making economy
gaming make it a comic-con or packs or
something like that because all the
companies are now skipping the media
middleman that's us and going straight
to consumers and you know what that's
okay they're more interested in
interacting with what they call
influencers than traditional press
whether it's people who are on YouTube
or just not Instagram or something and
just our are either you know influencers
with a big eye or even with a small I
they just have a small group of friends
and they're connected and they know
what's going on
welcome is probably would rather like
get a million thousand kids tweeting in
Los Angeles if they got them into the
event there then go through with one
tweet for me rigorous unfortunately okay
I I understand it's okay I remember like
used to seeing all the like the pretty
lights in coverage from 2000 oh you even
now there's still a big presence down
there but companies are not being shy at
all EA had an event sold out and they
have their own separate event that was
open to the public Activision the other
big company wasn't he didn't have a show
for presence at all which is a big
jarring change actually if you go to the
show year after year the three beam
microsoft and sony and nintendo was
still there and a few of the other big
guys but to the major publishers who
don't make their own hardware we're not
on the show floor and that's a huge
change that shows you that it's not like
you know about this one monolithic event
anymore just like its CES every year we
go is this really necessary do we need
to be here I'm sure Samsung would rather
have their own you know special Samsung
world you know two or three day
conference and and just invite people to
that in order to manage sort of the
media story better beer and is wondering
what you think of the new xbox the I
guess suppose the xbox one s news and
the scribes I mean that the slim I mean
everyone does that now they do Slim's
you know at some point during the
console life cycle that whole concept of
a life cycle is going away seems
perfectly fine if you don't have an xbox
one already although it's hard to
imagine you're interested in one and you
don't have one yet and then they tease
something else for next year that's
again part of the family but slightly
upgraded for who knows what may be VR
maybe you know 4k gaming is closer just
4k video it's sort of self cannibalizing
at a certain point because they're
saying by the singh of the fall we're
gonna accept really cool next year so
i'm not really sure what the message
there was listen what's your favorite
console Joe I don't have an idol did I
ever baby so I was that's the exchange i
completely understand i spend money when
she when she baby gets a little older do
you want her to play video games or what
are your thoughts that's a terrible idea
how was it Dan has children on earth an
idea so he knows I'll take his advice I
did a lot of M rated gaming with a
little baby dash on my lap
and in a gamepad because you know they
sleep a lot they're not gonna notice I
watched a lot of walking dead while i
was on maternity nursing nursing my
daughter and what i had to get a
bluetooth headphone Chiklis I could put
on Mozart severe Mozart um but I would
hear like bodies I didn't think of that
I was just blasting the call of duty
cially was warning if there's news I'm
place in 4.5 there wasn't enjoy it
wasn't they've confirmed that there is
some upgraded version of working out in
the concept here is these become not
modular but it's not a new generation
everything is cross compatible but maybe
the newer ones support 4k where they
have some other new features like VR
although you're going to get VR on the
PlayStation 4 now with the PlayStation
VR which seems pretty cool and if you're
interested in getting the VR don't want
to spend a million bucks and then I do
what are your things to be our last
comment for the for a chat but what's
their thoughts on the cross-platform
gaming and how this could affect the
consoles I it's an interesting idea and
what I was talking about is being able
to play let's say I'm playing a game on
the xbox and you're playing it on the
PlayStation you're playing on a computer
can't can't we all just get together and
play and really speaking the answer is
no we can't I know and a couple of games
have had that maybe there'll be some
more Microsoft is saying now if you get
one of their new games on the Xbox you
also get the pc version and vice versa
that's kind of a cool idea I I dig that
but you know I think the most of the
things people were interested in at e3
we're sort of very forward-looking
things like virtual reality with the
oculus and the vibe and that's where the
at least noteworthy experiences were I
mean it's funny because they're all
becoming more more judicious computers
now internally you in PlayStation they
always have a setting definitely
beautiful yes without a doubt and that's
why you have the ability to sort of
upgrade them but keep the base
functionality the same they're not
they're not standalone products that
exist on an island then they got a AMD
graphics cards in them yeah so it's
funny that like they always there
imposing the boundaries anyway but like
functionally if you think about it it
all kind of business they
aim but that's why pc gaming so hot
right now because you can buy any
computer can play any game if you think
about a PlayStation 4 and Xbox it's
almost like if you went back in time 15
years and you had a sony DVD player and
that would only play sony movies and you
had to get an RCA DVD player to play
some other guys movies you know that
whole sort of walled garden approach
never made a lot of sense all right
joining dan thank you so much for coming
today where can people find you on
twitter i am at at Joan underscore e hmm
i'm just at Danny Eckerman awesome and
i'm at mike j Sorrentino probably steal
ugh sorry but thank you so much for

conversation going in the comments I'll
be checking them on Facebook and should
have this video up on YouTube and the
site as well thank you everybody for
coming and have a great weekend cheers
