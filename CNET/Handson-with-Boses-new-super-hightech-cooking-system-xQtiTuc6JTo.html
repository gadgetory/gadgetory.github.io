cooking system that overcomes some of
the most fundamental problems in in home
cooking we've never shown this to
anybody I'm going to ask you to do
something that you would never ever do
with a regular pan filled with boiling
water which is I want you to put your
hand underneath this pan and hold it yep
what do you feel nothing put your hand
on the cooktop so it doesn't matter how
long you cook and it will always pass
that test all of the energy is actually
going into where it's needed which is
the surface that cooks food not into
heating up the outside of the pan or
heating up the cooktop this is a pan
that has multiple patents associated
with it if you need you need the pan you
do it's a system there's no way you
could deliver these benefits if you
separated the two things so there's a
really cool no pun intended
insulation technology inside that uses a
couple of different materials but
there's one very special material it's
called aerogel aerogel is the world's
lightest solid and we're using it in a
very special way here to get the
incredible insulation that you've just
experienced so this is using a form of
induction heating so the power amplifier
underneath there produces a powerful
magnetic field which heats up ferrous
metal which is bonded to the inside of
the pan this has wireless communication
between the pan and the cooktop and we
have a thermal sensor that is welded to
the bottom of the pan we can very very
precisely control heat so I just turned
this up to a temperature that's perfect
for making what's considered one of the
most difficult things in cooking which
is a CREP and it took like ten seconds
to get there because it poured it dumped
all of its energy in there and then it
stopped on a dime when it got to the
right temperature
even when I poured the cold batter in
right that would normally dump the
temperature of the pan down below to
what is ideal for a CREP but it sensed
that and you couldn't see it but it it
just put three thousand watts back in to
bring it right back up to the correct
temperature right this consumes less
than half of the energy of the most
efficient systems on the market we're in
the process right now of selecting a
global partner somebody that already
distributes markets and sells cooking
systems the the other way that you could
imagine this going into a kitchen is
built into a wood countertop because it
never gets hot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
