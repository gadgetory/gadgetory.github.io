chicago and the Moto G has been
Motorola's most successful phone it's
unbelievably affordable and it is a
smart phone that off contract doesn't
cost much at all the new Moto G that's
available now is 179 so it's the same
price as before and that's unlocked and
what you're getting is a 5-inch display
that 720p looks bright and crisp 8
megapixel camera that's been upgraded
plus some of the motorola features that
were in the Moto X have come over here
Motorola assist for reduced while
driving for hands-free control is now in
here plus an app to help import contacts
from feature phones in cases your first
time on a smartphone and there's a new
upgraded alert feature in case you're in
trouble the Moto G also has improved
stereo speakers that are front firing
both of them here and it has 15
different colors and back designs and
case covers if you want to customize on
your own no wood no leather on this one
but a really nice finish this actually
feels more like the Moto X than before
because of its size it's a bigger screen
size in last year's Moto X but it feels
comfortable to hold and 179 unlocked
that's great but this doesn't have LTE
this is 4G got to give up something the
Moto G comes in 8 and 16 gigabyte
storage options with the ability to
expand with microsd plus a quad-core
processor inside I'm Scott Stein here
with a quick look at the Moto G
available for 179 unlocked</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
