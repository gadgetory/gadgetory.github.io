look skirt Reever is a man of many
talents he juggles hatchets spins
frisbees with his teeth and is a master
sculptor in an unusual medium toothpicks
and Elmer's glue that this embodies the
maker movement embodies tinkering it is
classic taking a household item and
making something that is kinetic over
the course of three decades using more
than 105,000 toothpicks Weaver created
rolling through the bay a nine foot high
love letter to his hometown of San
Francisco at first glance you might
think the intricate sculpture was
designed using CAD or maybe 3d modeling
software but the tools of Weaver's trade
are actually less sophisticated I use
this old sharp calculator for figuring
out how many things will fit in an area
if I need arches and I have the
circumference of 23 inches how am I
going to fit an inch and a half you know
into that so nail clippers service
toothpick trimmers and everyday objects
become forms and molds what's the most
difficult part about creating a
toothpick sculpture um the glue I'll
used masking tape I use any kind of
thing household items salt pepper
shakers masking tape my phone coffee
cups whatever's handy Weaver's natural
talent has elevated this rather low tech
art form but he credits high tech for
much of his success just snow balled it
got on the internet and it went viral in
the matter of a couple years you go to
search page after search page and I
never would have thought this I mean I
did a radio show in South Africa at
midnight impressive for a hobby that
traces back to a fourth grade assignment
sue Rathbun a elementary school teacher
had us build these little sculptures I
went home I wanted to build a huge one I
started making these long strands of
toothpicks
in 1974 Weaver who has no formal
training created a few San Francisco
landmarks out of toothpicks three things
Lombard Golden Gate cable car those are
my first original things and then I said
wow it would be cool if i made like
another thing of the city here and that
was how rolling through the bay was born
ultimately the sculpture included many
sentimental favorite home right here is
518 twelfth Avenue you can see the
address right five generations of our
family spent the holidays at 518 twelfth
Avenue between ends and Balboa that's my
mom's home it was like the place where
our family whenever we got together
that's where we went this meticulously
detailed San Francisco homage is now on
display at the city's exploratorium
museum right there thank you attracting
sizable crowds especially when they
realize it's not just a sculpture a ping
pong ball roller coaster some people
have said like rolling through the bay
lone galleon a pirate ship demonstrates
his eye for precision with its
retractable cannons and movable
captain's wheel and what's next for
scott weaver it would be a self portrait
of myself doing what I invented maybe
the ping pong ball rolling through
myself would roll through my arm and
then down through my to my foot that
would be cool continuing his tradition
of turning ordinary objects into
something extraordinary in San Francisco
