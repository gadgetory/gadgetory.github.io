we're taking a look at the LUMO lift a
wearable fitness tracker that tracks
your posture most other fitness trackers
on the market only keep tabs on your
movement such as how many steps you take
or how much distance you cover the lift
which cost $99 does that too but its
main purpose is to pay attention to how
you sit and stand the device has a bit
of fashionable Flair with a magnetic
clasp that can be worn on top of your
outfit or hidden away that clasp comes
in silver and black and you can purchase
additional color separately the LUMO
lift works like this you attach the lift
to your clothing right below your
collarbone using the magnetic plate once
it's in place get into your desired
posture then press the lift twice to
calibrate it and it'll vibrate three
times you can now go about your day and
the lift will track your posture and
movement it sends all that info to an
iOS app where you can see your daily
stats including your activity levels and
posture performance lift also has a
coaching mode that will buzz you when
you slip out of your preferred posture

a coaching session and you'll feel
vibration each time you slouch there are
tons of fitness gadgets out there with
the Fitbit jawbone up and basis band

set it apart

device for tracking your daily steps and
body alignment you can check out my full
