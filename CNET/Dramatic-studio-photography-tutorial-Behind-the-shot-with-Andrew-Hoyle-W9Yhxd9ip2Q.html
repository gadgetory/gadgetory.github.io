version of the oneplus 6 it's made by a
company called head d'Oro who have
created this carbon fiber patent II sort
of design on the phone and charging
several thousand pounds for it
it looks amazing so I was really excited
to get it in the studio and see what
sort of shots I can get so this phone is
very dramatic looking it's monochromatic
of course and we've got this really
interesting pattern of the carbon that
the company has managed to get on the
phone so I really wanted to kind of
match that with a very dark dramatic
high contrast look in the studio so what
you can see is I've created a set within
my studio this is really really simple
to do this is just three pieces of black
card one as a base and to have created
this corner wall this is literally just
the two of them propped up together and
held in place on one side by a
microphone and taped together with just
a tiny little bit of masking tape on the
back like this is not an expensive set
service does not take a long time but
the results can be really really cool
so I do want this very dramatic single
light look so I am just using one of my
go ducks 8600 Pro studio strobes I've
got a reflector dish on the front of
this and I put this grid on here which
as you can probably see or maybe not
just restricts the spread of light when
it fires out so it really focuses this
beam of light down on the phone which
creates a really nice shadow on the
phone and stops it spilling all over the
backdrop that I've created so you get
this really nice dramatic look so
thankfully this light has got what's
called a modeling light on it which
means it has a continuous beam coming
out which is nowhere near as powerful as
the actual flash but it does help me
just have a look at where the lights
going to fall so as you can probably see
as I move it around on here you can see
how the shadows change on there on the
phone how the light spill changes on the
background you get a really good idea of
where this light is going to fall just
means that I can set up my shot very
very accurately at this point so when I
take a shot I know that it's going to be
looking exactly as I want it to I
actually quite like the way that the
shadows are coming out there and do you
want some light on this background here
if there's no light on it at all this is
going to just be a complete black
background which isn't gonna look great
so we do want to have some lights
falling on there so maybe about maybe
about there so I'm shooting on my Canon
5d Mark 4 which I've got on my mind
Fratto studio tripod this thing is
really really solid so there's no
movement in the camera when I'm actually
trying to take my shots I shoot in Live
View for this because you can get it
great look of exactly how your shot is
going to come out at shooting like this
you can twist these handles and frame up
the shot exactly as you want also makes
focusing much easier because you can
just zoom straight in on the camera on
the back of the phone and fine-tune the
focus to make sure it's exactly where
you want it I can also see exactly the
composition that I want to go for in
this I want to make sure that the the
corner of this wall is coming down right
in the right thirds of the frame which
is where the phone is and we get this
really nice shadow coming in which is
ending just before the edge of the photo
so I think this is really really nice
shot so we're going to start getting our
settings right and start shooting the
first thing I want to do is turn off my
strobe and just take a shot and great
there's no light in there whatsoever I
want to make sure that my shutter speed
is high enough if there's no ambient
light affecting the shot I want to know
that when I take a photo all over life
it's appearing in this shot is like that
I have put there that I have got
complete control over so if we turn the
light on and we just take a test shot
now we can see that the phone has been
lit and the background is lit and I know
that the only light that's affecting
this shot is coming from the light that
I've put okay so now what I want to get
is a shot of the front of the phone to
actually show that it's a one plus phone
and to show me these Android first thing
I need to do is make sure that the
display isn't going to turn off after 30
seconds because that's quite annoying if
I'm going to get this into position prop
it up a little bit of blue TAC or white
TAC right so I'm happy with how this
looks at the moment and like before I've
got this
shadow coming from behind the phone so
I'm gonna take a shot and see what we're
looking like okay so some things I
hadn't considered there my shutter speed
is so high that there's no ambient light
really coming into the scene which is a
problem for the screen because of course
that is entirely an ambient light source
so by using such a high shutter speed
the screen may as well be off you can
only just about tell that there's some
information on there
so my only option now kill the ambient
lights in the room lower my chef speed
even more which means we have to fall
into darkness that's me focus that's in
focus okay we'll try this again okay so
that's much better by using a much
slower shutter speed it's allowing the
light from the actual display to appear
in the shot so now when we have a look
at the shot we've got we can see that
the phone is nicely lit the backgrounds
nicely lit and you can actually see
what's on the screen which is what we
were going for so that's great so I
think I'm pretty much done here I think
I've got all the shots that I wanted
it's definitely a really really cool
phone I love this texture and even if
looking at the photos on the back of the
camera I think they've come out really
really nicely it's been all about
diffusing that one light to get a really
dramatic sense to the scene and just
fine-tuning the exact positioning and
power of that light so I'm really happy
with what I've got in camera really
excited to take these over to Lightroom
and Photoshop and see what I can get
with them now okay so now we're over in
Lightroom and you can see I've already
imported my images and I'm really
pleased with how these are coming out we
have a look at this I really love the
detail that you get here around the 1
plus logo and on this carbon wave
pattern going on it looks really really
cool again here
ona's great I love how the background
has been put together
I love the shadow coming here it's all
very dramatic very moody and I really
think it suits the tone of this phone
really really well now the shot but I
want to do the main edits on is this one
here it's a nice straight up shot of the
phone I think the background looks cool
I really like the way that the light
Falls around here and it hits this
background over in this area but it's
still quite dark over here so this is a
really really great amount of different
tones going on there which I think looks
really really cool so I'm gonna head
firstly over into the develop module
within Lightroom and I'm just going to
start playing around first thing I've
noticed that the light is a bit too
bright up on this top left corner of the
phone so I'm gonna bring that down just
a touch I don't want to bring it down a
lot I still want some of that remaining
in there and what I don't want to do is
bring down the light everywhere else in
the scene if you can see if I bring this
highlights right down then we lose some
of that light on the background you can
see what happened on the background if I
just bring that up and down there so I
don't want to take that out completely I
just want to take the edge off ever so
slightly so I think there works quite
well so this point I would tend to play
around with these sliders a little bit
and see what looks good again with the
shadows if you bring it down it gets it
more dramatic but then the background
fades to black a little bit and that's
not what I want with this shot I want
plenty of background detail to be there
to really create the atmosphere in this
shot but it is still going to be very
high contrast and it's very very
monochrome there's there's no color in
the phone and there is like a slight
orange yellow hue just the moment that's
just from my white balance settings but
I'm going to change that as well so if
we take the temperature of a mic balance
down a touch then you'll see things
start getting a bit more blue which is
much more accurate to both the phone and
the background which I like a lot and we
could try and tune of a saturation down
to but then it goes - it looks - black
and white it looks like I've just
applied a black and white filter
whereas I do want some of the color
tones to remain to give it that realism
I think about there looks great now it's
going to use the crop tool and I'm just
going to give it a bit of a straightener
so cropping in I want it nice and
centered in the frame I think about here
looks good
nicely in the middle I'm just making
sure when you when you look at this view
that all the lines are nice and straight
against the top and side edges of the
phone so it's going to apply that and
there we are already getting to a good
point and that's largely because I spent
the time in the studio crafting the shop
making sure that the light is falling
exactly where I wanted it to I wasn't
just firing light anywhere and hoping to
fix it in post I really wanted to make
sure that the shot looks exactly as I
wanted it to when I took the photo so my
actual work I'm gonna have to do here in
Lightroom is going to be pretty minimal
I bring the clarity it can really help
boost a shot like this this this sort of
texture but on the phone can really be
boosted but if you look if you go too
high then the background starts to have
these artifacts and stuff which I really
don't like so instead rather than
bringing it up in the whole scene I'm
gonna use and bring that back down just
to about pretty much zero I'm going to
use an adjustment brushes this tool up
here in the right by bringing that up I
can then increase the clarity and just
paint on the areas where I want that
clarity to be so I'm using at the moment
a wide brush with quite a lot a large
feather around it I want to bring that
down a little bit I'm gonna turn the
auto mask on which will should hopefully
help it not when I paint it won't go
anywhere else other than the phone I can
sort I can paint on over this area where
I want this clarity to be and it won't
go over the edges on to the background
at least that's the hope
I don't wanted to go too much around the
camera unit as it will start to look a
little fake and even now I think this
effect is slightly overdone so I always
going to bring that clarity down to
maybe just about there
13 mark only a small amount but if you
turn that on and off you can see but it
does just help that effect to pop out
just a little bit okay I'm not gonna use
another adjustment brush and this time
I'm going to set everything to 0 and I'm
going to bring those highlights down
just a little bit and I'm gonna paint
just over this top corner because that
car and I still was a little bit too
bright for me I want to bring those
tones to be a bit more even with the
rest of the phone but without affecting
the rest of the scene by painting that
on as you can see it brings it down
makes it blend much more naturally with
the rest of the phone so already you can
see if we look at the back and forth
view a small few edits but it makes a
big difference and it makes this phone
look really dramatic but we're not done
yet there are still a few more things as
I want to try the backgrounds I was
using they're a little bit scuffed in
places or a few little bits that I
wanted to take out so what I'm gonna do
now is I'm gonna click right-click
editing and I'm going to take this over
to photoshop so I can just clean things
up a little bit okay so wherever in
Photoshop now the first I'm gonna do is
drag this background layer into a new
layer that means that any changes I make
to this picture at all I can always just
turn them off and go back to the
original shots now hopefully won't need
to do that but there we go just to be
safe so the first I'm going to do is I'm
going to use this tool up here it's
called a Spot Healing Brush tool I'm
gonna make it bigger to about that size
50 pixels and I'm literally just going
to paint over this blemish here and as
you can see Photoshop does the rest it
figures out that it shouldn't be there
and it figures out what should be there
instead and allows me just to literally
tap
these smaller as well tap over these
little bits of dust little scuff marks
anything else in the scene which
basically shouldn't be there I can go
around and basically just click on it
makes everything very easy to do you can
spend more time doing this yourself if
you want it to be super clean which I do
so I'm gonna go around and get rid of
the rest of these okay that's pretty
much it on the background so if you have
a look at the phone there are a few
areas that looks like it could be
cleaned up a bit so if you look here for
example there's this mark and there are
a few other bits like normally I'd take
this sort of thing out and the bits all
over the place but with this particular
product this carbon effect they tell me
is unique to each phone so these aren't
scuffs this is actually somehow this
carbon is made it's it's layered up and
then cut into you basically to create
the shape of the phone so these are all
and natural at the marks that you would
want to have on the phone so I really
don't want to remove anything which
actually is there to give the phone
character only thing that's not is a
little bit closer up to the top if we
zoom in you see a couple of little bits
of dust and grit around the camera unit
which I want to get rid of because I
want it to look nice and neat and these
little bits of grit always stand out as
white marks against the black surround
of the camera so it's important to take
those out to give a good look okay the
last thing I want to do here is and it
may be difficult to see but there is a
little bit of what I think is my
fingerprint on this camera unit here you
can just see these very faint lines and
they shouldn't be there everything
should be fading very much to black as
is the rest of it but that's very easy
to fix just by using the brush tool
selecting a larger brush this size is
fine and then simply taking a color
picker of the actual background there
because you see it's not completely
black I don't want to paint in black
completely black it because it may show
up against the actual tone which as you
can see has a little bit of blue in it
just a touch so I'm going to select that
and then I can literally just paint over
that area very carefully not wanting to
go too far into the camera or onto the
sides but that gets rid of that really
nicely if you look before and after you
can see their fingerprint and then it's
gone but because it is black it's not
affecting anything else and again we can
do the same with this little smear down
here as I said most of the time was
spent in the studio getting a shot to
begin with and now with even just 20
minutes of work less than I think we've
got a shot which looks pretty neat so
I'm going to go ahead and save that and
that's will take me back to Lightroom
and ping there it goes and if we just
have a look before and after at the
editing that we've done we can see that
it has made a big difference I really
like the color tone I like the contrast
on the phone really brings out this
texture but doesn't overdo it the phone
really looks natural it stands out for
exactly what it is and I really think
this shot is a good example of the sort
of moody look that I want to achieve we
can't have a look through some of the
other shots I did have a quick edit on
this one I went in a little bit of a
different direction for this one in that
I really wanted to emphasize the
darkness so I have intentionally
darkened this background a little bit
more in order to make the phone stand
out against it which I think looks
pretty cool is that actually the one I
edited yes I think that it's a lot of
edited and again I've brought highlights
up a touch and to help the phone stand
out because it with this one if I had
them too far down and you can see the
phone really sort of fades to nothing
it's not a good look that we want to get
so by bringing those up just a bit you
get a much nicer tone almost looks like
it's been lit with this almost stage
light spotlight which of course it has
because it was just a single light which
is why we just get this nice light here
in the background and of course at this
strong shadow I think that looks pretty
cool again I actually haven't in fixed
my white balance there I'm going to
bring that back down to get the nice
cooler tone that we wanted and then
we've got and the other shots now going
back to the library view
so a couple the other ones I really
liked I went in and did a close-up shot
on the adoro branding on the side this
again I think is pretty cool I've done
some contrast work on here a little bit
of clarity which again just helps boost
that texture you can see hoping the
sliders here just +23 McLaren see I
brought the shadows up here because I
think that actually brings the
background out a little more and stops
it looking like it's been shot against a
black empty space I think that gives a
really really nice look and it's it's
pin sharp on here on the head Oro logo
which is great so I'm really happy with
what I've managed to get and I think
just by using such a simple setup these
three pieces of black card and the one
light crit was really dramatic moody
shot which perfectly suits this stark
stylized phone like this wouldn't work
for every product but definitely a
winner for this really pleased with what
I've been able to get its please let us
