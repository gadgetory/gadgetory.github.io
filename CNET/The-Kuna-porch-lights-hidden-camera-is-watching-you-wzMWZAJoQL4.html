is just that nothing more than a light
fixture but when you look closer it's
actually the 199 dollar Kuna a light
fixture with a built in 720p camera the
benefit to a setup like this of course
is discretion you don't have a big giant
camera that is really obvious to a lot
of people especially intruders so they
don't know that there's something
watching them at all times
it's high-definition camera has live
streaming so you can check in on the
Kuna app on your Android or iPhone and
see what's happening you can also get
motion alerts and trigger the light to
go on at dusk and off at dawn even so
this device has some significant
drawbacks for instance it doesn't work
with any third-party devices so if tor
smartthings and wink just isn't possible
you also have to pay at least five bucks
a month for cloud storage that's if you
want to save cloud storage clips and
review them later so the really cool
thing about this app is that it has dual
control you can actually look at the
live stream here and see what the camera
sees anytime you want to see it which is
really neat you can also sound an alarm
which basically is designed to scare
anybody away who might be breaking in or
doing something nefarious and you can
talk to them through a two-way talk
feature so basically you hold down a
button on the app to talk and then
release it to listen to them and its
really crisp and clear works really well
hey Tyler how's it going hey make it can
you hear me I can can you hear me yeah I
can hear you loud and clear but you also
have the light control so you can turn
the light on and off on demand straight
from the app but you can also set
schedules you can also go into the
recording section actually see all of
the different clips of motion activity
that's happened throughout the day I
have a free trial for now you actually
have to pay at least five bucks a month
to get that that's a potential
deal-breaker for some people drawbacks
aside I still really like kuna 199 bucks
isn't bad for a device that looks nice
and protects the exterior of your home
but just keep in mind that you might not
want to pay for the cloud storage fees
and that could be a deal-breaker for
some</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
