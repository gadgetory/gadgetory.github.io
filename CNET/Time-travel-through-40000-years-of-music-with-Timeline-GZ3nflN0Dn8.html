one live concert is not easy this is
timeline a collaboration between the
presets and the Australian Chamber
Orchestra we go behind the scenes and
take a look at some of the audio tech
making it happen we've got music from
you know the Big Bang right through to
the present day and try to translate all
of that different style into the concert
hall is quite a challenging job and just
in terms of the style the way that audio
is presented through from changing the
music you know big churches and an end
ends up in mobile phone music later
music in today's that presented down the
mobile phone it's the delivery format
also it seems so to translate that to
the concert halls just dynamics Alone's
complicated the show uses a bunch of
different speakers to recreate sounds
from past and present we put in quite a
large PA in the room we have a little
little gramophone horn down the front
which is cute introduction for a bit of
jazz in 1920s here we've got a very
modern console which makes it possible
every every item almost every item every
piece has a completely different balance
requirement so the process has been I
listened to the rehearsal set at an
appropriate balance and store it in the
computer
and then so during the show I recall
those settings for each item and then I
sit on the Masters and just I basically
got the high strings low strings
woodwinds choir and so during that
actual show I just recall the scene and
balance those components the biggest
technical challenges just the sheer
difference and variety in the program so
every item has got different soloists
different focuses and you know vastly
different balances go from jazz
classical punk to you know robbery and
chant and it's all got a sound it's got
to be true to itself and requires
entirely different mix setup it's not
just classical music though there's
plenty of contemporary stuff from
artists like Beyonce James Blake and
Daft Punk presets have put together to
get the mega mix which is this piece
this little slab at the very end where
we just basically lose your costura all
together and it goes to this modern of
up to present time and yeah it's just
I've done an amazing job of mashing all
the stuff together very quickly we're
very seamlessly it's like a new piece of
music and itself and that's actually the
easiest part of the show for me because
I just sit back which the faders up and
sit back and enjoy that
